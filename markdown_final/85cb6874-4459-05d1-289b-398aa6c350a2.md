## Question

explain me how does the use of prone positioning is better for ventilation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how prone positioning improves ventilation and why it is better for patients with ARDS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline pathophysiology of ARDS in the supine position. Then, I should verify the key physiological mechanisms that change with proning. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence for improved oxygenation, lung protection, and mortality. After that, I need to consider special populations like awake, non-intubated patients and those on ECMO. Finally, I should review practical implementation, dosing, safety, and guideline recommendations to synthesize a clear conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the baseline problem in supine ARDS. In supine position, dependent dorsal lung regions are compressed by the heart and abdominal contents, causing atelectasis, shunt, and ventilation–perfusion mismatch, while nondependent ventral regions are overdistended and at higher risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, which together worsen hypoxemia and increase the propensity for VILI [^12154cac] [^7b6962ae].

> Now, I will examine the core mechanisms that change with prone positioning. Wait, let me verify the directionality of pleural pressure gradients and recruitment. Prone positioning reverses the vertical pleural pressure gradient, making dorsal pleural pressures more negative and promoting recruitment of dorsal alveoli, while simultaneously reducing ventral overdistension, leading to more homogeneous ventilation and stress distribution across the lung [^7b6962ae] [^08afbdbe]. I should also confirm perfusion effects; perfusion remains relatively gravity-independent and preferentially distributed to dorsal regions in both positions, so proning improves ventilation–perfusion matching by increasing ventilation to well-perfused dorsal lung [^741b3716] [^a9997b64]. Hold on, I should verify the lung protection angle; by distributing tidal volume more evenly, prone positioning reduces regional strain and cyclic atelectasis, thereby mitigating VILI even when oxygenation does not dramatically improve [^327b52bd] [^abaa106c].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence for oxygenation. Let me consider the magnitude and timing. Across RCTs and meta-analyses, prone positioning improves oxygenation in roughly 70–80% of patients with ARDS, with median improvements in PaO2/FiO2 on the order of 20–60 mmHg within hours, and the effect is more pronounced with longer sessions and in severe hypoxemia [^08afbdbe] [^51278685] [^b976dad8]. But wait, what if the patient is awake and non-intubated? Even in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19, awake prone positioning improves oxygenation and reduces respiratory rate, though adherence and duration vary and benefits may wane on return to supine [^633d2c64] [^a4f8b5c2].

> I will now examine lung protection and mortality. The pivotal signal is mortality reduction in severe ARDS. The PROSEVA RCT showed a 28-day mortality of 16% with prone versus 32.8% supine, with a hazard ratio around 0.39, and this benefit persisted at 90 days, establishing prone as standard of care in severe ARDS when applied early and for prolonged sessions [^1b0bd7a7] [^1f6cae63]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; earlier trials were neutral, likely due to shorter proning durations, less severe populations, or non–lung-protective ventilation, and meta-analyses confirm benefit primarily when prone is sustained for more than 12 hours per day and in moderate-to-severe ARDS, with pooled mortality reductions around 20–30% in these subgroups [^2c02a780] [^11403d3c] [^33d0aaec].

> Let me consider awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19. I should double-check the strength of evidence. High-quality meta-analyses of randomized trials show that awake prone positioning reduces the risk of endotracheal intubation, with a modest effect size and low serious adverse event rates, though mortality effects remain uncertain and adherence to longer daily durations is often limited in practice [^a4f8b5c2] [^010ba158]. Hmm, wait a minute, some pragmatic RCTs in ward settings did not show clear composite outcome benefits, likely reflecting low daily prone time and patient selection, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralizing beyond ICU-level hypoxemia and higher-support settings [^2eafe508] [^d528e3ca].

> I should also review ECMO data. The PRONECMO RCT did not show faster ECMO weaning with prone positioning during venovenous ECMO, suggesting that routine proning on ECMO is not supported by high-certainty outcome data, even though physiologic improvements may still occur in selected patients. Hold on, I should verify that this does not negate the strong indication for prone in non-ECMO severe ARDS; it simply means ECMO-specific outcome benefits remain unproven [^59c27f90].

> Next, I should review practical implementation and dosing. Let me first confirm duration targets. Contemporary guidelines recommend initiating prone early after stabilization, targeting at least 12–16 consecutive hours per session, and continuing daily sessions until clinical improvement is sustained, with many centers using 16-hour sessions based on PROSEVA and subsequent analyses [^81b35bea] [^511d7dcd]. I need to ensure safety is addressed; prone positioning increases risks such as pressure injuries, tube displacement, and facial edema, which can be mitigated by trained teams, standardized protocols, and vigilant monitoring, and these risks are generally acceptable given mortality benefits in severe ARDS [^3b14e917] [^090d79ba].

> I should confirm contraindications and special considerations. Unstable spinal fractures, open abdominal wounds, and severe hemodynamic instability are commonly cited contraindications, and proning should be individualized in patients with elevated intracranial pressure or recent sternotomy, balancing risks and benefits with multidisciplinary input [^e6788b7c] [^327b52bd]. Let me reconsider the role of PEEP; while high PEEP and prone share overlapping physiologic goals, trials have not definitively answered whether combining both adds incremental benefit, so PEEP should still be titrated to lung mechanics and gas exchange rather than assumed synergism with prone [^388edd17] [^248db878].

> Finally, I will synthesize why prone is "better". Prone positioning is better for ventilation in ARDS because it simultaneously improves oxygenation via recruitment and V/Q matching and confers lung-protective effects by homogenizing stress and strain, reducing VILI, and translating into a robust mortality reduction in severe ARDS when applied early and for prolonged sessions, with supportive but less definitive benefits in awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19 hypoxemia [^1b0bd7a7] [^2c02a780] [^a4f8b5c2]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overstating universal benefit; benefits are clearest in moderate-to-severe ARDS and are less certain in mild hypoxemia or when awake proning is brief or poorly tolerated, so patient selection and adherence strategies are critical to realizing benefit [^81b35bea] [^1a0a6f89].

Prone positioning improves ventilation by **redistributing ventilation and perfusion** to better-matched lung regions, reducing shunt and improving oxygenation [^741b3716] [^a9997b64]. It also **homogenizes pleural pressure**, recruits dorsal lung, and reduces ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) by lowering regional stress and strain [^327b52bd] [^abaa106c]. These effects are most pronounced in moderate-to-severe ARDS, where prone positioning reduces mortality when applied early and for prolonged sessions (≥ 12–16 h/day) [^1b0bd7a7] [^81b35bea]. In awake, non-intubated patients with COVID-19, prone positioning improves oxygenation and may reduce intubation, though adherence and optimal duration remain uncertain [^a4f8b5c2] [^269117e6].

## Physiological mechanisms of improved ventilation in prone position

### Redistribution of ventilation and perfusion

In ARDS, supine positioning causes **ventilation–perfusion mismatch**: ventral lung is overventilated but underperfused, while dorsal lung is underventilated but overperfused, causing shunt and hypoxemia [^7b6962ae]. Prone positioning **reverses this mismatch** by redistributing ventilation dorsally and perfusion ventrally, improving V/Q matching and oxygenation [^741b3716] [^a9997b64].

---

### Homogenization of pleural pressure

Supine positioning creates a **vertical pleural pressure gradient**, with higher pressure in dependent dorsal regions, promoting atelectasis and regional overdistension. Prone positioning **flattens this gradient**, promoting more uniform alveolar inflation and reducing regional stress and strain [^7b6962ae] [^327b52bd].

---

### Recruitment of dorsal lung regions

Prone positioning **reduces superimposed pressure** from the heart and abdomen on dorsal lung, facilitating recruitment of collapsed alveoli and increasing functional residual capacity [^7b6962ae] [^08afbdbe]. This recruitment improves compliance and reduces shunt, further enhancing oxygenation [^327b52bd].

---

### Reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)

By homogenizing ventilation and reducing regional overdistension and cyclic atelectasis, prone positioning **lowers VILI risk**, a key driver of ARDS mortality [^327b52bd] [^abaa106c].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting prone positioning

### Mortality benefit in moderate-to-severe ARDS

The **PROSEVA trial** showed that early, prolonged prone positioning (≥ 16 h/day) reduced 28-day mortality from 32.8% to 16.0% in severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg) [^1b0bd7a7]. Meta-analyses confirm a **mortality reduction** with prone positioning in moderate-to-severe ARDS, especially with sessions > 12 h/day [^2c02a780] [^11403d3c].

---

### Benefits in awake, non-intubated patients

In COVID-19 hypoxemia, awake prone positioning improves oxygenation and may reduce intubation, though **adherence and optimal duration vary** and mortality benefit remains uncertain [^a4f8b5c2] [^269117e6]. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found a **reduced intubation risk** with awake prone positioning, with the effect size varying by adherence and severity [^a4f8b5c2].

---

## Limitations and risks of prone positioning

- **Pressure injuries**: Frequent and related to duration and number of pronations [^1b9f4169] [^090d79ba].
- **Airway complications**: Higher risk of tube displacement, obstruction, and accidental extubation [^3b14e917] [^090d79ba].
- **Hemodynamic effects**: Transient hypotension and reduced venous return can occur [^090d79ba].
- **Staffing and resources**: Requires trained teams and continuous monitoring [^3b14e917] [^12154cac].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ATS/ESICM/SCCM 2017 | Strong recommendation for prone positioning > 12 h/day in severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg) [^1ad5dd98] [^ee03a77e] |
| ESICM 2023 | Initiate prone early after stabilization, maintain ≥ 16 h/day in moderate-to-severe ARDS [^81b35bea] [^18518d04] |
| Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 | Recommend prone > 12 h/day in sepsis-induced moderate-to-severe ARDS [^511d7dcd] [^f245e39c] |
| WHO 2023 | Consider awake prone positioning in severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen or noninvasive ventilation [^3112f48a] |

---

Prone positioning improves ventilation by **improving V/Q matching**, recruiting dorsal lung, and reducing VILI; these effects translate into mortality benefit in moderate-to-severe ARDS when applied early and for prolonged sessions, and may reduce intubation in awake COVID-19 patients, albeit with adherence and safety considerations [^1b0bd7a7] [^a4f8b5c2].

### Treatment of ARDS with prone positioning [^de971ed5]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Prone positioning was first proposed in the 1970s as a method to improve gas exchange in ARDS. Subsequent observations of dramatic improvement in oxygenation with simple patient rotation motivated the next several decades of research. This work elucidated the physiological mechanisms underlying changes in gas exchange and respiratory mechanics with prone ventilation. However, translating physiological improvements into a clinical benefit has proved challenging; several contemporary trials showed no major clinical benefits with prone positioning. By optimizing patient selection and treatment protocols, the recent Proning Severe ARDS Patients (PROSEVA) trial demonstrated a significant mortality benefit with prone ventilation. This trial, and subsequent meta-analyses, support the role of prone positioning as an effective therapy to reduce mortality in severe ARDS, particularly when applied early with other lung-protective strategies. This review discusses the physiological principles, clinical evidence, and practical application of prone ventilation in ARDS.

### Should prone positioning be routinely used for lung protection during mechanical ventilation? [^35ba1c66]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Prone positioning has been known for decades to improve oxygenation in animals with acute lung injury and in most patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mechanisms of this improvement include a more uniform pleural-pressure gradient, a smaller volume of lung compressed by the heart, and more uniform and better-matched ventilation and perfusion. Prone positioning has an established niche as an intervention to improve gas exchange in patients with severe hypoxemia refractory to standard ventilatory manipulations. Because the lung may be more uniformly recruited and the stress of mechanical ventilation better distributed, prone positioning has also been proposed as a form of lung-protective ventilation. However, several randomized trials have failed to show improvements in clinical outcomes of ARDS patients, other than consistently better oxygenation. Because each of these trials had design problems or early termination, prone positioning remains a rescue therapy for patients with acute lung injury or ARDS.

### Mechanisms of the effects of prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^b7affbd7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prone positioning has been used for many years in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The initial reason for prone positioning in ARDS patients was improvement in oxygenation. It was later shown that mechanical ventilation in the prone position can be less injurious to the lung and hence the primary reason to use prone positioning is prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

Material and Methods

A large body of physiologic benefits of prone positioning in ARDS patients accumulated but these failed to translate into clinical benefits. More recently, meta-analyses and randomized controlled trial in a specific subgroup of ARDS patients demonstrated that prone positioning can improve survival. This review covers the effects of prone positioning on oxygenation, respiratory mechanics, and VILI.

Conclusions

We conclude with the effects of prone positioning on patient outcome, in particular on survival.

### Prone positioning for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS: a review [^9528d203]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Prone positioning is an immediately accessible, readily implementable intervention that was proposed initially as a method for improvement in gas exchange > 50 years ago. Initially implemented clinically as an empiric therapy for refractory hypoxemia, multiple clinical trials were performed on the use of prone positioning in various respiratory conditions, cumulating in the landmark Proning Severe ARDS Patients trial, which demonstrated mortality benefit in patients with severe ARDS. After this trial and the corresponding meta-analysis, expert consensus and societal guidelines recommended the use of prone positioning for the management of severe ARDS. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought prone positioning to the forefront of medicine, including widespread implementation of prone positioning in awake, spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Multiple clinical trials now have been performed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of prone positioning in these patients and have enhanced our understanding of the effects of the prone position in respiratory failure. In this review, we discuss the physiologic features, clinical outcome data, practical considerations, and lingering questions of prone positioning.

Context

Post hoc analysis of a previous trial has suggested that prone positioning may improve survival in patients with severe hypoxemia and with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Objective

To assess possible outcome benefits of prone positioning in patients with moderate and severe hypoxemia who are affected by ARDS.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Prone-Supine II Study, a multicenter, unblinded, randomized controlled trial conducted in 23 centers in Italy and 2 in Spain. Patients were 342 adults with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation, enrolled from February 2004 through June 2008 and prospectively stratified into subgroups with moderate (n = 192) and severe (n = 150) hypoxemia.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to undergo supine (n = 174) or prone (20 hours per day; n = 168) positioning during ventilation.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 6-month mortality and mortality at intensive care unit discharge, organ dysfunctions, and the complication rate related to prone positioning.

Results

Prone and supine patients from the entire study population had similar 28-day (31.0% vs 32.8%; relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–1.13; P = 0.72) and 6-month (47.0% vs 52.3%; RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73–1.11; P = 0.33) mortality rates, despite significantly higher complication rates in the prone group. Outcomes were also similar for patients with moderate hypoxemia in the prone and supine groups at 28 days (25.5% vs 22.5%; RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.89–1.22; P = 0.62) and at 6 months (42.6% vs 43.9%; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.76–1.25; P = 0.85). The 28-day mortality of patients with severe hypoxemia was 37.8% in the prone and 46.1% in the supine group (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66–1.14; P = 0.31), while their 6-month mortality was 52.7% and 63.2%, respectively (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53–1.14; P = 0.19).

Conclusion

Data from this study indicate that prone positioning does not provide significant survival benefit in patients with ARDS or in subgroups of patients with moderate and severe hypoxemia.

### Effect of prone versus supine position in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^423fff62]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To review the effects of prone position and supine position on oxygenation parameters in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomized trials.

Patients

Databases of EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL were systematically searched from its inception until March 2021.

Interventions

COVID-19 patients being positioned in the prone position either whilst awake or mechanically ventilated.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were oxygenation parameters (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio, PaCO₂, SpO₂). Secondary outcomes included the rate of intubation and mortality rate.

Results

Thirty-five studies (n = 1712 patients) were included in this review. In comparison to the supine group, prone position significantly improved the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio (study = 13, patients = 1002, Mean difference, MD 52.15, 95% CI 37.08 to 67.22; p < 0.00001) and SpO₂ (study = 11, patients = 998, MD 4.17, 95% CI 2.53 to 5.81; p ≤ 0.00001). Patients received prone position were associated with lower incidence of mortality (study = 5, patients = 688, Odd ratio, OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.80; p = 0.007). No significant difference was noted in the incidence of intubation rate (study = 5, patients = 626, OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.86; p = 0.42) between the supine and prone groups.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis demonstrated that prone position improved PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio with better SpO₂ than supine position in COVID-19 patients. Given the limited number of studies with small sample size and substantial heterogeneity of measured outcomes, further studies are warranted to standardize the regime of prone position to improve the certainty of evidence.

### Assessment of awake prone positioning in hospitalized adults with COVID-19: a nonrandomized controlled trial [^2d38b14c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled COVID-19 a global pandemic. Patients with COVID-19 develop acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and 71% to 88% of critically ill patients receive invasive mechanical ventilation. Numerous pharmacological therapies have been studied to determine best treatment for these patients.,

Awake prone positioning among patients not receiving mechanical ventilation represents 1 nonpharmacological therapy included in the consensus guidelines for patients with COVID-19. Prone positioning has been used in the care of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving mechanical ventilation since the 1970s. Changing position from supine to prone may enhance oxygenation by improving ventilation-perfusion matching through recruitment of previously atelectatic dependent alveoli, reducing lung overinflationand increasing postural clearance of secretions. Among patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, early prone positioning may confer a mortality benefit. Among patients not receiving mechanical ventilation, prone positioning improves hypoxemia, but improvement is not sustained on return to supine positioning. This observation has been replicated in patients with COVID-19.

Many retrospective cohort studies have explored the use of awake prone positioning among patients with COVID-19 who were not receiving mechanical ventilation. Current guidelines recommend awake prone positioning for patients with COVID-19 as a safe and beneficial practice despite a lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials. Reviews and meta-analyses have reported an association between awake prone positioning and improved clinical outcomes, but rigorous prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to guide clinical management. We designed a pragmatic (designed to evaluate the benefits of an intervention in real-life routine practice conditions) nonrandomized controlled trial to assess practitioner-recommended prone positioning and clinical outcomes among patients with COVID-19–related hypoxemia who had not received mechanical ventilation.

### The effect of prone positioning on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0db6f86f]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prone positioning (PP) has been reported to improve the survival of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, it is uncertain whether the beneficial effects of PP are associated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and long durations of PP. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate whether the effects of PP on mortality could be affected by PEEP level and PP duration and to identify which patients might benefit the most from PP.

Methods

Publications describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which investigators have compared prone and supine ventilation were retrieved by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science and Elsevier Science (inception to May 2013). Two investigators independently selected RCTs and assessed their quality. The data extracted from the RCTs were combined in a cumulative meta-analysis and analyzed using methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.

Results

A total of nine RCTs with an aggregate of 2,242 patients were included. All of the studies received scores of up to three points using the methods recommended by Jadad et al. One trial did not conceal allocation. This meta-analysis revealed that, compared with supine positioning, PP decreased the 28- to 30-day mortality of ARDS patients with a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤ 100 mmHg (n = 508, risk ratio (RR) = 0.71, 95 confidence interval (CI) = 0.57 to 0.89; P = 0.003). PP was shown to reduce both 60-day mortality (n = 518, RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.68 to 0.99; P = 0.04) and 90-day mortality (n = 516, RR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43 to 0.75; P < 0.0001) in ARDS patients ventilated with PEEP ≥ 10 cmH2O. Moreover, PP reduced 28- to 30-day mortality when the PP duration was > 12 h/day (n = 1,067, RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.54 to 0.99; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

PP reduced mortality among patients with severe ARDS and patients receiving relatively high PEEP levels. Moreover, long-term PP improved the survival of ARDS patients.

### Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1b0bd7a7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Previous trials involving patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have failed to show a beneficial effect of prone positioning during mechanical ventilatory support on outcomes. We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS.

Methods

In this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 mL per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion.

Results

A total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P < 0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group.

Conclusions

In patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

### Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS: the PRONECMO randomized clinical trial [^59c27f90]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prone positioning may improve outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it is unknown whether prone positioning improves clinical outcomes among patients with ARDS who are undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) compared with supine positioning.

Objective

To test whether prone positioning vs supine positioning decreases the time to successful ECMO weaning in patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial of patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO for less than 48 hours at 14 intensive care units (ICUs) in France between March 3, 2021, and December 7, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to prone positioning (at least 4 sessions of 16 hours) (n = 86) or to supine positioning (n = 84).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 60 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO and mechanical ventilation-free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, skin pressure injury, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 90-day follow-up.

Results

Among 170 randomized patients (median age, 51 [IQR, 43–59] years; n = 60 women [35%]), median respiratory system compliance was 15.0 (IQR, 10.7–20.6) mL/cm H2O; 159 patients (94%) had COVID-19-related ARDS; and 164 (96%) were in prone position before ECMO initiation. Within 60 days of enrollment, 38 of 86 patients (44%) had successful ECMO weaning in the prone ECMO group compared with 37 of 84 (44%) in the supine ECMO group (risk difference, 0.1% [95% CI, -14.9% to 15.2%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.71–1.75]; P = 0.64). Within 90 days, no significant difference was observed in ECMO duration (28 vs 32 days; difference, -4.9 [95% CI, -11.2 to 1.5] days; P = 0.13), ICU length of stay, or 90-day mortality (51% vs 48%; risk difference, 2.4% [95% CI, -13.9% to 18.6%]; P = 0.62). No serious adverse events were reported during the prone position procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO, prone positioning compared with supine positioning did not significantly reduce time to successful weaning of ECMO.

### Should early prone positioning Be a standard of care in ARDS with refractory hypoxemia? [^f617ddc3]. Respiratory Care (2016). Low credibility.

For the past 4 decades, the prone position has been employed as an occasional rescue option for patients with severe hypoxemia unresponsive to conventional measures applied in the supine orientation. Proning offers a high likelihood of significantly improved arterial oxygenation to well selected patients, but until the results of a convincing randomized trial were published, its potential to reduce mortality risk remained in serious doubt. Proning does not benefit patients of all disease severities and stages but may be life-saving for others. Because it requires advanced nursing skills and escalation of monitoring surveillance to deploy safely, its place as an early stage standard of care depends on the definition of that label.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ad03b43a]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Current evidence does not support the use of prolonged prone positioning outside of clinical trials. To date, no adequately powered RCT has specifically addressed this question. Our systematic review identified three RCTs and six observational studies comparing prolonged with standard prone positioning. One RCT and four observational studies were of high or critical risk of bias, leaving limited high-quality data for pooled analysis. None of the analyses, including those with all eligible studies, those restricted to low-to-moderate risk of bias studies, and sensitivity analyses, revealed statistically significant effects of PPP on primary or secondary outcomes assessing effectiveness or adverse events (Table 3). The wide confidence intervals observed throughout our analysis reflect limited statistical power. Consequently, neither harm nor benefit can be definitely excluded, which underscores the uncertainty of these findings. Most studies enrolled patients with COVID‑19–related ARDS, limiting the generalizability of these findings to other ARDS etiologies. Notably, the total cumulative prone time varied considerably across and within studies, which may have contributed to heterogeneity in the results.

Prone positioning is a cornerstone therapy for patients with moderate to severe ARDS and one of the few interventions proven to improve survival in randomized trials. Early studies employing relatively short prone sessions reported no clinical benefit, whereas subsequent trials demonstrated that sessions of at least 16 h, in combination with lung-protective ventilation strategies, significantly reduce mortality. Nevertheless, the optimal duration of prone positioning remains uncertain. Prolongation of sessions may help sustain alveolar recruitment and mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury, potentially improving outcomes, but it may also increase the need for deeper sedation and the risk of complications such as pressure injuries, thereby offsetting potential benefits.

### PEEP titration during prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^388edd17]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Prone positioning has been used since the 1970s to improve oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory failure. Several important physiological changes occur with proning: recruitment of dependent lung regions, increased ventilation-perfusion matching, optimized chest wall mechanics, decreased pleural pressure gradient from non-dependent to dependent regions, and augmented drainage of tracheobronchial secretions.

Given these effects, proning would seem likely to benefit patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Indeed, the recent PROSEVA (Proning Severe ARDS Patients) multicenter randomized trial demonstrated significantly improved survival with proning for moderate-severe ARDS. This trial built on cumulative experience from the prior decade of indeterminate trials, which served to refine the target population, intervention strategy, and co-interventions. Key features of PROSEVA that collectively may explain the observed benefit compared with prior trials include enrollment of patients only with more severe ARDS (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2) of less than 150), protocolized low tidal volume ventilation, near-ubiquitous use of continuous neuromuscular blockade, intervening early in the ARDS course, and increased duration of prone positioning.

High positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been advocated as part of an "open lung" approach by citing a rationale similar to that of proning — improving lung homogeneity to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Although no large clinical trial to date has demonstrated definitively a mortality benefit with high PEEP, a meta-analysis of three such trials found significantly increased survival and ventilator-free days with high PEEP for moderate-severe ARDS. As a result, several recently completed and ongoing multicenter clinical trials of ARDS have incorporated a high-PEEP strategy, although this practice is not universal.

No major randomized trial of prone versus supine positioning has incorporated a high-PEEP strategy for either study arm. Thus, it is unclear to what extent patients managed with a high-PEEP strategy may gain benefit from prone positioning and vice versa. High PEEP with supine positioning may offer benefit comparable to that of low PEEP with prone positioning; additionally, the combination of high PEEP and proning may be synergistic. To explore this potential limitation of the existing literature further, we conducted a post-hoc analysis of data from recent clinical trials on prone positioning to examine in detail the PEEP titration strategies used and to determine whether PEEP would have been meaningfully different had a high-PEEP strategy been employed.

Positioning

Indications for prone position

Prone position ventilation consists of delivering mechanical ventilation to the patient turned face-down. This method frequently and sometimes markedly improves oxygenation in patients with ARDS. As a treatment, prone position ventilation results in significantly better oxygenation than mechanical ventilation applied in the supine position in ARDS patients. As such prone positioning is used as an important strategy in life-threatening hypoxemia to avoid serious adverse events or death due to severe hypoxemia. In an individual patient-data meta-analysis of four large RCTs, prone position was associated with a significantly better survival rate in ARDS patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 100 mmHg. However, in a recent trial that showed significantly better survival in the prone position group compared to the supine position in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, the benefit of proning was observed at any level of hypoxemia at the time of randomization and no correlation was found between the magnitude of oxygenation response of the first session and patient survival. Therefore, the beneficial effect of proning is likely explained by factors other than improvement in oxygenation. Among them the prevention of VALI is likely a major contributing factor to the benefit of proning. As such, it should be applied as first-line therapy to any patient with moderate or severe ARDS.

### Effect of prone position on ventilation-perfusion matching in patients with moderate to severe ARDS with different clinical phenotypes [^69ab7185]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

For moderate to severe ARDS patients, oxygenation, and ventilation-perfusion improve more rapidly after prone positioning in focal or low D-dimer ARDS patients, whereas it takes longer for oxygenation to improve after prone positioning in non-focal and high D-dimer ARDS patients. This recommendation needs validation through a controlled trial with a larger sample size.

### Prone position in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1b9f4169]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

In the last few years prone positioning has been used increasingly in the treatment of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and this manoeuvre is now considered a simple and safe method to improve oxygenation. However, the physiological mechanisms causing respiratory function improvement as well as the real clinical benefit are not yet fully understood. The aim of this review is to discuss the physiological and clinical effects of prone positioning in patients with ARDS. The main physiological aims of prone positioning are: 1) to improve oxygenation; 2) to improve respiratory mechanics; 3) to homogenise the pleural pressure gradient, the alveolar inflation and the ventilation distribution; 4) to increase lung volume and reduce the amount of atelectatic regions; 5) to facilitate the drainage of secretions; and 6) to reduce ventilator-associated lung injury. According to the available data, the authors conclude that: 1) oxygenation improves in approximately 70–80% of patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome; 2) the beneficial effects of oxygenation reduce after 1 week of mechanical ventilation; 3) the aetiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome may markedly affect the response to prone positioning; 4) extreme care is necessary when the manoeuvre is performed; 5) pressure sores are frequent and related to the number of pronations; 6) the supports used to prone and during positioning are different and nonstandardised among centres; and 7) intensive care unit and hospital stay and mortality still remain high despite prone positioning.

### Prone position in ARDS patients: why, when, how and for whom [^327b52bd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In ARDS patients, the change from supine to prone position generates a more even distribution of the gas-tissue ratios along the dependent-nondependent axis and a more homogeneous distribution of lung stress and strain. The change to prone position is generally accompanied by a marked improvement in arterial blood gases, which is mainly due to a better overall ventilation/perfusion matching. Improvement in oxygenation and reduction in mortality are the main reasons to implement prone position in patients with ARDS. The main reason explaining a decreased mortality is less overdistension in non-dependent lung regions and less cyclical opening and closing in dependent lung regions. The only absolute contraindication for implementing prone position is an unstable spinal fracture. The maneuver to change from supine to prone and vice versa requires a skilled team of 4–5 caregivers. The most frequent adverse events are pressure sores and facial edema. Recently, the use of prone position has been extended to non-intubated spontaneously breathing patients affected with COVID-19 ARDS. The effects of this intervention on outcomes are still uncertain.

### Prone positioning of nonintubated patients with coronavirus disease 2019 – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^633d2c64]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Several studies have reported prone positioning of nonintubated patients with coronavirus diseases 2019-related hypoxemic respiratory failure. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the impact of prone positioning on oxygenation and clinical outcomes.

Design and Setting

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the coronavirus diseases 2019 living systematic review from December 1, 2019, to November 9, 2020.

Subjects and Intervention

Studies reporting prone positioning in hypoxemic, nonintubated adult patients with coronavirus diseases 2019 were included.

Measurements and Main Results

Data on prone positioning location (ICU vs non-ICU), prone positioning dose (total minutes/d), frequency (sessions/d), respiratory supports during prone positioning, relative changes in oxygenation variables (peripheral oxygen saturation, Pao2, and ratio of Pao2 to the Fio2), respiratory rate pre and post prone positioning, intubation rate, and mortality were extracted. Twenty-five observational studies reporting prone positioning in 758 patients were included. There was substantial heterogeneity in prone positioning location, dose and frequency, and respiratory supports provided. Significant improvements were seen in ratio of Pao2 to the Fio2 (mean difference, 39; 95% CI, 25–54), Pao2 (mean difference, 20mm Hg; 95% CI, 14–25), and peripheral oxygen saturation (mean difference, 4.74%; 95% CI, 3–6%). Respiratory rate decreased post prone positioning (mean difference, -3.2 breaths/min; 95% CI, -4.6 to -1.9). Intubation and mortality rates were 24% (95% CI, 17–32%) and 13% (95% CI, 6–19%), respectively. There was no difference in intubation rate in those receiving prone positioning within and outside ICU (32% [69/214] vs 33% [107/320]; p = 0.84). No major adverse events were recorded in small subset of studies that reported them.

Conclusions

Despite the significant variability in frequency and duration of prone positioning and respiratory supports applied, prone positioning was associated with improvement in oxygenation variables without any reported serious adverse events. The results are limited by a lack of controls and adjustments for confounders. Whether this improvement in oxygenation results in meaningful patient-centered outcomes such as reduced intubation or mortality rates requires testing in well-designed randomized clinical trials.

### Clinical strategies for implementing lung and diaphragm-protective ventilation: avoiding insufficient and excessive effort [^abaa106c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Prone positioning

The prone position has been used for decades in early ARDS to improve oxygenation and over time an appreciation for the lung-protective benefit of prone positioning has emerged. As the amount of lung tissue is larger in dorsal lung regions, gravitational forces generate more dependent atelectasis in the supine position compared to prone position. Therefore, ventilation-perfusion matching is improved in the prone position and, more importantly, the energy applied to the lung by mechanical ventilation is distributed among more (non-atelectatic) alveoli, reducing lung stress. This is the putative basis for the observed mortality benefit of prone positioning in patients with ARDS. The mechanistic benefits of prone positioning may also apply under assisted ventilation with spontaneous breathing, because the lung recruitment accrued by prone positioning may attenuate 'solid-like' lung behaviour and reduce effort-dependent regional lung stress. Prone positioning improves oxygenation in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia; it is possible that prone positioning could also reduce the risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury. Thus, prone positioning might facilitate safe spontaneous breathing and diaphragm-protective ventilation as well as lung protection.

### Improved oxygenation after prone positioning may Be a predictor of survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^46ed8761]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation and reduces the mortality of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is limited evidence about which patients would gain most survival benefit from prone positioning. Herein, we investigated whether the improvement in oxygenation after prone positioning is associated with survival and aimed to identify patients who will gain most survival benefit from prone positioning in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Medical ICU at a tertiary academic hospital between 2014 and 2020.

Patients

Adult patients receiving prone positioning for moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The main outcomes were ICU and 28-day mortality. A total of 116 patients receiving prone positioning were included, of whom 45 (38.8%) were ICU survivors. Although there was no difference in PaO2:FIO2 ratio before the first prone session between ICU survivors and nonsurvivors, ICU survivors had a higher PaO2:FIO2 ratio after prone positioning than nonsurvivors, with significant between-group difference (p < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the percentage change in the PaO2:FIO2 ratio between the baseline and 8–12 hours after the first prone positioning to predict ICU mortality was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80–0.94), with an optimal cutoff value of 53.5% (sensitivity, 91.5%; specificity, 73.3%). Prone responders were defined as an increase in PaO2:FIO2 ratio of greater than or equal to 53.5%. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, prone responders (hazard ratio, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05–0.25), immunocompromised condition (hazard ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.15–4.03), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27) were significantly associated with 28-day mortality.

Conclusions

The PaO2:FIO2 ratio after the first prone positioning differed significantly between ICU survivors and nonsurvivors. The improvement in oxygenation after the first prone positioning was a significant predictor of survival in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Domain 7: Prone positioning

Question 7.1: In intubated patients with ARDS, does prone position compared to supine position reduce mortality?

Background

Prone position was proposed for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS in the 1970s. Physiological benefits include improvement of oxygenation, better homogenization of lung stress, and decreased right ventricular strain. Over the years, several trials were conducted comparing prone to supine position, with improved designs on the basis of the critical analysis of previous ones. Thus, progressively more hypoxemic patients were selected, the duration of prone ventilation cycles increased, and protective ventilation was combined with pronation. In 2013, the PROSEVA trial demonstrated a clear protective effect of prone ventilation in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. In 2017, the ESICM and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) provided recommendations for the use of prone ventilation in ARDS based on both aggregated and individual patient data meta-analysis that included the largest four trials. In the aggregated data meta-analysis, the overall result was non-significant; however, in studies that used duration of proning longer than twelve hours or included patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 200 mmHg, a statistically significant mortality reduction was found. The individual patient meta-analysis identified a survival benefit in patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 100 mmHg. However, this subgroup analysis did not allow any definitive conclusion since the benefits of randomization are not maintained in subgroups (and only one study stratified patients according to the degree of hypoxemia). In general, subgroup analyses in meta-analysis have an exploratory nature, and results should be interpreted cautiously. There were no RCTs identified specifically addressing proning of mechanically ventilated patients in COVID-19.

### Efficacy of awake prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 related hypoxemic respiratory failure: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^010ba158]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Patients with covid-19 can develop hypoxemic respiratory failure, potentially necessitating admission to hospital for supplemental oxygen or to an intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation. Although most patients have mild disease, some will develop severe disease, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Interventions aimed at limiting illness severity and reducing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation are needed.

Non-pharmacological interventions such as prone positioning are life saving for patients with moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving mechanical ventilation. Although high certainty evidence exists for the use of prone positioning in patients receiving invasive ventilation for non-covid-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is unclear whether awake prone positioning improves outcomes in spontaneously breathing non-intubated patients with covid-19. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies suggested that awake prone positioning was associated with improved oxygenation and low endotracheal intubation rates. Despite these outcomes, the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of awake prone positioning remains unclear in patients with covid-19 related hypoxemic respiratory failure. A prospective meta-analysis of six individual randomized controlled trials reported a reduction in the risk of treatment failure (ie, a composite outcome of intubation or death) and a reduction in the risk of endotracheal intubation. The results of this prospective meta-analysis must be interpreted cautiously as the effect was probably driven by one of the included randomized controlled trials. Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses had limitations, such as being driven by the results of the prospective meta-analysisor combining both observational and randomized studies. Moreover, a comprehensive systematic review on awake prone positioning in patients with covid-19 that also incorporates recent trials is needed.

Given the uncertainty about the clinical benefits of awake prone positioningand recent evidence from three trials with more than 900 additional patients, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We used both frequentist and bayesian methods to evaluate the efficacy and safety of awake prone positioning compared with usual care in trials of non-intubated adults with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to covid-19.

### Effectiveness and safety of prolonged prone positioning in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5ae64c61]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) is a well-established therapeutic strategy in the management of moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Its physiological rationale lies in promoting a more homogeneous distribution of lung stress and strain. By redistributing transpulmonary pressures, PP facilitates alveolar recruitment, reduces regional overdistension, and mitigates cyclic alveolar collapse - all of which contribute to minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Moreover, PP improves ventilation-perfusion matching, frequently resulting in enhanced gas exchange. Recent evidence suggests a potential dose response relationship, with clinical benefits such as improved oxygenation and reduced mortality being more pronounced when PP is initiated early and maintained for extended durations. Randomized trials and prior meta-analyses support the efficacy of daily prone sessions lasting at least 16 h in improving survival among patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Theoretical and physiological considerations further propose that extending proning sessions beyond 24 h may offer additional benefits, including sustained improvements in lung mechanics and gas exchange, fewer position-related interruptions, and more consistent prevention of VILI. However, prolonged prone positioning may also be associated with an increased risk of certain complications. These include a higher incidence of pressure injuries, such as skin and soft tissue damage, particularly at bony prominences, and a greater need for sedation, which may contribute to longer durations of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. There may also be an increased risk of accidental extubation or displacement of vascular lines during repositioning maneuvers.

Despite growing clinical interest, data on the efficacy and safety of prolonged prone positioning (PPP) remain limited. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of PPP on relevant clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS.

### Prone positioning of nonintubated patients with COVID-19 [^f205309b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although the value of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS is compelling, less is known about the effects of prone positioning in spontaneously breathing, nonintubated adult patients. Case reports and retrospective reviews have demonstrated safety and improvements in oxygenation with prone positioning in patients with ARDS. In nonintubated patients with COVID-19, prone positioning together with a combined strategy of HFNC and restrictive fluid or noninvasive ventilation improved oxygenation. The effects of prone positioning, without positive pressure ventilation, were not isolated.

In this case series, all patients experienced significant improvement in respiratory status during the initial prone-positioning period. Five of the 6 patients on nasal cannula or room air did not require escalation of respiratory care, and 8 of 10 patients did not require invasive mechanical ventilation. The potential mechanism of benefit of prone positioning in nonintubated patients is unlikely to be related solely to improved oxygenation, as past studies have not associated improved oxygenation with survival in ARDS. Homogenous lung aeration with prone positioning could result in reduced respiratory effort and lead to a lower incidence of intubation.

Although the data presented herein are intriguing, many questions remain. How long does the effect of proning last? Does the beneficial effect of proning continue after supination? Does proning prevent the need for intubation or merely delay it? Could prone positioning accelerate recovery?

There are several limitations in the data from this case series. First, as is common with case series, selection bias is possible. Second, there was no control intervention, and the study sample was small. Third, it is uncertain whether these patients would have improved without prone positioning, although the rapid change, within 1 hour, after proning is suggestive of a favorable impact. Fourth, measures of patient dyspnea or comfort after prone positioning were not collected. Fifth, to minimize the documentation burden on nursing-staff workflow, data on patient adherence to the prone-positioning recommendation beyond the first episode of proning were not collected.

Given the potential of prone positioning as a low-cost, easily implemented, and scalable intervention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, expeditious yet thorough testing of prone positioning in patients at risk for intubation is warranted (e.g. W. Al-Hazzani and colleagues, unpublished resultsidentifier NCT 04350723], among others).

### PEEP titration during prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^474dfd26]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

No major trial evaluating prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has incorporated a high-positive end-expiratory pressure (high-PEEP) strategy despite complementary physiological rationales. We evaluated generalizability of three recent proning trials to patients receiving a high-PEEP strategy. All trials employed a relatively low-PEEP strategy. After protocol ventilator settings were initiated and the patient was positioned per treatment assignment, post-intervention PEEP was not more than 5 cm H2O in 16.7% and not more than 10 cm H2O in 66.0% of patients. Post-intervention PEEP would have been nearly twice the set PEEP had a high-PEEP strategy been employed. Use of either proning or high-PEEP likely improves survival in moderate-severe ARDS; the role for both concomitantly remains unknown.

### Early physiologic effects of prone positioning in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome [^a9997b64]. Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The mechanisms underlying oxygenation improvement after prone positioning in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome have not been fully elucidated yet. The authors hypothesized that the oxygenation increase with prone positioning is secondary to the improvement of ventilation-perfusion matching.

Methods

In a series of consecutive intubated COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients receiving volume-controlled ventilation, the authors prospectively assessed the percent variation of ventilation-perfusion matching by electrical impedance tomography before and 90 min after the first cycle of prone positioning (primary endpoint). The authors also assessed changes in the distribution and homogeneity of lung ventilation and perfusion, lung overdistention and collapse, respiratory system compliance, driving pressure, optimal positive end-expiratory pressure, as assessed by electrical impedance tomography, and the ratio of partial pressure to fraction of inspired oxygen (Pao2/Fio2; secondary endpoints). Data are reported as medians [25th to 75th] or percentages.

Results

The authors enrolled 30 consecutive patients, all analyzed without missing data. Compared to the supine position, prone positioning overall improved ventilation-perfusion matching from 58% [43 to 69%] to 68% [56 to 75%] (P = 0.042), with a median difference of 8.0% (95% CI, 0.1 to 16.0%). Dorsal ventilation increased from 39% [31 to 43%] to 52% [44 to 62%] (P < 0.001), while dorsal perfusion did not significantly vary. Prone positioning also reduced lung overdistension from 9% [4 to 11%] to 4% [2 to 6%] (P = 0.025), while it did not significantly affect ventilation and perfusion homogeneity, lung collapse, static respiratory system compliance, driving pressure, and optimal positive end-expiratory pressure. Pao2/Fio2 overall improved from 141 [104 to 182] mmHg to 235 [164 to 267] mmHg (P = 0.019). However, 9 (30%) patients were nonresponders, experiencing an increase in Pao2/Fio2 less than 20% with respect to baseline.

Conclusions

In COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, prone positioning overall produced an early increase in ventilation-perfusion matching and dorsal ventilation. These effects were, however, heterogeneous among patients.

### Prone positioning in awake, nonintubated patients with COVID-19… [^25c78c09]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The median improvement in oxygen saturation was 7% after 1 hour of prone positioning. This study adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that prone positioning may improve oxygenation in patients with early acute respiratory distress syndrome prior to intubation. Prone positioning has several beneficial effects on pulmonary physiology in patients with ARDS. 2 In the supine position, pulmonary edema accumulates in basilar regions, and the heart and abdominal contents further compress these dependent lung regions. This leads to heterogenous ventilation, with increased volume delivered to apical and anterior lung units, which are also the regions that receive less of the pulmonary circulation. Together, these factors lead to perfusion of poorly ventilated lung units and hypoxemia.

Prone positioning of the patient leads to a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation, thus decreasing the shunt fraction and improving matching of ventilation and perfusion. Moreover, homogeneous ventilation may decrease lung injury by more evenly distributing mechanical force from the ventilator across the lung during inhalation.
2. Finally, Sartini et al7 tested prone positioning in 15 patients admitted to a single center in Milan, Italy, who were hypoxemic despite 10 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure and
0. 6 Fio2, and Spo2 increased in all 15 patients. The report by Thompson et al adds to this body of observational evidence by demonstrating that many patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure yet not on positive pressure ventilation had improved oxygenation in the prone position.

1. One potential concern with the use of the prone position in spontaneously breathing patients is that it could delay intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The optimal timing of intubation and mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS is not known, but delayed intubation has been associated with increased mortality in patients with ARDS. 9 Spontaneously breathing patients with ARDS generate relatively large tidal volumes; the result could be inadvertent self-inflicted lung injury. Controlled modes of mechanical ventilation minimize progression of lung injury owing to barotrauma. These benefits should be balanced with the risks of mechanical ventilation, including the need for prolonged sedation and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Ongoing clinical trials of prone positioning in non–mechanically ventilated patients should help clarify the role of this simple, low-cost approach for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### Prone position in acute respiratory distress syndrome. rationale, indications, and limits [^7b6962ae]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the prone position, computed tomography scan densities redistribute from dorsal to ventral as the dorsal region tends to reexpand while the ventral zone tends to collapse. Although gravitational influence is similar in both positions, dorsal recruitment usually prevails over ventral derecruitment, because of the need for the lung and its confining chest wall to conform to the same volume. The final result of proning is that the overall lung inflation is more homogeneous from dorsal to ventral than in the supine position, with more homogeneously distributed stress and strain. As the distribution of perfusion remains nearly constant in both postures, proning usually improves oxygenation. Animal experiments clearly show that prone positioning delays or prevents ventilation-induced lung injury, likely due in large part to more homogeneously distributed stress and strain. Over the last 15 years, five major trials have been conducted to compare the prone and supine positions in acute respiratory distress syndrome, regarding survival advantage. The sequence of trials enrolled patients who were progressively more hypoxemic; exposure to the prone position was extended from 8 to 17 hours/day, and lung-protective ventilation was more rigorously applied. Single-patient and meta-analyses drawing from the four major trials showed significant survival benefit in patients with PaO2/FiO2 lower than 100. The latest PROSEVA (Proning Severe ARDS Patients) trial confirmed these benefits in a formal randomized study. The bulk of data indicates that in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, carefully performed prone positioning offers an absolute survival advantage of 10–17%, making this intervention highly recommended in this specific population subset.

### Prone positioning reduces mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome in the low tidal volume era: a meta-analysis [^465d7ae4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prone positioning for ARDS has been performed for decades without definitive evidence of clinical benefit. A recent multicenter trial demonstrated for the first time significantly reduced mortality with prone positioning. This meta-analysis was performed to integrate these findings with existing literature and test whether differences in tidal volume explain conflicting results among randomized trials.

Methods

Studies were identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, LILACS, and citation review. Included were randomized trials evaluating the effect on mortality of prone versus supine positioning during conventional ventilation for ARDS. The primary outcome was risk ratio of death at 60 days meta-analyzed using random effects models. Analysis stratified by high (> 8 ml/kg predicted body weight) or low (≤ 8 ml/kg PBW) mean baseline tidal volume was planned a priori.

Results

Seven trials were identified including 2,119 patients, of whom 1,088 received prone positioning. Overall, prone positioning was not significantly associated with the risk ratio of death (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68–1.02; p = 0.073; I (2) = 64%). When stratified by high or low tidal volume, prone positioning was associated with a significant decrease in RR of death only among studies with low baseline tidal volume (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.50–0.86; p = 0.002; I (2) = 25%). Stratification by tidal volume explained over half the between-study heterogeneity observed in the unstratified analysis.

Conclusions

Prone positioning is associated with significantly reduced mortality from ARDS in the low tidal volume era. Substantial heterogeneity across studies can be explained by differences in tidal volume.

### Prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^a9759edb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined the effect on survival of prone positioning as an early and continuous treatment in ARDS patients already treated with protective ventilation.

Design and Setting

Open randomized controlled trial in 17 medical-surgical ICUs.

Patients

Forty mechanically ventilated patients with early and refractory ARDS despite protective ventilation in the supine position.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to remain supine or be moved to early (within 48[Symbol: see text]h) and continuous (≥ 20 h/day) prone position until recovery or death. The trial was prematurely stopped due to a low patient recruitment rate.

Measurements and Results

Clinical characteristics, oxygenation, lung pressures, and hemodynamics were monitored. Need for sedation, complications, length of MV, ICU, and hospital stays, and outcome were recorded. PaO(2)/FIO(2) tended to be higher in prone than in supine patients after 6[Symbol: see text]h (202 ± 78 vs. 165 ± 70 mmHg); this difference reached statistical significance on day 3 (234 ± 85 vs. 159 ± 78). Prone-related side effects were minimal and reversible. Sixty-day survival reached the targeted 15% absolute increase in prone patients (62% vs. 47%) but failed to reach significance due to the small sample.

Conclusions

Our study adds data that reinforce the suggestion of a beneficial effect of early continuous prone positioning on survival in ARDS patients.

### PEEP titration during prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^248db878]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present analysis highlights the paucity of data on concomitant high PEEP with prone positioning. Given the purported overlapping benefits to regional mechanics afforded by both interventions, these data raise legitimate concern about generalizability of existing clinical trial data on prone positioning to patients receiving a high-PEEP strategy. Our findings highlight the need for additional research comparing prone positioning, high PEEP, and both in combination for treatment of moderate-severe ARDS.

The mechanisms by which high PEEP may protect against lung injury are similar to those associated with proning. Both therapies promote more homogenous lung recruitment, minimizing local shear stress; reduce cyclic opening/collapsing of potentially recruitable lung units during tidal ventilation; and improve ventilation-perfusion matching. Indeed, preclinical models have demonstrated that both proning and PEEP mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury. Clinically, the PROSEVA trial demonstrated definitively better survival from moderate-severe ARDS with prone compared with supine positioning when managed with a low-PEEP strategy. A similar survival benefit has been suggested with a high-PEEP supine strategy, compared with a low-PEEP supine strategy, for moderate-severe ARDS. No multicenter randomized trial testing a high- versus low-PEEP strategy has demonstrated definitively a survival benefit nor enrolled exclusively patients with moderate-severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 of not more than 200). However, a meta-analysis of the three largest trials found improved survival with high PEEP in the subgroup of patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 of not more than 200, comparable to the population enrolled in PROSEVA. Thus, the overlapping physiological and clinical effects of proning and high PEEP raise doubt as to whether a proning low-PEEP strategy yields a survival advantage compared with a high-PEEP supine strategy; further studies are needed to address this question.

### Prone positioning of patients with moderate hypoxaemia due to COVID-19: multicentre pragmatic randomised trial (COVID-PRONE) [^2eafe508]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial of encouraging prone positioning in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 with hypoxaemia who were not critically ill, we did not observe improvements in the risk of the composite of death, mechanical ventilation, or worsening respiratory failure. However, the wide confidence intervals preclude definitively ruling out benefit or harm. Additionally, although we also did not observe improvements in oxygenation, the overall time spent prone per day was lower than planned despite inclusion and exclusion criteria identifying patients most likely to be able to lie prone and interventions to encourage adherence.

Comparison with other studies

Initial reports suggested that prone positioning might be potentially lifesaving for patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. However, early data were based on anecdotal reports and small case series. In the largest available studies of patients on a medical ward, the duration of prone positioning was often not reported, and when reported it was typically less than three hours a day. Most of these studies focused on oxygenation rather than clinical outcomes and identified improvements in oxygenation while the patient was prone, but improvements did not necessarily persist after prone positioning was stopped. The one available randomised trial for patients with mild hypoxaemia showed no improvement in oxygenation, but the trial was small and was stopped early because of poor adherence (that is, mean duration of 1.6 hours spent prone in the first 72 hours). Our study found that patients did not adhere to a prolonged time spent prone, and we saw no sustained improvement in oxygenation related to prone positioning. Specifically, the change in the ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen was similar in the two groups over the first 72 hours. Furthermore, the rate of worsening respiratory failure, intubation, or death was similar in the two groups.

### Effect of prone position on ventilation-perfusion matching in patients with moderate to severe ARDS with different clinical phenotypes [^7bfa5e9d]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Prone positioning can alter the redistribution of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary perfusion. (1) A prone position can promote the redistribution of pulmonary ventilation, as observed in previous studies. (2) The effect of the prone position on pulmonary perfusion is inconsistent. While some studies have indicated no significant impact on pulmonary perfusion, recent studies utilizing EIT measurements have shown improved dorsal lung perfusion. This finding aligns with our study and may be influenced by the study population or the method of monitoring lung perfusion. Prone positioning can significantly improve ventilation-perfusion matching, consistent with previous research findings. A recent study suggested that prone positioning can improve dorsal shunting and reduce V/Q mismatch in early ARDS, which is consistent with what we have observed in focal ARDS.

The varied response of ARDS patients with different imaging phenotypes to prone positioning therapy may be explained by the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS and its influence on lung mechanics and perfusion. Focal ARDS is characterized by increased localized lung damage, frequently leading to dorsal lung hypoventilation. In classic ARDS, poor compliance of the lung, coupled with a four-to fivefold increase in mass, leads to a significant increase in the pleural pressure gradient. This results in severe compressive atelectasis and non-dependence in gravity-dependent lung regions, causing regional overdistension in the lungs. Therefore, in the prone position, these alveoli may open as the superimposed pressure in the dorsal region is relieved. Prone positioning may optimize ventilation-perfusion matching and enhance oxygenation by redistributing ventilation to affected areas. In focal ARDS, a larger volume of "healthy" lung tissue is preserved, making the reopening of dorsal atelectatic lung tissue potentially quicker. For non-focal ARDS, a more extended prone positioning time is required for improved oxygenation. This suggests that for this type of patient, a longer prone positioning time is needed to assess the effectiveness of prone positioning.

### Lung response to prone positioning in mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 [^9369156a]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning was recommended for moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) well before the appearance of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It improves survival possibly by reopening or "recruiting" the dorsal non-aerated but perfused lung tissue and diminishing ventral hyperinflation. As a result, arterial oxygenation almost always increases, and, more important, ventilation becomes more evenly distributed, with fewer harms from mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning carries some risks, including transient desaturation, endotracheal tube obstruction or displacement (up to accidental extubation), reduced venous return, need for more sedation, vomiting, loss of venous access, and pressure sores. The advantages of prone positioning are more likely to outweigh these dangers in moderate-to-severe ARDS, i.e. when the risk of secondary lung damage is higher.

Soon after its appearance, prone positioning was recommended by international guidelines and experts and widely used even for moderate-to-severe ARDS related to COVID-19. The underlying assumption was that prone positioning is also beneficial in ARDS due to COVID-19. However, whether the latter should be treated as ARDS of other origins remains controversial.

This study aimed to verify whether prone positioning decreases alveolar collapse and hyperinflation and homogenizes lung aeration in patients with early ARDS due to COVID-19. We reasoned that a positive response would support prone positioning even in this novel syndrome.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^ee03a77e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanical ventilation in ARDS — prone positioning recommendation states that adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receive prone positioning for more than 12 hours per day; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-high confidence in effect estimates. The panel notes a lack of consensus on providing a conditional recommendation for prone positioning in patients with moderate ARDS with a Pao2/Fio2 of 101–150 because of lower confidence in the balance of outcomes, and it is unknown whether higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can potentiate the lung-protective effects of prone positioning; trials to date have used moderate levels of PEEP and further research is required to evaluate the benefit of higher PEEP during prone positioning.

### Effect of prone positioning on endotracheal intubation in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure… [^be32bcbc]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Prone positioning has been used since the 1970s in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome. 4 Observational studies showed that prone positioning may result in increased lung volume, 5 homogenized pleural pressure, 6 and reduced shunting. 7 Furthermore, randomized clinical trials found prone positioning to be associated with a lower risk of death in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. 8, 9. The trial included patients aged 18 years or older who were not intubated, who had suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and who required at least 40% oxygen or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and were being treated in an intensive care unit or a monitored acute care unit.

We compared the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups with prespecified hypotheses and reported the corresponding P value for the interaction. In contrast, 53 patients in the prone positioning group and 60 patients in the control group received noninvasive positive pressure ventilation after randomization. Details on the duration of each oxygenation mode used per group appear in eTable 7 in Supplement 3. Awake prone positioning was associated with modest improvement in both Spo2: Fio2 and Fio2 compared with the values collected prior to prone positioning. Changes in oxygenation parameters appear in eFigures 6–7 in Supplement 3. At 30 days, patients in the prone positioning group had a mean of

### Prone position for acute respiratory failure in adults [^66abfdf4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute hypoxaemia de novo or on a background of chronic hypoxaemia is a common reason for admission to intensive care and for provision of mechanical ventilation. Various refinements of mechanical ventilation or adjuncts are employed to improve patient outcomes. Mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome, one of the main contributors to the need for mechanical ventilation for hypoxaemia, remains approximately 40%. Ventilation in the prone position may improve lung mechanics and gas exchange and could improve outcomes.

Objectives

The objectives of this review are (1) to ascertain whether prone ventilation offers a mortality advantage when compared with traditional supine or semi recumbent ventilation in patients with severe acute respiratory failure requiring conventional invasive artificial ventilation, and (2) to supplement previous systematic reviews on prone ventilation for hypoxaemic respiratory failure in an adult population.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 31 January 2014), EMBASE (1980 to 31 January 2014), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to 31 January 2014) and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1992 to 31 January 2014) in Ovid MEDLINE for eligible randomized controlled trials. We also searched for studies by handsearching reference lists of relevant articles, by contacting colleagues and by handsearching published proceedings of relevant journals. We applied no language constraints, and we reran the searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and LILACS in June 2015. We added five new studies of potential interest to the list of "Studies awaiting classification" and will incorporate them into formal review findings during the review update.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effects of prone position versus supine/semi recumbent position during conventional mechanical ventilation in adult participants with acute hypoxaemia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all trials identified by the search and assessed them for suitability, methods and quality. Two review authors extracted data, and three review authors reviewed the data extracted. We analysed data using Review Manager software and pooled included studies to determine the risk ratio (RR) for mortality and the risk ratio or mean difference (MD) for secondary outcomes; we also performed subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We identified nine relevant RCTs, which enrolled a total of 2165 participants (10 publications). All recruited participants suffered from disorders of lung function causing moderate to severe hypoxaemia and requiring mechanical ventilation, so they were fairly comparable, given the heterogeneity of specific disease diagnoses in intensive care. Risk of bias, although acceptable in the view of the review authors, was inevitable: Blinding of participants and carers to treatment allocation was not possible (face-up vs face-down). Primary analyses of short- and longer-term mortality pooled from six trials demonstrated an RR of 0.84 to 0.86 in favour of the prone position (PP), but findings were not statistically significant: In the short term, mortality for those ventilated prone was 33.4% (363/1086) and supine 38.3% (395/1031). This resulted in an RR of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.02) marginally in favour of PP. For longer-term mortality, results showed 41.7% (462/1107) for prone and 47.1% (490/1041) for supine positions, with an RR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.03). The quality of the evidence for both outcomes was rated as low as a result of important potential bias and serious inconsistency. Subgroup analyses for mortality identified three groups consistently favouring PP: those recruited within 48 hours of meeting entry criteria (five trials; 1024 participants showed an RR of 0.75 (95% CI 0.59 to 94)); those treated in the PP for 16 or more hours per day (five trials; 1005 participants showed an RR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.99)); and participants with more severe hypoxaemia at trial entry (six trials; 1108 participants showed an RR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.92)). The quality of the evidence for these outcomes was rated as moderate as a result of potentially important bias. Prone positioning appeared to influence adverse effects: Pressure sores (three trials; 366 participants) with an RR of 1.37 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.79) and tracheal tube obstruction with an RR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.60) were increased with prone ventilation. Reporting of arrhythmias was reduced with PP, with an RR of 0.64 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.87).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no convincing evidence of benefit nor harm from universal application of PP in adults with hypoxaemia mechanically ventilated in intensive care units (ICUs). Three subgroups (early implementation of PP, prolonged adoption of PP and severe hypoxaemia at study entry) suggested that prone positioning may confer a statistically significant mortality advantage. Additional adequately powered studies would be required to confirm or refute these possibilities of subgroup benefit but are unlikely, given results of the most recent study and recommendations derived from several published subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of individual patient data could be useful for further data exploration in this regard. Complications such as tracheal obstruction are increased with use of prone ventilation. Long-term mortality data (12 months and beyond), as well as functional, neuro-psychological and quality of life data, are required if future studies are to better inform the role of PP in the management of hypoxaemic respiratory failure in the ICU.

### The efficacy and safety of prone positional ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome: updated study-level meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials [^11403d3c]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The survival benefit of prone positioning during mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome has been a matter of debate. Recent multicenter randomized controlled trials have shown a significant reduction of 28-day and 90-day mortality associated with prone positioning during mechanical ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis on this topic and elucidated the effect of prone positioning on overall mortality and associated complications.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, BioMed Central, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and conference proceedings through May 2013.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trial comparing overall mortality of prone-versus-supine positioning in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted for populations, interventions, outcomes, and risk of bias. The prespecified primary endpoint was overall mortality, using the longest available follow-up in each study. The odds ratio with 95% CI was the effect measure.

Data Synthesis

This analysis included 11 randomized controlled trial, 2,246 total adult patients, and 1,142 patients ventilated in the prone position. Prone positioning during ventilation significantly reduced overall mortality in the random-effect model (odds ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99; p = 0.039; I = 33.7%), and the effects were marked in the subgroup in which the duration of prone positioning was more than 10 hr/session, compared with the subgroup with a short-term duration of prone positioning (odds ratio, 0.62; 9% CI, 0.48–0.79; p = 0.039; pinteraction = 0.015). Prone positioning was significantly associated with pressure ulcers (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18–1.89; p = 0.001; I = 0.0%) and major airway problems (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.10–2.17; p = 0.012; I = 32.7%).

Conclusions

Ventilation in the prone position significantly reduced overall mortality in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sufficient duration of prone positioning was significantly associated with a reduction in overall mortality. Prone ventilation was also significantly associated with pressure ulcers and major airway problems.

### The effect of prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome or acute lung injury: a meta-analysis. areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^5cf5ac86]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of ventilation in prone and in supine position in patients with acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS).

Design

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

BioMedCentral, PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase (to November 2007), with additional information from authors.

Measurements and Results

From selected randomised controlled trials comparing positioning in ALI/ARDS we extracted data concerning study design, disease severity, clinical outcomes, and adverse events. Five trials including 1,372 patients met the inclusion criteria for mortality analysis; one trial was added to assess the effects on acquisition of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The included trials were significantly underpowered and enrolled patients with varying severity. Prone positioning duration and mechanical ventilation strategy were not standardised across studies. Using a fixed-effects model, we did not find a significant effect of prone positioning (proning) on mortality (odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.77–1.22). The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased significantly more with proning (weighted means difference 25 mmHg, p < 0.00001). Proning was associated with a non-significant 23% reduction in the odds of VAP (p = 0.09), and with no increase in major adverse airway complications: OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.71–1.43. Length of intensive care unit stay was marginally and not significantly increased by proning.

Conclusions

Prone position is not associated with a significant reduction in mortality from ALI/ARDS despite a significant increase in PaO(2)/FiO(2), is safe, and tends to decrease VAP. Published studies exhibit substantial clinical heterogeneity, suggesting that an adequately sized study optimising the duration of proning and ventilation strategy is warranted to enable definitive conclusions to be drawn.

Treatment harms

Overall, the pooled risk of any adverse event with prone positioning was significantly increased (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12). Where a more detailed analysis of adverse events was conducted, endotracheal tube displacement (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.74), the incidence of pressure sores (1.23; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.41) and loss of venous access (RR 1.98; 95% CI 1.11 to 3.55) were significantly increased. However, this evidence was down-graded based on the risk of bias and imprecision in the trials evaluated.

Grade recommendation statement

We do not recommend the use of prone positioning for all patients with ARDS. We recommend the use of prone positioning for at least 12 hours per day in patients with moderate/severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 20 kPa: GRADE recommendation: strongly in favour).

Grade recommendation justification

Current evidence includes the possibility of substantial patient benefit in terms of reduced mortality when combined with lung-protective ventilation and when delivered for at least 12 hours to patients with moderate/severe ARDS. Evidence for these findings was of moderate quality. The GDG noted the relative improvements in study design over the time course of publication of all eight trials, such that the most recently published focused enrolment on the most severe strata of patients with ARDS, and involved a multimodal intervention comprising lung-protective ventilation with prolonged prone positioning producing highly favourable outcomes. This observation provides the rationale for the strong classification of recommendation.

The possibility for substantial patient benefit must be considered in the context of a significant risk of occurrence of adverse events including endotracheal tube displacement, pressure sores and loss of venous access, although the evidence to support these findings was either low or very low. However, the GDG felt that these adverse events could be mitigated by ensuring that sufficient skilled personnel were in place to deliver and monitor the intervention.

Fig. 1
Summary of the trend of optimal PEEP, respiratory system compliance (Crs), PaO 2 /FiO 2 (PF) and mechanical power (MP) during prone position. The values are normalized to time point 0 immediately measured after prone position started

The current study presents a summary of initial findings from five patients with moderate–severe ARDS during prolonged prone positioning. Our observations indicate a dynamic shift in lung mechanics and oxygenation, underscoring the crucial need for timely ventilator adjustments throughout extended prone periods. While the standard proning duration is typically recommended at around 16 h, the concept of extra-long prone positioning emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic when healthcare staff faced constraints. Contrary to conventional practice, we observed instances where patients exhibited ongoing improvements in lung function and oxygenation even after 30 h of prone position. The benefits persisted 6 h post-supination. This prompted our current study to document the physiological variations during prolonged proning. The optimal duration for prone positioning hinges significantly on individual responses to ventilation-perfusion adjustments and disease progression. In our study, a substantial deterioration in mechanical power post-30-h proning was noted in one patient, with a concurrent drop in PaO 2 /FiO 2 at T P36 (Fig. 1 bottom purple lines). Despite achieving similar ventilation homogeneity at lower PEEP level, extended prone positioning might not be advisable. The principal limitation of this study lies in its small sample size, precluding robust statistical analyses. Nonetheless, the personalized trends in optimal PEEP, lung mechanics and oxygenation were clearly illustrated. Future investigations should explore the link between personalized proning durations, ventilator adjustments and patient outcomes such as ventilator-free days and mortality rates, aiming to provide valuable insights for clinical practice.

### Prone position versus usual care in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in medical wards: a randomised controlled trial [^cd325f76]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 may cause pneumonia, hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prone positioning can improve oxygenation in several ways, it can reduce mortality, and it is now part of the standard of care in sedated, mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. In critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, awake prone positioning was recently shown to reduce the incidence of intubation or death and the incidence of intubation.

Among COVID-19 patients who are hospitalised in medical wards and require oxygen therapy, the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) admission to initiate mechanical respiratory support is high. The role of awake prone positioning in the care of these patients remains to be evaluated. Several observational studies have shown encouraging results, mainly an improvement in oxygenation. Small randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were uninformative. A large non-RCT found no benefit of prone positioning in hypoxemic patients. One recent RCT showing no benefits of prone positioning in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients was stopped early for futility.

This multicentre, pragmatic RCT of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen therapy and hospitalised in medical wards aimed to determine whether awake prone position plus usual care compared to usual care alone could reduce the incidence of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation or death. The question was considered at the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid overloading ICUs.

### Gas exchange in the prone posture [^741b3716]. Respiratory Care (2017). Low credibility.

The prone posture is known to have numerous effects on gas exchange, both under normal conditions and in patients with ARDS. Clinical studies have consistently demonstrated improvements in oxygenation, and a multi-center randomized trial found that, when implemented within 48 h of moderate-to-severe ARDS, placing subjects in the prone posture decreased mortality. Improvements in gas exchange occur via several mechanisms: alterations in the distribution of alveolar ventilation, redistribution of blood flow, improved matching of local ventilation and perfusion, and reduction in regions of low ventilation/perfusion ratios. Ventilation heterogeneity is reduced in the prone posture due to more uniform alveolar size secondary to a more uniform vertical pleural pressure gradient. The prone posture results in more uniform pulmonary blood flow when compared with the supine posture, due to an anatomical bias for greater blood flow to dorsal lung regions. Because both ventilation and perfusion heterogeneity decrease in the prone posture, gas exchange improves. Other benefits include a more uniform distribution of alveolar stress, relief of left-lower-lobe lung compression by the heart, enhanced secretion clearance, and favorable right-ventricular and systemic hemodynamics.

### Prolonged vs shorter awake prone positioning for COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure: a multicenter, randomised controlled trial [^e2acb888]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Placing intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) into the prone position has been investigated for 5 decades. It has been shown to improve oxygenation by recruiting dorsal lung regions and by improving the distribution of ventilation. It has also become the standard of care for patients with moderately-severe to severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg) based on studies demonstrating a decreased mortality, likely by decreasing ventilator-induced lung injury.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) primarily affects the respiratory system causing mild to severe respiratory illness. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies reported the benefit of using the prone position in non-intubated patients (an approach that is often termed "awake proning" or "awake prone positioning") with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Awake prone position has been suggested by ARDS guidelines as the standard of care for these patients to prevent intubation. However, the daily median duration of the awake prone position varied substantially among studies (from 1.7 to 9 h per day) and there were uncertainties over the benefits of longer periods of awake proning.

Longer durations of daily awake prone position appear to be associated with treatment success (survival without intubation) in patients with COVID-19-related AHRF, in line with a prospective cohort study, in which the awake prone position for ≥ 6 h/day reduced the risk of endotracheal intubation; and awake proning for ≥ 8 h/d reduced the risk of hospital mortality. Two recent meta-analyses also suggested a reduction in intubation rate among those with longer durations of daily awake prone position. However, there is no high-quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence demonstrating that prolonged awake prone positioning can further reduce intubation when compared to standard care which utilizes a short duration of awake prone position.

Given that the efficacy of proning appears to be time dependent in moderate to severe (intubated) ARDS patients, and in non-intubated COVID-19 AHRF patients, we conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to explore whether a strategy aimed at ensuring prolonged awake prone positioning (aiming for 12 h daily for 7 days) would reduce the rate of intubation at 28 days when compared with standard care with a shorter period of awake prone positioning in non-intubated patients with COVID-19-related AHRF.

### The effect of prone positioning on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^e60644af]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and search strategies

Reports of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PP in ARDS patients were retrieved by searching the following data sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science and Elsevier Science (inception to May 2013). The following keywords were used: ("prone position" OR "body posture" OR "body position" OR "prone positioning") AND ("acute respiratory distress syndrome" OR "lung injury" OR "respiratory failure" OR "ALI" OR "ARDS"). Adult and pediatric populations were included in this literature search, and we restricted the literature language to English.

Study selection

Two investigators assessed the retrieved studies, and they included the titles, abstracts and citations independently for possible consideration. The reviewers evaluated the studies for inclusion based on the criteria presented below, and they resolved any differences by consensus. The investigators selected the retrieved studies that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Because this is a meta-analysis of previously published studies, no ethical approval or patient consent was required.

Inclusion criteria

Studies were included if the following criteria were present: (1) the study was a trial comparing only the prone position with the supine position in patients with acute respiratory failure, acute lung injury or ARDS; (2) the definition of ARDS or the diagnostic criteria for ARDS were similar; (3) the study was a clinical RCT; (4) 28- to 30-day mortality data were available or ICU mortality, 60-day mortality or 90-day mortality was presented; and (5) the numbers of patients in the prone and supine positions were provided.

Exclusion criteria

Studies were excluded from the meta-analysis according to the following exclusion criteria: (1) the article was an editorial, review, letter or other type of publication not based on original research; (2) the full text was unavailable; (3) the study did not include extractable outcomes or mortality data; (4) the study was not an RCT; (5) the trial did not use supine positioning (SP) as a control (for example, the lateral position was used as a control); and 6) the trial applied significantly different adjunct interventions to the prone position and supine position groups (for example, the supine position group received high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, but the prone position group did not).

### Efficacy of awake prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 related hypoxemic respiratory failure: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^a4f8b5c2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Awake prone positioning compared with usual care reduced the risk of endotracheal intubation in adults with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to covid-19. Evidence on the effects of awake prone positioning on mortality or other secondary outcomes was, however, inconclusive. Adverse events related to awake prone positioning were uncommon, highlighting the safety of this intervention. However, adherence to the target duration of prone positioning was low in many trials. Thus, clinicians and patients must balance the goal of avoiding endotracheal intubation with the tolerability of awake prone positioning and availability of staff resources to encourage and assist patients. Future trials should aim to determine strategies to improve tolerability and adherence, assess the optimal duration of awake prone positioning, and determine the effect of awake prone positioning from other causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Regarding respiratory support for acute respiratory distress syndrome, more specifically with respect to mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, ESICM 2023 guidelines recommend to start prone position in patients with ARDS receiving invasive mechanical ventilation early after intubation, after a period of stabilization during which low tidal volume is applied and PEEP adjusted and at the end of which the PaO2/FiO2 remains < 150 mmHg. Maintain prone positioning for prolonged sessions (≥ 16 consecutive hours) to reduce mortality.

### Positioning of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: combining prone and upright makes sense [^f2ab4364]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Positional strategies have been proposed for mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Despite different physiological mechanisms involved, oxygenation improvement has been demonstrated with both prone and upright positions. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Robak and colleagues reported the first study evaluating the short-term effects of combining prone and upright positioning. The combined positioning enhanced the response rate in terms of oxygenation. Other benefits, such as a reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia and better enteral feeding tolerance, can potentially be expected.

### Adverse events of prone positioning in mechanically ventilated adults with ARDS [^090d79ba]. Respiratory Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning is a therapy utilized globally to improve gas exchange, minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, and reduce mortality in ARDS, particularly during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Whereas the respiratory benefits of prone positioning in ARDS have been accepted, the concurrent complications could be undervalued. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the adverse events (AEs) related to prone positioning in ARDS and, secondarily, to collect strategies and recommendations to mitigate these AEs.

Methods

In this scoping review, we searched recommendation documents and original studies published between June 2013 and November 2020 from 6 relevant electronic databases and the websites of intensive care societies.

Results

We selected 41 documents from 121 eligible documents, comprising 13 recommendation documents and 28 original studies (involving 1,578 subjects and 994 prone maneuvers). We identified > 40 individual AEs, and the highest-pooled occurrence rates were those of severe desaturation (37.9%), barotrauma (30.5%), pressure sores (29.7%), ventilation-associated pneumonia (28.2%), facial edema (16.7%), arrhythmia (15.4%), hypotension (10.2%), and peripheral nerve injuries (8.1%). The reported mitigation strategies during prone positioning included alternate face rotation (18 [43.9%]), repositioning every 2 h (17 [41.5%]), and the use of pillows under the chest and pelvis (14 [34.1%]). The reported mitigation strategies for performing the prone maneuver comprised one person being at the headboard (23 [56.1%]), the use of a pre-maneuver safety checklist (18 [43.9%]), vital sign monitoring (15 [36.6%]), and ensuring appropriate ventilator settings (12 [29.3%]).

Conclusions

We identified > 40 AEs reported in prone positioning ARDS studies, including additional AEs not yet reported by previous systematic reviews. The pooled AE proportions collected in this review could guide research and clinical practice decisions, and the strategies to mitigate AEs could promote future consensus-based recommendations.

### Effects of systematic prone positioning in hypoxemic acute respiratory failure: a randomized controlled trial [^51278685]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

A recent trial showed that placing patients with acute lung injury in the prone position did not increase survival; however, whether those results hold true for patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF) is unclear.

Objective

To determine whether prone positioning improves mortality in ARF patients.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Prospective, unblinded, multicenter controlled trial of 791 ARF patients in 21 general intensive care units in France using concealed randomization conducted from December 14, 1998, through December 31, 2002. To be included, patients had to be at least 18 years, hemodynamically stable, receiving mechanical ventilation, and intubated and had to have a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio of 300 or less and no contraindications to lying prone.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to prone position placement (n = 413), applied as early as possible for at least 8 hours per day on standard beds, or to supine position placement (n = 378).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was 28-day mortality; secondary end points were 90-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and oxygenation.

Results

The 2 groups were comparable at randomization. The 28-day mortality rate was 32.4% for the prone group and 31.5% for the supine group (relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79–1.19; P = 0.77). Ninety-day mortality for the prone group was 43.3% vs 42.2% for the supine group (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84–1.13; P = 0.74). The mean (SD) duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.7 (7.8) days for the prone group vs 14.1 (8.6) days for the supine group (P = 0.93) and the VAP incidence was 1.66 vs 2.14 episodes per 100-patients days of intubation, respectively (P = 0.045). The PaO2/FIO2 ratio was significantly higher in the prone group during the 28-day follow-up. However, pressure sores, selective intubation, and endotracheal tube obstruction incidences were higher in the prone group.

Conclusions

This trial demonstrated no beneficial outcomes and some safety concerns associated with prone positioning. For patients with hypoxemic ARF, prone position placement may lower the incidence of VAP.

### Lung response to prone positioning in mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 [^f87e42d1]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

So far, the morphological and functional response to prone positioning in COVID-19 has been investigated only partially. Herein we show that with prone positioning: (1) aeration is globally more evenly distributed so that harms from mechanical ventilation should be reduced; (2) a "beneficial" morphological response cannot be predicted from changes in gas exchange and respiratory system mechanics; (3) the decrease in hyperinflation (herein measured as the volume of the over-aerated lung) is frequently larger than recruitment. This can be particularly important in patients with COVID-19, who are at an increased risk of ventilator-induced lung damage.

Some of the limitations of this study deserve a comment. First, we could not enrol all consecutive eligible patients during the first pandemic wave, which may have been a source of bias (see Additional file 1: Table S1). Second, data were analysed with no correction for multiple tests, so our results should be considered preliminary. Third, the lung CTs were obtained at end-expiration, and we did not study the distribution of tidal volume in the supine and prone positions. Fourth, our study design differed in many aspects from common clinical practise. Lung response was assessed soon after prone positioning. However, patients are usually kept prone for several hours, during which their response can evolve. A recruitment manoeuvre was always performed before and after prone positioning, which may not be part of routine care. PEEP was set at the discretion of the attending physician; if set differently, lung morphology and function would have probably differed. All of these issues limit the generalizability of our findings. Fifth, the effects of prone positioning may not be the same in patients with late COVID-19. Finally, we did not study the impact of prone positioning on patient-centred outcomes, such as survival or duration of mechanical ventilation.

### Efficacy of awake prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 related hypoxemic respiratory failure: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^1a0a6f89]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

The mechanism for how awake prone positioning reduces endotracheal intubation remains uncertain. Adherence to longer duration of prone positioning may be an effect modifier on the outcome of endotracheal intubation. It has been hypothesized that longer duration of awake prone positioning may be more effective, similar to placing patients in the prone position who are receiving invasive ventilation. However, unlike patients receiving invasive ventilation who were placed in the prone positioning, awake patients are not sedated and not receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. This key difference may explain why none of the included trials that specified target durations for awake prone positioning met the prescribed dose in their intervention group. The intervention may be limited by patient tolerance as data suggest that awake patients may not cope well with long periods of prone positioning. Although many patients can place themselves in a prone position, others may need encouragement or assistance to do so for longer durations, which may require the availability of staff or other resources. Dedicated teams can increase adherence to prone positioning for intubated patients, but data on the utility of this approach for non-intubated patients are limited. Other strategies to improve adherence, such as smart phone based guidance and reminders, did not result in better adherence in one trial. Thus, the benefits of awake prone positioning need to be weighed against the resources and staff needed to ensure safe adherence to the intervention. Thus, it remains uncertain whether better adherence to longer duration of awake prone positioning does modify the effect of the intervention. Our subgroup analysis suggested that in trials in which the median duration of awake prone positioning was ≥ 5 hours/day, the reduction in endotracheal intubation risk was relatively greater. However, the interaction test P value was not significant. Similarly, using meta-regression, the association between duration of awake prone positioning at the trial level and the effect size was not significant. Although these analyses suggest a potential association between duration of awake prone positioning and efficacy, they may be underpowered or potentially confounded since duration of prone positioning was not randomized and should be considered hypothesis generating. Even if an association exists between duration and efficacy, the optimal duration of awake prone positioning remains unknown. This question could be better evaluated in future randomized trials comparing various durations of prone positioning that are balanced with tolerability. In our other subgroup analyses, trials with more severe baseline hypoxemia, those performed in mixed hospital settings, and those performed in low to middle income countries tended to have larger effects. None of the interaction test P values were, however, significant, so we caution against over-interpretation of these findings. To most appropriately and efficiently allocate resources to deliver this intervention, future studies could aim to determine which patient subgroups, if any, benefit most from awake prone positioning.

### High-frequency oscillatory ventilation following prone positioning prevents a further impairment in oxygenation [^bb40fccd]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The improvement in oxygenation with prone positioning is not persistent when patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are turned supine. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) aims to maintain an open lung volume by the application of a constant mean airway pressure. The aim of this study was to show that HFOV is able to prevent the impairment in oxygenation when ARDS patients are turned back from the prone to the supine position.

Design

Prospective, comparative randomized study.

Setting

A medical intensive care unit.

Patients

Forty-three ARDS patients with a Pao2/Fio2 ratio < 150 at positive end-expiratory pressure ≥ 5 cm H2O.

Interventions

After an optimization period, the patients were assigned to one of three groups: a) conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation in the prone position (12 hrs) followed by a 12-hr period of conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation in the supine position (CV(prone)-CV(supine)); b) conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation in the supine position (12 hrs) followed by HFOV in the supine position (12 hrs) (CV(supine)-HFOV(supine)); or c) conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation in the prone position (12 hrs) followed by HFOV in the supine position (CV(prone)-HFOV(supine) group).

Measurements and Main Results

Pao2/Fio2 ratio was higher at the end of the study period in the CV(prone)-HFOV(supine) group than in the CV(prone)-CV(supine) group (p < .02). Venous admixture at the end of the study period was lower in the CV(prone)-HFOV(supine) group than in the two other groups.

Conclusions

HFOV maintained the improvement in oxygenation related to prone positioning when ARDS patients were returned to the supine position.

### What is the optimal duration of ventilation in the prone position in acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^b976dad8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of prone ventilation on respiratory parameters and extravascular lung water (EVLW) in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in order to characterise the optimal duration of ventilation in the prone position.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

Nine-bed general intensive care unit.

Patients

Eleven patients with refractory hypoxaemia due to ALI/ARDS were prospectively investigated during 12 consecutive episodes of prone ventilation.

Interventions

Ventilation in the prone position for 18 h.

Measurements and Main Results

Measurements were obtained supine and after 1, 2, 6, 12 and 18 h in the prone position and 1 h after returning supine. There was a progressive improvement in PaO(2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)) ratio which reached significance after 12 h [121 (81–151) to 258 (187–329) torr; p < 0.05]. EVLW index increased transiently at 1 h [14.2 (7.6–20.8) to 15.1 (9.0–20.2); p = 0.05] and thereafter declined progressively and was significantly decreased at 18 h [12.1 (7.2–17.0); p = 0.043]. The shunt fraction showed an early fall [0.41 (0.40–0.42) to 0.31 (0.30–0.32) at 1 h; p < 0.001] preceding a subsequent progressive fall [0.22 (0.21–0.23) at 18 h; p < 0.001].

Conclusions

Over the 18 h period studied there was progressive improvement in gas exchange, pulmonary shunt and EVLW. Although it is not possible to exclude that improvement over this period was unrelated to prone positioning, these findings suggests that ventilation in the prone position for more prolonged periods may be required for optimal improvement and warrants further study.

### A comprehensive review of prone position in ARDS [^08afbdbe]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Prone position (PP) has been used since the 1970s to treat severe hypoxemia in patients with ARDS because of its effectiveness at improving gas exchange. Compared with the supine position (SP), placing patients in PP effects a more even tidal volume distribution, in part, by reversing the vertical pleural pressure gradient, which becomes more negative in the dorsal regions. PP also improves resting lung volume in the dorsocaudal regions by reducing the superimposed pressure of both the heart and the abdomen. In contrast, pulmonary perfusion remains preferentially distributed to the dorsal lung regions, thus improving overall alveolar ventilation/perfusion relationships. Moreover, the larger tissue mass suspended from a wider dorsal chest wall effects a more homogeneous distribution of pleural pressures throughout the lung that reduces abnormal strain and stress development. This is believed to ameliorate the severity or development of ventilator-induced lung injury and may partly explain why PP reduces mortality in severe ARDS. Over 40 years of clinical trials have consistently reported improved oxygenation in approximately 70% of subjects with ARDS. Early initiation of PP is more likely to improve oxygenation than initiation during the subacute phase. Maximal oxygenation improvement occurs over a wide time frame ranging from several hours to several days. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials suggest that PP provides a survival advantage only in patients with relatively severe ARDS (PaO2 /FIO2 < 150 mm Hg). Moreover, survival is enhanced when patients are managed with a smaller tidal volume (≤ 8 mL/kg), higher PEEP (10–13 cm H2O), and longer duration of PP sessions (> 10–12 h/session). Combining adjunctive therapies (high PEEP, recruitment maneuvers, and inhaled vasodilators) with PP has an additive effect in improving oxygenation and may be particularly helpful in stabilizing gas exchange in very severe ARDS.

### Effect of prone position on ventilation-perfusion matching in patients with moderate to severe ARDS with different clinical phenotypes [^44a337eb]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a prevalent condition in the intensive care unit (ICU) characterized by a high mortality rate, and prone positioning has been an important treatment modality for improving oxygenation and prognosis in ARDS patients.

An inaugural report on prone positioning in ARDS patients surfaced in 1976, detailing noteworthy enhancements in oxygenation upon transitioning patients from the supine to the prone position. The prone position may induce a spectrum of physiological effects, including the alleviation of lung pressure, diminishment of areas prone to collapse, enhancement of lung function, rectification of gas exchange imbalance through more uniform blood and airflow redistribution, reduction of ventilator reliance, and facilitation of improved clearance of secretions generated during lung diseases. In the last decade, conclusive evidence supporting the mortality reduction attributed to prone positioning in severe ARDS patients has emerged. Nonetheless, recent studies have cast doubt on the efficacy of prone positioning since it can cause heightened lung hyperinflation in ARDS patients. This suggests that individual differences may exist in the response of ARDS patients to prone positioning therapy.

ARDS is a markedly heterogeneous syndrome, leading to varied responses among patients to different treatments. Classifying ARDS patients into subphenotypes is a good perspective for explaining the different clinical characteristics of ARDS patients and their varying responses to treatment and imaging features, and biomakers are the most commonly used indicators for identifying ARDS subphenotypes. Within the LIVE trial, mortality reduction was observed at 90 days when personalized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning strategies were employed, guided by clinical phenotypes (focal versus non-focal), specifically among patients treated with each regimen. Secondary analyses of the LUNG-SAFE study and the ALVEOLI trial both indicated potential benefits for patients with hyperinflammation when employing high PEEP, in contrast to the hypoinflammatory subphenotype. This finding implies that inflammation levels may influence the uniformity of lung ventilation. Similarly, ARDS patients exhibiting diverse imaging features and inflammation levels may manifest distinct responses to prone positioning. In contrast to patients with non-focal ARDS, those with focal ARDS exhibit more pronounced dorsal lung collapse and may demonstrate greater responsiveness to prone positioning. Nevertheless, pertinent studies investigating the response of patients with distinct ARDS phenotypes to prone position treatment are currently lacking.

In this study, we aimed to compare the impact of PP on ventilation and pulmonary perfusion between moderate-to-severe ARDS patients with different subphenotypes using contrast-enhanced electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to determine the relationship between ARDS subphenotypes and patient response to PP.

### Prone positioning of patients with moderate hypoxaemia due to COVID-19: multicentre pragmatic randomised trial (COVID-PRONE) [^439a1f42]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Multiple observational studies have examined the effectiveness of prone positioning in non-intubated patients with covid-19. The results have been conflicting, with some studies showing a modest improvement in oxygenation and others showing no improvement. One randomised trial of 30 non-intubated patients with covid-19 identified no improvement in oxygenation, but the trial was stopped early owing to a lack of adherence to the intervention. A recently published meta-trial of patients needing high flow nasal cannulas identified a lower risk of treatment failure (that is, a composite of intubation or death) for patients randomised to prone positioning. Whether prone positioning is effective in managing patients with milder forms of hypoxaemia remains unclear. Because prone positioning has potential risks to patients (for example, aspiration and patient discomfort) and healthcare providers (requires more personnel time spent in the room with an infectious patient) and may be difficult for patients to tolerate, randomised trials are needed to evaluate the risks and benefits. We conducted a multicentre pragmatic randomised clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of prone positioning to reduce the risk of death or respiratory failure in non-critically ill patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 (NCT04383613).

Awake prone positioning in nonintubated adults with severe COVID-19 — evidence assessment: There is insufficient evidence to issue a recommendation on the use of awake prone positioning in nonintubated adults with severe COVID-19. An updated search identified a systematic review including 35 observational studies (n = 4144 patients, 12 prospective cohorts, 18 retrospective cohorts, and 5 case reports) in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings; 29 included COVID-19 patients. Prone positioning was protocolized in 15 studies, and all reports showed improvement in oxygenation while prone, but improvements were lost after return to supine; given lack of randomization/control and uncertainty about safety and patient-important outcomes, no recommendation was issued.

### ESICM guidelines on acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, phenotyping and respiratory support strategies [^45afb71d]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Unresolved questions and research gaps

It is unlikely that a trial comparing prone to supine will be conducted in moderate-severe COVID-related ARDS given the lack of equipoise in the field at present. A trial is ongoing in France in adult intubated patients with mild to moderate ARDS (NCT05056090).

Question 7.2: In patients with moderate-severe ARDS, when should prone positioning be started to reduce mortality?

Background

No specific trial was designed to explore the role of predetermined criteria in the decision to start prone position. Therefore, the evidence used for this question is the same as that for previous the question.

Expert opinion on clinical application

The current recommendation is based on the evidence obtained from one trial (PROSEVA). The stabilization period before proning should take into account the time to optimize the ventilator settings and hemodynamics. Continuing prone position even if there is no significant initial improvement in oxygenation is based on the potential of prone position to protect the lung by homogenization of lung stress and potentially improving trajectory of recovery.

Unresolved questions and research gaps

There is no trial comparing different durations of prone position and no trial testing strategies other than oxygenation to determine when to cease proning sessions. The difference in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio between prone and subsequent supine position could be used to guide when to cease prone position. Moreover, using respiratory mechanics, e.g. keeping driving pressure within safe ranges, in addition to oxygenation and/or markers of dead-space ventilation, may be taken into account in the decision to stop the sessions. The effect of prolonged sessions of proning in patients showing minimal improvement in gas exchange should be further evaluated.

Question 7.3: In non intubated patients with AHRF, does awake prone positioning (APP) as compared to supine positioning reduce intubation or mortality?

Background

During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with the spread of non-invasive respiratory support strategies in the wards and ICUs, so-called "awake proning" in non-mechanically ventilated patients was often performed and became the focus of several clinical trials. Indeed, all the high-quality evidence from RCTs derived from studies enrolling only COVID-19 patients.

### Physiological effects of awake prone position in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [^976efd4e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In intubated patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, prone positioning reduces intrapulmonary shunt and generates lung recruitment, optimizes ventilation/perfusion matching, lowers alveolar dead space and reduces right ventricle afterload. Through all these mechanisms, prone positioning improves gas exchange and attenuates ventilator-induced lung injury. Robust evidence supports the systematic use of prone positioning to improve survival among intubated patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

In recent years, prone position has been proposed in non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, with positive effects on arterial oxygenation. A large randomized meta-trial and one observational study demonstrated that awake prone positioning in patients with hypoxemia due to COVID-19 reduces the need for endotracheal intubation and, possibly, mortality. However, other data did not confirm these findings and highlighted the possible risks related to intubation delays due to only transient oxygenation improvement produced by prone position.

Despite plenty of clinical data obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic, few available studies address the physiological effects of prone position in spontaneously breathing humans with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

We conducted a sequential, crossover trial to comprehensively evaluate the effects of awake prone positioning on gas exchange, effort-to-breathe, lung volumes and inflation pattern in adult patients with moderate-to-severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure undergoing high-flow nasal oxygen.

### Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1f6cae63]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study PROSEVA was published by Guerin C and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the PROSEVA study, the trial question was: what is the role of prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS? In the PROSEVA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PROSEVA study, the population was: 466 patients (148 female, 318 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication for prone positioning, lung transplantation, underlying disease with a life expectancy of < 1 year, or end-of-life decision before inclusion. In the PROSEVA study, the interventions were: n = 237 performing prone-positioning sessions (within the first hour after randomization for at least 16 consecutive hours) n = 229 standard supine positioning (remained in semirecumbent position). In the PROSEVA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 28 days (16% vs. 32.8%; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63). In the PROSEVA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death at 90 days (23.6% vs. 41%; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.67) Significant decrease in successful extubation at 90 day (80.5% vs. 65%; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.7). In the PROSEVA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in overall incidence of complications, with the exception of cardiac arrest, which was more common in the supine group. In the PROSEVA study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS, performing prone-positioning sessions were superior to standard supine positioning with respect to death at 28 days.

### COVID-19 lessons learned: prone positioning with and without invasive ventilation [^b9ef224b]. Respiratory Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Prone positioning (PP) has been used extensively for patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that PP was beneficial during the pandemic, as it improves oxygenation and might improve chances of survival, especially in those with a continuum of positive oxygenation responses to the procedure. Additionally, the pandemic drove innovation regarding PP, as it brought attention to awake PP (APP) and the value of an interdisciplinary team approach to PP during a pandemic. APP appears to be safe and effective at improving oxygenation; APP may also reduce the need for intubation in patients requiring advanced respiratory support like high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive ventilation. Teams specifically assembled for PP during a pandemic also appear useful and can provide needed assistance to bedside clinicians in the time of crisis. Complications associated with PP can be mitigated, and a multidisciplinary approach to reduce the incidence of complications is recommended.

### The effect of prone positioning on mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^29752192]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Patients with severe ARDS (defined as P/F ratio ≤ 100 mmHg) clearly benefit from PP.

- There is no demonstrated benefit of PP in patients with mild to moderate ARDS.

- Patients ventilated with a higher PEEP level (defined as PEEP ≥ 10 cmH 2 O) also benefit from PP. Because the results of this study do not allow a definitive explanation for these findings, no firm recommendations can be made regarding the use of PP based on PEEP level.

- In this study, we show that the PP duration matters. It is unclear whether this importance resulted from a dose response to PP or whether there existed a threshold daily PP duration that was required to obtain a benefit. The data suggest, however, that PP for < 12 h/day is less likely to be beneficial to patients.

### Prone position ventilation-induced oxygenation improvement as a valuable predictor of survival in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective observational study [^63b2e1c3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The overall mortality for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains approximately 45%. Moreover, over 15% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop pulmonary ARDS, which is the primary cause of death in these patients. Prone position ventilation (PPV) has been evaluated as a key strategy in managing severe ARDS patients. Studies have shown that 32.9% of patients with severe ARDS were treated with PPV, and this proportion was even higher in COVID-19 patients (77%). Early (within 36 h) and prolonged PPV can improve lung homogeneity, ventilation/perfusion ratios, and outcomes in patients with moderate to severe ARDS by reducing ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI).

However, irrationally prolonged PPV has been identified as a risk factor for mortality in severe ARDS patients, as it may delay the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Therefore, it is essential to monitor patients' responses to PPV treatment and accurately distinguish responders from non-responders early on. However, there are various definitions for prone positioning responders. Some studies have defined PPV responders as patients whose PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) improved by 20% or 53.5% after PPV, while others defined PPV responders as those with a decrease in PaCO 2 of ≥ 1 mmHg. Existing studies have defined PPV responders and non-responders based solely on the changes in arterial blood gas after a single prone-positioning session. However, treatments targeting the etiology of ARDS may not take effect after the first PPV session. Therefore, predicting outcomes based solely on changes between baseline and the first PPV treatment may have limited clinical value. Furthermore, in clinical practice, PPV is often performed multiple times, even if oxygenation does not improve after previous sessions, as demonstrated in the PROSEVA trial. Additionally, under the framework of lung-protective ventilation, PPV is often performed with low tidal volume ventilation, which can result in hypercapnia.

Therefore, it is desirable to use a composite measure of PPV efficacy and identify an early turning point for escalating from PPV to ECMO. The objective of our study was to explore the relationship between oxygenation improvement after three rounds of PPV and survival in patients with pulmonary ARDS, in order to support clinical decision-making on PPV during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Prone positioning during venovenous ECMO for severe ARDS… [^5087fc78]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Care of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure receiving mechanical ventilation has advanced significantly in the last 25 years due to a focus on minimization of iatrogenic injury, largely ventilator-induced lung injury. In addition to limitation of tidal volumes and airway pressures, the use of prone positioning is a technique for lung protection. 1 Regional variability predisposes to overdistension of nondependent and cyclical opening and closing of dependent lung regions, which in turn drive ventilator-induced lung injury. 2 Prone-position ventilation induces changes in chest wall and respiratory system compliance, improving gas exchange and lung mechanics. Over a series of clinical trials, clinicians and scientists learned that longer daily application of prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia culminated in the large mortality reduction demonstrated in the PROSEVA trial.

3 Prone positioning improved oxygenation on average in that trial, but there was no association between changes in oxygenation and survival, further supporting that the main benefit of prone positioning is less ventilator-induced lung injury. 4 The use of routine prone positioning is strongly recommended in current clinical practice guidelines.

### Prone positioning of patients with moderate hypoxaemia due to COVID-19: multicentre pragmatic randomised trial (COVID-PRONE) [^c60f0921]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

To understand how longer duration of time spent prone is associated with our primary outcome, we did a post hoc exploratory analysis and compared outcomes at the sites with the highest adherence to prone positioning compared with the sites with the lowest adherence. We found no difference in the primary outcome at the sites with the highest adherence; however, our null finding might be related to lack of statistical power because of the relatively low number of overall events or because the longer duration of prone positioning may still be insufficient for a clinically important benefit. We also did a pre-planned subgroup analysis to identify how baseline hypoxaemia may affect the efficacy of prone positioning. In that analysis, we identified a lower risk of the primary outcome for patients randomised to prone positioning who needed 30% fraction of inspired oxygen or lower at the time of randomisation. This should be considered hypothesis generating, however, because of the low overall number of events, which increases the possibility of chance alone underlying our observed findings. Future studies are needed to identify whether this finding is replicable and robust across other protocols.

Mortality

Mortality (defined as overall mortality at the longest available follow-up) was significantly reduced with prone positioning (RR 0.9; 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96, 8 studies, 2141 patients) with very low quality of evidence supporting this RR. All trials demonstrated performance bias, because of the impossibility of blinding patients and carers with respect to the intervention. All trials also demonstrated detection bias, where outcome assessors were not blinded to intervention allocation. One RCT additionally demonstrated selection biasand three separate trials suffered from attrition biasaccording to the Cochrane risk of bias recommendations. Inconsistency was very serious, with varied point estimates, overlapping confidence intervals with high and significant levels of heterogeneity. There was also serious indirectness as the cohort of trials included subgroups receiving additional interventions known to demonstrate a mortality benefit.

Subgroup analysis demonstrated that prone positioning in combination with lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume ventilation, 6–8 mL/kg body weight) demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.86) compared with patients receiving prone positioning and no lung-protective ventilation (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.9 to 1.13), supported by moderate quality evidence. These findings may be influenced by inclusion of one trial enrolling a sizeable patient cohort with more severe ARDS (P/F ratio < 20 kPa, FiO 2 > 0.6)which showed larger differences in mortality rates between patients managed prone and supine in the setting of lung-protective ventilation.

Subgroup analysis based on the duration of prone positioning found that over 12 hours of prone positioning was associated with significantly reduced mortality (> 12 hour, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; < 12 hour, RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17), again supported by moderate quality evidence.

### Comparison of prone positioning and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d279d7c3]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Both prone position and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) have the potential to facilitate lung recruitment, and their combined use could thus be synergetic on gas exchange. Keeping the lung open could also potentially be lung protective. The aim of this study was to compare physiologic and proinflammatory effects of HFOV, prone positioning, or their combination in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Design

Prospective, comparative randomized study.

Setting

A medical intensive care unit.

Patients

Thirty-nine ARDS patients with a Pao2/Fio2 ratio < 150 mm Hg at positive end-expiratory pressure ≥ 5 cm H2O.

Interventions

After 12 hrs on conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight, plateau pressure not exceeding the upper inflection point, and a maximum of 35 cm H2O; supine-CV), 39 patients were randomized to receive one of the following 12-hr periods: conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation in prone position (prone-CV), HFOV in supine position (supine-HFOV), or HFOV in prone position (prone-HFOV).

Measurements and Main Results

Prone-CV (from 138 ± 58 mm Hg to 217 ± 110 mm Hg, p < .0001) and prone-HFOV (from 126 ± 40 mm Hg to 227 ± 64 mm Hg, p < 0.0001) improved the Pao2/Fio2 ratio whereas supine-HFOV did not alter the Pao2/Fio2 ratio (from 134 ± 57 mm Hg to 138 ± 48 mm Hg). The oxygenation index ({mean airway pressure x Fio2 x 100}/Pao2) decreased in the prone-CV and prone-HFOV groups and was lower than in the supine-HFOV group. Interleukin-8 increased significantly in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in supine-HFOV and prone-HFOV groups compared with prone-CV and supine-CV. Neutrophil counts were higher in the supine-HFOV group than in the prone-CV group.

Conclusions

Although HFOV in the supine position does not improve oxygenation or lung inflammation, the prone position increases oxygenation and reduces lung inflammation in ARDS patients. Prone-HFOV produced similar improvement in oxygenation like prone-CV but was associated with higher BALF indexes of inflammation. In contrast, supine-HFOV did not improve gas exchange and was associated with enhanced lung inflammation.

### Respiratory support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an expert opinion [^e6788b7c]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Prone positioning should be used in ARDS patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg unless contraindicated

Rationale and literature findings

Prone positioning — because of its beneficial effects on oxygenation, lung recruitment and stress distribution — should be considered in the early phase of ARDS in patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg, and when used should be applied for 16–20 hours per day.

The physiological effects of prone positioning include redistribution of lung densities, often with recruitment of well-perfused dorsal regions. Although prone positioning increases chest wall elastance, this change is usually accompanied by improved lung recruitment, a reduction in alveolar shunt and better ventilation/perfusion ratio, with a consequent improvement in oxygenation and CO 2 clearance, a more homogeneous distribution of ventilation and a reduction in VILI risk. Not all patients with ARDS benefit from prone positioning, and lung recruitment may be central to its value. An important recent study by Guerin et al. showed that prone positioning applied for at least 16 hours per day in patients with ARDS and PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 150 mmHg significantly reduced 28-day mortality (16% vs 32%). From currently available evidence, prone positioning may be of value even if there is no improvement in gas exchange.

Contraindications to prone positioning include the presence of an open abdominal wound, unstable pelvic fracture, spinal lesions and instability, and brain injury without monitoring of intracranial pressure. In addition, well-trained staff are required for its safe implementation.

### A multicenter trial of prolonged prone ventilation in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^3ac88696]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

Ventilation in the prone position for about 7 h/d in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, or acute respiratory failure does not decrease mortality. Whether it is beneficial to administer prone ventilation early, and for longer periods of time, is unknown.

Methods

We enrolled 136 patients within 48 h of tracheal intubation for severe ARDS, 60 randomized to supine and 76 to prone ventilation. Guidelines were established for ventilator settings and weaning. The prone group was targeted to receive continuous prone ventilation treatment for 20 h/d.

Results

The intensive care unit mortality was 58% (35/60) in the patients ventilated supine and 43% (33/76) in the patients ventilated prone (p = 0.12). The latter had a higher simplified acute physiology score II at inclusion. Multivariate analysis showed that simplified acute physiology score II at inclusion (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; p < 0.001), number of days elapsed between ARDS diagnosis and inclusion (OR, 2.83; p < 0.001), and randomization to supine position (OR, 2.53; p = 0.03) were independent risk factors for mortality. A total of 718 turning procedures were done, and prone position was applied for a mean of 17 h/d for a mean of 10 d. A total of 28 complications were reported, and most were rapidly reversible.

Conclusion

Prone ventilation is feasible and safe, and may reduce mortality in patients with severe ARDS when it is initiated early and applied for most of the day.

### Evaluation of PEEP and prone positioning in early COVID-19 ARDS [^2a84e4d5]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, we demonstrate that patients with early COVID-19 ARDS can benefit in terms of oxygenation from mechanical ventilation with high PEEP as well as from prone positioning. Our findings provide evidence that may help guide intensivists in the treatment of early COVID-19 ARDS, and lend support to the pointed statement by Rice and Janzthat we should be cautious in withholding proven beneficial therapeutic strategies (e.g. PEEP and prone position) without evidence for patients with COVID-19 ARDS despite its remarkably unique nature.

### Prone positioning of nonintubated patients with COVID-19 [^6e29dd98]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Epidemiological data on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), are quickly emerging. As the pandemic progresses, scarce resources (e.g. ICU beds and mechanical ventilators) may become a rate-limiting factor in the care for these patients. Therefore, therapies to prevent the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation are desperately needed.

A recent study describing the respiratory physiology of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19–associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) showed low respiratory system compliance in the supine position; however, prone positioning increased lung recruitment and improved oxygenation. Given the physiological benefits of prone positioning, we hypothesized that patients with COVID-19 and respiratory distress, not yet intubated but at high risk for intubation, might benefit from prone positioning. We conducted a retrospective review of our experience proning a clinical series of nonintubated patients.

### Prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [^12154cac]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Prone positioning is a technique used to help patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome breathe better. Widespread inflammation in the lungs may result in a life-threatening condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe infections such as coronavirus disease 2019 and influenza can cause ARDS. Breathing can be difficult for patients with ARDS. Hospitalized patients typically lie on their backs, a position known as supine. In prone positioning, patients lie on their abdomen in a monitored setting. Prone positioning is generally used for patients who require a ventilator. Prone positioning may be beneficial for several reasons: In the supine position, the lungs are compressed by the heart and abdominal organs.

Gas exchange, the process of trading carbon dioxide for oxygen, is reduced in areas of collapsed lung, resulting in low oxygen levels. In the prone position, lung compression is less, improving lung function. The body has mechanisms to adjust blood flow to different portions of the lung. In ARDS, an imbalance between blood and air flow develops, leading to poor gas exchange. Prone positioning redistributes blood and air flow more evenly, reducing this imbalance and improving gas exchange. With improved lung function in the prone position, less support from the ventilator is needed to achieve adequate oxygen levels. This may reduce risk of ventilator-induced lung injury, which occurs from overinflation and excess stretching of certain portions of the lung. Prone positioning may improve heart function in some patients. In the prone position, blood return to the chambers on the right side of the heart increases and constriction of the blood vessels of the lung decreases.

This may help the heart pump better, resulting in improved oxygen delivery to the body. Because the mouth and nose are facing down in the prone position, secretions produced by the disease process in the lung may drain better. Placement of Patients in the Prone Position Movement of patients to a prone position involves risk of serious complications such as a dislodged breathing tube or very low blood pressure. A team of trained clinicians, including respiratory therapists, nurses, and a physician, are necessary to safely reposition a patient. Most hospitals maintain patients in a prone position for at least 12 hours per day, though practices vary. Proning sessions continue until there is a sustained improvement in oxygen levels, or if proning does not improve oxygen levels.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^fc4241b3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine guideline — mechanical ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — states that the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O); for patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d; and for patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers. Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

### Mechanical ventilation in ARDS: a state-of-the-art review [^96ed7be0]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation is an essential component of the care of patients with ARDS, and a large number of randomized controlled clinical trials have now been conducted evaluating the efficacy and safety of various methods of mechanical ventilation for the treatment of ARDS. Low tidal volume ventilation (≤ 6 mL/kg predicted body weight) should be utilized in all patients with ARDS as it is the only method of mechanical ventilation that, to date, has been shown to improve survival. High positive end-expiratory pressure, alveolar recruitment maneuvers, and prone positioning may each be useful as rescue therapy in a patient with severe hypoxemia, but these methods of ventilation do not improve survival for the wide population of patients with ARDS. Although not specific to the treatment of ARDS, protocol-driven weaning that utilizes a daily spontaneous breathing trial and ventilation in the semirecumbent position have proven benefits and should be used in the management of ARDS patients.

### Awake prone positioning in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19: the PROFLO multicenter randomized clinical trial [^3620e3ad]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effect of awake prone positioning on intubation rates is not established. The aim of this trial was to investigate if a protocol for awake prone positioning reduces the rate of endotracheal intubation compared with standard care among patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation for respiratory support and a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio ≤ 20 kPa were randomly assigned to a protocol targeting 16 h prone positioning per day or standard care. The primary endpoint was intubation within 30 days. Secondary endpoints included duration of awake prone positioning, 30-day mortality, ventilator-free days, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, use of noninvasive ventilation, organ support and adverse events. The trial was terminated early due to futility.

Results

Of 141 patients assessed for eligibility, 75 were randomized of whom 39 were allocated to the control group and 36 to the prone group. Within 30 days after enrollment, 13 patients (33%) were intubated in the control group versus 12 patients (33%) in the prone group (HR 1.01 (95% CI 0.46–2.21), P = 0.99). Median prone duration was 3.4 h [IQR 1.8–8.4] in the control group compared with 9.0 h per day [IQR 4.4–10.6] in the prone group (P = 0.014). Nine patients (23%) in the control group had pressure sores compared with two patients (6%) in the prone group (difference − 18% (95% CI − 2 to − 33%); P = 0.032). There were no other differences in secondary outcomes between groups.

Conclusions

The implemented protocol for awake prone positioning increased duration of prone positioning, but did not reduce the rate of intubation in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 compared to standard care.

### Lung physiological changes during awake prone positioning in non-intubated hypoxemia patients [^7b8d82db]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, the current study showed that awake prone positioning improved outcome in patients with mild hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≥ 200 mmHg), which is different from the current consensus that prone positioning only exhibits benefit in severe ARF patients receiving mechanical ventilation. As described above, previous evidence suggests that lung physiology changes during prone positioning largely depend on advanced respiratory support, such as invasive/non-invasive mechanical ventilation, HFNC, etc. However, in the current study, more than 95% of patients received conventional oxygen therapy. Thus, we infer that the benefits of the awake prone position in patients with mild hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≥ 200 mmHg) may not be through the typical physiological changes (such as improving ventilation–perfusion matching, increasing end-expiratory lung volume, more uniform distribution of tidal volume, and alterations in chest wall mechanics), but rather through improved lung ventilation by promoting sputum excretion.

Finally, we thank Dr. Nay et al. for their outstanding job, and we suggest that more research is needed to explore the different mechanisms of prone ventilation in intubated and non-intubated patients with ARF.

### Effect of prone position on ventilation-perfusion matching in patients with moderate to severe ARDS with different clinical phenotypes [^214308ff]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Concerning the use of EIT, this study has provided some detailed evidence about the effects of PP during mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients with different subphenotypes. The main findings of our study are as follows: (1) Prone positioning rapidly improved oxygenation and ventilation-perfusion matching for focal ARDS patients or low D-dimer ARDS patients and the effects were sustained for at least 12 h, whereas patients in the non-focal ARDS group or high D-dimer ARDS group required a minimum of 6 h for significant enhancements in oxygenation and ventilation-perfusion matching. (2) For overall ARDS, prone positioning can reduce shunts, decrease dead space, and increase ventilation-perfusion matching, thereby improving oxygenation. (3) For focal ARDS patients, prone positioning for 3 h may improve oxygenation by reducing shunts and increasing ventilation-perfusion matching; for non-focal ARDS patients, prone positioning for 6 h simultaneously reduces the amount of dead space and shunts, resulting in increased ventilation, perfusion and oxygenation. (4) In patients with low D-dimer ARDS, prone positioning for 3 h can reduce shunts and improve oxygenation; in high D-dimer ARDS, prone positioning for 6 h can reduce dead space and shunts, increase ventilation-perfusion matching, and improve oxygenation.

### Physiologic effects of prone positioning on gas exchange and ventilation-perfusion matching in awake patients with AHRF [^1a2e92bc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) improves oxygenation in awake patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear in patients with diverse lung morphology. We aimed to determine the short-term effects of awake prone positioning (APP) in AHRF patients with focal and non-focal lung morphology.

Methods

This is a prospective physiological study. Twenty-four non-intubated patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 300 mm Hg were included. Gas exchange, ventilation and perfusion distribution, and hemodynamics variables were recorded in the supine position (SP1), 2 h after PP, and 1 h after re-supine (SP2). Lung morphology was classified as focal and non-focal patterns using computed tomography.

Results

Twelve of the included patients were classified to the focal group and 12 to the non-focal group. PaO 2 /FiO 2 improved after PP in all patients (161 [137, 227] mmHg vs. 236 [202, 275] mmHg, p < 0.001). Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching increased after PP in all patients (61.9 [53.9, 66.5] vs. 77.5 [68.3, 80.0], p < 0.001). Shunt exhibited a significant decrease in patients of the non-focal group (28.6 [22.5, 30.3] vs. 11.3 [9.0, 14.5], p < 0.001), whereas no difference was found in the focal group after PP. Dead space decreased significantly in patients of the focal group (25.6 [21.5, 28.4] vs. 12.0 [10.8, 14.1], p < 0.001), whereas no difference was found in the non-focal group after PP.

Conclusions

APP improves V/Q matching, and large-scale, bias-free studies are needed to find more definitive differences between patients with focal and non-focal lung morphyology.

### Effects of prone positioning on ARDS outcomes of trauma and surgical patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c94be774]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone position is an option for rescue therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there are limited relevant data among trauma and surgical patients, who may be at increased risk for complications following position changes. This study aimed to identify the benefits and risks of proning in this patient subgroup.

Methods

Follow the PRISMA 2020, MEDLINE and EMBASE database searches were conducted. Additional search of relevant primary literature and review articles was also performed. A random effects model was used to estimate the PF ratio, mortality rate, mechanical ventilator days, and intensive care unit length of stay using Review Manager 5.4.1 software.

Results

Of 1,128 studies, 15 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The prone position significantly improved the PF ratio compared with the supine position (mean difference, 79.26; 95% CI, 53.38 to 105.13). The prone position group had a statistically significant mortality benefit (risk ratio [RR], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.67). Although there was no significant difference in the intensive care unit length of stay, the prone position significantly decreased mechanical ventilator days (-2.59; 95% CI, -4.21 to -0.97). On systematic review, minor complications were frequent, especially facial edema. There were no differences in local wound complications.

Conclusions

The prone position has comparable complications to the supine position. With its benefits of increased oxygenation and decreased mortality, the prone position can be considered for trauma and surgical patients. A prospective multicenter study is warranted.

Regarding respiratory support for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to awake prone positioning, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider awake prone positioning of severely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen (includes high-flow nasal cannula) or noninvasive ventilation.

### Prone position versus usual care in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients in medical wards: a randomised controlled trial [^d528e3ca]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Benefit of early awake prone positioning for COVID-19 patients hospitalised in medical wards and who need oxygen therapy remains to be demonstrated. The question was considered at the time of COVID-19 pandemic to avoid overloading the intensive care units. We aimed to determine whether prone position plus usual care could reduce the rate of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or intubation or death as compared to usual care alone.

Methods

In this multicentre randomised clinical trial, 268 patients were randomly assigned to awake prone position plus usual care (N = 135) or usual care alone (N = 132). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who underwent NIV or intubation or died within 28days. Main secondary outcomes included the rates of NIV, of intubation or death, within 28days.

Results

Median time spent each day in the prone position within 72h of randomisation was 90min (IQR 30–133). The proportion of NIV or intubation or death within 28days was 14.1% (19/135) in the prone position group and 12.9% (17/132) in the usual care group [odds ratio adjusted for stratification (aOR) 0.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14–1.35]. The probability of intubation, or intubation or death (secondary outcomes) was lower in the prone position group than in the usual care group (aOR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01–0.89 and aOR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01–0.76, respectively) in the whole study population and in the prespecified subgroup of patients with SpO 2 ≥ 95% on inclusion (aOR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01–0.90, and aOR 0.09; 95% CI 0.03–0.27, respectively).

Conclusions

Awake prone position plus usual care in COVID-19 patients in medical wards did not decrease the composite outcome of need for NIV or intubation or death. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04363463. Registered 27 April 2020.
