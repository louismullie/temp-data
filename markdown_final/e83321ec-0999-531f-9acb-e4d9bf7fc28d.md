## Question

A 68-year-old woman with a history of postmenopausal osteoporosis presents for follow-up. She is currently taking alendronate and calcium supplements. Her most recent laboratory results show a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 22 ng/mL. She has no history of kidney stones or hypercalcemia. She is otherwise healthy, with a BMI of 32 kg/m². She reports good adherence to her medications and denies gastrointestinal symptoms.

Based on current AACE guidelines, what is the most appropriate approach to vitamin D supplementation for this patient? Specify the target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the recommended daily dose of vitamin D3, and any considerations for dose adjustment in her case.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate approach to vitamin D supplementation for a 68-year-old woman with postmenopausal osteoporosis, including the target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the recommended daily dose of vitamin D3, and dose adjustment considerations given her BMI of 32 kg/m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline context and whether AACE/ACE 2020 applies. Then, I should verify the current vitamin D status and how AACE defines insufficiency/deficiency. Next, I will determine the AACE-recommended target range and whether it differs from other societies. After that, I need to calculate the initial daily dose and account for obesity-related attenuation of response. Finally, I should plan monitoring, safety checks, and reconcile any conflicting guidance from other organizations.

> Let me first confirm the guideline anchor. For postmenopausal osteoporosis, the most authoritative, condition-specific guidance is the AACE/ACE 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines, which explicitly recommend maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at or above 30 ng/mL, with a preferable range of 30–50 ng/mL, and to use vitamin D3 supplementation when needed to achieve this target [^1113qXWH] [^1141FgRx].

> Wait, let me verify the current status and definitions. Her 25(OH)D of 22 ng/mL falls within AACE's definition of insufficiency (20–29 ng/mL), below the minimum target of 30 ng/mL, and well above the deficiency threshold of less than 20 ng/mL, so repletion is indicated but not urgent loading unless there are special circumstances, which are not present here [^1141FgRx] [^11742Qf2].

> I should confirm the target next. AACE recommends a serum 25(OH)D target of ≥ 30 ng/mL, with a preferable maintenance range of 30–50 ng/mL in patients with osteoporosis; this is a Grade A recommendation with BEL 1, reflecting strong evidence and consensus for this population [^1113qXWH] [^1141FgRx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about dose. I initially thought a standard 1,000–2,000 IU/day would suffice, but I need to check obesity-related attenuation. AACE advises that higher doses may be necessary in obesity, older age, and malabsorption; multiple studies show that individuals with higher BMI have lower baseline 25(OH)D and a blunted response to supplementation, with about a 20–30% smaller increment per unit dose in those with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m², so I should adjust upward in this patient [^1141FgRx] [^117ErEyE] [^114etgfT].

> Let me calculate a reasonable starting dose. A pragmatic approach is to begin at 2,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 and plan to reassess in about 3 months; if 25(OH)D remains below 30 ng/mL, I would increase to 3,000–4,000 IU/day, recognizing that doses up to 4,000 IU/day are generally within the tolerable upper intake level and that AACE allows consideration of higher doses in obesity and older age, with clinical judgment and periodic monitoring [^1141FgRx] [^114yagep] [^114H11RH].

> I need to ensure the formulation and regimen are aligned with best practice. AACE prefers cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) over ergocalciferol (D2) for supplementation, and daily dosing is favored over intermittent bolus dosing for maintenance because of more stable serum levels and better safety profile in older adults; I should avoid large intermittent bolus doses unless there is a compelling indication and careful monitoring [^11742Qf2] [^113cP2er] [^114yagep].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I will recheck 25(OH)D in about 3 months to gauge response and titrate the dose; routine calcium monitoring is not required in otherwise healthy patients, but I should confirm there is no history of hypercalcemia or kidney stones and counsel on symptoms of hypercalcemia. If she were to start potent antiresorptives like denosumab or zoledronic acid, I would check vitamin D and calcium beforehand and monitor per protocol, but with oral bisphosphonate therapy and adequate calcium intake, routine calcium checks are not mandated solely for vitamin D repletion [^113cP2er] [^1141FgRx].

> But wait, what if I am overemphasizing a 30 ng/mL target when other guidelines accept 20 ng/mL as adequate for bone health in the general population? I should double-check the context. The Endocrine Society and IOM acknowledge that 20 ng/mL meets population needs for many adults, yet AACE specifically recommends ≥ 30 ng/mL for patients with osteoporosis because of the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the need to optimize calcium absorption and bone outcomes in this high-risk group; thus, the higher target is appropriate here despite differing thresholds in general-population guidance [^116qeCNX] [^1159T71R] [^1113qXWH].

> Final recommendation: I would start cholecalciferol 2,000 IU daily now, continue her calcium intake to meet a total of about 1,000–1,200 mg/day from diet plus supplements, recheck 25(OH)D in 3 months, and titrate to 3,000–4,000 IU/day if she remains below 30 ng/mL, with a hard ceiling of 4,000 IU/day unless a specialist directs otherwise; I will avoid intermittent bolus dosing and maintain follow-up to ensure she reaches and stays within the 30–50 ng/mL range while on ongoing osteoporosis therapy [^1141FgRx] [^1113qXWH] [^114yagep] [^114H11RH].

Per AACE 2020, the target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in postmenopausal osteoporosis is **≥ 30 ng/mL** (preferably 30–50 ng/mL) [^1113qXWH]. For this patient with a BMI of 32 kg/m², the recommended daily vitamin D3 dose is **2,000 IU**, with consideration of **3,000–4,000 IU** if needed to reach the target, given obesity-related reduced absorption and sequestration in adipose tissue [^1141FgRx] [^117ErEyE]. Recheck 25(OH)D in 3 months and adjust the dose accordingly; avoid exceeding 4,000 IU/day without supervision [^114yagep].

---

## Target serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level

AACE recommends maintaining **serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL** (75 nmol/L) in patients with osteoporosis, with a preferable range of 30–50 ng/mL (75–125 nmol/L) [^1113qXWH] [^1141FgRx]. This target balances skeletal benefits — including improved calcium absorption, secondary hyperparathyroidism prevention, and fracture risk reduction — with safety considerations [^115yaYpm].

---

## Recommended daily vitamin D3 dose

The standard maintenance dose of vitamin D3 for osteoporosis is **1,000–2,000 IU/day** [^1113qXWH]. Given this patient's obesity (BMI 32 kg/m²), a higher dose is often required because adipose tissue sequesters vitamin D, reducing its bioavailability and increasing requirements [^117ErEyE] [^113qUrfH]. Therefore, an initial dose of **2,000 IU/day** is appropriate, with consideration of **3,000–4,000 IU/day** if 25(OH)D remains below 30 ng/mL after 3 months [^1141FgRx] [^114AkNam].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose adjustment in obesity

Obesity is associated with lower baseline 25(OH)D and a blunted response to supplementation; higher doses are often needed to achieve the same serum level as non-obese individuals [^117ErEyE] [^114etgfT]. Clinical studies show that individuals with obesity require approximately **1.5–2 times more vitamin D** than those with normal BMI to achieve the same 25(OH)D level [^114AkNam].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

- **Recheck 25(OH)D**: Measure 3 months after starting or changing the dose to assess response and guide further adjustment [^114AkNam].
- **Dose titration**: Increase to 3,000–4,000 IU/day if 25(OH)D remains < 30 ng/mL, then recheck in 3 months.
- **Upper limit**: Do not exceed 4,000 IU/day without medical supervision due to potential risks of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria [^114yagep] [^1156xH9f].

---

## Safety considerations

Vitamin D3 is generally safe at recommended doses; monitor for **hypercalcemia** or **hypercalciuria** if high doses are used or if symptoms develop. No routine calcium monitoring is required in asymptomatic patients on standard doses [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Target serum 25(OH)D | ≥ 30 ng/mL (preferably 30–50 ng/mL) |
| Initial vitamin D3 dose | 2,000 IU/day |
| Dose adjustment in obesity | Consider 3,000–4,000 IU/day if 25(OH)D < 30 ng/mL after 3 months |
| Monitoring | Recheck 25(OH)D in 3 months; titrate dose accordingly |
| Upper limit | ≤ 4,000 IU/day without supervision |

---

The most appropriate approach is to **start vitamin D3 at 2,000 IU/day**, recheck 25(OH)D in 3 months, and increase to 3,000–4,000 IU/day if needed to achieve and maintain ≥ 30 ng/mL, balancing efficacy and safety [^1141FgRx] [^1113qXWH].

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D and calcium supplementation: The IOM recommends 600 IU for women aged between 50 and 70 years and 800 IU daily for those aged older than 70 years, stating these intakes were sufficient to achieve serum 25-OHD levels of at least 20 ng/mL in most postmenopausal women, but meta-analyses report inconsistent fracture outcomes with most showing no benefit; in the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial bone health substudy, 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily for 24 months in healthy women (average age, 63 y; baseline serum 25-OHD 27.6 ng/mL) showed no effect overall or in those with baseline serum 25-OHD less than 30 ng/mL; salutary effects of vitamin D with calcium on fracture risk have been observed most often in institutionalized or vitamin D-deficient older adults; the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of daily vitamin D alone to prevent fractures and recommended against vitamin D supplements to prevent falls; women with osteoporosis do not require more calcium than those with normal bone mineral density (BMD), there is no convincing evidence that taking calcium and vitamin D supplements improves the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs, and adequate intakes of calcium and vitamin D are recommended when taking osteoporosis drugs to reduce the risk of treatment-induced hypocalcemia.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D assessment and therapy specify that an individual's vitamin D status is assessed by serum 25(OH)D, and adults who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient (serum 25[OH]D 20 to 29 or < 20 ng/mL, respectively) may receive 50,000 IU vitamin D2 or D3 weekly for 6 to 8 weeks to achieve a 25(OH)D blood level > 30 ng/mL; the above-noted replacement regimen should be followed by maintenance therapy of 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D3, daily. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) rather than vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) should be used for replacement, and a higher dose may be required in patients with obesity or malabsorption and those on medications affecting metabolism of vitamin D. Not every 25(OH)D assay measures 25(OH)D2 and, due to unequal cross-reactivity, many current assays are inaccurate if there is a significant amount of 25(OH)D2; therefore, use of an appropriate assay, generally one performed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry that accurately quantifies both 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2, is essential, and in patients with active granulomatous disease, replacement of vitamin D must be undertaken with caution due to risk for hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia.

### Optimal vitamin D status: a critical analysis on the basis of evidence-based medicine [^114aveQL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Public health authorities around the world recommend widely variable supplementation strategies for adults, whereas several professional organizations, including The Endocrine Society, recommend higher supplementation.

Methods

We analyzed published randomized controlled clinical trials to define the optimal intake or vitamin D status for bone and extraskeletal health.

Conclusions

The extraskeletal effects of vitamin D are plausible as based on preclinical data and observational studies. However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The greatest risk for cancer, infections, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is associated with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels below 20 ng/mL. There is ample evidence from RCTs that calcium and bone homeostasis, estimated from serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH, calcium absorption, or bone mass, can be normalized by 25OHD levels above 20 ng/mL. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation (800 IU/d) in combination with calcium can reduce fracture incidence by about 20%. Such a dose will bring serum levels of 25OHD above 20 ng/mL in nearly all postmenopausal women. Based on calculations of the metabolic clearance of 25OHD, a daily intake of 500–700 IU of vitamin D3 is sufficient to maintain serum 25OHD levels of 20 ng/mL. Therefore, the recommendations for a daily intake of 1500–2000 IU/d or serum 25OHD levels of 30 ng or higher for all adults or elderly subjects, as suggested by The Endocrine Society Task Force, are premature. Fortunately, ongoing RCTs will help to guide us to solve this important public health question.

LeBoff et al. reported the results of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT carried out among men ⩾50 and women ⩾55 years. After 2 years of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/day) there was no effect on BMD at the spine, femoral neck, total hip, or whole body. In this population, the effect did not vary by sex, ethnicity, or body mass index (BMI). This study was designed to study the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cancer risk. Mean baseline 25(OH)D levels were 30.8 ± 10.0 ng/ml, about 87% of treated subjects had normal 25(OH)D levels, and most of the supplemented subjects attained serum 25(OH)D levels of 40 ng/ml or more after the first year of follow up. In other words, nearly 87% of the treated subjects had normal 25(OH)D levels. No data were disclosed on the number of subjects with severe 25(OH)D insufficiency (< 10 ng/ml). Therefore, it seems we cannot expect that supplementation with 25(OH)D levels ⩾20 ng/ml will have benefit on bone metabolism.

Vitamin D and fracture risk

Although there is some controversy, combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation has been recommended to prevent osteoporosis and subsequent fracture risk. However, some clinicians are reluctant to use calcium supplements. In addition, some RCTs have reported conflicting results regarding optimal doses and regimens of supplementation. In one meta-analysis of clinical trials, Bolland et al. found that vitamin D supplementation does not prevent falls and fractures and has no significant effect on BMD. Nonetheless, subjects that had 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml achieved a significant increase in lumbar BMD with daily doses of 400 IU and 1000 IU, and in hip BMD with a daily dose of 1000 IU. Furthermore, 70% of the trials used low daily doses of vitamin D which seem not to be enough to promote a sufficient level of circulating 25(OH)D. Other limitations in the Bolland et al. meta-analysis have been related to the method used to measure 25(OH)D, the influence of ethnicity, and the possible presence of the 'so-called' p -hacking effect of meta-analytic procedures. –

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, mortality, and incident cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cancers, and fractures: a 13-y prospective population study [^114Mykw5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Substantial debate continues as to what optimal vitamin D status might be above low blood concentrations associated with deficiency and bone diseases. An Institute of Medicine report set serum 25(OH)D cutoffs of increased risk of deficiency at < 30 nmol/L, adequacy at > 50 nmol/L, and increased risk of excess at > 125 nmol/L on the basis of reviews that suggested a reverse J curve for overall mortality with highest risk from low vitamin D (< 30 nmol/L), lower risk between vitamin D concentrations of 30–60 nmol/L, with risk increasing again at higher concentrations [> 75 nmol/L in whites and > 60 nmol in African Americans and adverse outcomes with serum 25(OH)D concentration > 125 nmol/L]. Although the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Arthritis stated that, above a serum threshold of 50 nmol/L for 25(OH)D concentrations, there is no clear evidence for additional benefits of supplementation, they indicated that, in fragile elderly subjects at elevated risk of falls and fractures, a minimal serum 25(OH)D concentration of 75 nmol/L is recommended.

Randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation have not provided conclusive evidence. A review of 56 randomized trials with 95286 participants that examined vitamin D at any dose, duration, and route of administration observed that vitamin D in the form of vitamin D 3 seems to decrease mortality in predominantly elderly women who are mainly in institutional care but otherwise concluded that the available evidence on vitamin D supplementation and mortality is inconclusive. A similar debate applies to vitamin D–supplementation trials for prevention of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and other health outcomes (,–).

Some of the uncertainty has been attributed variously to the heterogeneity in the baseline vitamin D status of the populations studied, uncertain compliance, different modes of administration of vitamin D because oral compared with intramuscular administration or small daily doses compared with infrequent bolus doses result in very different blood concentrations, different forms of vitamin D administered because different isomers such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2) are postulated to have different biological potency and effects, possible interactions with other nutrients such as dietary or supplemental calcium, and low power for mortality. Many trials have focused on high-risk groups such as trials of the prevention of fractures in the very old or individuals with osteoporosis, and the largest trial to date, the Women's Health Initiative, was conducted only in postmenopausal women.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114xwr92]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessment of Vitamin D Status

To date, total serum 25(OH)D, the sum of 25(OH)D 3 and 25(OH)D 2, is the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status (Fig. 2). Observational studies have indicated the beneficial effects of an optimal vitamin D status on various outcomes not directly associated with the classical target tissues for the hormone — the so-called pleiotropic effects. Based on these studies, mostly using traditional radioimmunoassay measurements, vitamin D guidelines issued by major organizations worldwide recommend optimal 25(OH)D levels to be in the range of 50 to 75 nmol/L (20–30 ng/mL). However, optimal levels are still debated for several reasons. Lack of assay standardization contributes to the problem, and initiatives should be implemented to overcome it. In this perspective, the Endocrine Society (ES) has asked a task force to review its 2011 guidelines.

Figure 2.
Overview of vitamin D metabolism. The figure shows metabolism of vitamin D in physiologic and deficient status, with specific reference to conditions in which vitamin D should be evaluated.

Differences in the suggested optimal serum 25(OH)D levels depend on several factors. It is essential to clarify what is meant by optimal 25(OH)D level, that is, for whom and for what, as it is essential to consider patients' clinical profiles and the outcomes of interest. Many studies have been performed with a focus on osteoporosis and bone metabolism. Recently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed potential pleiotropic effects of 25(OH)D, in general, with negative results. Another pivotal factor in deciding optimal 25(OH)D levels is the perspective used. For example, although the outcomes used to derive desirable 25(OH)D levels were similar for the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 2011 ES guidelines, most studies included conclusions that differed. For example, in the case of osteomalacia, although the same study was used, conclusions differed. This is because the ES selected a cutoff above which no individual had osteomalacia (clinical perspective), whereas IOM chose a cutoff where 97.5% of the cohort did not have osteomalacia (public health perspective). Finally, when discussing vitamin D status assessment, it is also important to differentiate between screening, that is, a public health approach undertaken in the general populations, and testing, that is, targeted testing of high-risk individuals in the clinical setting.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — vitamin D intake and dosing patterns emphasize that many scientific organizations recommend intake of at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day for adults aged 50 years and older, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (now the National Academy of Medicine [NAM]) suggest 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day as the safe upper limit in the general population; a meta-analysis in postmenopausal women found fracture reduction at doses of 700 to 800 IU/day or more. In frail elderly adults, monthly bolus regimens including 24,000 IU of vitamin D3, 60,000 IU of vitamin D3, or 24,000 IU of vitamin D3 plus 300 μg of calcifediol were associated with increased falls, supporting that caution should be used with bolus dosing, and single, larger annual bolus doses are also not recommended where 500,000 IU of vitamin D3 was given annually in women with risk factors for hip fracture (median age of 76 years and baseline median 25(OH)D level of 21 ng/mL). Mechanistically, a single vitamin D3 dose of 150,000 IU led to greater 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 than daily dosing of 5,000 IU for 1 month.

OSTEOPOROSIS

Vitamin D and Fractures

Prevention of Nonvertebral Fractures with Oral Vitamin D and Dose Dependency: Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

What was known?.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in older adults, homebound individuals and women admitted with hip fracture. The association between vitamin D levels and fracture risk has been inconsistent, although a recent well done case-control study showed that women with lower serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels had a higher fracture risk than women with higher levels and there was a dose response effect. Although women are frequently treated for vitamin D deficiency, it has not been known whether vitamin D supplementation prevents non-vertebral and hip fractures.

What this study adds.

This well-done meta-analysis included twelve studies that evaluated vitamin D supplementation and reported at least one fracture. Studies had to be double-blind with at least one year of follow-up and data on adherence. Participants took either cholecalciferol (D 3) or ergocalciferol (D 2). Vitamin D doses > 400 IU per day reduced nonvertebral and hip fractures but lower doses did not. The overall reduction was relatively small (RR = 0.86, 95%CI 0.77–0.96) for nonvertebral fractures. The addition of calcium did not enhance the effect of Vitamin D. In addition, the anti-fracture efficacy was higher with higher achieved 25-OH vitamin D levels.

How should I change my practice?.

Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation have typically targeted the goal of achieving a particular 25-OH-vitamin D level, rather than a clinical outcome. We now know that vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk and should be considered for women with osteoporosis and potentially osteopenia. Further study is needed to clarify when supplementation should begin and whether there is added value to co-treatment with calcium and/or bisphosphonates.

### Dose response to vitamin D supplementation in postmenopausal women: a randomized trial [^115hAsay]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH]D) is considered the best biomarker of clinical vitamin D status.

Objective

To determine the effect of increasing oral doses of vitamin D(3) on serum 25-(OH)D and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in postmenopausal white women with vitamin D insufficiency (defined as a 25-[OH]D level ≤ 50 nmol/L) in the presence of adequate calcium intake. These results can be used as a guide to estimate the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) (defined as meeting the needs of 97.5% of the population) for vitamin D(3).

Design

Randomized, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00472823)

Setting

Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.

Participants

163 healthy postmenopausal white women with vitamin D insufficiency enrolled in the winter or spring of 2007 to 2008 and followed for 1 year.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or vitamin D(3), 400, 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, 4000, or 4800 IU once daily. Daily calcium supplements were provided to increase the total daily calcium intake to 1200 to 1400 mg.

Measurements

The primary outcomes were 25-(OH)D and PTH levels at 6 and 12 months.

Results

The mean baseline 25-(OH)D level was 39 nmol/L. The dose response was curvilinear and tended to plateau at approximately 112 nmol/L in patients receiving more than 3200 IU/d of vitamin D(3). The RDA of vitamin D(3) to achieve a 25-(OH)D level greater than 50 nmol/L was 800 IU/d. A mixed-effects model predicted that 600 IU of vitamin D(3) daily could also meet this goal. Compared with participants with a normal body mass index (< 25 kg/m²), obese women (≥ 30 kg/m²) had a 25-(OH)D level that was 17.8 nmol/L lower. Parathyroid hormone levels at 12 months decreased with an increasing dose of vitamin D(3) (P = 0.012). Depending on the criteria used, hypercalcemia occurred in 2.8% to 9.0% and hypercalciuria in 12.0% to 33.0% of participants; events were unrelated to dose.

Limitation

Findings may not be generalizable to other age groups or persons with substantial comorbid conditions.

Conclusion

A vitamin D(3) dosage of 800 IU/d increased serum 25-(OH)D levels to greater than 50 nmol/L in 97.5% of women; however, a model predicted the same response with a vitamin D(3) dosage of 600 IU/d. These results can be used as a guide for the RDA of vitamin D(3), but prospective trials are needed to confirm the clinical significance of these results.

Testing populations at risk of vitamin D deficiency — clinical approach

Measurement of 25(OH)D has been recommended in patients at risk for deficiency (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Thus, 25(OH)D is widely measured in many of these high-risk groups, for example, in older adults with decreased endogenous vitamin D production and prone to develop osteoporosis, in patients with parathyroid disorders and liver disease, and in patients with obesity. Patients with class III obesity (BMI > 40) present with low levels of 25(OH)D for various reasons, including nutritional factors, psychological reasons leading to less sun exposure, decreased hepatic expression of CYP2R1, and sequestration of the vitamin in the excess adipose tissue. Class III obesity may be addressed by bariatric surgery, which, by itself, may lead to malabsorption and, thereby, a further decrease of 25(OH)D levels, potentially followed by a secondary hyperparathyroidism. Other at-risk groups include those who are housebound, those working long hours indoors, dark-skinned individuals, patients with a chronic disease, those taking medications increasing vitamin D catabolism, etc (see Table 1). Paradoxically, listing situations where it may be reasonable to measure 25(OH)D accounts for most people. This would again result in overtesting with high costs for the health care system. Rather than testing in situations where it would be reasonable to, it would be better to test only in situations that actually warrant it. It comes down to the providers' judgment in first recognizing these high-risk individuals and then deciding to confirm with a measurement of 25(OH)D. There is, in fact, little evidence for the scientific utility and cost-effectiveness of testing for 25(OH)D deficiency, even in some of these selected groups. For example, some guidelines have recommended against screening pregnant women for vitamin D deficiency because of uncertainty about the benefits of vitamin D supplementation for maternal and fetal outcomes. However, a case can be made for optimizing vitamin D status in all pregnant or breastfeeding women and their offspring, given the reemerging public health concern of rickets in high-risk children and potential benefits on future peak bone mass. Evidence of a relationship between low 25(OH)D and adverse maternal outcomes together with evidence that these adverse outcomes (eg, risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, low birthweight, and the risk of severe postpartum hemorrhage) are reduced after vitamin D supplementation have also been shown. Poor vitamin D status has also been associated with increased risk of low birth weight, increased risk of preterm birth, and offspring's adverse anthropometric and neurodevelopmental outcomes, while supplementation or sufficient vitamin D status was found to be protective against the risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age, and associated with improved offspring vitamin D sufficiency status, reduced fetal or neonatal mortality, and improved fetal and future linear growth.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115QqUNi]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^115xGvi6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

USPSTF vitamin D and calcium supplementation in community-dwelling adults — fracture prevention evidence and RDAs — notes that for community-dwelling, postmenopausal women, the USPSTF "recommends against supplementation with 400 international units or less of vitamin D and 1,000 mg or less of calcium to prevent fractures because adequate evidence indicates that supplementation has no effect on fracture incidence", and it found "insufficient evidence on whether supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium, alone or combined, prevents fracture". Evidence synthesis from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 51,419 adults showed vitamin D alone had "no difference in hip fracture risk" (three RCTs, 5,496 participants; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.01%; 95% CI -0.80% to 0.78%), and vitamin D plus calcium had "no effect on the risk of total fractures" (one RCT, 36,282 participants; ARD -0.35%; 95% CI -1.02% to 0.31%) and hip fracture (two RCTs, 36,727 participants); the combination was "associated with an increased risk of kidney stones" (three RCTs, 39,213 participants; ARD, 0.33%; 95% CI 0.06%–0.60%). Recommended daily allowance (RDA) values are "1,000 mg per day from ages 19 to 50 years and 1,200 mg per day in older women" for calcium and "600 international units per day to age 70 years and 800 international units thereafter" for vitamin D; the "RDA of vitamin D is believed to maintain an adequate serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (20 ng/mL) in 97.5% of the population". For screening, the USPSTF concludes "the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults", and the Endocrine Society "advises that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening individuals who are not at risk of vitamin D deficiency".

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^113bBBGD]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The Kahwat et al. meta-analysis of RCTs or observational studies analyzed vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures among community - dwelling adults without known vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosis, or prior fracture. Supplementation with vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium was not associated with a reduction in fracture risk in studied subjects. Vitamin D with calcium was associated with an increase incidence of kidney stones.

Another more recent meta-analysiscompared vitamin D or vitamin D and calcium with controls. It was based on studies involving at least 200 fracture cases and RCTs enrolling at least 500 participants (59.9% women, mean age 77.1 years, baseline blood 25(OH)D levels ranging from 10.6 ng/ml to 26.3 ng/ml, and reporting at least 10 incident fractures). In 11 observational studies, the combined (vitamin D + calcium) supplementation was associated with an adjusted lower relative risk (RR) for any fracture (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.89–0.96) and for hip fracture (RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.75–0.86), for each increase in 10 ng/ml in serum 25(OH)D levels. Supplementation with vitamin D alone in 11 RCTs, with a mean serum 25(OH)D difference of 8.4 ng/ml, was not associated with a reduction in the risk of any fracture or hip fracture, although there were heterogeneous doses of vitamin D supplementation. Contrary to this, the meta-analysis of six RCTs of combined supplementation with vitamin D at daily doses of 400–800 IU/day (median serum difference of 25(OH)D 9.2 ng/ml) and calcium (1000–1200 mg/day) found a significant reduction (6%) for any fracture risk (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.89–0.99), and a 16% reduction for hip fracture risk (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.72–0.97).

### A 55-year-old woman with osteopenia [^114Z9bEx]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

About half of postmenopausal women have a bone density T score at the femoral neck between -1.0 and -2.5. Bone density in this range was termed "osteopenia" by a World Health Organization working group. Osteopenia is not a disease and the label can cause unnecessary anxiety. Osteopenia encompasses a wide range of fracture risks; an individual patient's risk can be estimated from her age, bone mineral density, and clinical risk factors. Regardless of bone mineral density, regular exercise and adherence with vitamin D and calcium intake may reduce the risk of hip fracture. Osteopenia by itself is not an indication for treatment. Decisions about pharmacological treatment to prevent fractures should be based on the patient's risk of fractures, evidence about the efficacy and nonskeletal effects of the specific treatment, and the patient's preferences.

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^112A5fAH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this review was to assess recent evidence regarding the effects of low vitamin D levels on some highly prevalent clinical conditions of postmenopausal women. We reviewed and selected recent literature regarding menopause-related conditions associated with vitamin D deficiency and interventions to manage them. Low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels related to menopause are linked to diet, lifestyle, changes in body composition, insulin sensitivity, and reduced physical activity. Vitamin D supplementation increases serum 25(OH)D levels while normalizing parathyroid hormone and bone markers, and in women with serum 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng/ml supplementation may improve bone mineral density. Low vitamin D status has been associated with the metabolic syndrome, high triglyceride levels, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. When compared with placebo, vitamin D supplementation may lower the risk of the metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia. There is an inverse relationship between fat mass and serum 25(OH)D levels and, therefore, the dosage of supplementation should be adjusted according to the body mass index. Although vitamin D supplementation may improve glucose metabolism in prediabetic subjects, data regarding muscle strength are conflictive. There is evidence that vitamin D over-treatment, to reach extremely high circulating 25(OH)D levels, does not result in better clinical outcomes. The identification and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in postmenopausal women may improve their general health and health outcomes. Vitamin D supplementation should preferably be based on the use of either cholecalciferol or calcifediol.

### Common misconceptions about vitamin D – implications for clinicians [^113imBRF]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Misconceptions about vitamin D continue to grow despite publications in the past few years that have attempted to clarify risk. We present our perspective, and offer several conclusions. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation can reduce fracture risk by ∼10%. On the other hand, little evidence exists to support a threshold measure for vitamin D status (serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) above which fractures are reduced. The association of serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D with other chronic diseases is confounded by multiple factors and conflicting outcomes that cannot be used to support a causal association. High doses of vitamin D supplements might not be completely harmless and should be avoided until additional data becomes available. Similarly, scant rationale exists for aggressive vitamin D supplementation for pregnant or lactating women. Dispelling misconceptions about vitamin D will ultimately benefit health-care providers and patients alike.

Daily supplementation

From a physiological perspective, daily administration of cholecalciferol seems to be most natural. Indeed, it appears that a daily approach results in higher efficacy in terms of 25(OH)D exposure and extraskeletal benefits.

In a recent RCT comparing 3 different dosing regimens in vitamin D–deficient participants with similar total end-of-study cumulative doses (D 3 daily 10 000 IU 8 weeks, then 1000 IU for 4 weeks; 50 000 IU weekly for 12 weeks; and 100 000 IU every 2 weeks for 12 weeks), the group receiving the daily supplementation was the quickest to reach sufficiency (< 2 weeks, although receiving a higher cumulative dose in the first 8 weeks when compared to the other 2 arms) and reached the highest serum 25(OH)D levels. Importantly, daily administration was associated with higher systemic exposure to 25(OH)D (greater area under the curve, +23% and +27% compared to weekly and biweekly administration, respectively), even when corrected for the cumulative dose. The greater 25(OH)D exposure of daily regimens could be due to lower activation of the 24-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP24A1). In an RCT of lactating women comparing the effect of bolus (150 000 IU) vs daily vitamin D 3 dosing (5000 IU) on vitamin D 3 catabolism, a single high-bolus dose of vitamin D led to greater production of 24,25(OH) 2 D 3, relative to the 25(OH)D 3 value than did daily vitamin D supplementation, with this effect persisting for at least 28 days after supplementation. The greater therapeutic potential of daily regimens compared to other regimens might be less relevant at lower doses (≤ 2000 IU). Two studies comparing 2000 IU/day vs 50 000 IU/month and 800 IU/day vs 5600 IU/month found no statistically significant differences in the 2 areas under the curves.

### Vitamin D insufficiency and epistemic humility: an endocrine society guideline communication [^1113S3oR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

A long-held precept is that vitamin D supplementation primarily, if not exclusively, benefits individuals with low circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at baseline. However, the most appropriate 25(OH)D threshold to distinguish unacceptably low vs reliably adequate concentrations remains controversial. Such threshold proposals have largely been based on observational studies, which provide less robust evidence compared to randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Since the Endocrine Society's first vitamin D-related guideline was published in 2011, several large vitamin D-related RCTs have been published, and a newly commissioned guideline development panel (GDP) prioritized 4 clinical questions related to the benefits and harms of vitamin D supplementation in generally healthy individuals with 25(OH)D levels below a threshold. The GDP determined that available clinical trial evidence does not permit the establishment of 25(OH)D thresholds that specifically predict meaningful benefit with vitamin D supplementation. The panel noted important limitations in the available evidence, and the panel's overall certainty in the available evidence was very low. Nonetheless, based on the GDP's analyses and judgments, the Endocrine Society no longer endorses its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "sufficiency" (ie, at least 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]) or its previously proposed definition of vitamin D "insufficiency" (ie, greater than 20ng/mL [50nmol/L] but lower than 30ng/mL [75nmol/L]). The Endocrine Society's rationale for such is the subject of this Guideline Communication.

### Vitamin D status and response to daily 400 IU vitamin D3 and weekly alendronate 70 mg in men and women with osteoporosis [^115sWpPJ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Suboptimal vitamin D status is common in elderly individuals. However, the extent of vitamin D inadequacy in men and women being treated for osteoporosis in a family practice setting has not been well characterized.

Objective

To describe the distribution of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-[OH] D) in Canadian men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis taking 400 IU or less of vitamin D daily and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and impact of vitamin D(3) supplementation 400 IU daily taken concurrently with alendronate sodium 70 mg weekly.

Methods

This was a prospective, single-cohort, open-label, multicenter study. Community-dwelling men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were recruited at 197 sites across Canada. Patients received vitamin D(3) 400 IU/day supplementation coadministered with alendronate 70 mg/wk for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the distribution of serum 25-(OH) D at baseline. Secondary outcome measures included changes from baseline in serum 25-(OH) D levels, adherence to study treatments, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs).

Results

Of the 681 patients included in the analysis, 485 (71.2%) completed the study. Patients were predominantly female (83.1%) with a mean (SD) age of 67.6 (10.7) years. At baseline, mean (SD) serum 25-(OH) D concentration was 25.4 (9.9) ng/mL and 68.0% of the patients had inadequate (less than 30 ng/mL) vitamin D status. At week 16, concentrations increased by 35.1% to 31.2 (9.2) ng/mL (p < 0.001) and the proportion of patients with inadequate 25-(OH) D levels was reduced to 47.0%. Adherence to the treatment regimen was high (greater than 95%). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported (6.9%) treatment-related AEs.

Conclusions

About two thirds of patients previously diagnosed with osteoporosis have inadequate vitamin D status. A treatment regimen consisting of alendronate 70 mg/wk administered with daily vitamin D(3) 400 IU supplementation significantly increased patients' serum 25-(OH) D levels, but 47% did not achieve optimal levels. These results support both the National Osteoporosis Foundation and Osteoporosis Canada recommendations for higher vitamin D supplement doses (at least 800 IU daily) in osteoporotic patients receiving pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis and for monitoring their serum 25-(OH) D response.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1127DaJc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation and 25(OH)D testing in adults aged 75 years and older — the panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation and issued a conditional recommendation, and suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in adults aged 75 years and older. The systematic review did not find evidence suggesting that the benefit is restricted to those with 25(OH)D below a threshold, and the panel judged that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity. In trials informing falls and fracture outcomes, the estimated weighted average intervention vitamin D dosage was approximately 990 IU/day (23 μg/day), participants were permitted to remain on vitamin D supplements up to 800 IU (20 μg)/day, and the median dosage of calcium used was 1000 mg per day (500–1500 mg/day).

### Vitamin D supplementation after the menopause [^114AkNam]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis of RCTsregarding adults supplemented with vitamin D 3 with doses ranging from 400 IU to 5714 IU showed that a dosage of 1000 IU best suppressed serum PTH levels, while 4000 IU showed the greatest increase in serum 25(OH)D levels in the overweight and normal obese population. Since postmenopausal women may also have some other component of MetS, the initial dose should be 1000–2000 IU/day with serum 25(OH)D required to be measured after 3–4 months to check if the dose is sufficient or should be increased. Some overweight and obese postmenopausal women probably need higher doses of vitamin D supplementation depending on their diet and exposure to sunlight in order to increase serum 25(OH)D levels. Another approach is to titrate the dose of vitamin D supplementation in cases of excessive body weight as recommended by Ekwaru et al. They suggested that vitamin D supplementation should be 2–3 times higher for obese subjects and 1.5 times higher for overweight subjects compared with subjects of normal weight.

Glucose, insulin resistance, and diabetes risk

Vitamin D status has been related to glucose metabolism, and higher serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with better glycemic control, better pancreatic β-cell function, and insulin sensitivity. Valladares et al. have studied fasting plasma glucose and 25(OH)D levels in women aged 35–74 years. This study reported that 65.4% had 25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml and 25.6% < 20 ng/ml and lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with higher glucose levels. A recent meta-analysis showed no association between serum 25(OH)D levels and prediabetes. There were no significant differences in hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, and HOMA-IR values between individuals with prediabetes treated with vitamin D and those taking placebo.

### Gene expression in breast and adipose tissue after 12 months of weight loss and vitamin D supplementation in postmenopausal women [^115XJfQ6]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

The Vitamin D, Diet and Activity (ViDA) study (Identifier NCT01240213), was a 12-month double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of 2000 IU/day oral vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation vs. placebo on weight and other biomarkers of breast cancer risk in healthy overweight and obese postmenopausal women with serum 25(OH)D concentrations ≥ 10 and < 32 ng/mL ("insufficient") who were participating in a lifestyle-based weight-loss program. The accrual goal was 228 women; 218 were randomized. All study procedures were reviewed and approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written Informed Consent.

Study participants

The main study is described elsewhere. Briefly, postmenopausal (50–75 years) women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m² and serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the insufficient range (10–32 ng/mL) were randomly assigned to 12 months of either: i) 2000 IU/day vitamin D 3 supplementation + a lifestyle-based weight-loss program (n = 109; "Vitamin D"), or ii) daily placebo + a lifestyle-based weight-loss program (n = 109; "Placebo"). The primary trial outcome was weight loss; secondary outcomes were changes in body composition (waist circumference, trunk fat, and percentage body fat) and serum biomarkers (insulin and c-reactive protein). Exclusion criteria included: taking > 400 IU supplemental vitamin D; renal disease; history of kidney stones; diagnosed diabetes, osteoporosis, or severe congestive heart failure; history of breast cancer or other invasive cancer excluding non-melanoma skin cancer; use of hormone replacement therapy within the past 6 months; alcohol intake > 2 drinks/day; current smoking; contraindication to taking 2000 IU vitamin D 3 /day; history of bariatric surgery; current use of weight loss medications; and additional factors that might interfere with the measurement of outcomes or intervention success (e.g. inability to attend facility-based sessions). All participants were offered participation in the tissue marker substudy that included collection of breast tissue through RPFNA and an abdominal subcutaneous fat pad biopsy.

Vitamin D Supplementation

Dosing Regimens

The term " dose " in relation to vitamin D is typically used to signify the measured quantity of vitamin D (usually cholecalciferol, but other formulations such as ergocalciferol, eldecalcitol, calcifediol, etc are also available) in a pill. It is expressed as µg or IU (where 10 µg is 400 IU). The dose of cholecalciferol is considered an important measure as it correlates with the change in blood 25(OH)D level, which is commonly used to define vitamin D status and correlates with important clinical outcomes. Doses can be considered as "loading" or "maintenance". The most common use of a loading dose is to rapidly improve a low blood 25(OH)D; however, the clinical wisdom of this approach is questionable, especially given studies that demonstrate adverse effects with very high doses given infrequently, as discussed next. Intermittent administration of large doses is also used to optimize adherence. Daily doses are generally preferred when vitamin D replacement is considered necessary. The effect of a given dose on changing blood 25(OH)D varies considerably from person to person due to many factors, such as body weight, absorption, diet, degree of adiposity, CYP2R1 activity, DBP. The recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D by the National Academy of Medicine is set at 400 to 800 IU per day, and the tolerable upper intake level at 4000 IU per day; however, the "optimal" dose of vitamin D varies by the desired outcome, and other authors suggest that the upper limit of safety may be lower than 4000 IU per day. For example, 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day may be adequate to avoid clinical vitamin D deficiency and maintain calcium homeostasis in healthy individuals. Doses of vitamin D higher than the recommended upper limit may be associated with toxicity; nonetheless, daily doses up to 10 000 IU have been used without safety concerns. Careful and judicious use of vitamin D will permit the realization of potential benefits and achieving optimal outcomes.

### Effects of high-dose vitamin D2 versus D3 on total and free 25-hydroxyvitamin D and markers of calcium balance [^116J3h4r]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Controversy persists over: 1) how best to restore low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels (vitamin D2 [D2] vs vitamin D3 [D3]); 2) how best to define vitamin D status (total [protein-bound + free] vs free 25D); and 3) how best to assess the bioactivity of free 25D.

Objective

To assess: 1) the effects of D2 vs D3 on serum total and free 25D; and 2) whether change in intact PTH (iPTH) is more strongly associated with change in total vs free 25D.

Design

Participants previously enrolled in a D2 vs D3 trial were matched for age, body mass index, and race/ethnicity. Participants received 50 000 IU of D2 or D3 twice weekly for 5 weeks, followed by a 5-week equilibration period. Biochemical assessment was performed at baseline and at 10 weeks.

Setting and Participants

Thirty-eight adults (19 D2 and 19 D3) ≥ 18 years of age with baseline 25D levels < 30 ng/mL were recruited from an academic ambulatory osteoporosis clinic.

Outcome Measures

Serum measures were total 25D, free 25D (directly measured), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcium, and iPTH. Urine measure was fasting calcium:creatinine ratio.

Results

Baseline total (22.2 ± 3.3 vs 23.3 ± 7.2 ng/mL; P = 0.5) and free (5.4 ± 0.8 vs 5.3 ± 1.7 pg/mL; P = 0.8) 25D levels were similar between D2 and D3 groups. Increases in total (+27.6 vs +12.2 ng/mL; P = 0.001) and free (+3.6 vs +6.2 pg/mL; P = 0.02) 25D levels were greater with D3 vs D2. Percentage change in iPTH was significantly associated with change in free (but not total) 25D, without and with adjustment for supplementation regimen, change in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and change in calcium.

Conclusions

D3 increased total and free 25D levels to a greater extent than D2. Free 25D may be superior to total 25D as a marker of vitamin D bioactivity.

The mean serum 25(OH)D level at the screening was 13.0 ± 3.9 ng/ml, mean free 25(OH)D concentration 3.9 ± 1.1 pg/ml, and the mean iPTH level was 60.1 ± 25.5 pg/ml.

TABLE 1
Demographic and other baseline characteristics of participants

At month 4, the analysis of the primary endpoint of this study showed that 35.0% (95% CI, 25.4% to 42.0%) of participants treated with calcifediol reached 25(OH)D levels > 30 ng/ml, whereas only 8.2% (95% CI, 3.6% to 15.5%) in the cholecalciferol group did (Figure 3). The proportion difference between both groups was of 26.8% (95% CI, 18.3% to 35.4%). This difference in efficacy (in terms of reaching 25(OH)D levels > 30 ng/ml) was already present at month 1, where 13.5% (95% CI, 9.1%; to 19.0%) of the patients in the calcifediol arm and none of those on cholecalciferol arm (95% CI, 0.0% to 3.7%) achieved the target level. Both results were statistically significant, with p < 0.0001.

### Osteoporosis diagnosis and medical treatment [^116PhuKy]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, the presence of either low bone mineral density or a history of a fragility fracture, is known to be associated with an increased risk of future fracture. Fracture prevention is possible through use of both nonpharmacologic and prescription treatments. Despite recent controversy regarding the safety of calcium supplementation and the appropriate dosing of calcium and vitamin D, calcium and vitamin D remain an important part of bone health. However, prescription osteoporosis treatments should be considered for those at higher risk for fracture, and there are currently several treatment options available.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^113cP2er]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

To summarize, cholecalciferol can maintain physiological 25(OH)D serum levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) but below 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) for a long time, regardless of whether the dosage given is daily or intermittent (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly), due to its slow pharmacokinetic elimination caused by prolonged storage and release on demand according to physiological needs. Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels is generally unnecessary for patients on long-term maintenance vitamin D doses of up to at least 2000 IU/day. Retesting after 8 to 12 weeks from the start of supplementation may be appropriate when poor compliance is suspected, in case of symptoms suggestive of vitamin D deficiency, and for patients at risk of persistent 25(OH)D level below 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L). These comprise institutionalized or hospitalized individuals, people in whom vitamin D therapy uncovers subclinical primary hyperparathyroidism, obese individuals, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery, individuals who use of certain concomitant medications (eg, anticonvulsant medications, glucocorticoids), and patients with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. For patients on potent antiresorptive agents (eg, denosumab or zoledronic acid), vitamin D levels should be checked annually per protocol.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114L9QtN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

Recommendation 7 — general population aged 75 years and older: In the general population aged 75 years and older, we suggest against routine testing for 25(OH)D levels. In this population, 25(OH)D thresholds that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials, and the panel suggests against (a) routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making (ie, vitamin D vs no vitamin D) and (b) routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing. This recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia).

### Calcifediol is superior to cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D status in postmenopausal women: a randomized trial [^114cbPe4]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

When the population was divided by baseline 25(OH)D levels, we found differences in the increase in serum 25(OH)D levels in subjects with baseline levels < 10 ng/ml, between both treatment groups, albeit this difference was not statistically significant. This was probably due to the reduced number of participants in this subgroup, given that the evaluation of this threshold was not one of the main objectives for this study. This may be also due to a more rapid conversion of cholecalciferol into 25(OH)D in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency. Cholecalciferol seems to have a biphasic behavior: with higher baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations, it shows slower increases, whereas this is not the case for calcifediol.

Vitamin D deficiency can result in a rise in PTH levels, or secondary hyperparathyroidism, increasing bone remodeling. This, in turn, causes a deterioration in the quality and quantity of bone, reducing bone strength and increasing the risk of fracture. However, most vitamin D–deficient patients can have normal PTH levels, which was also noted in our study. Age, sex, obesity, and basal 25(OH)D levels can affect this relationship. We observed that increasing 25(OH)D did not modify iPTH levels or alter bone remodeling parameters during the studied period. The fact that the basal iPTH levels were within normal range could explain this absence of treatment effect. Another important observation was that after 4 months of treatment, the mean 25(OH)D levels were 27.8 ± 9.0 ng/ml and 23.1 ± 5.4 ng/ml in the calcifediol and cholecalciferol groups, respectively. It is possible that higher concentrations of 25(OH)D are required for iPTH suppression and normalization of bone remodeling.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111FnWfU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years: Subgroup analyses did not provide evidence for benefit with vitamin D in subgroups with 25(OH)D below 20 to 24 ng/mL (50–60 nmol/L), and based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D, in addition to the anticipated undesirable effects, are likely to be trivial. The panel judged that vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no beneficial impact on the outcomes analyzed in healthy populations aged 50 to 74 years, and concluded there was therefore no compelling rationale to recommend empiric vitamin D in this age group. Noting monetary costs and that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity, the panel suggested against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^116dk6uZ]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Growing preclinical and clinical observations associating vitamin D with many health clinical conditions have been progressively reported in recent years. However, the lack of rigorous methodologies on patient enrollment, vitamin D supplements, and standardized laboratory assays have limited the ability to draw definitive conclusions about these data that still need to be more clearly understood.

Thus, a "whys, whens, and hows" of vitamin D assessment and supplementation derived from an international expert panel discussion about controversial topics regarding vitamin D metabolism, assessment, actions, and supplementation is needed to help the scientific community in evaluating and conducting future further studies with more rigorous methodologies, to better explore any clinical setting potentially influenced by vitamin D, and to provide reliable data required to update our international recommendations.

### National osteoporosis society vitamin D guideline summary [^113zRN7e]. Age and Ageing (2014). Low credibility.

The National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) published its document, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline for Patient Management, in 2013 as a practical clinical guideline on the management of vitamin D deficiency in adult patients with, or at risk of developing, bone disease. There has been no clear consensus in the UK on vitamin D deficiency its assessment and treatment, and clinical practice is inconsistent. This guideline is aimed at clinicians, including doctors, nurses and dieticians. It recommends the measurement of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D (25OHD) to estimate vitamin D status in the following clinical scenarios: bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment; bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate; musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The guideline also states that routine vitamin D testing is unnecessary where vitamin D supplementation with an oral antiresorptive treatment is already planned and sets the following serum 25OHD thresholds: < 30 nmol/l is deficient; 30–50 nmol/l may be inadequate in some people; > 50 nmol/l is sufficient for almost the whole population. For treatment, oral vitamin D3 is recommended with fixed loading doses of oral vitamin D3 followed by regular maintenance therapy when rapid correction of vitamin D deficiency is required, although loading doses are not necessary where correction of deficiency is less urgent or when co-prescribing with an oral antiresorptive agent. For monitoring, serum calcium (adjusted for albumin) should be checked 1 month after completing a loading regimen, or after starting vitamin D supplementation, in case primary hyperparathyroidism has been unmasked. However, routine monitoring of serum 25OHD is generally unnecessary but may be appropriate in patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency or malabsorption and where poor compliance with medication is suspected. The guideline focuses on bone health as, although there are numerous putative effects of vitamin D on immunity modulation, cancer prevention and the risks of cardiovascular disease and multiple sclerosis, there remains considerable debate about the evaluation of extraskeletal factors and optimal vitamin D status in these circumstances.

### Reducing fracture risk with calcium and vitamin D [^113BDzPM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. This study tries to define the types of patients, both at risk of osteoporosis and with established disease, who may benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The importance of adequate compliance in these individuals is also discussed. Calcium and vitamin D therapy has been recommended for older persons, either frail and institutionalized or independent, with key risk factors including decreased bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporotic fractures, increased bone remodelling as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased propensity to falls. In addition, treatment of osteoporosis with a bisphosphonate was less effective in patients with vitamin D deficiency. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is a key component of prevention and treatment of osteoporosis unless calcium intake and vitamin D status are optimal. For primary disease prevention, supplementation should be targeted to those with dietary insufficiencies. Several serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) cut-offs have been proposed to define vitamin D insufficiency (as opposed to adequate vitamin D status), ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/l. Based on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D, BMD, bone turnover, lower extremity function and falls, we suggest that 50 nmol/l is the appropriate serum 25(OH)D threshold to define vitamin D insufficiency. Supplementation should therefore generally aim to increase 25(OH)D levels within the 50–75 nmol/l range. This level can be achieved with a dose of 800 IU/day vitamin D, the dose that was used in successful fracture prevention studies to date; a randomized clinical trial assessing whether higher vitamin D doses achieve a greater reduction of fracture incidence would be of considerable interest. As calcium balance is not only affected by vitamin D status but also by calcium intake, recommendations for adequate calcium intake should also be met. The findings of community-based clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium supplementation in which compliance was moderate or less have often been negative, whereas studies in institutionalized patients in whom medication administration was supervised ensuring adequate compliance demonstrated significant benefits.

### The role of baseline serum 25 (OH) D concentration for a potential personalized vitamin D supplementation [^111abPzu]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

There are many examples in clinical nutrition with individuals responding differently to a dietary intervention. Here, personalized nutritional recommendations could be targeted, tailoring interventions to address plurality in response. For this, we reconsidered two randomized controlled trials investigating whether two different supplementation doses of cholecalciferol resulted in an increased serum 25(OH)D concentration. Three different statistical methods were applied in order to identify participants who would enjoy an increased benefit from receiving a specific dose of cholecalciferol. We concluded that, for individuals with high baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations, only the high supplementation dose will lead to a substantial increase in the serum 25(OH)D concentration. The presented statistical methods can be adequately used for more individualized approaches.

Among the 2742 participants with repeated blood collections at year 2, there was a significant mean (SD) 11.9 (8.6) ng/mL increase in serum 25-OHD level in the group randomized to vitamin D supplementation, compared with little change in the placebo group (−0.7 [7.9] ng/mL). Waterfall plots (eFigure in Supplement 1) illustrate the variability of within-person change in total 25-OHD level according to randomized treatment. The multivariable-adjusted means at baseline and 2 years for all biomarkers by treatment group and BMI category are given in Figure 2 and Table 3. There were significant increases in the mean total 25-OHD, 25-OHD3, FVD, and BioD levels at 2 years among participants randomized to active supplementation, and little or no changes observed for the placebo group. Furthermore, we observed statistically significant interactions (all interactions P < .001) by baseline BMI category for these treatment effects vs placebo, whereby the magnitudes of biomarker increases were lower at higher baseline BMI. For example, for total 25-OHD level, the mean (SD) increases at 2 years for supplementation vs placebo across BMI strata were 13.5 (0.6) ng/mL for less than 25.0, 12.7 (0.5) ng/mL for 25.0 to 29.9, 10.5 (0.7) ng/mL for 30.0 to 34.9, and 10.0 (1.0) ng/mL for greater than or equal to 35.0 ng/mL. In contrast, there was no significant difference with vitamin D supplementation vs placebo in VDBP, albumin, PTH, or calcium levels, and the lack of association was observed for all BMI categories.

### Association of body weight with response to vitamin D supplementation and metabolism [^117ErEyE]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

In the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), the effects of randomized vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol), 2000 IU/d, reduced the risk of several health outcomes among participants with normal, but not elevated, body weights. It was unclear whether weight had any association with the outcomes of the supplementation.

Objective

To investigate whether baseline body mass index (BMI) modifies vitamin D metabolism and response to supplementation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

VITAL is a completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease. In the present cohort study, an analysis was conducted in a subset of VITAL participants who provided a blood sample at baseline and a subset with a repeated sample at 2 years' follow-up. VITAL was conducted from July 1, 2010, to November 10, 2018; data analysis for the present study was conducted from August 1, 2021, to November 9, 2021.

Interventions

Treatment outcomes of vitamin D, 2000 IU/d, supplementation vs placebo associated with clinical and novel vitamin D-related biomarkers by BMI category adjusted for other factors associated with vitamin D status.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable-adjusted means (SE) or 95% CIs of vitamin D-related serum biomarkers at baseline and follow-up: total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), 25-OHD3, free vitamin D (FVD), bioavailable vitamin D (BioD), vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), albumin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium, and log-transformed as needed.

Results

A total of 16 515 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.7 [7.0] years; 8371 women [50.7%]; 12420 non-Hispanic White [76.9%]) were analyzed at baseline, including 2742 with a follow-up blood sample. Before randomization, serum total 25-OHD levels were incrementally lower at higher BMI categories (adjusted mean [SE]: underweight, 32.3 [0.7] ng/mL; normal weight, 32.3 [0.1] ng/mL; overweight, 30.5 [0.1] ng/mL; obesity class I, 29.0 [0.2] ng/mL; and obesity class II, 28.0 [0.2] ng/mL; P < .001 for linear trend). Similarly, baseline 25-OHD3, FVD, BioD, VDBP, albumin, and calcium levels were lower with higher BMI, while PTH level was higher (all P < .001 for linear trend). Compared with placebo, randomization to vitamin D supplementation was associated with an increase in total 25-OHD, 25-OHD3, FVD, and BioD levels compared with placebo at 2 years' follow-up, but increases were significantly lower at higher BMI categories (all treatment effect interactions P < .001). Supplementation did not substantially change VDBP, albumin, PTH, or calcium levels.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized cohort study, vitamin D supplementation increased serum vitamin D-related biomarkers, with a blunted response observed for participants with overweight or obesity at baseline. These longitudinal findings suggest that BMI may be associated with modified response to vitamin D supplementation and may in part explain the observed diminished outcomes of supplementation for various health outcomes among individuals with higher BMI.

Skeletal Outcomes

Skeletal outcomes of vitamin D deficiency are summarized in Fig. 3. Vitamin D deficiency leads to a decrease in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Other biochemical abnormalities, such as hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase, become apparent when serum 25(OH)D concentrations are lower than 25 nmol/L. In milder forms of vitamin D deficiency, the lower calcium concentration causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, which increases the conversion of 25(OH)D into 1,25(OH) 2 D, increasing calcium absorption and correcting serum calcium. Secondary hyperparathyroidism causes an increase in bone turnover, with relatively higher bone resorption at cortical sites. More severe longstanding vitamin D deficiency causes a decrease in the mineralization of newly formed osteoid tissue. This is visible in bone biopsies as an increase in osteoid surface and volume and increased thickness of osteoid seams, leading to the clinical picture of osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency and related secondary hyperparathyroidism cause bone loss and fractures in older adults. The incidence of hip fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency has been estimated at 5% to 10%. Meta-analyses of clinical trials with vitamin D and calcium have demonstrated a decrease in hip and other fractures of around 10% in nursing home residents, whereas vitamin D alone was not effective. In these studies, baseline mean serum 25(OH)D after cross-calibration was found to be very low — namely less than 25 nmol/L — as was the calcium intake. As almost all effective trials used a calcium supplement in addition to vitamin D, the effect on BMD of vitamin D supplements alone is difficult to determine, but it is considered to be less than 1%, and high doses may even be harmful when administered to vitamin D–replete individuals. Recent RCTs such as the ViDA, VITAL, and D-Health studies do not show skeletal benefits for mostly vitamin D–replete adults and older individuals; for example, in the VITAL trial, cholecalciferol supplementation did not result in a significantly lower risk of fractures (total, nonvertebral, and hip fractures) than placebo among generally healthy midlife and older adults not selected for vitamin D deficiency, low bone mass, or osteoporosis. In the D-Health study, large bolus monthly doses (60 000 IU) resulted in no increase nor decrease in fracture risk overall. However, the hazard ratio appeared to decrease with increasing follow-up time. Interestingly, in a recent retrospective longitudinal study, the use of cholecalciferol was associated with reduced incidence of morphometric vertebral fractures in high skeletal risk, such as acromegaly.

### Effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on cancer incidence in older women: a randomized clinical trial [^116YKzJh]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Evidence suggests that low vitamin D status may increase the risk of cancer.

Objective

To determine if dietary supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium reduces the risk of cancer among older women.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 4-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, population-based randomized clinical trial in 31 rural counties (June 24, 2009, to August 26, 2015-the final date of follow-up). A total of 2303 healthy postmenopausal women 55 years or older were randomized, 1156 to the treatment group and 1147 to the placebo group. Duration of treatment was 4 years.

Interventions

The treatment group (vitamin D3+calcium group) received 2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 and 1500 mg/d of calcium; the placebo group received identical placebos.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the incidence of all-type cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), which was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and proportional hazards modeling.

Results

Among 2303 randomized women (mean age, 65.2 years [SD, 7.0]; mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, 32.8 ng/mL [SD, 10.5]), 2064 (90%) completed the study. At year 1, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were 43.9 ng/mL in the vitamin D3+calcium group and 31.6 ng/mL in the placebo group. A new diagnosis of cancer was confirmed in 109 participants, 45 (3.89%) in the vitamin D3+calcium group and 64 (5.58%) in the placebo group (difference, 1.69% [95% CI, -0.06% to 3.46%]; P = 0.06). Kaplan-Meier incidence over 4 years was 0.042 (95% CI, 0.032 to 0.056) in the vitamin D3+calcium group and 0.060 (95% CI, 0.048 to 0.076) in the placebo group; P = 0.06. In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, the hazard ratio was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.47 to 1.02). Adverse events potentially related to the study included renal calculi (16 participants in the vitamin D3+calcium group and 10 in the placebo group), and elevated serum calcium levels (6 in the vitamin D3+calcium group and 2 in the placebo group).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among healthy postmenopausal older women with a mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 32.8 ng/mL, supplementation with vitamin D3 and calcium compared with placebo did not result in a significantly lower risk of all-type cancer at 4 years. Further research is necessary to assess the possible role of vitamin D in cancer prevention.

### Calcium and vitamin D for increasing bone mineral density in premenopausal women [^117H7nUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become fragile due to low bone density and impaired bone quality. This results in fractures that lead to higher morbidity and reduced quality of life. Osteoporosis is considered a major public health concern worldwide. For this reason, preventive measurements need to be addressed throughout the life course. Exercise and a healthy diet are among the lifestyle factors that can help prevent the disease, the latter including intake of key micronutrients for bone, such as calcium and vitamin D. The evidence on whether supplementation with calcium and vitamin D improves bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women is still inconclusive. In this age group, bone accrual is considered to be the goal of supplementation, so BMD is relevant for the future stages of life.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination, to increase the BMD, reduce fractures, and report the potential adverse events in healthy premenopausal women compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was 12 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in healthy premenopausal women (with or without calcium or vitamin D deficiency) comparing supplementation of calcium or vitamin D (or both) at any dose and by any route of administration versus placebo for at least three months. Vitamin D could have been administered as cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Outcomes included total hip bone mineral density (BMD), lumbar spine BMD, quality of life, new symptomatic vertebral fractures, new symptomatic non-vertebral fractures, withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all reported adverse events and additional withdrawals for any reason.

Main Results

We included seven RCTs with 941 participants, of whom 138 were randomised to calcium supplementation, 110 to vitamin D supplementation, 271 to vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, and 422 to placebo. Mean age ranged from 18.1 to 42.1 years. Studies reported results for total hip or lumbar spine BMD (or both) and withdrawals for various reasons, but none reported fractures or withdrawals for adverse events or serious adverse events. Results for the reported outcomes are presented for the three comparisons: calcium versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, and calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo. In all comparisons, there was no clinical difference in outcomes, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate to low. Most studies were at risk of selection, performance, detection, and reporting biases. Calcium versus placebo Four studies compared calcium versus placebo (138 participants in the calcium group and 123 in the placebo group) with mean ages from 18.0 to 47.3 years. Calcium supplementation may have little to no effect on total hip or lumbar spine BMD after 12 months in three studies and after six months in one study (total hip BMD: mean difference (MD) -0.04 g/cm 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to 0.03; I² = 71%; 3 studies, 174 participants; low-certainty evidence; lumbar spine BMD: MD 0 g/cm 2, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; I² = 71%; 4 studies, 202 participants; low-certainty evidence). Calcium alone supplementation does not reduce or increase the withdrawals in the trials (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.16; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 261 participants: moderate-certainty evidence). Vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared vitamin D versus placebo (110 participants in the vitamin D group and 79 in the placebo group), with mean ages from 18.0 to 32.7 years. These studies reported lumbar spine BMD as a mixture of MDs and percent of change and we were unable to pool the results. In the original studies, there were no differences in lumbar BMD between groups. Vitamin D alone supplementation does not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason between groups (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.19; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo Two studies compared calcium plus vitamin D versus placebo (271 participants in the calcium plus vitamin D group and 270 in the placebo group; 220 participants from Woo 2007 and 50 participants from Islam 2010). The mean age range was 18.0 to 36 years. These studies measured different anatomic areas, one study reported total hip BMD and the other study reported lumbar spine BMD; therefore, data were not pooled for this outcome. The individual studies found no difference between groups in percent of change on total hip BMD (-0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0; moderate-certainty evidence), and lumbar spine BMD (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; moderate-certainty evidence). Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may not reduce or increase withdrawals for any reason (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35; I² = 72%; 2 studies, 541 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our results do not support the isolated or combined use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in healthy premenopausal women as a public health intervention to improve BMD in the total hip or lumbar spine, and therefore it is unlikely to have a benefit for the prevention of fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral). The evidence found suggests that there is no need for future studies in the general population of premenopausal women; however, studies focused on populations with a predisposition to diseases related to bone metabolism, or with low bone mass or osteoporosis diagnosed BMD would be useful.

Serum 25OHD Levels and Screening

Guidelines regarding the use of serum markers of vitamin D status for medical management of individual patients and for screening were beyond the scope of the Committee's charge, and evidence-based consensus guidelines are not available. However, these issues should be addressed by appropriate federal agencies and professional organizations in light of the findings in this report. As noted above, the Committee recognized that serum 25OHD is a useful integrated marker of vitamin D exposure, incorporating endogenous synthesis from solar exposure, dietary intake from foods, fortified products, and/or supplements, and other factors. However, the Committee also recognized that observational studies of correlations between 25OHD and clinical outcomes are subject to confounding and do not prove causation. Concerns about inaccurate or imprecise serum 25OHD measurements are being overcome by methodological advances, frequent quality assessments, and accurate calibration tools. In contrast, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D represents a more complex endocrine parameter, regulated by calcium and PTH status and affected by kidney function. After a careful review of available literature, the Committee concluded that serum 25OHD levels of 16 ng/ml (40 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of approximately half the population, and levels of 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) cover the requirements of at least 97.5% of the population. These levels will be useful to clinicians as they consider management of patients under their care. For upper levels of serum 25OHD, sparse data are available, particularly regarding long-term effects of chronically high concentrations, and a margin of safety for public health recommendations is prudent. Thus, serum 25OHD levels above 50 ng/ml (125 nmol/liter) should raise concerns among clinicians about potential adverse effects.

### Nutrition users' guides: RCTs part 2-structured guide for interpreting and applying study results from randomised controlled trials on therapy or prevention questions [^115REJMC]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2024). High credibility.

In weighing the benefits and harms of intervention, we also need information on the adverse effects of intervention (while noting that RCTs evaluating the effects of interventions often include too few patients to detect rare but serious adverse events). Despite RCT results of the Women's Health Initiative Calcium/Vitamin D Supplementation trial, the safety of calcium with vitamin D has been questioned for the management of osteoporosis. In a re-analysis of 16 718 women who were not using personal calcium supplementation at randomisation, the HR for an increased risk in major cardiovascular events in those randomised to calcium and vitamin D was 1.16 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.34) (non-fatal myocardial infarction or revascularisation, p = 0.04), whereas in the women already using calcium supplements at randomisation, the cardiovascular risk did not change after allocation to calcium and vitamin D. However, it must be noted, when interpreting the validity of this apparent subgroup effect using the 11 questions in table 3 (above), the answer to about half of the questions is 'no' suggesting the subgroup effect is not necessarily valid. Regardless, in some instances, patients may be incurring out-of-pocket costs for nutritional interventions that have the possibility of harm, or no desirable benefit.

Finally, we need to consider and explain the trade-offs between potential benefits, harms, burden and costs (if relevant) of different options in an equitable way to our patients and help them choose the option that is most compatible with their personal values and preferences.

Interindividual Variability in Serum 25(OH)D Levels Achieved at 1 Year

Scrutiny of the individual serum 25(OH)D values at 1 year, and the difference in 25(OH)D levels between 12 months and baseline, reveal high variability in the magnitude and direction of response to both doses (Fig. 1). To evaluate the impact of baseline serum 25(OH)D levels and dose on the response to therapy, we performed regression analyses of the change (delta) in serum 25(OH)D level with changing baseline 25(OH)D levels, for each dose. As the baseline 25(OH)D levels increased, the change in serum 25(OH)D levels at 1 year decreased, with both doses (Fig. 4A). However, for any baseline serum 25(OH)D level, there could be substantial variance and overlap in the delta vitamin D achieved, within and between treatment groups (Fig. 4A). The mean increment with the low dose was 6 ng/mL, with a wide range from −13 to 26 ng/mL (Fig. 4B), and 15 ng/mL with the high dose, ranging between −13 and 41 ng/mL (Fig. 4C).

The 25(OH)D delta/100 IU was 1.00 ± 1.26 ng/mL in the low dose, and less than half, with a mean of 0.41 ± 0.27 in the high dose, (P < 0.001) in unadjusted analyses. This variable did not significantly differ by gender or BMI cutoff categories (above vs below 30 kg/m²) (Supplement 2). The 25(OH)D delta/100 IU was 0.99 ± 0.70 ng/mL in the low dose arm after adjusting for baseline 25(OH)D level.

### Cognition and vitamin D in older African-American women-physical performance and osteoporosis prevention with vitamin D in older African Americans trial and dementia [^116SfPH8]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To examine the effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels recommended by Endocrine Society guidelines (> 30 ng/mL) on cognition in healthy older African-American women over 3 years.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Setting

Bone Mineral Research Center at New York University Winthrop Hospital.

Participants

Healthy postmenopausal African American women aged 65 and older (N = 260; mean age 68.2 ± 4.9; 46% college education or higher).

Intervention

Half of the women were randomized to receive vitamin D (adjusted to achieve a serum level > 30 ng/mL) with calcium (diet and supplement total of 1,200 mg), and half were randomized to receive placebo with calcium (1,200 mg).

Measurements

Cognitive assessments every 6 months using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to detect cognitive decline. Mean MMSE scores were calculated over time for both groups. Those with MMSE scores less than 21 at baseline were excluded.

Results

The average dose of vitamin D 3 was 3,490 ± 1,465 IU per day, and average serum 25(OH)D at 3 years was 46.8 ± 1.2 ng/mL in the active group and 20.7 ± 1.1 ng/mL in the placebo group. Serum 25(OH)D concentration was maintained at greater than 30 ng/mL in 90% of the active group. Over the 3-year period, MMSE scores increased in both groups (p < .001), although change over time was not significantly different between the groups. No adverse events associated with vitamin D were observed.

Conclusion

There was no difference in cognition over time between older African-American women with serum concentrations of 25(OH)D of 30 ng/mL and greater than those taking placebo. There is no evidence to support vitamin D intake greater than the recommended daily allowance in this population for preventing cognitive decline. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:81–86, 2019.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^112sKGHX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

This older patient has sustained a minimal trauma hip fracture and is at high risk of future osteoporotic fractures. She is switched from intravenous zoledronic acid to subcutaneous denosumab in light of her poor functional status and advanced age, and instructed to continue this lifelong without dose interruption. She is recommenced on calcium with cholecalciferol supplement daily. After a hip fracture, the risk of subsequent fractures compared to those without hip fractures increases to 2.5 times in women and almost 5 times in men. Rather than provide a recommendation to the patient's GP to consider osteoporosis therapy following hospital discharge, our Post-Hip Fracture Osteoporosis Treatment Protocol adopts a proactive approach in early initiation of osteoporosis treatment during their index admission and provides link-up with FLS for ongoing treatment and review.

As previously described, the majority of patients are not diagnosed or treated for osteoporosis following a minimal trauma fracture, including hip fractures. A study from a US veterans' hospital demonstrated that even among the cohort with minimal comorbid conditions, only 13% of the study population received pharmacotherapy following a hip fracture. The Australian & New Zealand Hip Fracture Registry (ANZHFR) estimated that only 38% to 45% of hip fracture patients were on appropriate pharmacotherapy at 120 days post discharge.

In 2019, the ANZHFR report identified our tertiary hospital as having some of the lowest rates of predischarge osteoprotective therapy in patients admitted for a hip fracture. In response to this alarming data, the "Concord Post-Hip Fracture Osteoporosis Treatment Protocol" was developed as a collaboration between Geriatric Medicine, Endocrinology, Orthopaedic Surgery, Pharmacy, and Nursing. The protocol targets patients with minimal trauma hip fractures not currently on osteoporosis therapy. A small set of laboratory tests is ordered to ensure the patient has sufficient renal function (eGFR > 35 mL/min/1.73 m²), normal serum calcium, phosphate, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels prior to administering intravenous zoledronic acid before discharge. The 20% of patients who are vitamin D deficient receive 50 000 IU of cholecalciferol for 5 consecutive days to normalize their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels before receiving the bisphosphonate. This type of targeted inpatient initiation of treatment ensures that pharmacotherapy is not delayed due to awaiting DXA scans or outpatient appointments. Another integral component of the protocol is making a 12-month appointment with the FLS before discharge, thus reducing the chance of patients being lost to follow-up.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^1146dLP9]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

A decrease in BMD with age is well documented, with osteoporosis developing when negative bone balance exists, distinguishable by an imbalance in the coupling of bone formation and resorption by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively. Regardless of treatment allocation, BMD at all three sites declined by approximately 1% (ranging from −0.7% to −1.4%) over the 2‐year intervention. Our observations are comparable with rates of BMD decline observed in other studies. Through the use of an active placebo, with vitamin D administered to both treatment arms, all participants likely benefited from the current intervention given that vitamin D, combined with calcium, has a well‐documented role in bone health, with evidence that higher serum 25(OH)D is associated with greater BMD in older adults. Given that both groups received vitamin D, it can be assumed that any effect of B‐vitamin intervention on BMD decline was independent of vitamin D.

### Does higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels will harm bone mineral density? a cross-sectional study [^111SMwSw]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated a clear association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and total bone mineral density among the adult US population. We also revealed a significant U-shaped relationship, indicating that the serum 25(OH)D concentration associated with the highest bone mineral density was 81.1 nmol/L. The optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level for adult males is 84.8 nmol/L. For adult females, setting the threshold for vitamin D deficiency above 31.4 nmol/L is crucial, as lower 25(OH)D levels are not conducive to BMD. Moreover, they provide clinicians and researchers with a critical reference point for designing and implementing targeted interventions to optimise bone health outcomes in this population. Our study advances our understanding of the interplay between vitamin D status and bone health, paving the way for more effective strategies to combat osteoporosis and related conditions.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^11521r9m]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — 25(OH)D testing and targets indicates that serum 25(OH)D measurement is recommended in men at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, including men with osteomalacia, osteoporosis, malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease, bariatric surgery, etc.), and liver disease, as well as older men with a history of falls and those taking medications that alter vitamin D status, such as some anticonvulsants. Many experts support a minimum desirable 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/liter) for bone health, whereas a committee of the IOM concluded that 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/liter) was adequate for bone health; it should be noted that the IOM recommendations are for healthy individuals and may not be appropriate for patients with osteoporosis, and for men at high risk of fracture, we are recommending a target 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/ml, consistent with The Endocrine Society 2011 Clinical Practice Guidelines on Evaluation, Treatment, and Prevention of Vitamin D Deficiency.

Summary of Vitamin D Deficiency-associated Clinical Outcomes

The long-known skeletal benefits of vitamin D and calcium related to rickets or osteoporosis remain valid. Most reported extraskeletal benefits of vitamin D were not confirmed by recent, large RCTs (see Table 3). The gradual increase in vitamin D levels in Western populations may explain these null findings, and older trials and meta-analyses may be more likely to show benefits because individuals were more likely to be vitamin D deficient than they are nowadays. RCTs and metanalyses published to date do not have adequate power to evaluate important subgroups, such as individuals with low 25(OH)D levels, men, the very old, ethnic groups other than White individuals, and those from low-income countries. Moreover, most of the studies use adverse events data to identify fractures and were performed in adults who were vitamin D replete at baseline in whom benefit would be unlikely and toxicity possible. Such studies confound the identification of possible beneficial effects in vitamin D–deficient individuals who might benefit from supplementation. Thus, when it comes to vitamin D, it is advisable to "giveth to those who needeth". In fact, the benefit-to-risk ratio for vitamin D depends on the target population and medical condition. It would be incorrect to extrapolate vitamin D guidelines that apply to the general population (such as those from the US National Academic of Medicine) to avoid vitamin D deficiency (ie, rickets, osteomalacia) and promote bone health to special populations for whom the benefit-to-risk ratio of vitamin D would be different.

Nonetheless, RCTs, MR studies, and metanalyses suggest a link between vitamin D status with the immune system and diabetes, as well as fleeting effects on some CV events and some benefits on mortality risk when vitamin D 3 is used.

### Shared genetic architecture and causal relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and bone mineral density [^116NLLvN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitectural deterioration, poses considerable health risks to nearly one-fifth of the global population. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), the major circulating form of vitamin D, plays a pivotal role in calcium and mineral homeostasis, bone modeling, and bone remodeling. Epidemiologically, the relationship between serum 25OHD and BMD has been extensively explored over the decades — whereas some observational studies demonstrated a plausible relationship for lower levels of serum 25OHD with a decreased BMD, others failed to establish any association. Clinically, the inconsistent evidence further amplifies the complexity of the underlying connection. While guidelines from the National Osteoporosis Group and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists suggest vitamin D supplementation as a strategy to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fracture, meta-analyses of clinical trials have not consistently supported this recommendation. Indeed, conventional epidemiological studies are susceptible to bias, confounding, and reverse causality, making it challenging to establish causal links.

One way to disentangle the conflicting findings is to conduct mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Five MR studies have evaluated the serum 25OHD-BMD causal relationship (Supplementary Table S1). While most found no significant association, a few reported a negative effect of serum 25OHD on estimated heel BMD (eBMD). Nonetheless, several major issues remain to be solved. First, these studies used data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) that were of small sample size and a restricted set of instrumental variables (IVs), thereby lacking sufficient statistical power and potentially resulting in false-negative findings. Second, existing MR studies neglected sex- and age-specific effects, despite observational studies indicating apparent sex and age disparity. Third, prospective studies have identified both higher and lower levels of serum 25OHD contributing to the susceptibility of osteoporosis, implying a nonlinear relationship, which was not examined in the current MR studies. Last but not least, existing MR studies overlooked the adjustment of obesity (ie, body mass index [BMI]), a crucial confounder determined by observational studies.

It reports that "an estimated 97.5% of the population will have their vitamin D needs met at a serum level of 20 ng/mL (49.9 nmol/L) and risk for deficiency, relative to bone health, begins to occur at levels less than 12 to 20 ng/mL (29.9–49.9 nmol/L)". Additionally, a report based on 2014 survey data found that 5% of persons 1 year or older had very low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels (< 12 ng/mL) and 18% had levels between 12 and 19 ng/mL.

Materials and Methods

Study Design and Ethics

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending-dose study. This study was conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice Guideline as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation, the Declaration of Helsinki, and/or all applicable federal and local regulations. This study was approved by all institutional review boards of the investigators' institutions, as appropriate. All volunteers provided written informed consent before any study procedures were initiated.

Participants

Healthy male and female adults (aged 21–60 years) with body mass index ranging from 20 through 32 kg/m² were eligible for the study. All participants were required to be in good health, with women being of nonchildbearing potential (sterile or postmenopausal) and men and their partners of childbearing potential expected to use contraception.

Key exclusion criteria included any clinically significant history of active systemic disease (including but not limited to endocrine/metabolic disorders that may affect calcium levels or bone), malignancies, recent acute illness, positive results on a hepatitis panel or HIV test, abnormal vital sign measurements, or psychiatric disorders. Adults with abnormal laboratory values that suggested a clinically significant underlying disease were also excluded from participation. Exclusion criteria also included serum calcium or endogenous intact PTH(1–84) outside normal reference ranges, abnormal liver or kidney function, or a 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration less than 20 ng/mL. Potential participants were excluded if they used medications, supplements, and other substances before and during the study that may have affected the collection or interpretation of study results or placed a participant at unnecessary risk. Calcium supplements and calcium or vitamin D–containing multivitamins were to be discontinued once eligibility was confirmed.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112MjSb2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D use in adults aged 50 to 74 years — In the general population aged 50 to 74 years, we suggest against routine vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily for those aged 50 to 70 years; 800 IU [20 μg] daily for those older than 70 years).

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

Monitoring vitamin D status during treatment

Monitoring treatments is important to assess their efficacy and safety. Regarding vitamin D supplementations, there is limited evidence for when to monitor response to therapy or toxicity.

When it comes to achieving sufficiency in deficient patients, it seems there is no need to monitor differently according to different dosage regimens (dose and/or frequency) or baseline 25(OH)D serum values. The increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration after supplementation follows a curvilinear response with the increase of the cumulative doses. The delta increase over 100 IU depends on baseline levels, and there is less increase per 100 IU with high doses than low doses. Van Groningen et al calculated that the cholecalciferol loading dose required to reach the serum 25(OH)D target level of 75 nmol/L can be calculated as dose (IU) = 40 × [75 − serum 25(OH)D] × body weight. Mean 25(OH)D levels over a 2-month period are similar to daily, weekly, or monthly administrations (although monthly dosing is associated with more variability), and sufficiency can be reached independently from the baseline 25(OH)D values. In the study by Fassio et al, all participants normalized 25(OH)D safely, regardless of dosing regimens and including patients receiving 10 000 IU/day for the first 8 weeks; moreover, no cases of hypercalcemia were recorded. With regard to recent megatrials results, no effects were found on serum calcium or calciuria unless very high doses were used, such as 4000 to 10 000 IU per day in the Calgary study. Furthermore, these studies did not confirm the modestly increased risk of kidney stones observed in the WHI trial (400 IU per day). However, there might be a need for monitoring in case of other vitamin D metabolite use. As discussed earlier, calcifediol acts much more rapidly than cholecalciferol in increasing serum 25(OH)D levels, resulting in greater fluctuation of 25(OH)D levels. For example, supplementation with 20 μg (800 IU) of cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) increases 25(OH)D concentrations toward 70 nmol/L (28 ng/mL) within 16 weeks, while supplementation with 10 or 15 μg calcifediol (25(OH)D) increases 25(OH)D levels more than 75 nmol/L (> 30 ng/mL) in 8 and 4 weeks, respectively.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^117Vf6Hh]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — bone maintenance with glucocorticoids: Bone density assessments by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of lumbar vertebrae and hips should be performed at baseline in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis and every 2–3 years in adult patients with ongoing risk factors, with common risks including past or prolonged glucocorticoids, postmenopausal status, history of low-trauma fracture, and age (> 65 years for women and > 70 years for men). For patients on glucocorticoid therapy, elemental calcium (1,000–1,200 mg daily) and vitamin D (at least 400–800 IU daily) has been recommended. Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, ≤ 29 ng/mL) occurs in 68%-81% of patients with AIH, and severe deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, < 20 ng/mL) occurs in 20%; clinical trials support the use of bisphosphonates when osteoporosis is present. Guidance statements specify that bone mineral densitometry should be performed at baseline in all adult AIH patients with osteoporosis risk factors and repeated every 2–3 years of continuous glucocorticoid treatment, and that serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be determined at diagnosis and annually thereafter.

### Calcifediol is superior to cholecalciferol in improving vitamin D status in postmenopausal women: a randomized trial [^111JdkGm]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a strong consensus that 25(OH)D levels < 25 nmol/L (10 ng/ml) reflect severe vitamin D deficiency. However, there is no consensus about the threshold that should be reached to be within optimal levels. Some societies recommend 50 nmol/L (20 ng/ml), whereas others recommend 75 nmol/L (30 ng/ml).

There are several alternatives for vitamin D deficiency treatment: cholecalciferol (D3), ergocalciferol (D2), or calcifediol (25‐hydroxycholecalciferol). However, few supplementation guidelines mention the latter, because it is not broadly available worldwide.

Routine monitoring of 25(OH)D levels in patients supplemented with vitamin D is not necessary in the general population according to guidelines. However, it is recommended in the high‐risk subgroups and for specific conditions. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is considered one of these conditions, because antiresorptive and anabolic treatments should be accompanied by vitamin D and calcium supplements. The most commonly recommended standard dose for vitamin D in this population is 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).

In Spain, calcifediol has been available as a prescription drug and widely used for more than 40 years. The efficacy of calcifediol oral solution has been demonstrated in various population groups and different studies. Moreover, these small‐scale trials have shown that calcifediol is more potent and faster than cholecalciferol in terms of raising 25(OH)D levels.

The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of calcifediol in the correction and maintenance of 25(OH)D levels in postmenopausal women. It also compared calcifediol 0.266 mg soft capsules with cholecalciferol treatment, at doses recommended by current guidelines. Results reported here are from a prespecified interim analysis for the evaluation of the study's primary endpoint: the percentage of patients with 25(OH)D levels above 30 ng/ml after 4 months. Additional analyses were done on the change in 25(OH)D levels according to subgroups.

### Standardizing vitamin D assays: the way forward [^1172k3oe]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

For a number of years it has been widely assumed that measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration is the best approach to assessing an individual's vitamin D status. However, it has also been recognized that there is substantial within-assay variation in 25(OH)D measurement and even greater between-assay variability. Such assay variation clearly confounds attempts to define what constitutes the diagnosis of hypovitaminosis D. Importantly, assay variability makes pooling of 25(OH)D results from different studies in systematic reviews for the specific purpose of determining dose-response and/or clinical cut points at best problematic. Therefore, to develop and implement evidence-based clinical guidelines, it is essential that 25(OH)D measurement be standardized in both clinical and research laboratories. In this Perspective we outline a way forward toward achieving this goal-the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP).

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116sT4h1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Numerous studies demonstrate associations between serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and a variety of common disorders, including musculoskeletal, metabolic, cardiovascular, malignant, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Although a causal link between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and many disorders has not been clearly established, these associations have led to widespread supplementation with vitamin D and increased laboratory testing for 25(OH)D in the general population. The benefit-risk ratio of this increase in vitamin D use is not clear, and the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain.

Objective

To develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower the risk of disease in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 14 clinically relevant questions related to the use of vitamin D and 25(OH)D testing to lower the risk of disease. The panel prioritized randomized placebo-controlled trials in general populations (without an established indication for vitamin D treatment or 25[OH]D testing), evaluating the effects of empiric vitamin D administration throughout the lifespan, as well as in select conditions (pregnancy and prediabetes). The panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that (a) exceeds the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and (b) is implemented without testing for 25(OH)D. Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 14 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and guide recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from a patient representative and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations. The process to develop this clinical guideline did not use a risk assessment framework and was not designed to replace current DRI for vitamin D.

Results

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D supplementation for children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years to prevent nutritional rickets and because of its potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections; for those aged 75 years and older because of its potential to lower the risk of mortality; for those who are pregnant because of its potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and neonatal mortality; and for those with high-risk prediabetes because of its potential to reduce progression to diabetes. Because the vitamin D doses in the included clinical trials varied considerably and many trial participants were allowed to continue their own vitamin D-containing supplements, the optimal doses for empiric vitamin D supplementation remain unclear for the populations considered. For nonpregnant people older than 50 years for whom vitamin D is indicated, the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent use of high doses. The panel suggests against empiric vitamin D supplementation above the current DRI to lower the risk of disease in healthy adults younger than 75 years. No clinical trial evidence was found to support routine screening for 25(OH)D in the general population, nor in those with obesity or dark complexion, and there was no clear evidence defining the optimal target level of 25(OH)D required for disease prevention in the populations considered; thus, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in all populations considered. The panel judged that, in most situations, empiric vitamin D supplementation is inexpensive, feasible, acceptable to both healthy individuals and health care professionals, and has no negative effect on health equity.

Conclusion

The panel suggests empiric vitamin D for those aged 1 to 18 years and adults over 75 years of age, those who are pregnant, and those with high-risk prediabetes. Due to the scarcity of natural food sources rich in vitamin D, empiric supplementation can be achieved through a combination of fortified foods and supplements that contain vitamin D. Based on the absence of supportive clinical trial evidence, the panel suggests against routine 25(OH)D testing in the absence of established indications. These recommendations are not meant to replace the current DRIs for vitamin D, nor do they apply to people with established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Further research is needed to determine optimal 25(OH)D levels for specific health benefits.

### Heterogeneity in serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D response to cholecalciferol in elderly women with secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency [^116Pto8z]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the effects on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) of two dosing regimens of cholecalciferol in women with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPTH) and hypovitaminosis D and to investigate variables affecting 25(OH)D response to cholecalciferol.

Design

Randomized-controlled trial with 6-month follow-up.

Setting

Two osteoporosis centers in northern Italy.

Participants

Sixty community-dwelling women aged 65 and older with sHPTH and hypovitaminosis D, creatinine clearance greater than 65 mL/min and without diseases or drugs known to influence bone and vitamin D metabolism.

Intervention

Cholecalciferol 300,000 IU every 3 months, once at baseline and once at 3 months (intermittent D(3) group) or cholecalciferol 1,000 IU/day (daily D(3) group).

Measurements

Serum PTH, 25(OH)D, calcium, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, β-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, phosphate, 24-hour urinary calcium excretion.

Results

The two groups had similar baseline characteristics. All participants had vitamin D deficiency [25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL)], and 36 subjects (60%) had severe deficiency (< 10 ng/mL), with no difference between the groups (severe deficiency: intermittent D(3) group, n = 18; daily D(3) group, n = 18). After 3 and 6 months, both groups had a significant increase in 25(OH)D and a reduction in PTH. Mean absolute increase ± standard deviation of 25(OH)D at 6 months was higher in the intermittent D(3) group (22.7 ± 11.8 ng/mL) than in the daily D(3) group (13.7 ± 6.7 ng/mL, P < .001), with a higher proportion of participants in the intermittent D(3) group reaching desirable serum concentration of 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL (55% in the intermittent D(3) group vs 20% in the daily D(3) group, P < .001). Mean percentage decrease of PTH in the two groups was comparable, and at 6 months, a similar proportion of participants reached normal PTH values. 25(OH)D response to cholecalciferol showed a wide variability. In a logistic regression analysis, body mass index and type of treatment appeared to be significantly associated with normalization of 25(OH)D values.

Conclusion

Cholecalciferol 300,000 IU every 3 months was more effective than 1,000 IU daily in correcting vitamin D deficiency, although the two groups achieved similar effects on PTH at 6 months. Only 55% of the higher-dose intermittent group reached desirable concentrations of 25(OH)D, suggesting that yet-higher doses will be required for adequate vitamin D repletion.

### Discrepant influence of vitamin D status on parathyroid hormone and bone mass after two years of calcium supplementation [^112wtU2S]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the influence of vitamin D status on parathyroid hormone and bone mass after a 2-year supplementation of calcium alone.

Patients and Methods

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in healthy postmenopausal women without osteoporosis: three hundred and thirty-six subjects aged 60–97 years were studied and randomized to receive elemental calcium 500 mg/day (n = 175) or placebo (n = 161) for 2 years.

Measurements

Changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone mineral density (BMD) from baseline and vitamin D status. Values are presented as means ± SD.

Results

After 2 years, subjects with calcium supplementation had significant decrease in plasma PTH level (4.4 ± 1.7 vs 4.7 ± 1.9 pmol/l, P < 0.01), improved lumbar BMD (1.031 ± 0.12 vs 1.004 ± 0.12 g/cm², P < 0.001) and total hip BMD (0.890 ± 0.10 vs 0.883 ± 0.10 g/cm², P < 0.001) without change in femoral neck BMD. In the placebo group, PTH level significantly increased (4.8 ± 1.6 vs 4.5 ± 1.5 pmol/l, P < 0.001), lumbar BMD slightly increased (1.027 ± 0.14 vs 1.018 ± 0.14 g/cm², P < 0.001), total hip and femoral neck BMD decreased (0.876 ± 0.11 vs 0.887 ± 0.11 g/cm², P < 0.001 and 0.783 ± 0.10 vs 0.798 ± 0.10 g/cm², P < 0.001, respectively). When subjects were classified according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels into those with 25(OH)D in the lower tertile (lowVitD) and those in the middle and upper tertiles combined (normVitD). The degree of PTH suppression after calcium supplementation was significantly higher in the normVitD compared to the lowVitD groups (-5.6 ± 26.7%vs 1.3 ± 27.2%, P < 0.05). No effect of vitamin D status on the change in lumbar BMD after calcium supplementation was demonstrated. Despite the higher suppression of PTH, there was a slight decrease in femoral neck BMD after calcium supplementation in the normVitD group while femoral neck BMD was more or less maintained in the lowVitD group (-0.6 ± 3.2%vs 0.5 ± 2.9%, P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Calcium supplementation appears to affect femoral bone mass less in Thai postmenopausal women with adequate vitamin D status, despite higher suppression of PTH.
