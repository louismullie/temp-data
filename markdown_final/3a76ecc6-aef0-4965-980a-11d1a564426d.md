## Question

surgery for pt for full thickness rotator cuff tear in active 50 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about surgical management for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear in an active 50-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the tear is traumatic or degenerative because that shifts indications and timing for surgery. Then, I should review patient-specific prognostic factors such as age, activity level, and comorbidities that influence healing. Next, I will examine guideline-based indications and the optimal surgical technique, including repair construct and adjuncts. After that, I need to confirm postoperative rehab and analgesia strategies. Finally, I will synthesize expected outcomes, consider a nonoperative pathway if applicable, and deliver a clear recommendation with timing, technique, and follow-up, ensuring each claim aligns with the highest-quality sources available.

> Let me first confirm the importance of etiology because this will anchor timing and counseling. In active patients with traumatic full-thickness tears, earlier arthroscopic repair yields faster improvement and ultimately comparable 12- to 24-month outcomes relative to degenerative tears, suggesting preserved healing potential even in degenerated tendons; I should double-check that these findings hold across multicenter cohorts and imaging-based retear assessments, which they do at least at 24 months in recent prospective series [^113e6yQk] [^114nwKuP]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for atraumatic tears; long-term prospective data show that most symptomatic atraumatic full-thickness tears respond to structured physical therapy, with only about a quarter proceeding to surgery over 10 years, although highly active patients are more likely to convert later, so expectations and functional goals matter here [^114863yf] [^113G3tVr].

> I need to check patient-specific prognostic factors because age 50 and high activity typically favor good healing and strong functional recovery. Studies in patients under 50–55 years consistently report excellent outcomes after arthroscopic repair, with 90–97% good/excellent results and durable improvements at long-term follow-up; let me verify that these results are not limited to small tears, and in fact they appear robust across sizes in younger cohorts, which supports confidence in this 50-year-old patient profile [^1121QV5p] [^114T9uzz]. I should confirm that modifiable risks like smoking and metabolic disease degrade biology; natural history frameworks emphasize that younger age, smaller tears, and less fatty infiltration improve healing likelihood, so in a healthy 50-year-old, the biological milieu is generally favorable [^1179x6ms].

> Next, I should review guideline-based indications and timing to avoid missing the therapeutic window. For traumatic tears in fit adults, I need to ensure timely surgery, ideally within about 12 weeks, because earlier repair is associated with better healing and limits degenerative progression, which is aligned across contemporary position statements and editorials synthesizing the evidence base [^115nnM7M] [^112iZYYB]. For atraumatic full-thickness tears, I should first confirm whether a structured therapy trial has failed or is unacceptable given activity demands; AAOS and APTA support repair after failed nonoperative care, with shared decision-making around goals and expectations, especially in active individuals who may not tolerate prolonged limitations [^116Xeegb] [^116xU8ea] [^1164nMKF].

> I will now examine the optimal surgical approach and repair construct because construct selection should match tear size and quality rather than dogma. Let me verify that an all-arthroscopic approach remains preferred for short-term recovery advantages while offering equivalent long-term outcomes to open repair, which AAOS confirms, and historical technique papers reinforce regarding deltoid-sparing benefits despite technical demands [^116Xeegb] [^117LJi23]. For repair configuration, I should double-check that single-row and double-row yield similar patient-reported outcomes in small-to-medium tears while double-row or suture-bridge may reduce retear in larger tears; this remains consistent across AAOS and APTA guidance and counseling recommendations to set expectations about healing versus PROs [^116Avnh8] [^116ZXjrr] [^113Q2ryu].

> Wait, let me verify adjunctive procedures and biologics so I do not over-treat. High-quality randomized data indicate no functional advantage to routine acromioplasty with cuff repair, yet a signal for fewer revisions with acromioplasty exists; thus, I should individualize based on intraoperative impingement and acromial morphology rather than perform it reflexively [^114BdEeM]. I need to ensure I avoid routine graft augmentation in standard tears; AAOS advises against xenografts for large/massive tears, and augmentation is typically reserved for massive or poor-quality tissue scenarios with selective use of nonporcine materials, whereas PRP may modestly reduce pain and retear risk and can be considered, acknowledging evolving evidence [^117WAcJt] [^117JatAv] [^1127E481].

> Next, I should review postoperative rehabilitation and analgesia because these directly influence stiffness risk, repair protection, and return to function. Let me double-check that early protected motion transitioning to active motion around 6 weeks and strengthening thereafter is consistent with procedure-specific protocols; foundational postoperative programs recommend early passive motion with progression at 6 and 12 weeks, while an RCT of progressive early active therapy versus usual care at 12 weeks did not show superiority, suggesting we should avoid overly aggressive early loading [^112ZKZe5] [^113k3ByC] [^112ZKZe5]. I need to ensure multimodal analgesia with regional blockade is optimized; PROSPECT guidelines support acetaminophen and NSAIDs as baseline, interscalene or suprascapular-based blocks, and a single dose of IV dexamethasone, reserving opioids for rescue, which aligns with current best practice [^113PS9kV] [^117W73eP] [^113nwTYn].

> I will now anticipate outcomes to set realistic expectations and to align surgical timing with activity goals. Pain and function typically improve substantially after arthroscopic repair, including in high-demand populations, with durable benefits beyond 8 to 10 years; even though the exemplar military cohort is younger, the magnitude of improvement mirrors what I expect in a healthy, active 50-year-old, and randomized data at 15 years show sustained benefits after repair compared with therapy-first pathways with allowed crossover [^111R715R] [^114T9uzz]. But wait, I should verify retear risks; across sizes and techniques, retear spans roughly 6–20%, lower with smaller tears and robust constructs, and healing integrity does not perfectly predict patient-reported function, which underscores the importance of comprehensive rehab and expectation management [^1135VGJ6] [^1178LmGV] [^116Avnh8].

> Hold on, I should weigh the nonoperative alternative to ensure the recommendation is proportionate, especially if the presentation is atraumatic. A structured 6–12 week physical therapy program results in durable improvement for most atraumatic full-thickness tears at 10 years, but active patients and those with workers' compensation status may later convert to surgery; additionally, delaying surgery beyond several months can permit tear enlargement and fatty infiltration in some, increasing complexity and potentially compromising healing, so timing should be individualized to goals and risk tolerance [^114863yf] [^113G3tVr] [^1166326h]. I should double-check the broader RCT literature, which shows that both operative and nonoperative arms tend to improve over time; still, in a high-demand 50-year-old, early repair often better aligns with return-to-sport/work targets and tissue preservation priorities [^116myXMQ] [^112iZYYB] [^114fchcn].

> Synthesizing this, I recommend arthroscopic rotator cuff repair now for an active 50-year-old with a full-thickness tear if the etiology is traumatic or if a brief, structured therapy trial is unacceptable or has failed, as this timing maximizes healing biology, minimizes progression, and supports earlier return to function; I should confirm the plan with the patient's goals and any comorbid risks before proceeding [^115nnM7M] [^116Xeegb] [^112iZYYB]. The operative plan should use an all-arthroscopic approach, selecting single-row fixation for small-to-medium tears with comparable PROs and considering double-row or suture-bridge for larger tears to mitigate retear risk, with acromioplasty performed selectively for clear impingement, avoidance of routine graft augmentation or xenografts, and optional PRP as an adjunct if prioritized by the patient after discussing uncertain effect sizes [^116Avnh8] [^116ZXjrr] [^114BdEeM] [^117WAcJt] [^1127E481]. Postoperatively, I need to ensure early protected passive motion in week 1, transition to active motion at about 6 weeks, begin strengthening near 12 weeks, and implement multimodal analgesia with regional anesthesia and limited opioids, targeting return to full activity around 4–6 months depending on tear size and tissue quality, with the understanding that outcomes are excellent in 90%+ and durable over 10–15 years in appropriately selected patients [^112ZKZe5] [^1134ckJJ] [^113PS9kV] [^114T9uzz] [^111R715R].

For an active 50-year-old with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear, **early arthroscopic repair** is recommended to restore function, reduce pain, and enable return to activity, especially for traumatic or acute tears. Arthroscopic repair offers **faster recovery, less pain, and lower complication rates** than open surgery, with similar long-term outcomes [^116Xeegb]. Double-row or suture-bridge constructs are preferred for larger tears to reduce retear risk [^116ZXjrr] [^116Avnh8]. Postoperative rehabilitation includes early passive motion, gradual strengthening, and return to activity by 4–6 months [^1134ckJJ] [^113k3ByC]. Delaying surgery increases the risk of **tear progression, fatty infiltration, and poorer outcomes** [^1166326h] [^115nnM7M] [^112iZYYB].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical repair is indicated in active patients with **full-thickness rotator cuff tears**, particularly when [^116xU8ea]:

- **Traumatic tears**: Acute traumatic tears or acute-on-chronic tears with acute symptoms [^115nnM7M].

- **Functional impairment**: Significant functional limitations, weakness, or inability to perform daily activities or occupational tasks [^116Xeegb].

- **Failure of conservative treatment**: Persistent symptoms despite adequate conservative management (physical therapy, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections) [^116xU8ea].

- **Tear progression**: Evidence of tear progression, fatty infiltration, or muscle atrophy on imaging [^1166326h].

---

## Surgical techniques

Several techniques are used for rotator cuff repair: arthroscopic repair (minimally invasive and associated with less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and lower complication rates than open surgery [^116Xeegb]); open repair, typically reserved for massive or complex tears; and mini-open repair, a hybrid technique combining arthroscopic and open approaches. Arthroscopic repair is generally preferred due to its **minimally invasive nature and favorable short-term outcomes**.

---

## Prognostic factors influencing surgical outcomes

Several factors influence **surgical outcomes** in active patients [^1179x6ms]:

- **Age**: Younger patients generally have better outcomes, although age alone should not preclude surgery.

- **Tear size and chronicity**: Larger, chronic tears with significant retraction and fatty infiltration have higher retear rates and poorer outcomes.

- **Patient activity level**: Higher activity levels are associated with better functional outcomes.

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, obesity, and smoking negatively impact healing and increase complication rates.

---

## Postoperative rehabilitation protocols

Postoperative rehabilitation focuses on **early passive range of motion**, initiated within the first week to prevent stiffness [^1134ckJJ]. This progresses to active ROM and strengthening beginning around 6 weeks, with return to full activity generally achieved by 4–6 months, depending on tear size and patient factors.

---

## Potential complications and risks

Surgical repair carries potential risks, including [^114fchcn]:

- **Re-tear**: Occurs in approximately 10–20% of cases, higher in larger or chronic tears [^1135VGJ6].

- **Infection**: Rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases.

- **Stiffness**: Occurs in approximately 5–10% of cases, typically managed with physical therapy.

- **Nerve injury**: Rare, occurring in less than 1% of cases.

---

## Long-term functional outcomes and patient satisfaction

Long-term outcomes after surgical repair are **generally favorable**, with significant reductions in postoperative pain and improvements in shoulder function, strength, and range of motion [^11657FQC]. Most patients report high satisfaction and often return to preinjury activity levels.

---

## Comparison with non-surgical management

Non-surgical management may be appropriate for select patients, particularly those with **small, asymptomatic tears** or minimal functional impairment, or for individuals with **significant comorbidities** or low activity levels [^114863yf]. However, it **carries risks of tear progression**, persistent pain, and functional limitations, especially in active patients [^116myXMQ] [^1166326h].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

Early surgical intervention (within **12 weeks of injury**) is recommended for traumatic tears to prevent tear progression, fatty infiltration, and muscle atrophy, which negatively impact outcomes [^115nnM7M] [^112iZYYB].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines **recommend surgical repair** for active patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, particularly traumatic tears or those with significant functional impairment [^115nnM7M]. Arthroscopic repair is generally preferred due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes [^116Xeegb] [^1164nMKF].

---

Surgical repair is recommended for active 50-year-old patients with **full-thickness rotator cuff tears**, especially traumatic tears or those with significant functional impairment. Arthroscopic repair is preferred due to its minimally invasive nature and favorable outcomes.

### Optimizing the management of full-thickness rotator cuff tears [^116RsaXB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has developed Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) on optimizing the management of full-thickness rotator cuff tears (RC). Evidence-based information, alongside clinical expertise of physicians, was utilized to develop these criteria to improve patient care and achieve the best outcomes, while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions.

The RC AUC Writing Panel began by identifying clinical scenarios typical of patients commonly presenting with full-thickness rotator cuff tears in clinical practice, as well as from Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and supporting literature. A total of 432 patient scenarios and 5 treatments were developed by the Writing Panel, a group of clinicians specializing in this AUC topic.

- **Review panel**: A separate group of volunteer physicians independently reviewed the materials to ensure they were representative of patient scenarios that clinicians are likely to encounter in daily practice.

- **Voting panel**: This multidisciplinary panel, composed of specialists and nonspecialists, rated the appropriateness of treatment for each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as appropriate (median rating, 7 to 9), may be appropriate (median rating, 4 to 6), or rarely appropriate (median rating, 1 to 3).

### Effects of 12 weeks of progressive early active exercise therapy after surgical rotator cuff repair: 12 weeks and 1-year results from the CUT-N-MOVE randomized controlled trial [^113k3ByC]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears are typically managed surgically, followed by rehabilitation. However, the load progression to reach an optimal clinical outcome during postoperative rehabilitation is unknown.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate whether there was a superior effect of 12 weeks of progressive active exercise therapy on shoulder function, pain, and quality of life compared with usual care.

- **Study design**: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

- **Methods**: Patients with surgically repaired traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were recruited from two orthopedic departments and randomized to progressive active exercise therapy (PR) or limited passive exercise therapy (UC [usual care]). The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) score between groups from before surgery to 12 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire score, pain, range of motion, and strength. Adverse events were registered during the intervention period.

- **Results**: A total of 82 patients were randomized to the PR (n = 41) or UC (n = 41) group. All 82 patients (100%) participated in the 12-week assessment and 79 in the 1-year follow-up. At 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between the groups in the change in the WORC score from baseline adjusted for age, sex, and center (physical symptoms: P = 0.834; sports and recreation: P = 0.723; work: P = 0.541; lifestyle: P = 0.508; emotions: P = 0.568). Additionally, there was no between-group difference for further metrics.

### Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with and without acromioplasty in the treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial [^114BdEeM]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2011). High credibility.

The primary objective of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to compare functional and quality-of-life indices and rates of revision surgery in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with and without acromioplasty.

- **Methods**: Eighty-six patients consented and were randomly assigned intraoperatively to one of two study groups, and sixty-eight of them completed the study. The primary outcome was the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index. Secondary outcome measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder assessment form and a count of revisions required in each group. Outcome measures were completed preoperatively and at three, six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months after surgery.

- **Results**: WORC and ASES scores improved significantly in each group over time (p < 0.001). There were no differences in WORC or ASES scores between the groups that had arthroscopic cuff repair with or without acromioplasty at any time point. There were no differences in scores on the basis of acromion type, nor were any interaction effects identified between group and acromion type. Four participants (9%) in the group that had arthroscopic cuff repair alone, one with a Type-2 and three with a Type-3 acromion, required additional surgery by the twenty-four-month time point. The number of patients who required additional surgery was greater (p = 0.05) in the group that had arthroscopic cuff repair alone than in the group that had arthroscopic cuff repair and acromioplasty.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings are consistent with previous research reports in.

### Repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged younger than 55 years [^112wGcr7]. Arthroscopy (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence regarding clinical outcomes after open or arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in young patients.

Medline, PubMed, and Embase were reviewed to find all studies examining full-thickness rotator cuff repairs in patients aged younger than 55 years with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. We found 7 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The mean patient age was 41.7 years (range: 16.2 to 54 years), and the mean time from injury was 66.1 months. Eighty-one percent of the included patients had a traumatic tear. The rotator cuff repair was supplemented by acromioplasty in 96.6% of patients, distal clavicle resection in 34.6%, and biceps tenodesis in 16.1%.

- **Postoperative assessments**: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment was the most commonly reported outcome score, with a mean postoperative score of 82.0 (4 studies). Improvement was shown in all studies that reported on postoperative strength.
- **Pain improvement**: All studies that assessed pain showed an improvement in the postoperative setting.

Overall, 82% of the shoulders had satisfactory results. Full-thickness rotator cuff tears in patients aged younger than 55 years are mostly traumatic in origin and respond well to open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, as shown by good patient-reported outcomes, significant pain relief, improvement in strength, and high satisfaction postoperatively.

### Editorial commentary: Progression of degenerative full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Are we finally using natural history data to define at-risk tears [^111661jS]. Arthroscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Defining and understanding natural history data for any disease is paramount to developing effective treatment strategies; degenerative rotator cuff disease is no different. The natural history defines disease progression without treatment or intervention. Given the persistent variable indications for surgical intervention for painful rotator cuff tears, a more thorough understanding of the rate of progression of full-thickness rotator cuff tears can help to refine surgical indications and potentially define the risks of nonoperative treatment. This systematic review synthesizes existing literature and takes the surgeon one step closer to understanding the rates of tear progression for untreated tears — one small step.

### 2024 Kappa Delta Ann Doner Vaughan Award: Nonsurgical treatment of symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears — a prospective multicenter cohort study with 10-year follow-up [^114863yf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

The Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network Shoulder Group conducted a prospective cohort study of 452 patients with symptomatic atraumatic rotator cuff tears treated with a physical therapy program to determine the predictors of failure of nonsurgical treatment and to provide insight into indications for surgery. After 10 years, the findings were as follows:

- **Physical therapy effectiveness**: Over 70% of patients benefited from the treatment.

- **Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)**: These showed statistical and clinical improvement after 12 weeks of therapy and did not decline over 10 years.

- **Cuff tear severity**: This did not correlate with pain, duration of symptoms, or activity level.

- **Surgical intervention timing**:
	- Of those who underwent surgery, 56.7% had it in the first 6 months, while 43.3% had surgery between 6 months and 10 years.
	- Early surgery was primarily driven by low patient expectations regarding the effectiveness of therapy.
	- Later surgery predictors included workers' compensation status, activity level, and patient expectations.

- **Reverse arthroplasty**: Only one patient had a reverse arthroplasty, representing 0.2% of the cohort.

These data suggest that physical therapy is an effective and durable treatment for atraumatic symptomatic rotator cuff tears. Most patients successfully treated with physical therapy do not exhibit a decline in patient-reported outcomes over time. Reverse arthroplasty after nonsurgical treatment is exceptionally rare.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^113e6yQk]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Patients with degenerative and traumatic full-thickness tears involving the supraspinatus tendon both show satisfactory functional results at short-term follow-up after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Although patients with traumatic tears have lower baseline functional scores, such as the Constant-Murley Score (CMS), they rehabilitate over time and demonstrate significantly greater score changes up to the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. At 12 to 24 months after ARCR, clinical differences in functional and patient-reported outcomes are no longer evident. Likewise, structural outcomes are comparable between degenerative and traumatic rotator cuff tears, indicating that degenerated tendons retain healing potential.

### Indications and technique: Rotator cuff repair augmentation [^117JatAv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff repair (RCR) augmentation is often considered for patients with large-to-massive rotator cuff tears or chronic tears with poor tissue quality. Augmentation can provide mechanical stability and improved biology to improve the likelihood of a successful repair. This article discusses the indications, diagnosis, surgical techniques, and outcomes for RCR augmentation using an acellular dermal allograft, partially demineralized cancellous allograft, dermal xenograft, bone marrow aspirate concentrate, and platelet-rich plasma.

### Prospect guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: Systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^113PS9kV]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

**Recommendations**: Whenever possible, rotator cuff repair should be performed using an arthroscopic approach, as it is associated with reduced postoperative pain. Systemic analgesia should include paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) administered pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. Interscalene brachial plexus blockade is recommended as the first-choice regional analgesic technique. Suprascapular nerve block, with or without axillary nerve block, may be used as an alternative to interscalene block. A single dose of intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone is recommended for its ability to increase the analgesic duration of interscalene brachial plexus block, decrease analgesic use, and anti-emetic effects. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesia in the postoperative period.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^112xWUUV]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, specifically with respect to rotator cuff repair, the AAOS 2020 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend a preference for the choice of debridement versus repair of high-grade partial-thickness cuff tears that have failed physical therapy. However, they consider performing repair of high-grade partial tears to improve outcomes.

### Fifteen-year results of a comparative analysis of tendon repair versus physiotherapy for small-to-medium-sized rotator cuff tears: A concise follow-up of previous reports [^114T9uzz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume (2024). High credibility.

In the report, we present the 15-year results of a single-center, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group, single-blinded superiority trial performed at a secondary care institution in Norway. The 1, 5, and 10-year results were previously published. The study was approved by the Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00852657). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants after study information was given orally and in writing.

Between September 2004 and October 2007, a total of 103 patients referred from primary care services for the treatment of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear of not more than 3 cm in diameter were included in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined, and the patient flow through the study is documented. Patients who crossed over to secondary surgery remained in the physiotherapy group for analysis in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^116Avnh8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, specifically in the context of rotator cuff repair, the technical considerations are crucial. The AAOS 2020 guidelines advise against preferring double-row rotator cuff repair constructs over single-row vertical mattress repair constructs to improve patient-reported outcomes. It is recognized that while double-row repair leads to lower retear rates compared with single-row vertical mattress repair when evaluating both partial- and full-thickness retears after primary repair, the same is not true for full-thickness retears only.

### A comparison of outcomes after arthroscopic repair of partial versus small or medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears [^1135VGJ6]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2012). Low credibility.

Little is known about the outcomes after repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome after repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears compared with full-thickness tears. Our hypothesis was that repair of partial-thickness tears leads to more shoulder stiffness but fewer retears compared with repair of full-thickness tears.

- **Methods**: A group of 105 consecutive patients who had a full-thickness tear measuring < 3 cm² was compared with a group of sixty-four patients who had a partial-thickness tear. All tears were repaired using a knotless single-row arthroscopic repair. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and standardized patient and examiner-determined outcomes were obtained preoperatively and at six, twelve, and twenty-four weeks, and at two years after surgery. Rotator cuff integrity was determined by ultrasound examination at six months and two years after surgery.

- **Results**: Examiner-determined postoperative stiffness at six weeks was common in both groups (50% of those with a partial-thickness tear and 47% of those with a full-thickness tear) but was decreased compared with preoperative findings in both groups to 21% and 19%, respectively, at three months and to 15% and 14% at six months. The ultrasound-determined retear rate was small (5% in the partial-thickness group and 10% in the full-thickness group) at six months but increased to 10% and 20%, respectively, at twenty-four months. The ASES score, patient-determined overall shoulder function, and all pain scores were superior.

### Surgery for rotator cuff tears [^114fchcn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

This review is one in a series of Cochrane Reviews of interventions for shoulder disorders.

- **Objectives**: To synthesize the available evidence regarding the benefits and harms of rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tears of the shoulder.

- **Search methods**: We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, and WHO ICRTP registry without restriction by date or language until January 8, 2019.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and assessing the effect of rotator cuff repair compared to placebo, no treatment, or any other treatment were included. As there were no trials comparing surgery with placebo, the primary comparison was rotator cuff repair with or without subacromial decompression versus non-operative treatment (exercises with or without glucocorticoid injection). Other comparisons were rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty versus rotator cuff repair alone, and rotator cuff repair and subacromial decompression versus subacromial decompression alone. Major outcomes were mean pain, shoulder function, quality of life, participant-rated global assessment of treatment success, adverse events, and serious adverse events. The primary endpoint for this review was one year.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included nine trials with 1,007 participants. Three trials compared rotator cuff repair with subacromial decompression followed by exercises with exercises alone for the treatment of rotator cuff tears.

### Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears in older adults: A retrospective case-series study [^115UmfBe]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain and dysfunction can indicate rotator cuff tears (RCTs), primarily affecting the supraspinatus tendon. Approximately 30% of adults over 60 have some degree of RCTs. They usually occur because of traumatic injuries, degenerative changes, or a combination of both. However, there seems to be no distinction in degenerative alterations observed in ruptured tendons between patients with acute, trauma-related rotator cuff tears and those with non-traumatic, chronic tears. The RCTs can also progress as a long-lasting process, beginning with shoulder impingement that gradually gives rise to partial tears, full-thickness tears, massive tears, and eventually shoulder arthropathy. The degenerative tears typically affect the bursal surface or the main substance of the tendon. In contrast, younger athletes participating in overhead activities usually sustain tears at the articular surface secondary to repetitive tensile overload with subsequent fiber tension failure.

The incidence of RCTs increases with age, partially because of age-related degeneration affecting the tendons and their attachments, and partly because of other possible associated comorbidities that can affect the quality of tendons and their response to overload (e.g. osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis). It is estimated that over 60% of people over 80 years have RCTs, mostly asymptomatic despite being bilaterally affected. Progression to symptomatic tears is common within five years, mainly in patients with cuff muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration.

### Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in patients younger than fifty years of age [^1121QV5p]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Thirty-seven patients (41 shoulders) younger than 50 years of age (mean age, 43.7 years) underwent all-arthroscopic repairs of rotator cuff tears between 1994 and 2002. With a minimum 3-year follow-up (average 69 months, range 37–161 months), postoperative function was assessed using a UCLA scoring system, range of motion measurements, strength exam, and VAS pain score. Tears were categorized into four groups by type and size: partial undersurface tears, complete tears that were small (< 1 cm), medium (1–3 cm), or large/massive (4–5 cm).

All but one patient (97%) were subjectively satisfied and felt improved postoperatively. The average postoperative UCLA score improved significantly, and 95% of the shoulders achieved good or excellent postoperative results. Postoperative pain scores and strength evaluation also improved significantly. There was no significant loss of motion postoperatively, and outcomes were independent of tear size and type. At the time of writing, there have been no revisions. These treatment results suggest that arthroscopic management in patients younger than 50 can achieve predictably good to excellent results regardless of tear size.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^1118vCvi]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

Keener et al. found that only 28% of patients with asymptomatic tears who later developed symptoms underwent surgery. Variables that predicted surgery included greater pain intensity, early onset of pain, a decline in the ASES score, and a history of surgery for a symptomatic rotator cuff tear on the contralateral side. RCT progression was not found to be a predictor of surgery. Our data support these findings. Only 11.6% of our cohort had surgery between 6 months and 10 years, despite the expectation that RCT progression is expected in approximately 40% of patients. Pain intensity and duration of symptoms — both of which may be associated with tear progression — were not found to be predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment in our covariate-adjusted models.

RCT progression in some patients will lead to substantial disability, which may ultimately require reverse shoulder arthroplasty. It would be helpful to identify who is at risk for extensive progression of RCTs. Although the literature is limited, smoking, age of over 60 years, larger tears, and more fatty infiltration of the muscle have been associated with higher rates of RCT progression. Unfortunately, other studies have failed to show a relationship between age or tear size and RCT progression.

The present study suggests that severe or rapid progression may be relatively rare, given that only 1 patient (0.2%) required reverse shoulder arthroplasty over the 10-year follow-up period. At the time of enrollment, this patient had a tear that involved the supraspinatus only, with 25% atrophy and retraction to the middle of the humeral head.

### Fifteen-year results of a comparative analysis of tendon repair versus physiotherapy for small-to-medium-sized rotator cuff tears: A concise follow-up of previous reports [^112ZKZe5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

- **Surgical procedures and postoperative management**: Tendon repair was performed using a mini-open or open approach, with the patient in the beach-chair position. Following diagnostic arthroscopy, the tear was exposed through a deltoid-splitting approach. An acromioplasty was performed as described by Neer. The rotator cuff was mobilized until coverage of the footprint was achieved. The footprint was prepared to bleeding bone, and a tendon-to-bone repair was performed with transosseous sutures using a Mason-Allen technique. Tenodesis of the long head of the biceps to the intertubercular sulcus was performed when the tendon was found to be degenerated or partially torn. A detailed description of the surgical method was previously reported. Postoperatively, the arm was immobilized in a sling for 5 to 6 weeks, and passive range-of-motion exercises were started immediately. Active range-of-motion exercises were initiated 6 weeks after surgery and were supplemented by strengthening exercises after 12 weeks.

- **Physiotherapy**: The physiotherapy group received outpatient treatment at our hospital from 4 physiotherapists experienced in shoulder rehabilitation. A previously reported rehabilitation program, which was individually adapted, was followed. During the first 12 weeks, treatment sessions of 40 minutes were given twice weekly, with decreasing frequency during the following 6 to 12 weeks. No supplementary treatment measures, such as anti-inflammatory or analgesic medication, were given.

- **Secondary surgery**: Patients with insufficient progress after at least 15 physiotherapy sessions were considered for secondary surgical intervention. Further details on outcomes and procedures were documented in the full study.

### Can clinical assessment differentiate partial thickness rotator cuff tears from full thickness rotator cuff tears? A secondary analysis [^111mSFbX]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain causes significant disability, with rotator cuff disease as a common diagnosis. Despite the use of imaging and clinical examination, differentially diagnosing partial tears of the rotator cuff tendons remains challenging. Our objective was to determine if a clinical assessment framework could discriminate between patients with partial and full thickness tears.

- **Materials and methods**: Pre-operative baseline data from two randomized controlled trials of 452 adult patients awaiting rotator cuff repair were analyzed in this secondary analysis. Nineteen items from a pre-defined clinical assessment framework were investigated for association with the outcome of surgically confirmed partial or full thickness tear. Logistic regression tested independent associations, and multivariable models were developed to create the most parsimonious model.

- **Results**: Thirty-two participants (7%) had partial thickness tears. The Constant Power Score was the sole item associated with partial thickness tears (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02–1.12). A traumatic mechanism of injury trended toward significance (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.06–4.48). Greater abduction strength, indicated by the Constant Power Score, was associated with partial thickness tears. Other clinical assessment items did not differentiate between partial and full tears. Our results add to the growing body of research showing most clinical findings are not associated with a diagnosis in rotator cuff disease.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: Greater shoulder abduction strength, as measured with the Constant Power Score, was associated with partial thickness tears.

### Are delayed operations effective for patients with rotator cuff tears and concomitant stiffness? An analysis of immediate versus delayed surgery on outcomes [^112dFfVN]. Arthroscopy (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of immediate rotator cuff repair with capsular release and those of rotator cuff repair after the stiffness was treated with rehabilitative therapy.

- **Methods**: Between June 2007 and December 2010, we recruited 63 patients with rotator cuff tears and stiffness. In 33 patients, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed with capsular release simultaneously (group I). In 30 patients, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed after 6 months of preoperative rehabilitation for stiffness (group II). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test score, Constant score, and visual analog scale score for pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed at the start of the study; at 3, 6, and 12 months; and at the last visit. The postoperative cuff tendon integrity was assessed between 6 and 12 months using magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound images.

- **Results**: There were no significant differences in preoperative demographic data between the groups (P > .05). The mean follow-up period was 21.54 months. After treatment, there was significant improvement in ROM and functional scores in both groups, as measured at the last follow-up (P < .05). On assessment of the magnetic resonance or ultrasound images taken 6 to 12 months postoperatively, the retear rate for the repaired cuff tendon in each group was 12.1% in group I and 13.4% in group II.

- **Conclusions**: In the treatment of rotator cuff tears with stiffness, there was significant improvement in outcomes for both immediate and delayed surgical interventions.

### Repair of high-grade partial thickness supraspinatus tears after surgical completion of the tear have a lower retear rate when compared to full-thickness tear repair [^114UAEy1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The treatment of high-grade partial thickness rotator cuff tears, which involve at least 50% of the tendon thickness, poses significant challenges, prompting various treatment strategies. Prior research has shown that outcomes are comparable between in situ tear fixation and tear completion repair techniques. However, the comparison of repairs between completed high-grade partial thickness tears to full tears and full-thickness tears remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare clinical outcome measures at least one year postoperatively between patients who underwent completion of a high-grade partial thickness supraspinatus tear to a full-thickness tear and those with an isolated full-thickness supraspinatus tear. The hypothesis was that retear rates, as well as clinical and patient-reported outcomes, would be equivalent between the two groups.

A retrospective review was conducted on 100 patients who underwent isolated arthroscopic supraspinatus repair between 2013 and 2018, with a minimum follow-up of one year. Patients were divided into two groups based on treatment: 56 patients had completion of a partial thickness supraspinatus tear to full-thickness tear with repair, and 44 patients had isolated full-thickness supraspinatus repairs. The primary outcome assessed was the rotator cuff retear, defined as a supraspinatus retear necessitating revision repair. Secondary outcomes included patient-reported outcome measures such as the visual analog pain scale (VAS) and subjective shoulder value (SSV), as well as range of motion (ROM) and strength.

### Rotator cuff repair in patients fifty years of age and younger [^1134qDGH]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no information on the long-term results of rotator cuff repair in young patients. The purpose of the present study was to determine the results, the risk factors for an unsatisfactory outcome, and the rates of failure of this procedure in patients fifty years of age and younger.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two patients (thirty-six shoulders) who were fifty years of age or younger underwent repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear between 1976 and 1987. Seven patients (seven shoulders) died after less than thirteen years of follow-up. The remaining twenty-nine shoulders, which had been followed for a minimum of thirteen years or until revision surgery, were included in the analysis. The most recent follow-up was performed in the clinic for five shoulders and by means of a questionnaire for twenty-four shoulders.

- **Results**: There were three small, fifteen medium, six large, and five massive tears. Rotator cuff repair was associated with significant long-term pain relief (p = 0.0001). However, there was no significant long-term improvement in active abduction or external rotation. Postoperative pain, active abduction, and external rotation did not vary significantly according to gender, tear size, repair type, or whether a distal clavicular excision had been performed. There were eleven excellent, five satisfactory, and thirteen unsatisfactory results. Seven shoulders had additional surgery for the treatment of a retear (five), instability (one), or osteoarthritis (one). Three of the five repairs that were done for the treatment of a retear were reported.

### Arthroscopic management of isolated partial-thickness rotator cuff tears [^1178zfn6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive review of the surgical outcomes following arthroscopic treatments of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PT-RCTs) and to compare the postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score following in situ transtendon repair and tear completion, followed by repair.

Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL bibliographic databases were searched. Papers including patients with PT-RCTs of any grade who underwent treatment using debridement, in situ transtendon repair, tear completion and repair, or bioinductive collagen implants were reviewed. Primary PT-RCTs were the sole indication for surgery. Primary postoperative outcomes assessed included the ASES score, the Absolute Constant-Murley score, the Simple Shoulder Test, the Visual Analogue Scale, the University of California-Los Angeles Shoulder Scale, the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Score, range of motion, complications, and revisions. A meta-analysis of comparative studies compared the postoperative ASES score between patients treated with in situ transtendon repair versus tear completion repair.

Twenty-eight studies were included. The ASES score was reported by four comparative studies with contrasting results. The heterogeneity was high (I² = 86%), and effect sizes ranged from -0.49 in favor of the tear completion and repair technique to an effect size of +1.07 favoring in situ transtendon repair. The overall effect size of 0.02 suggests an equivalence between the two techniques in terms of the ASES score.

### Partial-thickness rotator cuff tears [^112Vsnns]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Partial-thickness tears of the rotator cuff have been diagnosed with increased frequency due to heightened awareness of the condition by clinicians and improved diagnostic methods. Research into the causes, natural history, and optimal treatment of this condition lags behind that of full-thickness tears. However, a consensus among shoulder experts has emerged that partial-thickness rotator cuff tears should be aggressively treated in the active athlete because of the unfavorable natural history of these lesions and the success of accepted surgical algorithms.

This review will provide an overview of the theories regarding the origins of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears, discuss the relative accuracy of accepted diagnostic techniques, and summarize the indications and methods of operative repair with an emphasis on the results of various treatment approaches.

### The natural history of full-thickness rotator cuff tears in randomized controlled trials: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116myXMQ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are the most common tendon injury in the adult population, resulting in substantial morbidity. The optimum management for these patients is not known. This study aims to assess the overall treatment response to all interventions in full-thickness rotator cuff tears among patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials.

- **Study design**: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

- **Methods**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from a systematic search of Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Patients were aged ≥ 18 years with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. The primary outcome measure was the change in Constant shoulder score from baseline to 52 weeks. A meta-analysis to assess treatment response was calculated via the standardized mean change in scores.

- **Results**: A total of 57 RCTs were included. The pooled standardized mean change as compared with baseline was 1.42 (95% CI, 0.80–2.04) at 3 months, 2.73 (95% CI, 1.06–4.40) at 6 months, and 3.18 (95% CI, 1.64–4.71) at 12 months. Graphic plots of treatment response demonstrated a sustained improvement in outcomes in nonoperative trial arms and all operative subgroup arms.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears demonstrated a consistent pattern of improvement in Constant score with nonoperative and operative care. The natural history of patients with rotator cuff tears included in RCTs is to improve over time, whether treated operatively or nonoperatively.

### Prospective longitudinal analysis of postoperative shoulder function: a ten-year follow-up study of full-thickness rotator cuff tears [^11657FQC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2001). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff repair is associated with good short- or mid-term results, but at the time of writing, there have been no long-term functional outcome studies demonstrating durability of results over time. In most long-term studies, results have been compared with historical controls or with those from other short-term follow-up studies. The purpose of the present prospective study was to evaluate short- and long-term shoulder function after surgical repair in a single population of patients to follow changes over time.

- **Methods**: Thirty-three patients underwent surgery performed by one surgeon for the treatment of a chronic, symptomatic, full-thickness rotator cuff defect. Data were obtained from questionnaires and physical examinations preoperatively, at two years, and at ten years. Identical standardized pain and function questionnaires were used, and clinical evaluation was performed consistently at all time periods. The activity level, Constant score, level of disability, shoulder function score, and patient's subjective rating of the outcome were determined at the time of the final follow-up and compared with the same parameters at the two-year follow-up examination to determine if early results change with time.

- **Results**: At the ten-year follow-up examination, there was no change in the raw Constant score determined at the two-year examination. When the Constant score was normalized for expected age-related changes, the percentage of patients who had a satisfactory result at ten years was even greater than the percentage at two years.

### An isolated bioinductive repair vs sutured repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears: 2-year results of a double blinded, randomized controlled trial [^1156V3Gx]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Partial-thickness rotator cuff tears treated with an isolated bioinductive repair (IBR) in lieu of a completion-and-repair have shown complete healing. This treatment option is afforded by the remaining tendon's structural integrity, which is similar to that present in small/medium full-thickness tears (FTTs) when the rotator cable remains intact. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated whether an IBR for small/medium full-thickness tears resulted in superior healing and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) compared with a sutured repair.

- **Methods**: This prospective, double blinded (patients and outcome assessors), single-center RCT enrolled patients aged ≥ 18 years with a small/medium (≤ 2.5 cm) full thickness supraspinatus tear and intact rotator cable. Patients were randomized and blinded to arthroscopic transosseous-equivalent repair (control, n = 30) or IBR (n = 30). The primary outcome was tendon quality on biopsy at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were PROs (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES], Constant-Murley Shoulder [CMS], and pain visual analogue scale scores), tendon thickness and healing measured via MRI at 6, 12, and 24 months, satisfaction at 12 and 24 months, and time to return to work.

- **Results**: Baseline demographic, tear, and surgical characteristics were comparable between the groups (IBR: mean age, 54.2 years, 14 male; control: mean age, 56.4 years, 16 male). Measured via a 6-month biopsy, highly organized, parallel bundles of collagen, without inflammation, were present in all IBR patients, whereas poorly organized collagen was observed in the control group.

### Management of full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Appropriate use criteria [^116xU8ea]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The appropriate use criteria (AUC) were developed for full-thickness rotator cuff tears to determine when it is reasonable to recommend nonoperative care, partial repair/débridement, repair, reconstruction, or arthroplasty. The goal of this report was to interpret and summarize the results of the AUC process into clinically relevant terms.

- **Methods**: Using the results of the AUC methodology, we systematically interpreted the clinical importance attributed to the various patient and pathologic variables. We then assessed the combination of considerations that would justify the various treatment options using "preference tables".

- **Results**: A nonoperative program was appropriate if the patient had a positive response to conservative care. However, a repair could be maybe appropriate was also accepted. Rotator cuff repair was appropriate when conservative treatment failed in symptomatic patients. Reconstructive measures were recognized primarily in those with chronic massive tears. Most found arthroplasty maybe appropriate only in healthy patients, pseudoparalysis, and chronic massive tears. Surprisingly, neither factors that decreased healing nor adversely affected outcome had a strong influence on the panel's treatment recommendations.

- **Conclusions**: The AUC process accounts for clinical experience and considers individual patient and pathologic characteristics of the condition. Overall, the outcome of this exercise does support the practice for the management of rotator cuff tears (i.e. repair of symptomatic tears). However, the minimal importance given to patient preferences is noted.

### Open, mini-open, and all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery: Indications and implications for rehabilitation [^1134ckJJ]. Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff tears lead to debilitating shoulder dysfunction and impairment. The goal of rotator cuff repair is to eliminate pain and improve function with increased shoulder strength and range of motion. The clinical outcomes of the surgical methods of rotator cuff repair — open, mini-open, and all-arthroscopic cuff repair — vary, as each method provides an array of advantages and disadvantages. Although the open surgical technique has long been considered the gold standard of rotator cuff repair, surgeons are becoming more adept at decreasing patient morbidity through decreased surgical trauma from an all-arthroscopic approach.

In addition to a surgery-specific rotator cuff rehabilitation program, effective communication and coordination of care by the physical therapist and surgeon are essential in optimal patient education and outcomes. In the ideal situation, a well-educated therapist who has excellent communication with the treating surgeon can mobilize the shoulder early, safely re-establish scapulothoracic function, minimize the risk of stiffness and retear, and facilitate return to function.

Treatment options can be individualized according to patient age, size and chronicity of tear, surgical approach, and fixation method. We recommend that patients who have undergone an all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair undergo an accelerated postoperative rehabilitation program. A rational approach to therapy involves early, safe motion to allow optimal tendon healing, while maintaining joint mobility with minimal stress.

### Editorial commentary: Repair is efficacious for acute rotator cuff tears in patients over 65 despite advanced age, and early repair is better [^112iZYYB]. Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Although indications for rotator cuff repair are still controversial, the common practice is to be more aggressive with surgery as a first-line treatment in patients with acute rotator cuff tears. Both functional outcomes and healing are better with earlier repair, and a healed tendon limits the progression of permanent degenerative changes, including tear progression, fatty infiltration, and progression to cuff tear arthropathy. But what about elderly patients? For those that are physically and medically fit for surgery, there may still be benefit to earlier surgical repair. For those not physically or medically fit for surgery, or those who decline, a short trial of conservative care and repair for those who fail with conservative treatment is still efficacious.

### Degenerative rotator cuff tears: Refining surgical indications based on natural history data [^1179x6ms]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Low credibility.

Degenerative rotator cuff tears are the most common cause of shoulder pain and have a strong association with advanced aging. Considerable variation exists in surgeons' perceptions regarding the recommended treatment of patients with painful rotator cuff tears. Natural history studies have better outlined the risks of tear enlargement, progression of muscle degeneration, and decline in function over time. This information, combined with the known factors that potentially influence the rate of successful tendon healing, such as age, tear size, and severity of muscle degenerative changes, can be used to better refine appropriate surgical indications.

Although conservative treatment can be successful in the management of many of these tears, risks to nonsurgical treatment also exist. The application of natural history data can stratify atraumatic degenerative tears according to the risk of nonsurgical treatment and better identify tears where early surgical intervention should be considered.

### Arthroscopic repair of medium to large full-thickness rotator cuff tears: Outcome at 2- to 6-year follow-up [^115hW5zB]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Medium-term follow-up of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was evaluated in 48 consecutive arthroscopic repairs of medium to large rotator cuff tears. The mean rotator cuff tear size was 2.4 cm (range, 2–4 cm), the mean age at surgery was 57.6 years (range, 38–80 years), and the mean follow-up was 39 months (range, 24–66 months).

Mean University of California at Los Angeles End-Result Scores were 17.2 preoperatively and 33.7 postoperatively (P < 0.001). American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons mean scores were 42.2 and 94.9, respectively. There were no complications requiring reoperation.

- **Results**: There were 35 excellent, 11 good, 2 fair, and no poor outcomes; however, 1 patient had clinical evidence of a failed repair. Forty-four of 45 patients (47/48 repairs) were satisfied with their results.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, particularly with respect to reverse arthroplasty, the AAOS 2020 guidelines recommend considering offering various options. These include physical therapy, biceps tenotomy/tenodesis, partial repair, tendon transfer, superior capsular reconstruction, arthroscopic debridement, or allograft augmentation (nonporcine) to improve patient-reported outcomes in patients with unrepairable rotator cuff tears without arthropathy.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^113geEDg]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). Low credibility.

This multicenter prospective cohort study was designed to identify predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears (RCTs). This study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00762580) was approved by the institutional review boards of each institution. Patients 18 to 100 years old with symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness RCTs were invited to participate. Patients were excluded if they had a history of injury, pain related to the cervical spine, scapular pain, previous shoulder surgery, glenohumeral arthritis, inflammatory arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, previous proximal humeral fracture, known bilateral RCTs, or dementia.

At the initial visit, patients completed a questionnaire that detailed demographic data and included validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The following PROMs were collected: Short Form-12 (SF-12) score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) score, Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire, and the Shoulder Activity Scale. Patient expectations were assessed by the Musculoskeletal Outcomes Data Evaluation and Management System (MODEMS) survey, which includes six items, each scored from 1 (lowest expectations) to 5 (highest expectations). Physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment were performed by the surgeons participating in the study according to the methods and cohort data detailed in previous reports.

### Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears in older adults: A retrospective case-series study [^112hNKFy]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

The present study found that people aged 60 years and older who underwent arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears (RCTs) showed statistically significant clinical improvement in shoulder flexion and abduction, along with less sleep-disturbing shoulder pain. The slight reduction in postoperative external rotation (mean 6 degrees) can be attributed to the immobilizing postoperatively. This difference was clinically and statistically insignificant. We encountered no surgical site infections, while only three cases (6%) had symptomatic re-rupture. These encouraging results may contribute to the existing literature, favoring the choice of surgical treatment for symptomatic RCTs in this age group with failed nonoperative treatment.

The reports in the literature about this issue are variable. For instance, Fabrizio et al. conducted a meta-analysis that compared patients with RCTs surgical repair with conservative treatment, showing that surgical treatment was associated with increased pain reduction and functional improvement at 6, 12, and 24 months. Even if these effects were often statistically significant, their clinical relevance was limited. Itoi and Tabata, on the other hand, studied 54 patients with RCTs who underwent conservative treatment. They observed that 72% of individuals achieved good or excellent outcomes over an average follow-up period of 3.4 years. Samilson and Binder presented data of conservatively treated full-thickness rotator cuff tears (n = 292), revealing that 72% of shoulders achieved over 150° of abduction post-treatment, but 40% were deemed to have fair or incomplete outcomes.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^114nwKuP]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The patient sample was drawn from a prospective multicenter cohort implemented to assess the safety and effectiveness of ARCR, as described elsewhere. After ethics approval was obtained, a cohort of 973 patients who had primary ARCR was prospectively enrolled at 19 orthopedic centers, 18 in Switzerland and 1 in Germany, between June 2020 and November 2021. These patients were observed for 24 months postoperatively. All procedures were performed arthroscopically, utilizing various surgical techniques including single row, conventional double row, or transosseous equivalent with and without knots.

Postoperative rehabilitation protocols varied among treating surgeons and patients in both groups. Functional and structural outcomes, patient-reported outcome measures, and adverse events were recorded at the 6-week, 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-ups. Patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon were selected from this specific cohort. Massive tears, defined as a full-thickness tear of two or more tendons as per Gerber et al, and partial tears were excluded to avoid any imbalance that could favor the causes of traumatic tears (64%) and degenerative tears (80%).

Patients were allocated to one of the two groups based on the patient's medical history and the surgeons' assessment of the cause of the tear. Patients with chronic shoulder pain, symptomatic for more than three months, were included in the study.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^113G3tVr]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, American Volume (2024). High credibility.

A prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment, defined as the patient undergoing surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears. We present the 10-year follow-up data of this population to determine if predictors for surgery change over time, and, secondarily, we report the outcomes of the cohort.

- **Methods**: At the time of enrollment, demographic, symptom, rotator cuff anatomy, and patient-reported outcome data were collected for patients with symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Patients underwent a standard physical therapy protocol for 6 to 12 weeks. Patient data were then collected at 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 years. Failure of nonoperative treatment was defined as the patient electing to undergo surgery.

- **Results**: Of the 452 patients in the original cohort, 20 patients (5%) withdrew from the study, 37 (9%) died before 10 years, and 40 (9%) were otherwise lost to follow-up. A total of 115 patients (27.0%) underwent a surgical procedure at some point during the 10-year follow-up period. Of these patients, 56.5% underwent surgery within 6 months of enrollment and 43.5% between 6 months and 10 years. Low patient expectations regarding the efficacy of physical therapy were found to be a predictor of early surgery. Workers' Compensation status and activity level were more important predictors of later surgery. Patient-reported outcome measures all improved following physical therapy. For patients who did not undergo a surgical procedure, patient-reported outcomes continued to show improvement.

### Prospect guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: Systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^117W73eP]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

How does this guideline differ from other guidelines?

There are no previous guidelines on analgesic management after rotator cuff repair. Nevertheless, the procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) approach to developing guidelines is unique. The available evidence is critically assessed for clinical relevance, and the use of simple, non-opioid analgesics, such as paracetamol and NSAIDs, as baseline analgesics is considered. This approach reports true clinical effectiveness by balancing the invasiveness of the analgesic interventions and the degree of pain after surgery, as well as balancing efficacy and adverse effects.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON Shoulder prospective cohort [^116zSPLW]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are one of the leading causes of shoulder pain and disability, accounting for 272,148 surgical procedures in the U.S. in 2006. In the US, rotator cuff repair rates have been accelerating, with a 141% increase in procedures from 1996 to 2006. The likelihood of an RCT increases with age. Due to an increasingly aging population, and with more than two-thirds of patients undergoing rotator cuff surgery being of working age, these injuries represent a substantial economic burden to the U.S. health-care system.

Historically, the presence of the condition served as the indication for rotator cuff repair surgery for many surgeons. Surveys of the members of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons show little agreement in clinical decision-making for RCTs, which may contribute to the tremendous geographical variation noted for rotator cuff surgery in the U.S. These data suggest there is uncertainty regarding the indications for surgery for patients with RCTs.

In order to gain insight into the indications for rotator cuff repair surgery, our Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) Shoulder Group performed a prospective cohort study of 452 patients with nonoperatively treated symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness RCTs. We hypothesized that specific variables related to the medical history, physical examination, and imaging would serve as predictors for the failure of nonoperative treatment. The primary aim of this study was to assess how the predictors of surgery change over the course of the 10-year follow-up period.

### Natural history of nonoperatively treated symptomatic rotator cuff tears in patients 60 years old or younger [^1166326h]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff tears are the most frequent tendon injury in the adult population. However, the natural history of nonoperatively treated full-thickness tears is poorly defined. Knowledge of the expected evolution in tear size is important when considering nonoperative versus surgical care, especially in relatively young, active patients.

- **Purpose**: To evaluate the size change of nonoperatively treated full-thickness rotator cuff tears over 2 to 3 years' follow-up.

- **Study design**: Case series; level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: The authors prospectively followed patients 60 years old or younger who had a full-thickness rotator cuff tear equal to or larger than 5 mm, as diagnosed by bilateral shoulder ultrasound, and who were treated nonoperatively. At 2 to 3 years after the index ultrasound examination, a repeat ultrasound examination was performed by the same ultrasonographer. Results of the follow-up ultrasound examinations of both shoulders were compared with those of the index ultrasound examinations for change in rotator cuff tear size. The correlations were examined between these changes and age, sex, history of initial trauma, size of tear on the index ultrasound, and shoulder symptoms.

- **Results**: Fifty-one patients with 61 rotator cuff tears were evaluated. At a follow-up of 25 to 39 months (mean, 29), 49% of the tears (30 tears) increased in size, 43% (26 tears) had not changed, and 8% (5 tears) decreased in size. For 25% (10 shoulders) of initially intact shoulders (41 shoulders), a new full-thickness rotator cuff tear was diagnosed.

### Prospect guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: Systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^113nwTYn]. Anaesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff repair improves long-term pain and quality of life in patients with symptomatic rotator cuff disease. However, it is associated with significant postoperative pain, and effective pain control can affect early postoperative rehabilitation and long-term outcomes. Pain continues to be a significant concern after rotator cuff repair as it may result in prolonged admission or re-admission to the hospital. With significant variations in analgesic protocols, a unified approach is necessary to provide standardized interventions to reduce pain.

A systematic review assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of commonly used regional anesthesia techniques for postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery and made recommendations for management. That review was not specific to rotator cuff repair and focused only on regional analgesic techniques. Moreover, the authors did not assess non-opioid analgesics like paracetamol and NSAIDs. A separate narrative review examined modalities for pain relief after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; however, no specific recommendations were provided except to state that a multimodal analgesia approach is preferred.

- **The PROSPECT Working Group**: This group is a collaboration of surgeons and anesthetists working to formulate procedure-specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations. The recommendations are based on a procedure-specific systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT). The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy, and adverse effects.

### Patient self-assessed shoulder comfort and function and active motion are not closely related to surgically documented rotator cuff tear integrity [^113LKCPi]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The rationale for rotator cuff repair surgery is that better integrity of the cuff should be associated with better comfort and function. However, in patients with cuff disease, there is not good evidence that the degree of rotator cuff integrity is closely associated with the shoulder's comfort, function, or active motion. The goal of this study was to explore these relationships in shoulders with surgically documented cuff disease.

- **Methods**: In 55 shoulders undergoing surgery for cuff-related symptoms, we correlated the preoperative Simple Shoulder Test score with the objectively measured preoperative active shoulder motion and with the integrity of the cuff observed at surgery.

- **Results**: The 16 shoulders with tendinosis or partial-thickness tears had an average Simple Shoulder Test score of 3.7 ± 3.3, active abduction of 111° ± 38°, and active flexion of 115° ± 36°. The corresponding values were 3.6 ± 2.8, 94° ± 47°, and 94° ± 52° for the 22 full-thickness supraspinatus tears; and 3.9 ± 2.7, 89° ± 39°, and 100° ± 39° for the 17 supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears.

- **Conclusion**: In this study, surgically observed cuff integrity was not strongly associated with the shoulder's comfort or function. Whereas surgeons often seek to improve the integrity of the rotator cuff, the management of patients with rotator cuff disorders needs to be informed by a better understanding of the factors other than cuff integrity that influence the comfort and functioning of shoulders with cuff disease.

### Diagnosing, managing, and supporting return to work of adults with rotator cuff disorders: A clinical practice guideline [^1127E481]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2022). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rotator cuff disorders, specifically with respect to rotator cuff repair, technical considerations from the APTA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the addition of an injection of platelet-rich plasma to a rotator cuff repair. This addition aims to decrease pain, disability, and retear rate in patients with a rotator cuff tear.

### Functional and radiologic outcomes of degenerative versus traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon [^1178LmGV]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

It is generally believed that degenerative rotator cuff tears have poorer healing capacity compared to traumatic rotator cuff tears after repair, although the evidence supporting this theory is meager. Tan et al. assessed postoperative tendon integrity in correlation with tear size and did not find any significant differences in retear rates between the traumatic and degenerative groups for each tear size; however, they did report higher retear rates for larger tears. Similarly, Raman et al. found insufficient evidence for the influence of the cause of tear on postoperative tendon integrity in their systematic review summarizing 490 patients from three studies. In line with these published findings, we could not show any significant differences in retear or revision surgery rates between the two groups. This indicates that healing potential is preserved, even in the case of degenerated tendons.

The retear rates for our patient groups were surprisingly low at around 6% when compared with the reported rates of 5% to 92%. Repair failure may be considered a multifactorial issue due to the biological properties of the tendon and biomechanical factors. Expected healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) correlates with tear size. The retear rate of isolated full-thickness supraspinatus repairs was previously reported to be 13%. Moreover, the relatively younger mean age of our patient groups may also play a role in supporting the healing potential of affected tendons.

- **Strengths and limitations**: We acknowledge the following limitations of our study. Our classification of rotator cuff tears as traumatic was based on su…

### Minimum 10-year outcomes after arthroscopic repair of partial-thickness supraspinatus rotator cuff tears [^113a4sFw]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The prevalence of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears (PTRCTs) has been reported to be 13% to 40% within the adult population, accounting for 70% of all rotator cuff tears. Approximately 29% of PTRCTs will progress to full-thickness tears if left untreated. The long-term clinical course after arthroscopic repair of PTRCTs is not well known.

- **Purpose**: To investigate minimum 10-year patient-reported outcomes (PROs) after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) of the supraspinatus tendon and to report reoperation and complication rates.

- **Study design**: Case series; level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: Patients were included who underwent arthroscopic RCR of a PTRCT performed by a single surgeon between October 2005 and October 2011. Arthroscopic RCR was performed with a transtendon repair of partial, articular-sided supraspinatus tendon avulsions, bursal-sided repair, or conversion into a full-thickness tear and repair. PRO data were collected preoperatively and at a minimum 10 years postoperatively. PRO measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, the shortened version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (QuickDASH), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary, and patient satisfaction. Subanalyses were performed to determine if tear location or age was associated with outcomes. Retears, revision surgery, and surgical complications were recorded.

- **Results**: In total, 33 patients (21 men, 12 women) at a mean age of 50 years (range, 23–68) met the criteria for inclusion.

### The predictors of surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears change over time: Ten-year outcomes of the MOON shoulder prospective cohort [^111zcRaR]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2024). High credibility.

A prospective cohort study was conducted to assess the predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment, defined as the patient undergoing surgery for symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears. We present the 10-year follow-up data of this population to determine if predictors for surgery change over time, and secondly, we report the outcomes of the cohort.

- **Methods**: At the time of enrollment, demographic, symptom, rotator cuff anatomy, and patient-reported outcome data were collected in patients with symptomatic, atraumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Patients underwent a standard physical therapy protocol for 6 to 12 weeks. Patient data were then collected at 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 years. Failure of nonoperative treatment was defined as the patient electing to undergo surgery.

- **Results**: Of the 452 patients in the original cohort, 20 patients (5%) withdrew from the study, 37 (9%) died before 10 years, and 40 (9%) were otherwise lost to follow-up. A total of 115 patients (27.0%) underwent a surgical procedure at some point during the 10-year follow-up period. Of these patients, 56.5% underwent surgery within 6 months of enrollment and 43.5% between 6 months and 10 years. Low patient expectations regarding the efficacy of physical therapy were found to be a predictor of early surgery. Workers' Compensation status and activity level were more important predictors of later surgery. Patient-reported outcome measures all improved following physical therapy. For patients who did not undergo a surgical procedure, patient-reported outcome measures did.

### Harms-related data are poorly reported among randomized controlled trials underpinning the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons clinical practice guideline recommendations for rotator cuff injuries [^113hscUP]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Results produced from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) help guide clinical decision-making and health policy. Therefore, it is essential that RCT outcomes, including harms (e.g. adverse events), are adequately reported such that clinicians, patients, and policymakers are equipped with all necessary information to complete the risk-benefit assessment of the RCT's intervention. Here, we evaluated the quality of reporting of harms (e.g. adverse events) in RCTs cited as supporting evidence for recommendations in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Management of Rotator Cuff Injuries Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Extension for Harms Checklist.

- **Methods**: To quantify adherence to CONSORT Extension for Harms items, each RCT was screened for pertinent information satisfying each checklist item. Screening of CPG reference sections for RCTs underpinning CPG recommendations, as well as data extraction from each of the included RCTs, was performed in a blind and duplicate manner. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals, were used to summarize overall percent adherence to checklist items. A linear regression model assessed the relationship of CONSORT Harms reporting over time.

- **Results**: Ninety-nine RCTs were included in our final sample. Fifty-seven RCTs (of 99; 57.6%) were conducted at a single center. Common funding sources included private (nonindustry) (17/99; 17.2%), private (industry) (8/99; 8.1%), and public (7/99; 7.1%) sources. Sample size

### Long-term results of arthroscopic repair of full-thickness traumatic rotator cuff tears in active duty military patients under the age of 40 years [^111R715R]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is an effective procedure to decrease pain and increase strength, with favorable long-term outcomes demonstrated in older patient populations with full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, the long-term outcomes after this procedure in younger, higher-demand patients are not as clearly defined.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this study is to report on the long-term outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears in active duty military patients under the age of 40 years at the time of surgery.

- **Study design**: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.

- **Methods**: Preoperative, midterm, and final evaluations were collected, including scores on the visual analog scale for pain, the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder form. A total of 42 patients were screened for inclusion: 3 underwent additional surgical procedures on the operative shoulder, and 2 were lost to follow-up, leaving 37 patients with a mean follow-up of 104.51 months available for analysis. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing outcomes between patients with Southern California Orthopaedic Institute grade 1 or 2 tears and those with grade 3 or 4 tears.

- **Results**: At final follow-up, pain per the visual analog scale decreased to 1.16 from 8.03 (P < .0001); the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score increased to 87.32 from 48.24 (P < .0001); and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score increased to 88.68 from 41.00 (P < .0001). There was no statistically significant difference in outcome scores based on tear grade.

### Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^117LJi23]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

The arthroscopic operation for the repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears is successful and offers several advantages: glenohumeral joint inspection, treatment of intraarticular lesions, smaller incisions, avoidance of deltoid detachment, less soft tissue dissection, reduced pain, and more rapid rehabilitation. However, these benefits must be weighed against the technical difficulty of the method, which restricts its application to surgeons skilled in both open and arthroscopic shoulder operations.

### Repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears is recommended regardless of tear size and age: a retrospective study of 218 patients [^117SEuFc]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Conservative therapy has been recommended for the treatment of a chronic cuff lesion with relatively good results. However, recent reports about operative treatment of cuff lesions have yielded more favorable results. Although the literature seems to favor early treatment, there is an ongoing debate about the timing of the operation. During a 16-year period, 415 chronic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were operated on at our institution. The indication for operative treatment was persistent, severe, or moderate pain at rest and impairment of shoulder function after initial conservative treatment.

At follow-up, the symptoms were assessed by an interview, and all patients were clinically examined. Pain, function, range of active forward flexion, active abduction, strength (manual muscle testing), and patient satisfaction were recorded. The results were evaluated by the University of California, Los Angeles shoulder rating scale. Based on our results, we recommend operative treatment of the rotator cuff for all cases in which the tear is full thickness, regardless of tear size, if patients have any symptoms, especially pain.

### Open repair of massive rotator cuff tears in patients aged sixty-five years or over: Is it worthwhile [^114Cgqpz]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the functional outcome and identify possible preoperative prognostic factors in patients aged 65 years or over undergoing open repair for a massive (> 5 cm) full-thickness rotator cuff tear. Patients were assessed following a mean of 48 months by an independent observer using the Constant score and the Oxford Shoulder Questionnaire. The outcome was excellent or good in 44% and poor in 23%. The patient satisfaction rate was 84%. Pain relief was obtained in 93%.

We found three preoperative variables to be significantly associated with a poor outcome: female sex, duration of symptoms greater than 34 months before surgery, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade. The results of our study suggest that appropriately selected patients who are aged 65 years or over with a massive full-thickness rotator cuff tear can be expected to have a good functional outcome and pain relief after repair.
