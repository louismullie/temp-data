## Question

How far apart can I take meloxicam 15mg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how far apart they can take meloxicam 15 mg and whether more frequent dosing is safe or effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing frequency and maximum daily dose. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics, especially the half-life and time to steady state. Next, I will review safety considerations that might influence dosing intervals, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks. After that, I should check whether any clinical trials or guidelines support more frequent dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, practical answer with caveats for special populations and formulations.

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing. The FDA prescribing information for oral meloxicam states that the maximum recommended daily dose is 15 mg, typically given once daily, and that doses should be the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals. This applies across common oral formulations and indications such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis [^117Eouzx] [^111FCTkg] [^111GwLED].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic rationale for once-daily dosing. Meloxicam has a long elimination half-life of roughly 15 to 20 hours, with steady-state concentrations achieved after about 3 to 5 days of repeated dosing. A second peak around 12 to 14 hours suggests enterohepatic recycling, which helps sustain anti-inflammatory effect over 24 hours. This profile supports once-daily administration and argues against more frequent dosing for maintenance therapy [^113DV3Ae] [^116HqpBE] [^111FCTkg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about splitting the dose. I initially wondered if dividing 15 mg into 7.5 mg twice daily might improve tolerability, but I should double-check whether any label or guideline endorses that. I do not find FDA labeling that recommends twice-daily meloxicam for oral formulations, and the 15 mg maximum is per day, not per dose, so taking 15 mg more than once in 24 hours would exceed the labeled maximum and increase NSAID risk without proven benefit [^117Eouzx] [^111c6APo].

> Next, I should review safety constraints that underpin the once-daily regimen. Higher NSAID exposure increases risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation, as well as cardiovascular thrombotic events and renal toxicity. Meloxicam's pooled safety data and FDA warnings emphasize using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, which reinforces not shortening the dosing interval below 24 hours at the 15 mg dose [^116sQyy3] [^112DSUdc] [^112DSUdc].

> I need to ensure I'm not conflating oral and intravenous formulations. Intravenous meloxicam is dosed once daily in clinical trials and labeling, but that IV schedule reflects a different formulation and clinical context and should not be extrapolated to justify more frequent oral dosing. So, even though IV meloxicam is given every 24 hours, that does not change the oral once-daily maximum of 15 mg [^116RgrTU] [^117Eouzx].

> Let me consider special populations and exceptions. In renal impairment, especially eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or lower, the maximum recommended dose is reduced to 7.5 mg daily, and in hemodialysis it is often capped at 7.5 mg daily depending on the product, again as a once-daily dose. In hepatic impairment, no routine adjustment is needed for mild to moderate disease, but caution is advised in severe impairment. None of these scenarios introduce a rationale for more frequent dosing of oral meloxicam [^117Eouzx] [^notfound] [^113zZ5g4] [^111hdeyX].

> But wait, what if someone is using a fixed-dose combination product like Symbravo for migraine? I should confirm that this is a different indication and formulation. Symbravo contains 20 mg meloxicam with rizatriptan and is dosed as a single tablet as needed, with a maximum of one tablet per day; this is not a model for chronic oral meloxicam scheduling and should not be used to justify more frequent oral NSAID dosing [^116cX5ao].

> I should double-check whether any guideline or trial supports divided dosing. I do not find high-quality evidence or guidelines recommending twice-daily oral meloxicam for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, and the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles do not support it. Therefore, the standard remains once daily, with dose adjustments downward for tolerability or comorbidities rather than increasing frequency [^117Eouzx] [^111c6APo].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For oral meloxicam, the 15 mg dose should be taken once every 24 hours, not more frequently, because the labeled maximum is 15 mg per day and the long half-life sustains effect over 24 hours. Taking 15 mg more often than every 24 hours would exceed the maximum daily dose and increase NSAID-related risks without added benefit [^117Eouzx] [^113DV3Ae].

---

Meloxicam 15 mg is **once daily** [^117Eouzx] due to its long half-life of about 15–20 hours [^113DV3Ae], which provides sustained 24-hour coverage. Taking it more often than every 24 hours increases the risk of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects without added benefit [^116sQyy3] [^112DSUdc]. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but **skip it if it's within 12 hours of the next dose** to avoid doubling up. Always use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^117Eouzx].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and dosing interval

- **Half-life**: 15–20 hours, supporting once-daily dosing [^113DV3Ae].
- **Steady-state**: reached by day 5 with repeated dosing [^116HqpBE].
- **Duration**: single dose provides 24-hour analgesia/anti-inflammatory effect [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting once-daily dosing

Clinical trials show **once-daily 7.5–15 mg** is effective for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, with no added benefit from more frequent dosing [^111tH1LY] [^112tSJGT]. Higher doses (> 15 mg/day) increase GI and CV risks without improving efficacy [^116sQyy3].

---

## Risks of more frequent dosing

More frequent dosing raises the risk of:

- **GI effects**: bleeding, ulceration, perforation [^116sQyy3].
- **CV effects**: MI, stroke, hypertension, heart failure [^111iNKfY].
- **Renal effects**: acute kidney injury, renal papillary necrosis [^116sNSgr].

---

## Special populations and dose adjustments

- **Elderly**: start low, monitor closely for GI/CV/renal events [^1171VSbF].
- **Renal impairment**: max 7.5 mg/day if eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^113yeUMZ].
- **Hepatic impairment**: use caution; no routine adjustment for mild–moderate disease [^111hdeyX].

---

## What to do if a dose is missed

If a dose is missed, **take it as soon as you remember** unless it is within about 12 hours of the next dose; in that case, skip it and resume the next dose as scheduled. Do not double the dose to catch up.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines consistently recommend **once-daily dosing** at 7.5–15 mg, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^117Eouzx] [^113mMHWt].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended dose** | **Dosing frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| General adult population | 7.5–15 mg | Once daily |
| Elderly patients | 7.5 mg initially | Once daily |
| Renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 30) | 7.5 mg maximum | Once daily |
| Hepatic impairment (mild–moderate) | 7.5–15 mg | Once daily |

---

Meloxicam 15 mg should be taken **once every 24 hours**; more frequent dosing increases adverse effects without added benefit. If a dose is missed, take it if remembered early, but skip if close to the next dose.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Use for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

For intravenous administration only.

The recommended dosage of XIFYRM is 30 mg once daily, administered by intravenous bolus injection over 15 seconds.

When initiating XIFYRM, monitor patient analgesic response. Because the median time to meaningful pain relief was 2 and 3 hours after XIFYRM administration in two clinical studies, a non-NSAID analgesic with a rapid onset of effect may be needed, for example, upon anesthetic emergence or resolution of local or regional anesthetic blocks [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Some patients may not experience adequate analgesia for the entire 24-hour dosing interval and may require administration of a short-acting, non-NSAID, immediate-release analgesic [see Clinical Studies (14)].

To reduce the risk of renal toxicity, patients must be well hydrated prior to administration of XIFYRM.

Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Should the contents appear discolored or contain particulate matter, discard the vial [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3)].

2.1 General Dosing Instructions

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Meloxicam tablets and other treatment options before deciding to use Meloxicam tablets. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with Meloxicam tablets, adjust the dose to suit an individual patient's needs.

In adults, the maximum recommended daily oral dose of Meloxicam tablets is 15 mg regardless of formulation. In patients with hemodialysis, a maximum daily dosage of 7.5 mg is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Meloxicam tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals.

2.2 Osteoarthritis

For the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of Meloxicam tablets is 7.5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.

2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis

For the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of Meloxicam tablets is 7.5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.

2.4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course

For the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended oral dose of Meloxicam tablets is 7.5 mg once daily in children who weigh ≥ 60 kg. There was no additional benefit demonstrated by increasing the dose above 7.5 mg in clinical trials.

Meloxicam tablets should not be used in children who weigh < 60 kg.

2.5 Renal Impairment

The use of Meloxicam tablets in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended.

In patients on hemodialysis, the maximum dosage of Meloxicam tablets is 7.5 mg per day [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.6 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Meloxicam

Meloxicam tablets have not shown equivalent systemic exposure to other approved formulations of oral meloxicam. Therefore, Meloxicam tablets are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral meloxicam product even if the total milligram strength is the same. Do not substitute similar dose strengths of Meloxicam tablets with other formulations of oral meloxicam product.

### Spl unclassified section… [^111FCTkg]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

In adults, the maximum recommended daily oral dose of meloxicam is 15 mg regardless of formulation. In patients with hemodialysis, a maximum daily dosage of 7. 5 mg is recommended. Meloxicam tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals.
2. 2 Osteoarthritis For the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of meloxicam tablets is
7. 5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.
2. 3 Rheumatoid Arthritis For the relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended starting and maintenance oral dose of meloxicam tablets is
7. 5 mg once daily. Some patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg once daily.
2. 4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course.

To improve dosing accuracy in smaller weight children, the use of the meloxicam oral suspension is recommended. For the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended oral dose of meloxicam is 0. 125 mg/kg once daily up to a maximum of
7. 5 mg. There was no additional benefit demonstrated by increasing the dose above 0. 125 mg/kg once daily in these clinical trials. Therefore, it is recommended that meloxicam dosage in this population not exceed 7. 5 mg per day. Hemodialysis did not lower the total drug concentration in plasma; therefore, additional doses are not necessary after hemodialysis. Meloxicam is not dialyzable. There is limited experience with meloxicam overdose. Four cases have taken 6 to 11 times the highest recommended dose; all recovered. Cholestyramine is known to accelerate the clearance of meloxicam.

Mean Cmax was achieved within four to five hours after a 7. 5 mg meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption. With multiple dosing, steady-state concentrations were reached by Day 5. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.

### Meloxicam [^116sQyy3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1a depicts adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2% of the Meloxicam treatment groups in a 12-week placebo- and active-controlled osteoarthritis trial.

Table 1b depicts adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2% of the Meloxicam treatment groups in two 12-week placebo-controlled rheumatoid arthritis trials.

The adverse events that occurred with Meloxicam in ≥ 2% of patients treated short-term (4 to 6 weeks) and long-term (6 months) in active-controlled osteoarthritis trials are presented in Table 2.

Higher doses of Meloxicam (22.5 mg and greater) have been associated with an increased risk of serious GI events; therefore, the daily dose of Meloxicam should not exceed 15 mg.

Pediatrics

Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA)

Three hundred and eighty-seven patients with pauciarticular and polyarticular course JRA were exposed to Meloxicam with doses ranging from 0.125 to 0.375 mg/kg per day in three clinical trials. These studies consisted of two 12-week multicenter, double-blind, randomized trials (one with a 12-week open-label extension and one with a 40-week extension) and one 1-year open-label PK study. The adverse events observed in these pediatric studies with Meloxicam were similar in nature to the adult clinical trial experience, although there were differences in frequency. In particular, the following most common adverse events, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and pyrexia, were more common in the pediatric than in the adult trials. Rash was reported in seven (< 2%) patients receiving Meloxicam. No unexpected adverse events were identified during the course of the trials. The adverse events did not demonstrate an age or gender-specific subgroup effect.

The following is a list of adverse drug reactions occurring in < 2% of patients receiving Meloxicam in clinical trials involving approximately 16,200 patients.

### Single dose oral meloxicam for acute postoperative pain in adults [^113qxiH2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used mainly in treating pain associated with arthritis. The usual oral dose for osteoarthritis is 15 mg daily, but lower doses of 7.5 mg are advised in older patients. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study has been used for many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of single dose oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events.

Search Strategy

We searched Cochrane CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE (June 2009); EMBASE (June 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral meloxicam for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We planned to use area under the "pain relief versus time" curve to derive the proportion of participants with meloxicam experiencing least 50% pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations; to use number needed to treat to benefit (NNT); the proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period; time to use of rescue analgesia; information on adverse events and withdrawals.

Main Results

No studies were identified by the searches that examined oral meloxicam in patients with established postoperative pain.

Authors' Conclusions

In the absence of evidence of efficacy, at present, for oral meloxicam in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes, there is no urgent research agenda.

Hepatic Impairment

Following a single 15 mg dose of meloxicam there was no marked difference in plasma concentrations in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class I) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class II) hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers. Protein binding of meloxicam was not affected by hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class III) have not been adequately studied [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Renal Impairment

Meloxicam pharmacokinetics have been investigated in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment. Total drug plasma concentrations of meloxicam decreased and total clearance of meloxicam increased with the degree of renal impairment while free AUC values were similar in all groups. The higher meloxicam clearance in subjects with renal impairment may be due to increased fraction of unbound meloxicam which is available for hepatic metabolism and subsequent excretion. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied. The use of Meloxicam in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^112tJEft]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Part 1: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- and Active-Controlled Study.

On postoperative day 1 of part 1, at approximately 6, patient-controlled analgesia was discontinued or a dose of IV morphine was administered. Subjects received a single dose of study medication in ≤ 6 hours after their 6dose of morphine and were monitored for 24 hours. Study medications were meloxicam IV (5, 7.5, 15, 30, or 60 mg), placebo (sterile dextrose 5% in water), and morphine (≈0.15 mg/kg). All medications were administered as an IV push over 1–2 minutes. Morphine 0.15 mg/kg also was used as rescue medication, administered as an IV push or a subcutaneous or an intramuscular injection.

Part 1 consisted of 2 cohorts. Subjects in cohort 1 (n = 206) were randomized using central randomization (block size: 6, 1:1:2:2 ratio) to receive placebo (n = 30), morphine (n = 30), or meloxicam IV 7.5 mg (n = 60) or 60 mg (n = 60). The meloxicam IV 7.5 mg dose was assumed to have a similar treatment effect as morphine 6 mg, with a mean total pain relief (TOTPAR) score of 16 and a standard deviation (SD) of 11.6. There was also an assumption that the mean TOTPAR and SD for the placebo group would be 9 and 9.6, respectively. To provide ≥ 80% power to detect differences between the placebo and meloxicam IV 7.5 mg groups based on these assumptions, 30 and 60 subjects were required for the placebo and meloxicam IV 7.5 mg groups, respectively. A planned and prespecified interim analysis was performed at the conclusion of cohort 1 to determine dosing for double-blind cohort 2. In cohort 2, subjects (n = 280) were randomized using central randomization (block size: 28) to receive placebo (n = 30), morphine (n = 30), or meloxicam IV 5 (n = 60), 7.5 (n = 20), 15 (n = 60), 30 (n = 60), or 60 mg (n = 20) (3:3:6:2:6:6:2 ratio). The sample size for cohort 2 was based on the same assumptions made for cohort 1 and provided ≥ 80% power to detect differences between each meloxicam IV group and the placebo group.

Specific Populations

Based on population pharmacokinetics analyses, age, sex and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the PK of meloxicam injection.

Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of XIFYRM have not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment. However, following a single 15 mg dose of meloxicam tablets there was no marked difference in plasma concentrations in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class I) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class II) hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers. Protein binding of meloxicam was not affected by hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class III) have not been adequately studied. Monitor for adverse events when used in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Renal Impairment: Meloxicam pharmacokinetics have been investigated in elderly subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60–90) compared to young healthy volunteers. A 5% and 7% increase of Cmaxand AUC, respectively, was observed in elderly subjects with mild renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment. Patients with moderate and severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied. The use of XIFYRM in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment is not recommended. XIFYRM is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency who are at risk for renal failure due to volume depletion [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].

### Dose response and safety study of meloxicam up to 22.5 mg daily in rheumatoid arthritis: a 12 week multicenter, double blind, dose response study versus placebo and diclofenac [^112tSJGT]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This Phase III, placebo and active controlled, multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg daily for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

A 12 week, randomized, double blind, double dummy, parallel group trial compared daily oral meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg to placebo (negative control) and diclofenac 75 mg BID (positive control). A total of 894 patients (18 years of age with confirmed RA who flared following an NSAID-free period) were randomized to be treated. Baseline scores for all endpoints were similar among the treatment groups. Patient assessments were at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks or early termination.

Results

All treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement from baseline (p < 0.001). Meloxicam 7.5 and 22.5 mg was significantly superior to placebo in all 5 primary efficacy endpoints (swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient pain, patient and physician global; all p < 0.05). Diclofenac 150 mg was superior to placebo for 4 of 5 primary efficacy measures (all but swollen joint count; p < 0.05) and meloxicam 15 mg was superior for 3 of 5 primary endpoints (patient pain and patient and physician global). AUC of patient global, patient pain, and modified Health Assessment Questionnaire demonstrated dose-response (p < 0.04), while AUC ACR20 showed a qualitative trend in the same direction. The rate of gastrointestinal (GI) events during the 12 week trial for all doses of meloxicam and diclofenac did not differ significantly from placebo (23.2–32.0%). GI withdrawals were comparable and not significantly different across all treatment groups (4.3–5.7%).

Conclusion

This trial demonstrated a dose response relationship for meloxicam 7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg using AUC measurement of response for the treatment of RA. All 3 doses of meloxicam. and positive control, were effective in the treatment of RA. The overall incidence rate of GI events did not differ significantly from placebo in either the meloxicam treatment groups or the positive control.

### Intravenous meloxicam for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain: a pooled analysis of safety and opioid-reducing effects [^115oGaHw]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

To describe the safety and tolerability of intravenous meloxicam compared with placebo across all phase II/III clinical trials.

Methods

Safety data and opioid use from subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain who received ≥ 1 dose of intravenous meloxicam (5–60 mg) or placebo in 1 of 7 studies (4 phase II; 3 phase III) were pooled. Data from intravenous meloxicam 5 mg, 7.5 mg and 15 mg groups were combined (low-dose subset).

Results

A total of 1426 adults (86.6% white; mean age: 45.8 years) received ≥ 1 dose of meloxicam IV; 517 (77.6% white; mean age: 46.7 years) received placebo. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in intravenous meloxicam and placebo-treated subjects was 47% and 57%, respectively. The most commonly reported TEAEs across treatment groups (intravenous meloxicam 5–15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively) were nausea (4.3%, 20.8%, 5.8% and 25.3%), headache (1.5%, 5.6%, 1.6% and 10.4%), vomiting (2.8%, 4.6%, 1.6% and 7.4%) and dizziness (0%, 3.5%, 1.1% and 4.8%). TEAE incidence was generally similar in subjects aged > 65 years with impaired renal function and the general population. Similar rates of cardiovascular events were reported between treatment groups. One death was reported (placebo group; unrelated to study drug). There were 35 serious adverse events (SAEs); intravenous meloxicam 15 mg (n = 5), intravenous meloxicam 30 mg (n = 15) and placebo (n = 15). The SAEs in meloxicam-treated subjects were determined to be unrelated to study medication. Six subjects withdrew due to TEAEs, including three treated with intravenous meloxicam (rash, localized edema and postprocedural pulmonary embolism). In trials where opioid use was monitored, meloxicam reduced postoperative rescue opioid use.

Conclusions

Intravenous meloxicam was generally well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe postoperative pain.

Methods

Study Design and Subjects

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult subjects undergoing elective unilateral TKA; it was conducted in hospital settings and was planned to require a hospital stay of ≥ 24 hours. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive meloxicam IV 30 mg or placebo IV as a bolus injection every 24 hours, consistent with meloxicam dosing recommendations. The randomization scheme was generated prior to study initiation by an independent statistician who was not involved in the study. Randomization was assigned by central Interactive Web Response Systems (IWRS), with access limited to unblinded personnel. Matching placebo was utilized to prevent unblinding. Study medication was administered in addition to a multimodal pain management protocol that included perioperative use of analgesics with differing mechanisms of action. The study was designed and monitored in accordance with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by a central Institutional Review Board (Western Institutional Review Board Protocol 20172394) and the local institutional review boards of participating institutions when required. All subjects provided written informed consent. The trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03434275; Date of registration: February 15, 2018). Each study site had its own principal investigator (Supplemental Digital Content 4, Table S3).

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

2.1 General Instructions Carefully
consider the potential benefits and risks of MOBIC and other treatment
options before deciding to use MOBIC. Use the lowest effective dose for
the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment
goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. After observing the response to initial therapy with MOBIC, adjust the dose to suit an individual patient's needs. In
adults, the maximum recommended daily oral dose of MOBIC is 15 mg
regardless of formulation. In patients with hemodialysis, a maximum
daily dosage of 7.5 mg is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), and Clinical Pharmacology
(12.3)]. MOBIC oral suspension 7.5 mg/5 mL or 15 mg/10 mL may be substituted for MOBIC tablets 7.5 mg or 15 mg, respectively. Shake the oral suspension gently before using. MOBIC may be taken without regard to timing of meals.

2.2 Osteoarthritis For
the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis the recommended
starting and maintenance oral dose of MOBIC is 7.5 mg once daily. Some
patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg
once daily.

2.3 Rheumatoid Arthritis For the relief of
the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended
starting and maintenance oral dose of MOBIC is 7.5 mg once daily. Some
patients may receive additional benefit by increasing the dose to 15 mg
once daily.

2.4 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course To
improve dosing accuracy in smaller weight children, the use of the
MOBIC oral suspension is recommended. MOBIC oral suspension is
available in the strength of 7.5 mg/5 mL. For the treatment of juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended oral dose of MOBIC is 0.125 mg/kg
once daily up to a maximum of 7.5 mg. There was no additional benefit
demonstrated by increasing the dose above 0.125 mg/kg once daily in
these clinical trials. Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis dosing using the oral suspension should be individualized based on the weight of the child:

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1134jx7H]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Rescue Medication Use.

Compared with placebo, all active treatments reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue medication in the first 24 hours postdose (P < .001). Relative to placebo subjects, those who received meloxicam IV 60 or 30 mg were 90% less likely to require rescue medication during the first 24 hours, with an HR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.16) for the meloxicam IV 60 mg group and an HR of 0.10 (95% CI, 0.06–0.17) for the meloxicam IV 30 mg group. Those who received meloxicam IV 15, 7.5, or 5 mg were 86% (HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09–0.23), 80% (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14–0.30), and 81% (HR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.12–0.29) less likely to require rescue medication in the first 24 hours, respectively.

Compared with morphine, all meloxicam IV doses reduced the likelihood of rescue medication use within the first 24 hours postdose (P ≤ .010). Relative to morphine, meloxicam IV 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg doses reduced the risk of rescue medication use in the first 24 hours by 72% (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18–0.45; P < .001), 73% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45; P < .001), 62% (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23–0.61; P < .001), 41% (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40–0.88; P = 0.010), and 45% (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35–0.85; P = 0.007), respectively.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115rDGgN]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — adult and pediatric dosing and analgesic ceiling — Studies of multiple NSAIDs have suggested an analgesic ceiling at submaximal doses — for example, 400 mg PO for ibuprofen. The recommended analgesic dose of ibuprofen is 200–400 mg as needed every 6 h PO for adults or 5–10 mg/kg for children, and in short-term applications an ibuprofen dose of 1200 mg/day or less has been shown to lead to no further adverse GI effects than placebo in otherwise healthy patients. For naproxen, recommended analgesic dosing is generally a 550 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every 12 h PO for adults, and 5 mg/kg every 12 h for children (maximum 10 mg/kg/d). Meloxicam is another PO NSAID notable for austere use in that its recommended analgesic dosing for adults is 7.5–15 mg PO as needed only once daily. Ketorolac is an NSAID that is available PO and in a parenteral form, given IV or IM; doses for adults are 15 mg IV or 30 mg IM every 6 h.

### Meloxicam [^111tH1LY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The use of Meloxicam for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, controlled trial. Meloxicam (3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, and 15 mg daily) was compared to placebo. The four primary endpoints were investigator's global assessment, patient global assessment, patient pain assessment, and total WOMAC score (a self-administered questionnaire addressing pain, function, and stiffness). Patients on Meloxicam 7.5 mg daily and Meloxicam 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in each of these endpoints compared with placebo.

The use of Meloxicam for the management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was evaluated in six double-blind, active-controlled trials outside the U.S. ranging from 4 weeks' to 6 months' duration. In these trials, the efficacy of Meloxicam, in doses of 7.5 mg/day and 15 mg/day, was comparable to piroxicam 20 mg/day and diclofenac SR 100 mg/day and consistent with the efficacy seen in the U.S. trial.

The use of Meloxicam for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, controlled multinational trial. Meloxicam (7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 22.5 mg daily) was compared to placebo. The primary endpoint in this study was the ACR20 response rate, a composite measure of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures of RA response. Patients receiving Meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in the primary endpoint compared with placebo. No incremental benefit was observed with the 22.5 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^1132dm6f]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of an intravenous (IV) nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following a standardized unilateral bunionectomy.

Methods

Fifty-nine subjects aged 18–72 years were randomized to receive doses of either 30 mg (n = 20) or 60 mg (n = 20) meloxicam IV or placebo (n = 19), administered once daily as bolus IV injections over 15–30 seconds (two or three doses). Safety, the primary objective, was assessed by physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Efficacy was evaluated by examining summed pain intensity differences over the first 48 hours (SPID 48) using analysis of covariance models. Use of opioid rescue analgesic agents was evaluated.

Results

Generally, AEs were mild-to-moderate in intensity, and their incidence was similar across the three treatment groups. No serious AEs were reported; there were no withdrawals due to AEs, including injection-related AEs. The estimated effect size for SPID 48 versus placebo was 1.15 and 1.01 for meloxicam IV doses 30 mg and 60 mg, respectively (P ≤ 0.01). Both doses produced significantly greater pain reductions versus placebo (P ≤ 0.05) at all evaluated times/ intervals during the 48-hour period. The proportions of subjects with ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% overall reduction in pain from baseline after 6 and 24 hours were significantly higher with meloxicam IV 30 mg doses versus placebo, but not with meloxicam IV 60 mg doses. The time to first use of rescue medication was significantly longer versus placebo with meloxicam IV 60 mg (P < 0.05), but not with meloxicam IV 30 mg doses.

Conclusion

Meloxicam IV was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate-to-severe post-bunionectomy pain. Once-daily administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg and 60 mg exhibited rapid onset of analgesia (as early as 15 minutes) with maintenance of analgesic effect for two consecutive 24-hour periods.

### Safety and efficacy of meloxicam in the treatment of osteoarthritis… [^116HqpBE]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

In previous studies, meloxicam has been found to be safe and effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis at doses of 7. 5 to 15 mg daily. To evaluate a lower dose and a different patient population, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of meloxicam vs placebo and diclofenac for the treatment of OA among patients with symptom exacerbations. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached after 3 to 5 days with administration of 7. 5 and 15 mg/d, with a plasma elimination half-life of 20 hours. Meloxicam is extensively protein bound and is metabolized in the liver, with equal excretion of inactive metabolites in the urine and feces. In 6-month, double-blind trials, meloxicam, 15 mg/d, is comparable to piroxicam, 20 mg/d, and diclofenac, 100 mg/d. 12, 13. Efficacy is evident by 28 days in comparing the withdrawals due to lack of efficacy in the placebo group with the withdrawals in the meloxicam and diclofenac treatment groups. The difference between the 3.

75-mg/d meloxicam dosage and the higher dosages of meloxicam is also clear, with a withdrawal rate of 18% in the
3. 75-mg/d group and a 9% withdrawal rate in the 7. 5- and 15-mg/d groups. For both patient's and investigator's final global assessment of efficacy, the 7. 5- and 15-mg/d dosages of meloxicam and diclofenac were statistically significantly superior to placebo for all comparisons. The mean rate of consumption of rescue medication on treatment was significantly lower in all the meloxicam groups compared with placebo. In conclusion, the data reported herein confirm and extend previous data showing that meloxicam at dosages of 7. 5 to 15 mg/d is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for OA.

Meloxicam demonstrated efficacy with no dose response for GI tolerability-related adverse events, thus allowing for flexibility of dosing.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1131HL77]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

An intravenous (IV) formulation of meloxicam was developed for moderate-to-severe pain management. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of meloxicam IV after open abdominal hysterectomy. Meloxicam IV is an investigational product not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

METHODS:

Women (N = 486) with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of meloxicam IV (5–60 mg), placebo, or morphine (0.15 mg/kg) in ≤ 6 hours after morphine dosing on postoperative day 1 and were evaluated for 24 hours. Rescue morphine (≈0.15 mg/kg IV) was available if needed for pain not relieved by the study medication. In an open-label extension (N = 295), meloxicam IV was administered once daily for the remaining hospital stay (or per the investigator's discretion). The coprimary efficacy end points were the summed pain intensity difference (SPID 24) and total pain relief (TOTPAR 24) from hour 0 to 24 hours after dosing. Effect size, the standardized difference between means reported in standard deviation (SD) units, was calculated to indicate the magnitude of the difference in the mean analgesic effect measured for different intervention groups.

RESULTS:

Subjects who received morphine or meloxicam IV had a median time to first perceptible pain relief within 6–8 minutes. Morphine and meloxicam IV 5–60 mg produced statistically significant differences than placebo in SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24. SPID 24 (standard error [SE]) for meloxicam IV 5–60 mg ranged from −56276.8 (3926.46) to −33517.1 (3930.1; P < .001); SPID 24 (SE) for morphine and placebo were −29615.8 (3869.2; P < .001) and 4555.9 (3807.1), respectively. SPID 24 effect sizes (95% confidence intervals) for the 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg meloxicam IV doses and morphine were 1.93 (1.61–2.25), 2.00 (1.65–2.35), 1.70 (1.35–2.05), 1.28 (0.95–1.60), 1.25 (0.90–1.61), and 1.12 (0.77–1.45) SDs, respectively. TOTPAR 24 (SE) for meloxicam IV 5–60 mg ranged from 3104.5 (155.28) to 4130.4 (191.17; P < .001); TOTPAR 24 (SE) for morphine and placebo were 2723.3 (188.4; P < .001) and 1100.6 (185.4), respectively. TOTPAR 24 effect sizes (95% confidence interval) for the 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg meloxicam IV doses and morphine were 2.03 (1.70–2.35), 2.05 (1.70–2.40), 1.78 (1.43–2.13), 1.35 (1.03–1.67), 1.37 (1.01–1.72), and 1.10 (0.75–1.45) SDs, respectively. The mean total opioid consumed (SD) during the double-blind phase was 4.6 (8.17), 5.3 (8.85), 5.9 (7.85), 8.5 (9.67), 9.3 (9.47), 9.6 (8.12), and 16.0 (10.15) mg for patients in the 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg meloxicam IV, morphine, and placebo groups, respectively. Generally, meloxicam IV was well tolerated, evidenced by the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo and lack of deaths and treatment-related serious adverse events.

CONCLUSIONS:

A meloxicam IV dose of 5–60 mg was generally well tolerated and appeared to reduce opioid consumption in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy. Once-daily administration of meloxicam IV produced analgesic effect within 6–8 minutes postdose that was maintained over a 24-hour dosing interval.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does the intravenous (IV) formulation of nanocrystal meloxicam provide appropriate analgesia in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy?
Findings: Meloxicam IV at doses of 5–60 mg produced statistically significant improvements in the summed pain intensity difference and total pain relief over the first 24 hours after dosing (coprimary end points) compared with placebo; in addition, there were no deaths or treatment-related serious adverse events.
Meaning: Meloxicam IV was well tolerated and produced analgesic effect for moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy.

Meloxicam is a preferential cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. – Orally administered meloxicam is indicated for management of chronic conditions, including the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Oral meloxicam is not indicated for the management of acute pain largely due to its relatively slow absorption rate; mean maximum plasma concentrations are not achieved until 9–11 hours after oral administration of a 30 mg dose.

A nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam (Recro Pharma, Inc, Malvern, PA) was developed for bolus intravenous (IV) administration to provide faster onset of pain relief than can be achieved with oral administration. In a phase 2 study conducted in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after a standardized bunionectomy procedure, once-daily dosing of meloxicam IV (30 or 60 mg) had a low incidence of adverse events (AEs) and injection-related events and demonstrated onset of analgesia in ≤ 15 minutes of administration that was maintained throughout 2 sequential 24-hour dosing periods. In another phase 2 study, meloxicam IV (15, 30, or 60 mg) was administered to subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after surgical removal of impacted third molars. In this study, meloxicam IV reduced moderate-to-severe pain compared with placebo and an active control (ibuprofen 400 mg); onset of pain relief began as early as 10 minutes after administration and was maintained throughout the 24-hour inpatient study period. Furthermore, meloxicam IV appeared to have a generally favorable safety profile.

Part 2: Open-Label Extension.

Meloxicam IV was administered once daily for the remainder of each subject's hospital stay or at the discretion of the investigator based on the subject's needs. Subjects treated with meloxicam IV in part 1 continued on the same dose in part 2. A second computer-generated randomization was created for subjects who received morphine or placebo in part 1 who were eligible to receive meloxicam IV (5, 7.5, 15, 30, or 60 mg) in part 2. Open-label randomization was assigned by the site coordinator or investigator. Subjects were hospitalized for ≥ 24 hours after the last dose of open-label meloxicam IV to complete safety assessments.

Outcome Measures

Safety and Efficacy Populations.

All subjects who received study medication were included in the safety analysis, and all subjects who received study medication and had ≥ 1 efficacy assessment were included in the efficacy analysis.

End Points.

The coprimary efficacy variables were the summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over the first 24 hours postdose (SPID 24) and the sum of the time-weighted pain relief scores over the first 24 hours postdose (TOTPAR 24). SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24 are accepted regulatory standard measures that combine magnitude and duration of relief into a single score. To assess pain intensity, subjects used a 100-mm VAS anchored at 0 for no pain and 100 for the worst imaginable pain. Pain intensity differences (PIDs) were determined by subtracting the baseline pain intensity score from each postdose pain intensity score. SPID was calculated as the sum of the time-weighted PID (difference between current pain and pain at baseline) multiplied by the interval between ratings. SPID represents the area under the PID curve. More negative SPID scores demonstrate greater cumulative pain reduction.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis The use of MOBIC for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind,
controlled trial. MOBIC (3.75 mg, 7.5 mg, and 15 mg daily) was compared
to placebo. The four primary endpoints were investigator's global assessment, patient global assessment, patient pain assessment, and total WOMAC score (a self-administered questionnaire addressing pain, function, and stiffness). Patients on MOBIC 7.5 mg daily and MOBIC 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in each of these endpoints compared with placebo. The use of MOBIC for the management of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis was evaluated in six double-blind, active-controlled trials
outside the U.S. ranging from 4 weeks' to 6 months' duration. In these
trials, the efficacy of MOBIC, in doses of 7.5 mg/day and 15 mg/day, was comparable to piroxicam 20 mg/day and diclofenac SR 100 mg/day and consistent with the efficacy seen in the U.S. trial. The use of MOBIC for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis was evaluated in a 12-week, double-blind, controlled multinational trial. MOBIC (7.5 mg, 15 mg, and 22.5 mg daily) was compared to placebo. The primary endpoint in this study was the ACR20 response rate, a composite measure of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures of RA response. Patients receiving MOBIC 7.5 mg and 15 mg daily showed significant improvement in the primary endpoint compared with placebo. No incremental benefit was observed with the 22.5 mg dose compared to the 15 mg dose. 14.2 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JRA) Pauciarticular and Polyarticular Course The use of MOBIC for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis
in patients 2 years of age and older was evaluated in two 12-week,
double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled trials. Both studies
included three arms: naproxen and two doses of meloxicam. In both
studies, meloxicam dosing began at 0.125 mg/kg/day (7.5 mg maximum) or 0.25 mg/kg/day (15 mg maximum), and naproxen dosing began at 10 mg/kg/day. One study used these doses throughout
the 12-week dosing period, while the other incorporated a titration
after 4 weeks to doses of 0.25 mg/kg/day and 0.375 mg/ kg/day (22.5 mg maximum) of meloxicam and 15 mg/kg/day of naproxen. The
efficacy analysis used the ACR Pediatric 30 responder definition, a
composite of parent and investigator assessments, counts of active
joints and joints with limited range of motion, and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate. The proportion of responders were similar in all three groups in both studies, and no difference was observed between the meloxicam dose groups.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^115Y1NBS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

An intravenous (IV) formulation of meloxicam was developed for moderate-to-severe pain management. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of meloxicam IV after open abdominal hysterectomy. Meloxicam IV is an investigational product not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Methods

Women (N = 486) with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of meloxicam IV (5–60 mg), placebo, or morphine (0.15 mg/kg) in ≤ 6 hours after morphine dosing on postoperative day 1 and were evaluated for 24 hours. Rescue morphine (≈0.15 mg/kg IV) was available if needed for pain not relieved by the study medication. In an open-label extension (N = 295), meloxicam IV was administered once daily for the remaining hospital stay (or per the investigator's discretion). The coprimary efficacy end points were the summed pain intensity difference (SPID24) and total pain relief (TOTPAR24) from hour 0 to 24 hours after dosing. Effect size, the standardized difference between means reported in standard deviation (SD) units, was calculated to indicate the magnitude of the difference in the mean analgesic effect measured for different intervention groups.

Results

Subjects who received morphine or meloxicam IV had a median time to first perceptible pain relief within 6–8 minutes. Morphine and meloxicam IV 5–60 mg produced statistically significant differences than placebo in SPID24 and TOTPAR24. SPID24 (standard error [SE]) for meloxicam IV 5–60 mg ranged from -56276.8 (3926.46) to -33517.1 (3930.1; P < .001); SPID24 (SE) for morphine and placebo were -29615.8 (3869.2; P < .001) and 4555.9 (3807.1), respectively. SPID24 effect sizes (95% confidence intervals) for the 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg meloxicam IV doses and morphine were 1.93 (1.61–2.25), 2.00 (1.65–2.35), 1.70 (1.35–2.05), 1.28 (0.95–1.60), 1.25 (0.90–1.61), and 1.12 (0.77–1.45) SDs, respectively. TOTPAR24 (SE) for meloxicam IV 5–60 mg ranged from 3104.5 (155.28) to 4130.4 (191.17; P < .001); TOTPAR24 (SE) for morphine and placebo were 2723.3 (188.4; P < .001) and 1100.6 (185.4), respectively. TOTPAR24 effect sizes (95% confidence interval) for the 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg meloxicam IV doses and morphine were 2.03 (1.70–2.35), 2.05 (1.70–2.40), 1.78 (1.43–2.13), 1.35 (1.03–1.67), 1.37 (1.01–1.72), and 1.10 (0.75–1.45) SDs, respectively. The mean total opioid consumed (SD) during the double-blind phase was 4.6 (8.17), 5.3 (8.85), 5.9 (7.85), 8.5 (9.67), 9.3 (9.47), 9.6 (8.12), and 16.0 (10.15) mg for patients in the 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg meloxicam IV, morphine, and placebo groups, respectively. Generally, meloxicam IV was well tolerated, evidenced by the incidence of adverse events compared to placebo and lack of deaths and treatment-related serious adverse events.

Conclusions

A meloxicam IV dose of 5–60 mg was generally well tolerated and appeared to reduce opioid consumption in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy. Once-daily administration of meloxicam IV produced analgesic effect within 6–8 minutes postdose that was maintained over a 24-hour dosing interval.

The effect sizes for doses of 30 mg and 60 mg meloxicam IV during the first 48 hours after administration, using the W2LOCF and LOCF analysis methods, are shown in Figure 1 and Table 3. Subjects treated with either dose of meloxicam IV had significantly greater reductions in SPID 48 than subjects who received placebo (P ≤ 0.01) according to both methods of analysis (Table 3). Both doses of meloxicam IV also produced significantly greater pain reductions than placebo at other post-dose intervals (ie, in SPID 6, SPID 12, SPID 24, SPID12–24, SPID12–48, and SPID24–48 values) according to W2LOCF and LOCF analysis methods (P ≤ 0.05; Table 4).

PID at each time point

Mean PID values versus baseline for the three treatment groups over 48 hours, using the W2LOCF assessment method, are shown in Figure 2A. Statistically significant decreases in pain from baseline (ie, negative PID values) were detected as early as 15 minutes after the first dose of both meloxicam IV 30 mg and meloxicam IV 60 mg (Figure 2B). At this time, mean PID values versus baseline with the two doses were −1.5 ± 2.44 (P < 0.05) and −0.7 ± 1.22 (P < 0.05), respectively.

The mean PI changes from baseline at all assessment points were less than zero with both doses of meloxicam IV (ie, the pain level was lower than at baseline); at the 48-hour assessment, the changes were −4.6 ± 3.61 and −4.3 ± 3.06 with meloxicam IV doses of 30 mg and 60 mg, respectively (both P < 0.001 versus baseline). With placebo, the mean PID at 0.25 hours was −0.1. Thereafter, PI changes from baseline were positive until the 20-hour assessment, and a significant difference versus baseline was not detected until Hour 28.

### Risk of serious upper gastrointestinal and cardiovascular thromboembolic complications with meloxicam [^112vXNAA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the risk of serious gastrointestinal and thromboembolic complications with approved doses of meloxicam.

Methods

We pooled data from clinical trials of meloxicam at doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/d. A blinded gastrointestinal adjudication committee used prespecified criteria to identify gastric or duodenal perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, or hemodynamically important upper gastrointestinal bleeding. For analysis of thromboembolic complications, investigator-reported events were analyzed without adjudication.

Results

We analyzed data from 24,196 patients from 28 trials, most of whom had been followed for up to 60 days. Of these patients, 13,118 received meloxicam (10,158 received a daily dose of 7.5 mg and 2960 received 15 mg), 5283 were treated with diclofenac 100 mg, 181 received diclofenac 150 mg, 5371 were treated with piroxicam 20 mg, and 243 received naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Patients who received 7.5 mg of meloxicam daily had a 0.03% risk of serious upper gastrointestinal events, which was significantly lower than the risk in those who received diclofenac, naproxen, or piroxicam (P < 0.02). With the 15 mg daily dose of meloxicam, this risk was significantly different only when compared with piroxicam (P = 0.03). The risk of thromboembolic events in patients treated with meloxicam at either dose was lower than with diclofenac, but similar to that observed with piroxicam and naproxen.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis of 24,196 patients demonstrates that meloxicam has a favorable gastrointestinal and thromboembolic safety profile. However, only a small number of patients were followed for more than 60 days, and meaningful comparisons were not possible in this subgroup.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^116Yg6X4]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The Kaplan–Meier survival curve of time to first use of rescue medication is shown in Figure 4. The median time to first rescue medication use, using the lower bound of the 95% CI for the 50th percentile, was approximately 1.1 hours with placebo, 6.6 hours with morphine, and 21.8, 18.3, 10.1, and 12.2 hours with meloxicam IV 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg, respectively. Because < 50% of subjects in the meloxicam IV 60 mg group used rescue medication, the median time to the first rescue use could not be estimated for this group.

Figure 4.
Survival analysis of time to first use of rescue medication. Compared with placebo, all active treatments reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue medication in the first 24 h postdose. Compared with morphine, all meloxicam IV doses reduced the likelihood of rescue medication use within the first 24 h postdose. IV indicates intravenous.

All active treatments reduced total consumption of rescue morphine in the double-blind treatment phase (P < .0001 versus placebo). Subjects in the placebo group received a mean (SD) number of rescue doses of 2.2 (1.16). Subjects in the morphine and meloxicam IV 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg dose groups received a mean (SD) number of rescue doses of 1.3 (0.96), 0.5 (0.83), 0.6 (0.89), 0.7 (0.84), 0.9 (1.00), and 1.1 (1.09), respectively. Total opioid rescue requirements in the placebo group were 16.0 (10.15) mg. In contrast, total opioid rescue requirements for morphine and meloxicam IV 60, 30, 15, 7.5, and 5 mg recipients were 9.6 (8.12), 4.6 (8.17), 5.3 (8.85), 5.9 (7.85), 8.5 (9.67), and 9.3 (9.47) mg, respectively. The meloxicam IV 60, 30, and 15 mg doses also reduced total rescue opioid consumption relative to morphine (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0071, and P = 0.0206, respectively).

5.1	Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.1 Dosage

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

For management of osteoarthritis pain, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg orally once daily. Dose may be increased to 10 mg in patients who require additional analgesia. The maximum recommended daily oral dose of VIVLODEX is 10 mg.

In patients on hemodialysis, the maximum daily dosage is 5 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

2.2 Non-Interchangeability with Other Formulations of Meloxicam

VIVLODEX capsules have not shown equivalent systemic exposure to other formulations of oral meloxicam. Therefore, VIVLODEX capsules are not interchangeable with other formulations of oral meloxicam even if the total milligram strength is the same. Do not substitute similar dose strengths of other meloxicam products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Safety

A total of 486 subjects received ≥ 1 dose of study medication in the double-blind phase, and 295 received ≥ 1 dose of study medication in the open-label phase. The majority of subjects in the meloxicam IV 60, 30, and 15 mg groups received ≥ 2 days of treatment, and approximately one-third of subjects in each of these groups received ≥ 3 days of exposure. Cumulative exposure was lower in the meloxicam IV 7.5 and 5 mg groups: 47.9% and 40.3% of subjects (respectively) received ≥ 2 days of treatment, and 28.1% and 16.7% (respectively) had ≥ 3 days of exposure.

Adverse Events.

Generally, meloxicam IV at doses ≤ 60 mg were well tolerated during the double-blind and open-label phases. Overall, 205 treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 147 subjects during the double-blind treatment phase (Table 2). Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Severe treatment-emergent AEs were reported for 3 (4.7%), 6 (9.7%), 5 (8.3%), 7 (7.7%), 9 (15.0%), 5 (8.3%), and 9 (10.1%) patients in the placebo, morphine, and meloxicam IV 5, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 mg groups, respectively. For 61% of subjects, AEs that occurred during the double-blind treatment phase were considered unrelated to study medication. One subject in the placebo group discontinued the study due to an AE attributed to the use of morphine as rescue medication.

Table 2.
Summary of Treatment-Emergent AEs: Double-Blind Treatment Phase

Overall, the type of treatment-emergent AEs reported among subjects treated with meloxicam IV during the open-label phase was consistent with that reported during the double-blind phase. Most AEs continued to be mild or moderate, and no subject withdrew due to an AE.

### Meloxicam (Xifyrm) [^1175YXpC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 2 (Abdominoplasty Surgery) In the second controlled, multiple-dose trial (NCT02678286) of adult patients with postoperative pain who underwent elective abdominoplasty surgery, 219 patients were treated with meloxicam injection 30 mg or placebo administered once daily for two days starting on the day of surgery. An optional third dose was permitted just prior to discharge. A minimum postoperative baseline pain intensity of 4 on the NPRS (range 0–10) and pain categorized as moderate or severe were required for randomization. The majority of patients were female (98%). The average age was 40 years. The mean overall baseline pain intensity on the NPRS was 7.3. A statistically significant difference demonstrating efficacy was observed in the primary efficacy endpoint of the summed pain intensity difference over the first 24 hours (SPID24) as well as over the first 48 hours (SPID48). The average pain intensity over time is depicted for the treatment groups in Figure 3. A generally consistent separation in pain scores between the meloxicam injection and placebo group was observed from time of onset through most of the dosing interval with a narrowing at the end of the first 24-hour dosing interval.

Onset of Meaningful Pain Relief and Use of Rescue Analgesic Medication

The median time to first rescue analgesic use in patients treated with meloxicam injection (2 hours in Study 1 and 1 hour in Study 2) came before the median time to patient-reported meaningful pain relief in both studies (2 hours in Study 1 and 3 hours in Study 2). Fifty percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 49% of patients treated with placebo in Study 1 received rescue analgesia medication in the first 2 hours after the start of dosing. Seventy-eight percent of patients treated with meloxicam injection and 78% of patients treated with placebo in Study 2 received rescue in the first 3 hours after the start of dosing.

### Meloxicam [^113Axpaq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Meloxicam has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of Meloxicam, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of meloxicam capsules was 89% following a single oral dose of 30 mg compared with 30 mg IV bolus injection. Following single intravenous doses, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were shown in the range of 5 mg to 60 mg. After multiple oral doses the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam capsules were dose-proportional over the range of 7.5 mg to 15 mg. Mean Cmax was achieved within four to five hours after a 7.5 mg meloxicam tablet was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption. With multiple dosing, steady-state concentrations were reached by Day 5. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.

Meloxicam capsules have been shown to be bioequivalent to Meloxicam tablets.

Food and Antacid Effects

Administration of meloxicam capsules following a high fat breakfast (75 g of fat) resulted in mean peak drug levels (i.e. Cmax) being increased by approximately 22% while the extent of absorption (AUC) was unchanged. The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was achieved between 5 and 6 hours. No pharmacokinetic interaction was detected with concomitant administration of antacids. Based on these results, Meloxicam can be administered without regard to timing of meals or concomitant administration of antacids.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^114FJH66]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Results of the present study demonstrate that meloxicam IV provided significant analgesic effect and, in general, was well tolerated in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy. The onset of pain relief after the administration of meloxicam IV occurred within 6–8 minutes postdose, and analgesic effects were maintained for 24 hours after dosing. Doses of 5–60 mg produced statistically significant improvements in SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24 relative to placebo; the 30 mg dose produced the greatest treatment effect. Moreover, meloxicam IV doses of ≥ 15 mg significantly improved SPID 24 and TOTPAR 24 relative to morphine. Beneficial effects on secondary outcome measures were also observed, and patient-reported GES suggested a preference for meloxicam IV over morphine for all but the lowest dose of meloxicam IV.

Importantly, meloxicam IV was associated with a significantly reduced need for rescue medication; total rescue opioid consumption was 42%–71% lower with meloxicam IV versus placebo during the double-blind phase. Meloxicam IV doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg were also associated with significantly lower overall rescue opioid consumption versus morphine. Opioid monotherapy has been a mainstay and standard of care for postoperative pain management and has demonstrated adequate pain reduction in a variety of soft-tissue surgical procedures. Morphine was a rigorous comparator in this surgical model; it is highly effective, acts rapidly with clearly defined efficacy, and does not require dose adjustment for renal impairment, unlike other current nonopioid IV analgesics.

Other studies have evaluated the preoperative administration of meloxicam formulations, including suppositories or oral tablets for reducing postoperative pain after hysterectomy. – In these studies, meloxicam appears to provide effective analgesia; however, in some cases, investigators observed that morphine consumption was not significantly reduced for subjects who received meloxicam compared with placebo. The relatively poor solubility and slow absorption rate of these meloxicam formulations, may not provide maximum analgesia in the immediate postoperative period. Bolus IV injections of meloxicam administered postoperatively provided onset of analgesia as early as 6 minutes postdose, and the IV formulation provides a useful alternative in the immediate postoperative period.

Methods

Study Design

This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety of meloxicam IV in adult subjects undergoing major surgery, including, but not limited to, orthopedic procedures (eg, total hip or knee replacement), open or laparoscopic abdominal surgeries, or gynecological surgeries and a range of other soft-tissue surgeries (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02720692). The study was conducted at sites in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand between March 2016 and April 2017; all subjects provided written informed consent. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the central Institutional Review Board (IRB) with additional review by local IRBs where required and was performed according to the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice Guideline for Industry and, where applicable, the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Study randomization was stratified into two groups: subjects who underwent an orthopedic procedure and those who underwent a non-orthopedic procedure. This post hoc analysis evaluated the safety and opioid-reducing effects of meloxicam IV among the subgroup of subjects in the strata undergoing a range of orthopedic procedures (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of Orthopedic Surgery Types

Dosing

Subjects who met postoperative randomization eligibility criteria were randomized (3:1 using a computer-generated block randomization scheme) to IV treatment with meloxicam 30 mg or placebo, administered as a bolus injection every 24 hrs. Randomization was stratified by subjects greater than 65 years with mild renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 60‒89 mL/min/1.73 m 2) versus other. Subjects received the first dose of study medication within 6 hrs of the end of surgery, with additional doses administered as clinically appropriate up to a maximum of seven doses.

Concomitant NSAIDs were prohibited within 7 days prior to surgery. During surgery, subjects received the standard of care anesthesia and analgesic regimens (excluding the use of NSAID medication) according to the clinical practice of the surgeon based on the surgery type. Subjects with inadequately controlled pain could receive standard of care rescue medication. Although opioid analgesics were the most common type of rescue medication, any rescue analgesic (except for other NSAIDs) was acceptable according to the standard practice of the study site.

Infertility

Females

Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including Meloxicam, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including Meloxicam, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of meloxicam in pediatric JRA patients from 2 to 17 years of age has been evaluated in three clinical trials [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been adequately studied. Since meloxicam is significantly metabolized in the liver and hepatotoxicity may occur, use meloxicam with caution in patients with hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^117GnFde]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Meloxicam, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties, with better gastrointestinal tolerability compared with nonselective NSAIDs, has been proven effective when administered orally for ameliorating the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.–However, largely due to its poor solubility, orally administered meloxicam is not rapidly absorbed; peak plasma concentrations after a dose of 30 mg are not reached until 9–11 hours after administration. Consequently, this slow onset of action is a reason why oral meloxicam is not currently approved for the management of acute pain.

A novel nanocrystal colloidal dispersion formulation of meloxicam (N1539; Recro Pharma, Inc. Malvern, PA, USA) has recently been developed for bolus intravenous (IV) administration, providing faster onset of analgesia than can be achieved with oral administration. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in females who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, the IV nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam was effective in relieving moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. All single doses of meloxicam IV evaluated (5 mg to 60 mg) resulted in significantly lower pain intensity (PI) scores and better global pain-control scores than placebo; doses > 5 mg also achieved significantly better pain-relief scores than morphine (10 mg to 15 mg), and the use of rescue medication was lower in all meloxicam IV dose groups than in the morphine and placebo groups.

The present Phase 2 study (NCT02675907) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IV nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam administered in doses of 30 mg and 60 mg compared to placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following a standardized bunionectomy procedure. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of meloxicam IV administered as a bolus injection over 15–30 seconds (rather than 1–2 minutes, as in earlier studies) by assessing vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, electrocardiography (ECG) changes, wound healing, and the occurrence of AEs. The principal efficacy objective was the estimated effect size of the two doses of meloxicam IV, determined via time-weighted summed PI differences (PID) over the first 48 hours (SPID 48), relative to placebo.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^113SWGuT]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients typically report high levels of pain after orthopedic surgery, and managing this pain can be challenging. The importance of effective pain management is underscored by adverse outcomes associated with uncontrolled postoperative pain, which include delayed recovery, longer hospital stays, readmissions, increased morbidity, and decreased quality of life. In an effort to improve the management of postoperative pain, current guidelines strongly recommend an integrative approach, including use of multimodal analgesia and minimization of opioids.

In the past, the limited number of options to treat moderate-to-severe pain led to overreliance on the use of opioids. Given the potential risks associated with opioids, such as addiction, gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs), pruritus, and respiratory depression, among others, there has been an increased emphasis on using alternative medications and decreasing opioid use in patients who undergo elective or nonelective surgical procedures. In general, it is recommended that opioids be used at the lowest possible dose and not in isolation. Therefore, a multimodal analgesic regimen that includes two or more analgesic agents with different mechanisms of action to provide enhanced analgesia is a rational approach. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for this purpose, as they have not only demonstrated efficacy for reducing postoperative pain, but have also demonstrated benefits with respect to patient satisfaction (improved), opioid consumption and related AEs (reduced), systemic inflammation (reduced), and time to recovery (shortened). However, they can lead to serious side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding, exacerbation of respiratory disease, thrombotic events, and renal or hepatic injury, the risk of which may be related to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selectivity. Furthermore, few intravenous (IV) options are currently available.

### Intravenous meloxicam versus ketorolac for pain control following total joint arthroplasty: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113fQtsS]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although joint arthroplasty surgery is considered safe and effective in reducing osteoarthritis-related pain long-term, the surgery is known to be painful in the immediate postoperative period. Therefore, optimal pain management has become a crucial goal for orthopaedic surgeons. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used but can cause adverse effects due to their mechanism of action. Meloxicam, however, has a unique mechanism of action, allowing it to better spare the gut lining, translating to reduced complications. This double-blind randomized controlled trial sought to compare intravenous (IV) meloxicam and IV ketorolac for total joint arthroplasty regarding pain scores, opioid consumption, and lengths of stay.

Methods

All other institutional protocols and medications remained unchanged. A total of 223 patients were randomized. The meloxicam group received 30 mg IV meloxicam preoperatively two hours before primary incision, while the ketorolac group received 15 mg IV ketorolac intraoperatively followed by 15 mg IV every six hours, scheduled for two doses. Pain, opioid consumption, and nausea were recorded at two and 24 hours postoperatively. An a priori power analysis demonstrated a need for 170 total patients. The study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05291598) and received Institutional Review Board approval.

Results

The IV meloxicam group had increased total opioid consumption 24 hours postoperatively and longer lengths of stay compared to the IV ketorolac group; however, there were no differences in pain scores or nausea.

Conclusion

The use of IV meloxicam as part of a perioperative pain management protocol led to increased opioid consumption, longer lengths of stay, and a lower rate of same-day discharges compared to IV ketorolac.

### Safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate to severe pain following laparoscopic abdominal surgery [^117CccaV]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Material and methods

This was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled study in subjects undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to intravenous (IV) doses of placebo, ketorolac every 6 hours (Q6H), meloxicam NIV 7.5 mg Q12H, meloxicam NIV 15 mg Q12H, or meloxicam NIV 30 mg once daily (QD) for up to 48 hours. Each subject was dosed Q6H (with placebo as applicable) to maintain blinding. Subjects were discharged from the study unit 48 hours after the initial dose of study drug and followed as outpatients through Day 28.

Efficacy was assessed by subject reports of PI on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale anchored at 0 for no pain and 100 for worst possible pain. Rescue medication (parenteral morphine 2–6 mg) was available any time after the initial dose of study drug. Missing PI scores were imputed for the efficacy analysis using a 2-hour windowed last observation carried forward (W2LOCF) approach.

Safety was monitored through the reporting of adverse events, clinical laboratory testing, vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), and wound site assessments.

The study was expected to enroll 200 subjects; however, the study was terminated for business reasons after 50 subjects enrolled. As a result, the original analyses were limited to disposition, demographics, and safety. Efficacy data were subsequently analyzed post hoc. No formal statistical analysis was performed.

The Aspire Institutional Review Board approved the protocol and the study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practices. All subjects provided written informed consent. Trial registration:(Identifier: NCT01436032).

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^115Sc2NG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the treatment of degenerative joint disease provides patients with an improved quality of life and better functional status; however, the procedure can result in moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. Historically, opioid medications have been the cornerstone of postoperative analgesia after TKA, but our improved understanding of pain physiology and transmission helped to usher in the era of multimodal analgesia. The premise of multimodal analgesia is to use nonnarcotic medications such as acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), among others, to reduce opioid-related adverse effects while providing improved pain management. For example, the tissue damage during TKA causes the release of arachidonic acid, the precursor to prostaglandins, resulting in a hyperalgesiac response from the peripheral nerves. Because NSAIDs block the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, causing a subsequent reduction in the hyperalgesiac response, NSAIDs can be used to reduce postoperative pain as an alternative to opioid medications.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are categorized based on their ability to selectively inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform that is responsible for the production of prostiglandins. Nonselective NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) provide relatively equivalent inhibition of the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms while selective COX-2 NSAIDs are subcategorized as highly selective (eg, celecoxib) and preferentially selective (eg, meloxicam) COX-2 NSAIDs. Although meloxicam does have a preference for binding with COX-2, it also inhibits COX-1 at the higher dosage regimens of 15 mg daily. Because COX-1 is constitutively expressed throughout the body and plays a role in platelet function, protection of gastric mucosa, and renal function, it resulted in the development of the selective and preferentially selective COX-2 NSAIDs with the intention to limit the negative effect of COX-1 inhibition. Nevertheless, realizing the full benefit of highly selective COX-2 inhibition while avoiding the complications associated with COX-1 inhibition has not come to fruition.

The purpose of this study was to compare the complication rates related to COX-1 inhibition between those who receive either a nonselective (meloxicam 15 mg/d), preferential COX-2 (meloxicam 7.5 mg/d) or a highly selective COX-2 (celecoxib) NSAID after primary TKA and determine whether meloxicam, at a dose of 15 mg/d, is more cost-effective when considering the potential cost of increased complications related to COX-1 inhibition.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^112RobTq]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A large impediment to the wider adoption of oral NSAIDs for postoperative primary TKA analgesia are concerns regarding the GI and renal adverse effects associated with COX-1 inhibition from nonselective NSAIDs, especially with the increased utilization of postoperative IV ketorolac, IV corticosteroids, and VTE prophylaxis of aspirin. Currently, limited evidence is available regarding the safety profile of nonselective NSAIDs after discharge from primary TJA. In light of the opioid epidemic, a working committee of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Hip Society, Knee Society, and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine have suggested that the safety of nonselective NSAIDs after primary TKA be investigated.

Therefore, we sought to investigate for any potential differences in COX-1 inhibition-related postoperative complications between nonselective NSAID dosing of meloxicam, preferential COX-2 NSAID dosing of meloxicam, or highly selective COX-2 NSAID dosing of celecoxib. Our findings suggest that using meloxicam at either a nonselective (15 mg/d) or preferential COX-2 (7.5 mg/d) dose as a part of a postoperative multimodal TKA pain protocol does not seem to result in an increased incidence of postoperative GI bleeding compared with the usage of celecoxib, P = 0.4, considering that patients in the three cohorts had similar GI risk profiles: 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0% of patients in the celecoxib, meloxicam 15 mg/d, and meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohorts had a history of peptic ulcer disease (P = 1.0). These findings did not agree with our hypothesis because we expected patients on meloxicam, particularly when consuming 15 mg/d, to have a greater incidence of GI bleeding and ulceration based on meloxicam being a nonselective NSAID at higher doses.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Following single-dose intravenous administration of XIFYRM (meloxicam injection 30 mg/mL) to healthy adult volunteers, plasma concentrations of meloxicam was found comparable to that of another meloxicam injection 30 mg/mL. The single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of XIFYRM following intravenous administration is presented in Table 4.

Table 4. Single-dose PK of meloxicam injection from comparative bioavailability study

*Tmaxvalues are reported as median (range).

Meloxicam injection exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over intravenous doses ranging from 15 mg to 180 mg.

Distribution

Following administration of meloxicam injection, the apparent volume of distribution during the terminal elimination phase (Vz) of meloxicam is 9.63 L.

Meloxicam is ~99.4% bound to human plasma proteins (primarily albumin) within the therapeutic dose range. The fraction of protein binding is independent of drug concentration, over the clinically relevant concentration range, but decreases to ~99% in patients with renal disease. Meloxicam penetration into human red blood cells, after oral dosing, is less than 10%. Following a radio labeled dose, over 90% of the radioactivity detected in the plasma was present as unchanged meloxicam.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^115Lhcg4]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in subjects who experienced moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy, a postoperative pain model that has proven useful for assessing the analgesic efficacy of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, and other drugs. The study's design was consistent with current Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations for short-duration, acute-pain trials. This included using standardized surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative care regimens.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of the IV nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam administered as a bolus injection over 15–30 seconds in subjects who had undergone bunionectomy. At doses of both 30 mg and 60 mg, meloxicam IV was generally well tolerated when administered as a bolus injection once daily. Most AEs that occurred with meloxicam IV were rated mild in intensity, and their incidence was similar to that in the placebo group – including adverse gastrointestinal events such as nausea, constipation, gastric or peptic ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. There was no increase in the incidence or severity of AEs over time. No injection-related AEs were reported with either dose of meloxicam IV, and there were no clinically meaningful changes as determined by the primary investigator, in vital signs or laboratory parameters (including hepatic and renal function) and no clinically significant abnormal ECG changes. There was no evidence of abnormal wound healing attributable to meloxicam IV as evaluated by the PI.

Although the study originally was not statistically powered to demonstrate efficacy, results numerically favored both doses of meloxicam IV push (30 mg and 60 mg, given once daily) over placebo in relieving moderate-to-severe post-bunionectomy pain at all assessment times during the 48-hour study period, regardless of the analysis method (LOCF or W2LOCF). A statistically significant difference versus placebo was observed with both doses of meloxicam IV for SPID 48 values, and also for SPID 6, SPID 12, SPID 24, SPID 12–24, SPID 12–48, and SPID 24–48 values. The significant differences in SPID 12–24 values versus placebo with the two doses indicate that the analgesic effect of meloxicam IV remains significant throughout the second half of the dosing interval.

### Safety, tolerability, and effect on opioid use of meloxicam IV following orthopedic surgery [^113mS6v8]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The safety and efficacy of meloxicam IV was investigated in three Phase 2 clinical trials using validated models for both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries, including bunionectomy, hysterectomy, and dental impaction.–In these studies, once-daily administration of meloxicam IV provided onset of analgesia as early as 15 mins post-dose, with maintenance of analgesic effect over a 24-hr period in subjects with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. The drug was generally well tolerated, with an incidence of AEs that was comparable to placebo.

In phase 3 trials using validated models of subjects with postoperative pain following soft-tissue surgery (abdominoplasty)and hard-tissue surgery (bunionectomy), subjects who received meloxicam IV had a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity versus subjects randomized to placebo. In both studies, meloxicam IV demonstrated a safety profile comparable to placebo with respect to number, severity, and frequency of AEs.

A recent phase 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety and tolerability of meloxicam IV 30 mg in adults scheduled to undergo major elective surgery with an inpatient hospital stay > 24 hrs (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02720692). The primary objective, evaluation of meloxicam IV safety and tolerability, was assessed by incidence of AEs and serious AEs, physical examination, vital signs, clinical tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), wound evaluation, and postoperative opioid consumption. The clinical study enrolled a heterogeneous subject population in order to study the use of meloxicam IV under a wide range of procedures, including both hard- and soft-tissue surgeries. Here, the safety and tolerability findings from a subpopulation of subjects in this study who underwent orthopedic surgeries are reported.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115dMB23]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of perioperative meloxicam IV 30mg on opioid consumption in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Design

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Subjects

In total, 181 adults undergoing elective primary TKA.

Methods

Subjects received meloxicam 30mg or placebo via an IV bolus every 24hours, the first dose administered prior to surgery as part of a multimodal pain management protocol. The primary efficacy parameter was total opioid use from end of surgery through 24hours.

Results

Meloxicam IV was associated with less opioid use versus placebo during the 24hours after surgery (18.9 ± 1.32 vs 27.7 ± 1.37mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P < 0.001) and was superior to placebo on secondary endpoints, including summed pain intensity (first dose to 24hours postdosing, first dose to first assisted ambulation, and first dose to discharge) and opioid use (48-72hrs., 0-48hrs., 0-72hrs., hour 0 to end of treatment, and the first 24hours after discharge). Adverse events (AEs) were reported for 69.9% and 92.0% of the meloxicam IV and placebo groups, respectively; the most common AEs were nausea (40% vs. 59%), vomiting (16% vs 22%), hypotension (14% vs 15%), pruritus (15% vs 11%), and constipation (11% vs 13%).

Conclusions

Perioperative meloxicam IV 30mg as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen for elective primary TKA reduced opioid consumption in the 24-hour period after surgery versus placebo and was associated with a lower incidence of AEs typically associated with opioid use.

Introduction

Managing pain following orthopedic surgery can be challenging as post-orthopedic surgery patients report high pain scores, likely related to the nature of bone injuries. Effective pain management is important because uncontrolled postoperative pain is associated with several adverse outcomes, including delayed recovery, longer hospital stays, and increased morbidity. Guidelines for the management of postoperative pain strongly recommend an integrative approach, including the use of multimodal analgesia. This approach advocates the use of a variety of medications, routes of administration, and techniques that result in a synergistic and more effective approach to pain relief. Multimodal analgesia regimens are also a central component for enhanced recovery after surgery protocols and procedure-specific pain management initiatives. A major goal of multimodal pain management is the reduction in the need for opioids, which are associated with several well-documented risks (eg, dependence, abuse, diversion, hyperalgesia) and adverse events (AEs), including respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and constipation.–

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly recommended for incorporation in multimodal postoperative pain management regimens following orthopedic surgery.–These agents have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and opioid-reducing effects; however, they can be associated with AEs (eg, bleeding, cardiovascular complications, and renal effects) that have the potential to limit their use. Thus, a detailed examination of the safety profile of investigational NSAIDs or new formulations of known NSAIDs is important.

Meloxicam is a long-acting NSAID with preferential cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibition that has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. The drug has been available in an oral formulation for many years; however, a limitation of oral meloxicam is poor aqueous solubility that results in slow absorption and a slow onset of action. This is evidenced by an observed peak plasma concentration that occurs 9 to 11 hrs after an orally administered dose of 30 mg. Consequently, oral meloxicam is not suitable for the treatment of acute pain. A novel nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam that can be given by intravenous (IV) bolus injection is being developed for moderate to severe pain management alone or in combination with other analgesics.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at greater risk for NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If the anticipated benefit for the elderly patient outweighs these potential risks, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6, 5.13)]. Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of VIVLODEX, 291 were age 65 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been adequately studied. Because meloxicam is significantly metabolized in the liver; use VIVLODEX in patients with severe hepatic impairment only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If VIVLODEX is used in patients with severe hepatic impairment, monitor patients for signs of worsening liver function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Renal Impairment

No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been studied. The use of VIVLODEX in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended. In a previous study, the free Cmax plasma concentrations following a single dose of meloxicam were higher in patients with renal failure on chronic hemodialysis (1% free fraction) in comparison to healthy volunteers (0.3% free fraction). Therefore, the maximum VIVLODEX dosage in this population is 5 mg per day. Hemodialysis did not lower the total drug concentration in plasma; therefore, additional doses are not necessary after hemodialysis. Meloxicam is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^111trwJh]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

After receiving exemption from our institutional review board, we searched our institutional database to identify patients who received a primary TKA between January 2015 and February 2020 who used celecoxib or meloxicam for postoperative analgesia. Because meloxicam acts as a preferential COX-2 inhibitor at lower doses and a nonselective NSAID at higher does, patients taking meloxicam were further stratified into a 15 mg/d meloxicam cohort and 7.5 mg/d meloxicam cohort, and as such, three cohorts of patients were analyzed. A total of 4,994 patients were included in this study who took either celecoxib (n = 3,174), meloxicam 15 mg/d (n = 1,369), or meloxicam 7.5 mg/d (n = 451) for postoperative TKA analgesia. Baseline characteristics between the three groups were similar with the exception of a slightly higher percentage of men in the celecoxib cohort, slightly higher BMI in the meloxicam cohorts, and lower CCI in the meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohort (Table 1); however, the age-adjusted CCI demonstrated similarity among the three cohorts. Patients were either prescribed meloxicam 7.5 mg/d, meloxicam 15 mg/d, or celecoxib because of surgeon preference. Surgeons tended to choose one medication and one dosage regimen and did not switch over to another medication based on perceived risk. Patient pain protocols were otherwise similar among the three groups, and all patients were prescribed with a proton-pump inhibitor as a part of the standard of care at our institution. Patients who did not fill their prescriptions or were found to not be taking the prescription were excluded. After reviewing discharge records and patient charts, a total of 4,994 patients were included in the study.

Endpoints

The primary efficacy parameter was the total use of opioid analgesia from end of surgery (EOS; hour 0) through 24 hours. To analyze total opioid consumption, medication use was converted to IV morphine equivalent dose (IVMED, mg) using a standardized conversion table.

Pain intensity (PI) was assessed using an 11-point numeric pain rating scale (0–10; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain) at defined intervals throughout the first 48 hours after surgery, before and during each ambulation, and before each administration of opioid rescue (time 0 through hospital discharge). The sum of PI score (SPI) was the time-weighted cumulative PI value from first dose. The weight factor at each time point was the time elapsed since the previous observation. The SPI is also referred to as the SPID when the baseline pain score is nonzero. In this study, all subjects had baseline postsurgery pain score of zero because the study medication was given before surgery. Outcome measures that summarize treatment response over a clinically relevant period are widely reported in clinical trials of analgesics. Secondary endpoints included the sum of PI from the time of first dose of study drug through 24 hours, the percentage of opioid-free subjects from EOS through 24 hours, and the time from EOS to the first use of IV opioid as rescue medication. Other efficacy endpoints included the sum of PI over other time intervals, the percentage of subjects who were opioid free over other time intervals, the total use of opioid analgesia over other intervals, and the 7-item patient-reported Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score (OBAS) questionnaire.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^1139M2dH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

With our findings suggesting no difference in the incidence of postoperative complications among patients using low-dose meloxicam (7.5 mg/d), high-dose meloxicam (15 mg/d), and celecoxib, formal cost-analysis was not done because it is evident that meloxicam usage would demonstrate cost-savings. Using the values of the average retail medication prices in 2020, we found the cost for a 30-day supply of 15 mg of meloxicam to be $32.99, whereas the cost of a 30-day supply of 200 mg of celecoxib to be $215.99. If patients were to use 15 mg meloxicam daily for postoperative TKA analgesia rather than 200 mg celecoxib daily, this would result in a saving of $183 per prescription on average. Based on the finding that 9% of the patients were prescribed celecoxib for postoperative pain control at our institution, if this figure were to be applied to the TKA population in the United States, approximately 700,000, prescribing meloxicam in place of celecoxib would generate a savings of $12 million to the healthcare system.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^115JwFk4]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Perioperative administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen demonstrated an opioid-sparing effect among subjects who underwent elective primary TKA. Meloxicam IV had a favorable AE profile comparable to that of placebo and was not associated with an increase in AEs associated with NSAIDs. Select measures of health care resource utilization also tended to be lower with meloxicam IV, including 10% lower mean total hospital charges. These results suggest that meloxicam IV has a promising role in multimodal analgesic regimens in this clinical setting.

Excretion

Meloxicam excretion is predominantly in the form of metabolites, and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces. Only traces of the unchanged parent compound are excreted in the urine (0.2%) and feces (1.6%). The extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg doses: 0.5%, 6%, and 13% of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5'-hydroxymethyl and 5'-carboxy metabolites, respectively. There is significant biliary and/or enteral secretion of the drug. This was demonstrated when oral administration of cholestyramine following a single IV dose of meloxicam decreased the AUC of meloxicam by 50%.

The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) ranges from 15 hours to 20 hours. The elimination half-life is constant across dose levels indicating linear metabolism within the therapeutic dose range. Plasma clearance ranges from 7 to 9 mL/min.

Specific Populations

Pediatric

After single (0.25 mg/kg) dose administration and after achieving steady state (0.375 mg/kg/day), there was a general trend of approximately 30% lower exposure in younger patients (2 to 6 years old) as compared to the older patients (7 to 16 years old). The older patients had meloxicam exposures similar (single dose) or slightly reduced (steady state) to those in the adult patients, when using AUC values normalized to a dose of 0.25 mg/kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. The meloxicam mean (SD) elimination half-life was 15.2 (10.1) and 13.0 hours (3.0) for the 2 to 6 year old patients, and 7 to 16 year old patients, respectively.

### Bupivacaine and meloxicam (Zynrelef) [^116TgNEJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Additional pharmacodynamic data in clinical studies

Additional pharmacodynamic data for ZYNRELEF was evaluated in patients undergoing abdominoplasty, Cesarean section, total shoulder arthroplasty, and 1- to 3-level lumbar spinal surgery. Refer to Dosage and Administration for specific doses used for each study [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Contribution of Meloxicam and Bupivacaine to Activity of ZYNRELEF

The contribution of each active ingredient in ZYNRELEF was demonstrated in Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled clinical studies in subjects undergoing herniorrhaphy or bunionectomy, utilizing ZYNRELEF and formulations of meloxicam alone or bupivacaine alone in the ZYNRELEF vehicle. In both studies, meloxicam alone demonstrated negligible local analgesia and bupivacaine alone demonstrated greater analgesia compared with placebo through 24 hours post surgery, despite exposure to bupivacaine for approximately 72 hours. Compared with bupivacaine alone in both studies, ZYNRELEF (at the same bupivacaine doses) demonstrated greater and longer analgesia through 24, 48, and 72 hours.

Effect on Cardiac Repolarization

The effect of ZYNRELEF on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated following a single administration in patients undergoing surgical procedures. ZYNRELEF, at single doses up to the maximum recommended dose, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval.

Bupivacaine

Systemic absorption of local anesthetics, including bupivacaine, produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems (CNS), which can be serious at toxic blood concentrations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. At blood concentrations achieved with normal therapeutic doses, manifestations of CNS stimulation and depression or changes in cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal. Clinical reports and animal research suggest that cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of bupivacaine.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The instillation of ZYNRELEF into the surgical site results in systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine and meloxicam for up to the duration as described in Table 7 for soft tissue surgical procedures and Table 8 for orthopedic surgical procedures. Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine or meloxicam following application of ZYNRELEF do not correlate with local efficacy.

Results

A total of 251 subjects were screened, 194 of whom were deemed eligible and assigned randomly to a study group. Of these, 181 (meloxicam IV, n = 93; placebo, n = 88) received ≥ 1 dose of study drug, and all treated subjects completed the study through the last visit (Figure 1). Baseline demographics, and surgical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. In general, study groups were similar in terms of demographic and surgical characteristics. Most surgeries (69.1%) were able to spare or minimize invasion of the quadriceps tendon. The majority of subjects in both groups received 2 or 3 doses of study drug (Table 2).

Efficacy

With respect to the primary endpoint (opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after EOS), opioid use was significantly lower with meloxicam IV-treated subjects (18.9 mg ± 1.32 IVMED vs 27.7 mg ± 1.37 IVMED; P < .0001), corresponding to 31.7% less opioid usage during this period (Supplemental Digital Content 1, Figure S1). Meloxicam IV was also associated with statistically significant differences from placebo for several secondary endpoints. For example, opioid consumption was lower in the meloxicam IV group at all other time intervals, with statistically significant differences from placebo for most comparisons (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Table S1). Opioid usage was numerically lower for subjects in the meloxicam IV group during hours 24–48 (9.7% decrease; P = 0.2449) and significantly lower for subjects in the meloxicam IV group during hours 48–72 (32.1% decrease; P = 0.0306), hours 0–48 (24.3% decrease; P < .0001), hours 0–72 (25.0% decrease; P < .0001), hour 0 to end of treatment (25.9% decrease; P = 0.0002), and in the first 24 hours after discharge (19.1% decrease; P = 0. 00394).

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

During clinical development, 1426 patients were exposed to meloxicam injection in controlled and open- label Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. Meloxicam injection was studied across a range of surgical procedures, including bunionectomy, abdominoplasty, soft tissue surgery, total knee replacement surgery, gynecologic surgery, complex foot surgery and total hip replacement surgery. In these trials, 381 patients received a single dose of meloxicam injection and 1045 patients received multiple doses of meloxicam injection daily for up to 7 days. The incidence rates of adverse reactions listed in Table 1 are derived from the three Phase 3 trials comparing meloxicam injection to placebo in patients who may have also received opioid rescue medication.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of meloxicam capsules was 89% following a single oral dose of 30 mg compared with 30 mg IV bolus injection.
Following single intravenous doses, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics
were shown in the range of 5 mg to 60 mg. After multiple oral doses the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam capsules were dose-proportional over the range of 7.5 mg to 15 mg. Mean Cmax
was achieved within four to five hours after a 7.5 mg meloxicam tablet
was taken under fasted conditions, indicating a prolonged drug absorption. With multiple dosing, steady-state concentrations were reached by Day 5. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 12 to 14 hours post-dose suggesting biliary recycling.

Meloxicam oral suspension doses of 7.5 mg/5 mL and 15 mg/10 mL have been found to be bioequivalent to meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg capsules, respectively. Meloxicam capsules have been shown to be bioequivalent to MOBIC tablets.

1The parameter values in the table are from various studies 2 not under high fat conditions 3 MOBIC tablets 4 Vz/f = Dose/(AUC-Kel) Food and Antacid Effects Administration
of meloxicam capsules following a high fat breakfast (75 g of fat)
resulted in mean peak drug levels (i.e. Cmax) being increased by approximately 22% while the extent of absorption (AUC) was unchanged. The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was achieved between 5 and 6 hours. In comparison, neither the AUC nor the Cmax values for meloxicam suspension were affected following
a similar high fat meal, while mean Tmax values were increased to
approximately 7 hours. No pharmacokinetic interaction was detected with concomitant administration of antacids. Based on these results, MOBIC can be administered without regard to timing of meals or concomitant administration of antacids. Distribution The mean volume of distribution (Vss) of meloxicam is approximately 10 L. Meloxicam is ~99.4% bound to human plasma proteins (primarily
albumin) within the therapeutic dose range. The fraction of protein
binding is independent of drug concentration, over the clinically
relevant concentration range, but decreases to ~99% in patients with
renal disease. Meloxicam penetration into human red blood cells,
after oral dosing, is less than 10%. Following a radiolabeled dose,
over 90% of the radioactivity detected in the plasma was present as unchanged meloxicam. Meloxicam
concentrations in synovial fluid, after a single oral dose, range from
40% to 50% of those in plasma. The free fraction in synovial fluid
is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in
synovial fluid as compared to plasma. The significance of this penetration is unknown. Metabolism Meloxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver. Meloxicam metabolites include 5'-carboxy meloxicam (60% of dose), from P-450 mediated metabolism formed by oxidation of an intermediate metabolite 5'-hydroxymethyl meloxicam which is also excreted to a lesser extent (9% of dose). In vitro studies indicate that CYP2C9 (cytochrome P450 metabolizing enzyme) plays an important role in this metabolic pathway with a minor contribution of the CYP3A4 isozyme. Patients' peroxidase activity is probably responsible for
the other two metabolites which account for 16% and 4% of the
administered dose, respectively. All the four metabolites are not known to have any in vivo pharmacological activity. Excretion Meloxicam
excretion is predominantly in the form of metabolites, and occurs to
equal extents in the urine and feces. Only traces of the unchanged
parent compound are excreted in the urine (0.2%) and feces (1.6%). The
extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg doses: 0.5%, 6%, and 13% of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5' hydroxymethyl
and 5' carboxy metabolites, respectively. There is significant biliary
and/or enteral secretion of the drug. This was demonstrated when oral administration of cholestyramine following a single IV dose of meloxicam decreased the AUC of meloxicam by 50%. The mean elimination half-life (t1/2) ranges from 15 hours to 20 hours. The elimination half-life is constant across dose levels indicating linear metabolism within the therapeutic dose range. Plasma clearance ranges from 7 to 9 mL/min. Special Populations Pediatric After single (0.25 mg/kg) dose administration and after achieving steady state (0.375 mg/kg/day), there was a general trend of approximately
30% lower exposure in younger patients (2 to 6 years old) as compared
to the older patients (7 to 16 years old). The older patients had
meloxicam exposures similar (single dose) or slightly reduced (steady
state) to those in the adult patients, when using AUC values normalized to a dose of 0.25 mg/kg [see Dosage and Administration]. The meloxicam mean (SD) elimination half-life was 15.2 (10.1) and 13.0 hours (3.0) for the 2 to 6 year old patients, and 7 to 16 year old patients, respectively. In a covariate analysis, utilizing population pharmacokinetics body-weight, but not age, was the single predictive covariate for differences in the meloxicam apparent oral plasma clearance. The body-weight normalized apparent oral clearance values were adequate predictors of meloxicam exposure in pediatric patients. The pharmacokinetics of MOBIC in pediatric patients under 2 years of age have not been investigated. Geriatric Elderly males (³65 years of age) exhibited meloxicam plasma concentrations and steady-state pharmacokinetics similar to young males. Elderly females (³65 years of age) had a 47% higher AUCss and 32% higher Cmax, ss as compared to younger females (£55
years of age) after body weight normalization. Despite the increased
total concentrations in the elderly females, the adverse event
profile was comparable for both elderly patient populations. A smaller
free fraction was found in elderly female patients in comparison to elderly male patients. Gender Young females exhibited slightly lower plasma concentrations relative to young males. After single doses of 7.5 mg MOBIC, the mean
elimination half-life was 19.5 hours for the female group as compared
to 23.4 hours for the male group. At steady state, the data were
similar (17.9 hours vs 21.4 hours). This pharmacokinetic difference due
to gender is likely to be of little clinical importance. There was linearity of pharmacokinetics and no appreciable difference in the Cmax or Tmax across genders. Hepatic Impairment Following a single 15 mg dose of meloxicam there was no marked difference in plasma concentrations in patients with mild (Child- Pugh Class I) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class II) hepatic impairment compared to healthy volunteers. Protein binding of meloxicam was not affected by hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Patients
with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class III) have not been
adequately studied [see Warnings and Precautions

### Meloxicam (Vivlodex) [^112SnKP6]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

VIVLODEX has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties.

The mechanism of action of VIVLODEX, like that of other NSAIDs, is not completely understood but involves inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).

Meloxicam is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Meloxicam concentrations reached during therapy have produced in vivo effects. Prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin in inducing pain in animal models. Prostaglandins are mediators of inflammation. Because meloxicam is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, its mode of action may be due to a decrease of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The relative bioavailability of VIVLODEX 10 mg capsules compared to meloxicam 15 mg tablets was assessed in 28 healthy subjects under fasted and fed conditions in a single-dose crossover study.

VIVLODEX 10 mg capsules do not result in an equivalent systemic exposure compared to 15 mg meloxicam tablets. When taken under fasted conditions, a 33% lower dose of meloxicam in VIVLODEX 10 mg capsules resulted in a 33% lower overall systemic exposure (AUCinf) and a comparable mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) to meloxicam 15 mg tablets. The median time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) occurred earlier for VIVLODEX capsules (2 hours for both 5 mg and 10 mg) than for meloxicam tablets (4 hours for 15 mg).

Absorption

Single oral doses of VIVLODEX 5 mg and 10 mg were associated with dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. Mean Cmaxwas achieved within 2 hours post-dose for both VIVLODEX 5 mg and 10 mg capsules when taken under fasted conditions. A second meloxicam concentration peak occurs around 8 hours post-dose.

Taking VIVLODEX with food causes a decrease in the rate but not the overall extent of systemic meloxicam absorption compared with taking VIVLODEX on an empty stomach. VIVLODEX capsules administered under fed conditions results in 22% lower mean Cmaxand a 3 hour delay in median Tmax(5 hours for fed versus 2 hours for fasted) compared to the fasted condition. Significant changes in AUCinfwere not observed. VIVLODEX can be administered without regard to timing of meals.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^112VHMhn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Meloxicam IV generally was well tolerated in this study, with a low incidence of AEs, 2 discontinuations (due to "a desire to withdraw from the study"), no deaths, and no serious treatment-related AEs. In the combined treatment phases, the most commonly reported AE was anemia. This outcome likely reflects the procedure for reporting anemia in the study protocol and was not deemed clinically meaningful by the principal investigators.

Potential limitations of this study include the use of only single doses of morphine in the double-blind phase (morphine typically can be administered every 4 hours as needed) and the lack of comparators in the open-label extension. Furthermore, methods of imputation may have influenced the findings. For efficacy analyses, missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward approach. The scores for pain intensity and pain relief for any time points after the administration of rescue medication were imputed using the last score before the rescue dose. For the analyses of time to first perceptible pain relief, time to first meaningful pain relief, and time to first rescue analgesic, data from patients who withdrew prematurely or took rescue medication were right censored. Last, subjects who were nonresponders in the meloxicam IV treatment arms in the double-blind phase and subjects who received morphine or placebo and did not require rescue medication were not eligible to enter the open-label extension phase.

In summary, meloxicam IV at doses of 5–60 mg produced statistically significant improvement in pain intensity and pain relief compared with placebo in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy. Onset of pain relief with meloxicam IV ranged from 6 to 8 minutes and was comparable to that of morphine; analgesic effect was maintained for ≤ 24 hours. Meloxicam IV was generally well tolerated and reduced opioid consumption. Findings of this study support further (phase 3) studies of the efficacy and safety of the IV formulation of meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain.

At multiple time points during the initial 24 hours postdose, PI was lower in subjects treated with meloxicam IV (Figure 2). Moreover, summed PI scores were better for subjects who received meloxicam IV versus placebo for most time intervals, including notable recovery milestones (eg, first dose to 24 hours postdosing [P < .0001], first dose to first assisted ambulation [P = 0.0235], and first dose to discharge [P = 0.0001] [Table 3]). The OBAS score was significantly lower for meloxicam IV compared with placebo-treated subjects on the first postoperative day (LS mean [SE] 4.45 [0.360] vs 5.90 [0.375] for meloxicam and placebo, respectively; difference [95% CI], –1.45 [–2.39, –0.51]; P = 0.0027).

Time from EOS to first use of opioid rescue medication (via IV or oral administration) was significantly longer with meloxicam IV versus placebo (P = 0.0003) (Table 4). Meloxicam IV was associated with a longer time to first IV rescue medication (P = 0.0009) and a longer time to first oral rescue medication (P = 0.0036) (Table 5).

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^112YyzXn]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

This knowledge allows prediction of the clinical consequences of COX isozyme inhibition by NSAIDs. NSAIDs may affect platelet function in vivo when the inhibition of platelet COX-1 ex vivo is > 97%. This effect occurs primarily with low-dose aspirin and persists throughout the dose interval. Naproxen, which is a reversible inhibitor of COX isozymes and has a higher potency for COX-1 than COX-2 and a long half-life (~14 hours), may have an aspirin-like effect on platelet function in some individuals when administered at high (500 mg twice daily) doses. The use of whole-blood assays allows for characterization of COX isozyme selectivity of NSAIDs in vitro. Concentration-dependent relationships for inhibition of whole-blood COX-1 and COX-2 activities as a function of the addition of an NSAID in vitro allow for assessment of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values for COX-1 and COX-2, as well as calculation of IC 50 ratios for COX-1/COX-2. COX-2 selectivity assessed in human whole blood in vitro is a continuous variable, and it is not possible to separate traditional NSAIDs from coxibs (Figure 2C).

All NSAIDs are essentially COX-2 inhibitors with differing degrees of COX-1 inhibition as a "side effect". From a clinical perspective, COX-2 selectivity can be considered as a variable describing the probability of sparing COX-1 activity and avoiding associated side effects (eg, in the gastrointestinal mucosa and platelets) at therapeutic concentrations of the NSAID. Drugs that inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 with comparable potency (known as nonselective NSAIDs; eg, ibuprofen and ketoprofen) will not spare COX-1 activity after dosing, while drugs with intermediate COX-2 selectivity (eg, nimesulide, meloxicam, diclofenac, celecoxib) or highly selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, rofecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib [not available in the United States]) have greater potential for sparing COX-1 activity.

### Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an intravenous nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam in the management of moderate-to-severe pain after bunionectomy [^117QBD8N]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Response analysis

The proportions of subjects with pain reduction of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% from baseline during the first 6 and 24 hours were determined by the W2LOCF and LOCF analysis methods. According to W2LOCF analysis, significantly more subjects who received meloxicam IV 30 mg doses had pain reductions of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% over 6 hours and 24 hours after receiving the first dose in comparison with those who received placebo (P ≤ 0.05; Figure 3). However, the LOCF analysis method did not show a statistically significant difference versus placebo with doses of 30 mg, and neither analysis method demonstrated a significant difference with meloxicam IV doses of 60 mg versus placebo.

PGA of the pain-control method

No statistically significant differences in PGA scores between the three study groups were observed at 24 or 48 hours after administration of the first dose of study medication. However, compared with placebo recipients, more subjects in both meloxicam IV groups reported "good" or better pain control (ie, a rating of ≥ 2 on the 5-point scale) at these times (Figure 4).

Rescue analgesia

Oral oxycodone 5 mg, the rescue medication used in this study, was required by ≥ 90% of subjects in all three study groups within the first 24 hours of receiving the initial dose of study medication. However, the percentage of subjects who required rescue analgesia during the second 24 hours (Hours 24–48) was lower with both doses of meloxicam IV than with placebo (55.0%, 52.6%, and 77.8%, respectively). Although the time to first use of rescue medication was significantly longer with meloxicam IV doses of 60 mg than with placebo (median, 3.10 hours versus 1.57 hours; P < 0.05), there was no significant difference between the meloxicam IV 30 mg dose and placebo.

Subjects treated with either dose of meloxicam IV required fewer doses of rescue analgesia than those who received placebo (average number of rescue doses: 8.2, 6.9, and 11.1 with meloxicam IV 30 mg and 60 mg doses and placebo, respectively), but the differences were not statistically significant.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of meloxicam / rizatriptan PO (also known as Symbravo):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Cardiac arrhythmias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, including VT and VF, have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5-HT1 agonists.
- **Cerebrovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events, including cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke.
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as meloxicam may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and rizatriptan has been associated with significant BP elevations, including hypertensive crisis. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam reduces inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and DRESS syndrome.
- **Vasospastic reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-coronary vasospastic reactions, including peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction, splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome.

### Safety, tolerability, and effect on opioid use of meloxicam IV following orthopedic surgery [^115ER2uL]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

A Phase 3 randomized multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT02720692) compared once-daily intravenous (IV) meloxicam 30 mg to placebo, when added to the standard of care pain management regimens, in adults with moderate-to-severe pain following major elective surgery and concluded that meloxicam IV had a safety profile similar to placebo and reduced opioid consumption.

Methods

In this post hoc subgroup analysis of orthopedic surgery subjects, 379 subjects received meloxicam IV 30 mg or IV-administered placebo every 24 hrs for ≤ 7 doses. Safety was assessed via AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG, with an emphasis on specific AEs, including injection site reactions, bleeding, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thrombotic, and wound healing events. Daily opioid consumption was assessed during treatment.

Results

Among meloxicam IV-treated subjects, 64.7% experienced ≥ 1 AE versus 68.8% of placebo-treated subjects. Investigators assessed most AEs to be mild or moderate in intensity and unrelated to treatment. Total opioid consumption (36.8 mg versus 50.3 mg IV morphine equivalent dose; P = 0.0081) and opioid consumption during time points 0‒24, 24‒48, 0‒48, and 0‒72 hrs were statistically significantly lower in the meloxicam IV group.

Conclusion

Meloxicam IV demonstrated no significant differences in the number and frequency of AEs versus placebo in subjects following orthopedic surgery. Opioid consumption was reduced in the meloxicam IV group versus placebo.

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^113aC6sG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as part of multimodal analgesia in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) are believed to have fewer gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects than nonselective NSAIDS. Meloxicam is less selective for COX-2 than celecoxib is and partially inhibits COX-1 at higher doses. Nonetheless, some surgeons prefer using nonselective NSAIDs because of their lower expense.

Methods

Four thousand nine hundred ninety-four patients who underwent TKA between January 2015 and February 2020 and took either celecoxib (n = 3,174), meloxicam 15 mg/d (n = 1,819), or meloxicam 7.5 mg/d (n = 451) were studied. Mutlimodal postoperative analgesia protocols were otherwise similar. GI bleeding and wound complication incidence were determined, as well as average 30-day prescription costs.

Results

GI bleeding incidence was similar in the three cohorts (P = 0.4). The incidence of wound complications did not significantly differ between the groups: 0.06%, 0.07%, and 0.22% in the celecoxib, meloxicam 15 mg/d, and meloxicam 7.5 mg/d groups, respectively (P = 0.06). Subsituting meloxicam for celecoxib results in an average savings of $183 per prescription.

Discussion

Meloxicam used at higher doses (15 mg/d) does not markedly increase the risk of GI or wound complications associated with COX-1 inhibition and is less costly for multimodal analgesia after TKA.

### Ischaemic colitis in a patient taking meloxicam [^116mUVck]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

The safety of cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) preferential inhibitors such as meloxicam is debated. We describe a patient who presented with bloody diarrhoea after 15 mg meloxicam daily for 10 days for osteoarthritis. The endoscopic and histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of ischaemic colitis. Symptoms and endoscopic lesions quickly regressed within 1 week of meloxicam withdrawal. There was no evidence of another cause of colonic ischaemia. We suggest that meloxicam might have intestinal toxic effects when taken in high doses, because of reduced COX-2 selectivity.

Warfarin: The effect of meloxicam tablets on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8. In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1. Caution should be used when administering XIFYRM with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced [see Drug Interactions (7)].

12.5	Pharmacogenomics

CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic variants such as CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3 polymorphisms. Limited data from three published reports showed that meloxicam AUC was substantially higher in individuals with reduced CYP2C9 activity, particularly in poor metabolizers (e.g., *3/✱3), compared to normal metabolizers (*1/✱1). The frequency of CYP2C9 poor metabolizer genotypes varies based on racial/ethnic background but is generally present in < 5% of the population.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^11355wgA]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The anticipated sample size of the study (100 subjects per group) had a ≥ 90% power to detect the difference between meloxicam IV 30 mg and placebo in total opioid consumption, based on the results of the phase 3 safety study that evaluated meloxicam IV 30 mg in major surgeries. Results are reported as mean values ± standard error (SE). Treatment effect analyses were performed on the modified intent-to-treat analysis set, which included all subjects who received ≥ 1 injection of study drug and underwent the scheduled surgery. Treatment effect was evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for opioid consumption‒related endpoints and PI-related endpoints. The ANCOVA model included treatment as the main effect and investigational site as a covariate. Differences in least squares (LS) means were compared between the treatment groups. Differences between meloxicam IV 30 mg and placebo groups were evaluated via a 2-sided, 2-sample t -test at the 0.05 significance level. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for time-to-event endpoints, including Kaplan-Meier survival curves; 25th-, 50th-, and 75th-percentile estimates; and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The magnitude of treatment effect of meloxicam IV 30 mg versus placebo for time-to-event endpoints was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards (PH) model to estimate hazard ratios (HR; meloxicam IV 30 mg/placebo). The Cox PH model included treatment effects and investigational sites. HR estimates and 95% CIs were based on Wald's statistics.

Safety and tolerability assessments were performed on the safety set, which included all treated subjects. Safety endpoints and health care utilization measures were analyzed descriptively.

### Safety and efficacy of perioperative intravenous meloxicam for moderate-to-severe pain management in total knee arthroplasty: a randomized clinical trial [^116X9ykw]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Meloxicam is an NSAID with a prolonged half-life that has preferential, but not exclusive, inhibition of COX-2, demonstrating a more favorable gastrointestinal AE profile (ie, lower rates of GI-related AEs [dyspepsia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, GI mucosal damage]) than that of nonselective NSAIDs. Intravenously administered meloxicam (meloxicam IV) utilizes a novel nanocrystal formulation of meloxicam and has been evaluated in seven phase 2 and 3 postoperative studies in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain following hard-tissue surgery or soft-tissue surgery.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative administration of meloxicam IV 30 mg (first dose administered prior to surgery) on opioid consumption in subjects undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In this study, meloxicam IV was used as part of a multimodal pain management regimen to provide pain relief in accordance with generally accepted good practices. Secondary objectives were to assess the safety of meloxicam IV 30 mg and to evaluate its effect on postoperative pain, as well as associated health care resource utilization, compared with that of placebo.

### Meloxicam (Vivlodex) [^113sEDRZ]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of meloxicam PO (also known as Vivlodex, Mobic):
- **Anemia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of anemia. Monitor hemoglobin levels and for signs of bleeding.
- **Edema**: use caution in patients taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, as meloxicam may blunt the cardiovascular effects of these agents. Avoid using in patients with severe HF unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening HF.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of elevations of serum transaminases and, rarely, severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure. Monitor liver enzymes periodically in patients on long-term treatment.
- **HF**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalization for HF, and death.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as meloxicam has been associated with an increased risk of new-onset or worsening of pre-existing hypertension. Monitor BP.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Mask symptoms of infection**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs reduce inflammation and fever, potentially diminishing the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.
- **Renal toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term use of NSAIDs has been associated with an increased risk of renal papillary necrosis, renal insufficiency, AKI, and other renal injury, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration or hypovolemia, taking diuretics, ACEis, or ARBs, and in the elderly. Monitor renal function in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, HF, dehydration, or hypovolemia.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as NSAIDs have been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### Bupivacaine and meloxicam (Zynrelef) [^113MHZVS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Excretion

After bupivacaine and meloxicam have been released from ZYNRELEF and are absorbed systemically, their excretion is expected to be the same as for other bupivacaine HCl solution formulations or meloxicam oral formulations.

Bupivacaine

The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites. Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH. Only 6% of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine.

When administered in recommended doses and concentrations, bupivacaine HCl does not ordinarily produce irritation or tissue damage. The mean apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) for bupivacaine from ZYNRELEF is approximately 10 to 25 hours.

Meloxicam

Meloxicam excretion is predominately in the form of metabolites, and occurs to equal extents in the urine and feces. Following oral meloxicam, only traces of the unchanged parent compound are excreted in the urine (0.2%) and feces (1.6%). The extent of the urinary excretion was confirmed for unlabeled multiple 7.5 mg oral meloxicam doses: 0.5%, 6%, and 13% of the dose were found in urine in the form of meloxicam, and the 5'-hydroxymethyl and 5'-carboxy metabolites, respectively. There is significant biliary and/or enteral secretion of the drug. This was demonstrated when oral administration of cholestyramine following a single IV dose of meloxicam decreased the AUC of meloxicam by 50%.

The mean apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) for meloxicam from ZYNRELEF is approximately 21 to 42 hours.

Effect of Age, Sex, Race, and Ethnicity on Pharmacokinetics

Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, sex, race, and ethnicity do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine and meloxicam in ZYNRELEF [see Use in Special Populations (8.5)].

### Meloxicam versus celecoxib for postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty: safety, efficacy and cost [^1154iFfP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study contains all the weaknesses that are present in retrospective reviews. Because we established cohorts based on what TKA patients were prescribed, the retrospective nature of the study means that patients who were prescribed may not have been taking celecoxib or meloxicam as instructed. Nonetheless, we reviewed the discharge medications of those who had a discharge record present in our system and whether celecoxib or meloxicam use was mentioned in patient chart note search to improve the accuracy of our data. About our primary end point, GI bleeding/ulceration, we were underpowered because of the low incidence of these complications in our cohort. The low incidence of GI complications and thus the underpowered findings may be attributable to the rarity of the complication. At our institution, the historical rate of GI complications after TJA from 2008 to 2019 was 0.6% (102/17,402 patients), and peptic ulcer disease was found to be a notable risk factor. In our study, 0.2%, 0.1%, and 0% of patients in the celecoxib, meloxicam 15 mg/d, and meloxicam 7.5 mg/d cohorts, respectively, had a prior history of peptic ulcer disease (P = 1.0), suggesting that patients in our study had low GI risk in general. Furthermore, our institutional guidelines limit the prescription of NSAIDS to patients with serious GI risk. Therefore, we believe that these variables, taken together, should not detract from the findings of our study and that these results offer the best available evidence on NSAIDS and postoperative complications in TKA. We would encourage prospective studies to corroborate our findings. We also could not evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of the medications used at various dosages. Nevertheless, clinical practice guidelines dictate that irrespective of COX-1/COX-2 selectivity, there is no difference in analgesic effectiveness among NSAIDs. Although we used average retail costs, in practice, the cost of prescriptions may vary depending on insurance coverage, rebate, and discount programs at pharmacies. The strengths of our study include having the largest retrospective comparative study of the safety profile of NSAIDS in the realm of TJA and having a large cohort size of patients, showing that our results have external validity.

### Analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous meloxicam in subjects with moderate-to-severe pain after open abdominal hysterectomy: a phase 2 randomized clinical trial [^1128R7Tc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design and Subjects

This 2-part multicenter study was approved by an independent ethics committee. All clinical work was conducted in compliance with current Good Clinical Practices as stated in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guideline E6, local regulatory requirements, and principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Before patient enrollment, this multicenter study was registered with(NCT01084161; principal investigators at each site [Supplemental Digital Content 1, Table S1,]; date of registration: March 5, 2010). All study subjects provided written informed consent before participation. The study was performed at 14 sites in 3 countries (Poland, Serbia, and Georgia) from August 6, 2010, to January 4, 2011. Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, single-dose study. Part 2 was a multiple-dose, open-label safety extension.

Women 18–65 years of age who were scheduled to undergo open abdominal hysterectomy with an anticipated incision length of ≥ 3 inches, who otherwise were in good health (American Society of Anesthesiology class I or II), were considered for study participation. Subjects were eligible for part 1 of the study if they experienced moderate-to-severe pain in ≤ 6 hours of morphine discontinuation, which took place at ≈6on postoperative day 1 (4-point Likert scale category of moderate or severe and visual analog scale [VAS] score ≥ 45 mm on a scale of 0–100 mm).

Exclusion criteria included active gastrointestinal bleeding or history of peptic ulcer disease; any known bleeding disorder or use of agents affecting coagulation; history of abdominal surgery, with the exception of inguinal hernia repair, lateral-approach appendectomy, or cesarean delivery performed > 1 year before study participation and yielding no postoperative complications; and history of chronic opioid use (> 30 consecutive days of use) for pain in the previous 2 years.

Subjects randomized to receive meloxicam IV in part 1 could be enrolled in the open-label extension (part 2) if they did not take rescue medication in the first 18 hours of the double-blind phase (responders). Subjects randomized to receive placebo or morphine in part 1 could be enrolled in part 2 if they used rescue medication within the first 18 hours of the double-blind phase (nonresponders).

Study Procedures

Per the standard of care in each participating institution, open abdominal hysterectomy was performed with subjects under general anesthesia, and postoperative morphine was administered by bolus IV injection or patient-controlled analgesia.

### Meloxicam, histidine (trepoxicam-7.5) [^114Qn9FX]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment
8.7 Renal Impairment

8.5 Geriatric Use As with any NSAID, caution should be exercised in treating the elderly (65 years and older). Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies, 5157 were age 65 and over (4044 in OA studies and 1113 in RA studies). No overall
differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these
subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience
has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and
younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

8.6 Hepatic Impairment No
dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic
impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been
adequately studied. Since meloxicam is significantly metabolized in the
liver; the use of meloxicam in these patients should be done with caution [see Warnings and Precautions

and Clinical Pharmacology].

8.7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been studied. The use of MOBIC in subjects with severe renal impairment is not recommended. Following a single dose of meloxicam,
the free Cmax plasma concentrations were higher in patients with renal
failure on chronic hemodialysis (1% free fraction) in comparison to healthy volunteers (0.3% free fraction). Therefore, it is recommended that meloxicam dosage in this population not
exceed 7.5 mg per day. Hemodialysis did not lower the total drug
concentration in plasma; therefore, additional doses are not necessary after hemodialysis. Meloxicam is not dialyzable [see Dosage and Administration, Warnings and Precautions, and Clinical Pharmacology].
