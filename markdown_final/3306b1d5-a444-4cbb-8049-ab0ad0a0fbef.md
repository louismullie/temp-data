## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient with low anti-HBs detected on routine screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and what "low anti-HBs" actually means. Then, I should verify the complete HBV serologic panel to distinguish vaccine-induced immunity from resolved infection versus isolated anti-HBc. Next, I will interpret the serologic patterns and define thresholds for immunity. After that, I will risk-stratify and outline management by scenario, including immunocompromised states and special populations. Finally, I will address counseling, documentation, and follow-up, and I will double-check assay variability and edge cases that could alter decisions [^113Vf5hB] [^114PW1Hv].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the meaning of "low anti-HBs". Anti-HBs is the surface antibody that indicates immunity either from vaccination or from resolved infection; in immunocompetent persons, a titer of at least 10 mIU/mL measured 1–2 months after a completed series is considered protective, and waning below 10 mIU/mL over time does not necessarily mean loss of immunity because memory responses often persist, though some high-risk groups need tighter thresholds and periodic monitoring [^113Vf5hB] [^116H1cHQ]. Wait, let me verify the thresholds used in special populations: many dialysis and HIV guidelines use 100 mIU/mL as a more conservative cut point for durability and protection, so I should keep that in mind as I proceed [^114rqtcR] [^111a7Xkq].

> I need to check the complete HBV serologic panel before making any decision, because anti-HBs alone is insufficient to determine whether the patient is immune from vaccination, has resolved infection, or has isolated anti-HBc suggesting occult or remote infection. The triple panel should include HBsAg, total anti-HBc, and anti-HBs, and I should ensure anti-HBc is total IgG/IgM rather than IgM-only unless acute infection is suspected, as IgM-only would misclassify chronic or resolved disease [^113Vf5hB] [^114XN4gN]. Hold on, I should verify that recent passive antibody receipt (e.g. IVIG) could yield a false-positive anti-HBc; if suspected, I should repeat serologies after the biologic half-life has elapsed or correlate with prior records [^114dUgrt].

> Now, let me interpret the serologic patterns carefully. If HBsAg is negative, anti-HBc is negative, and anti-HBs is positive at any level, that supports vaccine-induced immunity; if HBsAg is negative, anti-HBc is positive, and anti-HBs is positive, that indicates resolved infection with durable immunity; if HBsAg is negative, anti-HBc is positive, and anti-HBs is negative, that is isolated anti-HBc, which can reflect false positivity, resolved infection with waning anti-HBs, occult HBV, or acute infection in the window period; if HBsAg is positive, that indicates current infection requiring disease-phase assessment and management [^113Vf5hB] [^114XN4gN]. I should double-check for occult infection risk in isolated anti-HBc, especially in immunocompromised hosts, where low-level HBV DNA may be present and reactivation risk is higher with immunosuppression [^1151o2e3].

> For immunocompetent, non-dialysis adults with low anti-HBs and negative HBsAg and anti-HBc, I should confirm vaccination history and, if the series is incomplete, complete it; if the series is complete and anti-HBs is below 10 mIU/mL, I should offer a single booster dose and recheck anti-HBs 1–2 months later, recognizing that many will mount an anamnestic response and that routine periodic titers are not required in immunocompetent hosts after adequate primary vaccination [^113Vf5hB] [^116H1cHQ]. Wait, let me verify the nuance here: although titers can wane below 10 mIU/mL, most immunocompetent persons retain immune memory and do not need routine boosters; I should avoid over-testing unless exposure risk or clinical context changes [^113Vf5hB].

> For persons with HIV or other immunocompromised states, I should use a higher protective threshold and a more structured approach. Let me consider the 100 mIU/mL cut point: guidelines recommend giving one standard dose of HepB vaccine to those with isolated anti-HBc or low anti-HBs, then checking anti-HBs 1–2 months later; if the titer is at least 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if it is less than 100 mIU/mL, a complete series (often double-dose) should be given with post-series serology, and if titers remain suboptimal, additional strategies or acceptance of nonresponse may be needed [^111a7Xkq] [^112KLnvY]. Hold on, I should verify that routine HBV DNA testing is not recommended for isolated anti-HBc in HIV outside pregnancy; yes, that is correct, though pregnancy or high-risk scenarios may warrant individualized consideration [^113jMngm] [^114u4ARf].

> For hemodialysis patients, I need to ensure a strict threshold and surveillance cadence. Adequate response is typically defined as anti-HBs greater than 100 mIU/mL 8 weeks after the series, and many units provide boosters if annual titers fall below 100 mIU/mL because antibody loss is common and exposure risk is high; nonresponders after two full series are counseled on exposure precautions and may require HBIG for exposures [^114rqtcR] [^115eUNKG]. Wait, let me verify the nonresponder pathway: if anti-HBs remains below 10 mIU/mL after two series, the patient is labeled a nonresponder and should be managed with exposure avoidance and post-exposure prophylaxis protocols rather than further vaccination attempts, except in select high-risk contexts where alternative regimens may be considered [^114rqtcR].

> For oncology or other patients facing immunosuppression, I should confirm baseline HBV serostatus with HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs before starting therapy and not delay cancer treatment for results; those with chronic HBV should receive antiviral prophylaxis during and for at least 12 months after immunosuppression, and those with resolved HBV at high reactivation risk (e.g., anti-CD20, stem cell transplant) should receive prophylaxis, whereas lower-risk regimens may be managed with close monitoring and on-demand antivirals if reactivation occurs [^115vFsic] [^11566r4Y]. I should double-check that anti-HBs positivity reduces but does not eliminate reactivation risk; indeed, meta-analytic data show higher reactivation in anti-HBc-positive/anti-HBs-negative patients than in those with anti-HBs present, supporting risk stratification and prophylaxis decisions [^115VVn9S].

> But wait, what if the serology shows isolated anti-HBc with low or absent anti-HBs? I should confirm there is no HBsAg positivity and then consider a single vaccine challenge with anti-HBs testing 1–2 months later; a robust anamnestic rise supports prior immunity and may obviate a full series, whereas a poor response suggests true susceptibility and warrants completion of a standard or high-dose series depending on host factors; in immunocompromised hosts, I should also maintain vigilance for occult infection if immunosuppression is planned, balancing prophylaxis versus intensified monitoring based on regimen risk [^111a7Xkq] [^1151o2e3]. Hold on, I should verify that false-positive anti-HBc can occur after IVIG; if suspected, I should repeat serologies after an appropriate interval or correlate with prior results to avoid misclassification [^114dUgrt].

> I will now examine assay variability, because quantitative anti-HBs results can differ substantially across platforms, and this can affect decisions near threshold cut points. Studies comparing commercial anti-HBs assays show notable inter-assay variability, so if a result is borderline or discordant with clinical expectations, I should consider repeating testing on the same platform or confirming with an alternative method before making firm management decisions, especially in high-risk populations where titers guide boosters or prophylaxis [^114PW1Hv]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost anchored on a single numeric threshold; given this variability, clinical judgment and, when possible, trend assessment can improve accuracy in decision-making [^114PW1Hv].

> Next, I should review counseling and documentation. Patients with vaccine-induced immunity should be reassured that waning anti-HBs does not equal loss of protection in immunocompetent hosts, though high-risk groups may merit periodic titers; patients with resolved infection should be counseled on reactivation risk with immunosuppression and the need to inform future prescribers; all results and vaccination actions should be clearly documented to avoid redundant testing and to support safe care transitions [^113Vf5hB] [^116H1cHQ]. I need to ensure that patients who are nonresponders or who decline vaccination understand exposure precautions and post-exposure protocols, including timely HBIG after potential exposures, and that this is recorded in the chart [^113Vf5hB].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up plans. For immunocompetent adults who complete a booster, no routine repeat testing is needed unless exposure risk or clinical context changes; for immunocompromised persons, periodic anti-HBs checks every 1–5 years depending on risk and guideline context are reasonable to detect waning and prompt boosters; for hemodialysis patients, annual titers with boosters if below 100 mIU/mL are standard in many programs; for oncology or transplant candidates, I should coordinate pre-immunosuppression screening and prophylaxis timing to mitigate reactivation risk [^113Vf5hB] [^114rqtcR] [^115vFsic]. Hold on, I should verify that any planned immunosuppression triggers a need to reassess HBV serostatus and risk; yes, multiple society guidelines converge on pre-immunosuppression screening and risk-based prophylaxis or monitoring strategies to prevent HBV reactivation [^115vFsic] [^1139N9mF].

For a patient with low anti-HBs on routine check-up, **confirm immunity status** with HBsAg and anti-HBc [^112sRDeK], then **give a single HBV vaccine booster** if HBsAg and anti-HBc are negative [^113ocRqF]. If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL after 1–2 months, **complete a full 3-dose series** and recheck anti-HBs [^113ocRqF]. If still < 10 mIU/mL, **repeat the series or use a higher-dose regimen** (e.g. 40 µg) and consider intradermal or adjuvanted vaccines for nonresponders [^114rqtcR] [^115eUNKG]. Counsel on exposure risk and provide HBIG for significant exposures; monitor anti-HBs annually in immunocompromised or high-risk patients [^113ocRqF] [^114rqtcR].

---

## Step 1: confirm immunity status

Order **HBsAg and anti-HBc** to distinguish vaccine-induced immunity from past/resolved infection or occult HBV [^113Vf5hB]. Interpret results as follows:

| **HBsAg** | **Anti-HBc** | **Interpretation** | **Action** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Negative | Negative | Vaccine-induced immunity waning | Booster dose |
| Negative | Positive | Past/resolved infection | Monitor; no booster |
| Positive | Positive | Chronic or acute HBV | Refer to specialist |

---

## Step 2: administer booster dose

If HBsAg and anti-HBc are negative, **give a single standard-dose HBV vaccine booster** (20 µg IM) [^notfound].

---

## Step 3: post-booster serologic testing

Check **anti-HBs 1–2 months after the booster** [^113ocRqF]. If anti-HBs is ≥ 10 mIU/mL, immunity is restored; if < 10 mIU/mL, proceed to Step 4 [^113Vf5hB].

---

## Step 4: complete vaccination series

If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL, **complete a full 3-dose HBV series** (0, 1, 6 months) and recheck anti-HBs 1–2 months after the final dose [^113ocRqF].

---

## Step 5: management of nonresponders

If anti-HBs is still < 10 mIU/mL after the full series, **repeat the series or use a higher-dose regimen** (e.g. 40 µg) and consider intradermal or adjuvanted vaccines [^113LmWRR]. If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL after two series, label as a nonresponder and counsel on exposure risk and HBIG use [^114rqtcR].

---

## Step 6: special considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Use higher-dose or accelerated schedules; monitor anti-HBs annually [^113ocRqF].
- **Healthcare workers**: Ensure anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL; revaccinate if < 10 mIU/mL [^113ocRqF].
- **Dialysis patients**: Use high-dose or intradermal regimens; monitor anti-HBs annually [^115eUNKG].

---

## Step 7: patient counseling

Counsel on **HBV exposure risk**, safe sex, and avoiding shared needles [^113ocRqF]. Provide **HBIG for significant exposures** and ensure prompt medical evaluation [^113ocRqF].

---

## Summary algorithm

Confirm immunity with HBsAg and anti-HBc; if both are negative, **give a booster** and recheck anti-HBs in 1–2 months. If anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL, **complete a full 3-dose series** and recheck; if still < 10 mIU/mL, repeat or use higher-dose regimens, and counsel nonresponders on exposure risk and HBIG use [^113ocRqF].

Serology-based counseling prior to anticancer therapy — patient messages should reflect specific HBV test patterns: Patients who have isolated anti-HBc may need further work-up because the HBV management for these patients depends on the type of anticancer therapy administered, and these patients are not at risk for transmission through sexual or close personal contact. Patients with a detectable anti-HBs but who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc can be counseled that they have protective levels of antibody from previous vaccination. Patients who are positive for anti-HBc and anti-HBs have resolved hepatitis B infection and should be counseled that they are at risk, albeit lower than if they had a negative anti-HBs, of HBV reactivation. Patients who are negative for all HBV screening tests (negative HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) are considered not to be immune to HBV, have never been exposed to HBV, and may benefit from HBV vaccination, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing of anticancer therapy.

As persons transition across phases over the lifetime of infection, regular monitoring is essential to identify when a change of management is indicated, including use of antiviral therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Management of isolated anti-HBc in HIV — routinely checking HBV DNA is not recommended; instead, vaccinate with one standard dose of HBV vaccine and check anti-HBs titers 1 to 2 months after vaccination. If the anti-HBs titer is > 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is < 100 mIU/mL, a complete series of HBV vaccine should be completed followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). The cut-off of 100 mIU/mL is supported by a study in which 100% of patients with isolated anti-HBc who achieved a titer of 100 mIU/mL after a booster dose maintained an anti-HBs response for > 18 months compared to 23% among those with a titer of 1 to 100 mIU/mL.

### Selecting appropriate management strategies for chronic hepatitis B: who to treat [^114aqTtx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a significant problem. In the United States estimates indicate that 0.3% of the population (1.25 million individuals) have chronic hepatitis B infection.

Methods

Review of published practice guidelines and literature on management of hepatitis B to determine: 1) Which persons in Western populations are at the highest risk for HBV infection and should be screened for HBV seromarkers to identify those who are chronically infected and those who need to be protected with hepatitis B vaccine; 2) The importance of regular monitoring in persons with chronic hepatitis B, the frequency of monitoring, and which tests should be performed; 3) How to identify the patients who are appropriate candidates for antiviral therapy.

Results

Recommendations for screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of chronic HBV infection are reviewed. Important differences are discussed between the Practice Guidelines for chronic hepatitis B developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL). In addition, this article reviews which patients who are no covered by these Guidelines might be candidates for antiviral therapy.

Discussion

Established practice guidelines provide direction to providers for the diagnosis and management of chronic HBV infection to reduce the risk of serious sequelae. However, not all patients with chronic hepatitis B are identified, and many of those who are diagnosed do not receive adequate management and follow-up.

### Reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection in patients with hematologic disorders [^1169ybz7]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Management of hepatitis B virus reactivation

Screening

Ideal management and prevention of HBV reactivation includes both stringent identification of at risk patients prior to initiation of any immunosuppressive therapy, and appropriate consideration of prophylactic antiviral treat ment. As the majority of people with chronic or past HBV are not aware of their infection, it has been strongly recommended by several international societies and guidelines that all patients should be screened for HBV prior to commencing any immunosuppressive therapy. Given the significant risk of reactivation associated with resolved HBV infection and certain regimens, this should include testing for both HBsAg and anti-HBc antibody. Testing for anti-HBs antibodies may also be beneficial, as those without anti-HBs are considered to be at even higher risk. However, at the moment, no recommendations have been made concerning stratifying management according to anti-HBs presence or titer.

If during screening a new HBsAg-positive patient is identified, he or she should be referred to an appropriate specialist hepatitis service to undergo full assessment, regardless of the plans for immunosuppression. Assessment will focus on defining the phase of HBV infection (Table 1), differentiating between chronic HBV infection and chronic hepatitis, and staging the liver disease with a combination of imaging, liver biopsy, and/or noninvasive methods such as transient elastography (FibroScan). Patients positive for anti-HBc antibody may also require assessment, as they may still present with advanced liver disease, even in the absence of active HBV viremia. In rare cases, anti-HBc positivity may also represent true occult HBV infection, where the patient is HBsAg-negative but has positive serum HBV DNA. This can be due to virus mutations in surface antigen rendering it undetectable with standard HBsAg assays or, more commonly, strongly suppressed but active viral replication. Such patients are managed the same as those who are HBsAg-positive.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination — titer testing and isolated anti-HBc management: Anti-HBs should be obtained 4 weeks after completion of the vaccine series to document response to HepB vaccination, defined as anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL (AIII). Vaccinate individuals with isolated anti-HBc with one standard dose of HepB (BIII) and check anti-HBs titers 1–2 months afterward. If anti-HBs ≥ 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, but if the titer is < 100 mIU/mL, then vaccinate with a complete series of HepB (double dose) followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). If titers are not available, then give a complete vaccine series followed by anti-HBs testing (BII). If a significant delay occurs between doses, there is no need to restart the series.

### New and old biomarkers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^114BTGsH]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests to detect the presence and activity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the cornerstones of diagnosis and management. Assays that detect or measure serum levels of HB surface antigen, HB surface antibody, and HB core antibody are used to identify patients with exposure to HBV, whereas other tests provide information on the level of virus replication, presence of specific variants, and presence of virus reservoirs. Newer diagnostic tests, used only in research settings so far, aim to quantify levels of intrahepatic HBV replication. Other tests have been developed to detect HBV infection in resource-limited settings. We review point-of-care tests (essential in global screening efforts), standard diagnostic tests used in routine clinical management, and newer tests that might be used in clinical trials of agents designed to cure HBV infection.

Guideline 5.6 – BBV infection: identification and management of 'non-responders' to the immunisation programme

We suggest that patients should be regarded as an inadequate-responder if the anti HBs antibody titre is < 100mIU/ml 8 weeks after completing the first complete immunisation schedule. (1C).

We would suggest the following strategies:
If the anti HBs Ab titre is between 10 IU/ml and 100 IU/ml we recommend administering a booster dose of the vaccine. (1C)
If the anti HBs titre is < 10 IU/ml we recommend repeating the entire vaccination course with the high concentration of the vaccine (or the appropriate dose for children age < 16 years). (1C) Follow up with an anti-HBs antibody titre test 4 to 6 weeks following the last injection to ensure it is greater than 10 m IU/l.
If after two full vaccination courses the anti HBs titre remains < 10mIU/ml we recommend that the patient is labeled as a non-responder to the vaccine, and therefore not immune to HBV.
A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and the recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B)

### Implementing evidenced-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^111jt352]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In the past 2 years, evidenced-based guidelines and statements on screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from several organizations and experts have been published. The purpose of this article is to take the recommendations from these documents and help guide clinicians — whether they are primary care providers, hepatologists, gastroenterologists, or public health workers — about how to incorporate these guidelines into practice. The first task is for all providers to be involved in identifying persons with chronic HBV infection (CHB). New recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocate screening for the HBV in those at highest risk, especially persons from countries where HBV is endemic. Using information from the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient infected with HBV, especially the hepatitis B e antigen/antibody status, clinicians can classify the patient into 1 of the 4 phases of HBV infection. Because CHB is a dynamic process and patients can move from inactive to active infection status, and vice versa, all patients must be followed with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase monitoring every 3 to 12 months for life. Those with elevated ALT and HBV DNA levels (> 2,000 IU/mL) should be referred to a specialist for evaluation for possible treatment. Patients selected for antiviral therapy with nucleoside analogues should be followed every 3 to 6 months to detect emergence of antiviral resistance to the agent chosen. In addition, alpha-fetoprotein should be tested and ultrasound performed on all men aged > 40 years and women > 50 years of age to detect any hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an early stage. Algorithms are included for primary care providers providing information on initial evaluation and management and referral of persons with CHB, and for specialists evaluating and treating HBV. Implementing steps to identify, follow, refer, and treat appropriately persons with CHB infection by all primary care and specialist healthcare providers can have a major impact on reducing the occurrence of HCC and cirrhosis in infected persons.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114zurS6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO (2020) HBV screening and management in patients with cancer — "All patients with cancer anticipating systemic anticancer therapy should be tested for HBV", with serology "HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs". Testing details specify "3 tests — HBsAg, anti-HBc total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen — but anticancer therapy should not be delayed". For chronic HBV, "Patients with chronic HBV receiving any systemic anticancer therapy should receive antiviral prophylactic therapy through and for minimum 12 months following anticancer therapy", and "Coordination of care with a clinician experienced in HBV management is recommended… after completion of anticancer therapy". "Hormonal therapy alone should not pose a substantial risk…; these patients may follow noncancer HBV monitoring and treatment guidance". For past HBV with high-risk therapies such as "anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or stem-cell transplantation", patients "should receive antiviral prophylaxis during and for minimum 12 months after anticancer therapy completion", though "Careful monitoring may be an alternative" if close follow-up is feasible. For past HBV with other systemic therapies not clearly high risk, patients "should be monitored with HBsAg and ALT during cancer treatment; antiviral therapy should commence if HBV reactivation occurs".

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^114hBctn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

HBV immunity assessment and vaccination around anticancer therapy are outlined. Anti-HBs testing allows for assessing immunity, and individuals who are negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc, as well as anti-HBs, have never been exposed to HBV, are not immune, and thus are susceptible to HBV infection. Vaccination can be recommended, taking into consideration a patient's clinical situation and timing, although insufficient data exist to recommend vaccination specifically for immunocompromised individuals. Some recommendations suggest waiting 3–6 months after cessation of anticancer treatment, and because anticancer therapy can dampen immunogenicity of HBV vaccination, higher doses or more intensive vaccination regimens may be needed to achieve protective levels of anti-HBs. If immunocompromised patients receive vaccination, postvaccination serology testing has been suggested. Among patients who have isolated anti-HBc–positive with negative HBsAg and anti-HBs, studies have shown that protective levels of anti-HBs can decrease risk of HBV reactivation.

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

### The role of HBsAg levels in the current management of chronic HBV infection [^117Lesc3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can result in liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the natural course of the disease is highly dynamic and not every patient requires therapy. The challenges for optimal management are who to treat, which therapeutic regimen to use, and when to begin or stop treatment. Constant monitoring is mandatory to predict the natural course and guide treatment decisions. Surrogate markers for baseline and on treatment decisions are needed. Besides HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen levels also proved to be useful to help judge the natural course and guide treatment. High levels of HBsAg are suggestive of low fibrosis and immune tolerance in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive patients; whereas low levels of HBsAg indicate a lower risk for HCC and inactive carrier state in HBeAg negative patients. Data also support the possible use of HBsAg levels as an on-treatment response marker. So far, the best evidence exists for treatment with interferon (IFN)-α where lack of HBsAg decline after 12 weeks is associated with non-response. Thus, stopping rules after 12 weeks therapy could be established for HBeAg positive as well as for HBeAg negative patients. However, the positive predictive value for achieving sustained response is still vague. The value of HBsAg monitoring is less clear during treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) but it can be a useful marker for new concepts such as stopping NA or add-on IFN strategies. Currently, several studies are underway to validate HBsAg in these settings.

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

Rationale

Although there is no documented harm associated with the administration of the HBV vaccine to patients with natural immunity, it is recommended that anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies should be checked prior to immunisation. Patients who have a positive anti HBs antibody and who have a detectable anti HBc usually have natural immunity to HBV and therefore may not need vaccination. However, detection of Hepatitis B core antibody should not be used in isolation to determine immunity or previous infection and these patients may still require vaccination.

The need for pre-immunisation screening for anti HBc to avoid unnecessary immunisation should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV or previous vaccine as a study in the United States suggests that pre-immunisation screening is cost-effective only in populations in which the prevalence of HBV infection exceeds 30%.

Hepatitis B core antibody detected reports can arise from many scenarios. (Table 5 - interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination).
Recent receipt of blood products (core antibody is passively acquired and is a frequent finding in patients who have received blood, plasma, IVIg or similar in the last few weeks, testing a serum sample predating the blood products is required to determine patient status), (HBV vaccination will be required)
Occult infection: HBV DNA will be detected and Anti HBs antibody levels are usually low (HBV vaccination not required)
False positive: discussion with local virology team to determine if referral to reference lab can be helpful (HBV vaccination required)

Table 5
Interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination (1B)

Although patients are routinely considered as having HBV transmission in the past and not infectious to others, there is an increasing evidence that these persons may replicate or may start to replicate under special circumstances (immunosuppression, cachexia). Any patient with confirmed past HBV infection who is going to be significantly immunosuppressed is at risk of reactivation and a pre-emptive management plan should be made with a Hepatitis B specialist.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

Rationale for New Recommendations

Chronic HBV infection can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality but is detectable before the development of severe liver disease using reliable and inexpensive screening tests. Routine monitoring and treatment for chronic HBV infection can reduce morbidity and mortality, supporting the importance of early detection of HBV infection. In addition, although not quantifiable, management of chronic infection through prevention efforts can prevent further transmission to others. These recommendations consider a simpler and less stigmatizing implementation strategy than previous risk-based HBV screening recommendations. The recommendations also provide guidance that is complementary to the 2022 ACIP recommendations to vaccinate all adults aged 19–59 years against HBV infection by providing a means to establish immunity or any history of infection or the need for vaccination to protect from future infection. Specific rationales for recommendations are as follows:

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection [^114n1GHT]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to monitoring of untreated patients, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining annual monitoring for disease progression and ALT and HBV DNA levels (if available) in patients not currently meeting the criteria for antiviral therapy, as defined by persistently normal serum aminotransferase results and HBV DNA levels < 2,000 IU/mL (if available) or expressing a desire to defer treatment.

---

### Hepatitis B – more treatments, more testing, not enough data [^116TkLcQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Published clinical guidelines, such as those from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), the US Treatment Algorithm, and the NIH Consensus Conference, offer recommendations as to the frequency of monitoring of ALT, HBV DNA, and HBeAg for different subgroups of chronic HBV patients. They also give recommendations as to when to initiate antiviral HBV treatment and guidelines as to the choice of drug or combination or drugs. Unfortunately there are several problems with these recommendations. For one, the recommendations are quite complicated. For example, for patients who are HBeAg positive and have ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal, the AASLD recommends monitoring the ALT every 3 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6 months. However, if the patient is HBeAg positive but the ALT is less than the upper limit of normal, then they recommend monitoring the ALT every 3–6 months and monitoring the HBeAg every 6–12 months. For patients who are HBeAg negative with an ALT one to two times the upper limit of normal and HBV DNA between 2,000–20,000 IU/ml, they recommend checking the ALT every 3 months and the HBV DNA every 3 months. The purpose of this frequent monitoring is to determine when a patient may be transitioning from active to inactive phases of disease or vice versa, or when a patient would become eligible for antiviral treatment. However, the second and more significant problem with these guidelines is that there are no data to support the recommended frequencies for laboratory monitoring. While it is increasingly evident that ALT elevation and HBV DNA level are strong predictors of development of cirrhosis and HCC,–the recommendations for indefinite monitoring of ALT, DNA, and HBeAg every 3 or 6 months have never been studied in any randomized trial or been compared to other frequencies, and there are no data to show that such frequent monitoring leads to an increased use of antiviral treatment or a mortality benefit. The third problem with the current guidelines is that long-term management with this frequency of complex monitoring is an ambitious charge for providers and patients. The intensity of the schedule requires a significant burden of both time and resources for both providers and patients. Finally, as for the guidelines for the use of treatment of HBV, while there are clinical trials to support benefits and safety of each therapy or combination of therapies, the endpoints in HBV treatment trials have largely been surrogate markers, such as suppression of HBV DNA, normalization of ALT, and seroconversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials of anti-HBV therapies have demonstrated a beneficial impact on overall mortality, liver-specific mortality, or development of HCC.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^11566r4Y]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

HBV management — past HBV infection in hematologic malignancy and anti-CD20 or stem-cell transplant settings: Patients with past HBV with hematologic malignancies anticipating anti-CD20 or stem-cell transplantation have a high risk of HBV reactivation and should start antiviral prophylaxis prior to anticancer therapy and continue it at least 12 months after the end of anticancer therapy and even longer, as their cumulative risk of reactivation increases until nearly 2 years after cessation of anticancer therapy. Risk of reactivation is higher with negative anti-HBs than anti-HBs–positive; in one study of 63 HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive lymphoma patients, undetectable anti-HBs at baseline prior to rituximab-containing therapy predicted HBV reactivation (hazard ratio, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.37 to 8.98; p = 0.009). As an alternative to prophylaxis, monitoring without antiviral therapy in 83 HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive patients on anti-CD20 therapy used frequent laboratories every 4 weeks; the rate of reactivation was 25%, and once reactivation developed, follow-up increased to every 2 weeks; active HBV disease was defined as reverse HBsAg seroconversion or an increase in ALT > 2x upper limit of normal; all treated had normalization of ALT with HBV DNA to undetectable levels and there were no cases of clinical hepatitis, liver failure, or death.

Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) and reactivation risk in hematologic malignancies: In a meta-analysis of 20 studies involving 1,672 patients, the reactivation risk was 14% in 388 anti-HBc–positive/anti-HBs–negative patients versus 5% in 1,284 anti-HBc–positive/anti-HBs–positive patients, and a positive anti-HBs likely attenuates the risk of HBV reactivation in patients with past HBV infection.

The updated EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for its management. Spanning ten thematic sections, the guidelines address diagnostics, treatment goals, treatment indications, therapeutic options, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, management of special populations, HBV reactivation prophylaxis, post-transplant care, HBV prevention strategies, and finally address open questions and future research directions. Chronic HBV remains a global health challenge, with over 250 million individuals affected and significant mortality due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. These guidelines emphasise the importance of early diagnosis, risk stratification based on viral and host factors, and tailored antiviral therapy. Attention is given to simplified algorithms, vaccination, and screening to support global HBV elimination targets. The guidelines also discuss emerging biomarkers and evolving definitions of functional and partial cure. Developed through literature review, expert consensus, and a Delphi process, the guidelines aim to equip healthcare providers across disciplines with practical tools to optimise HBV care and outcomes worldwide.

### Internist diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^112QpABR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis in up to 25% of infected individuals. As many as 2 million individuals in the US may have chronic hepatitis B infection, most of whom immigrated to the US from hepatitis B-endemic regions of the world. A 2010 report from the Institute of Medicine noted that two thirds of patients with hepatitis B are unaware of their infection, and most health care providers do not screen for hepatitis B or know how to manage hepatitis B-positive patients. In 2010, the Hepatitis B Foundation convened a group of primary care providers to consider the existing evidenced-based recommendations and strategies for implementation of hepatitis B screening into routine practice. The group designed an easy-to-use algorithm for screening, initial evaluation, ongoing management, and referral to a subspecialist when appropriate. Internal medicine specialists, including primary care providers and subspecialists, need to understand the steps they can take to address this often under-recognized disorder.

### An evidence-based practical guide to vaccination for hepatitis B virus [^113LmWRR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly infectious, with over 292 million chronically infected people worldwide and up to 2.4 million in the United States. Following infection, clinically silent liver damage can ensue, but symptoms or signs of advanced disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, can take decades to emerge. HBV has the heaviest public health burden of all hepatitis viruses and has now surpassed other major communicable diseases (eg, HIV, diarrheal disease, malaria, tuberculosis) as a leading cause of death globally. Preventing transmission is essential, and efforts are in place to reinforce screening, vaccination, and routine follow-up. Three safe and effective vaccines are available in the United States and other countries for HBV prevention, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing infection and its sequelae have been substantiated. For the first time in over 25 years, a new Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine is available that offers a high degree of immunogenicity after 2, rather than 3, injections. Persistent challenges include the underutilization of vaccination, choice of vaccine, incomplete vaccinations, varying needs in different populations, management of nonresponders or those with undocumented or incompletely documented vaccination courses, and questions about whether and when booster injections may be needed. A panel of US academic hepatologists with expertise and experience in preventing and managing HBV infection have collaborated to write this practical clinical paper intended to guide clinicians in vaccinating for HBV and address questions that regularly arise in the clinic.

### The role of HBsAg levels in the current management of chronic HBV infection [^115D8GrC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The immune tolerant phase is followed by the immune clearance phase, in which the immune system tries to eliminate the virus. This phase is characterized by variable HBV DNA levels, which in general tends to decrease. On liver biopsy, there is marked active hepatitis. ALT levels are fluctuating, but tend to be above the upper normal limit. So far, there is no evidence that HBsAg levels help to predict anti-HBe seroconversion. Nevertheless, HBsAg levels drop and reflect the ongoing immune response. In most patients, the immune clearance phase results in anti-HBe seroconversion, but some patients do have an unsuccessful immune clearance. These patients are at increased risk for development of cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The best usual scenario for HBsAg positive patients is the development of HBeAg negative inactive carrier state, where anti-HBe antibodies are present, HBV DNA is low, and there are no marked signs of hepatitis in the liver biopsy. Because of the fluctuating ALT and HBV DNA levels, the differentiation between ongoing HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis and the inactive carrier state may be difficult and requires close monitoring.

To differentiate the latter two phases and estimate the prognosis of the natural course of HBV infection, different markers have been studied. The REVEAL Study showed that the development of HCC depends on the viral load, measured by serum HBV DNA. HBV DNA of > 2,000 IU/mL is associated with a cumulative incidence of HCC of 3.57% after 13 years. The risk becomes more prominent with rising viral loads and surpasses 12% for HBV DNA levels exceeding 20,000 IU/mL.

Hence, the current recommendations for the American and European guidelines use the HBV DNA cut-off of 2,000 IU/mL to define the inactive carrier state, which is correlated with good survival prognosis and low incidence of cirrhosis and HCC.

Further help to discriminate between inactive carriers and chronic HBeAg negative hepatitis B can be provided by assessing the HBsAg levels. Several studies showed that inactive carriers had lower HBsAg levels, with HBsAg levels < 1,000 U/mL having a 87.9% PPV and 96.7% NPV for patients with HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^114SWM3u]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HBV immunity monitoring after HepB vaccination in individuals with HIV — children and adolescents — states that in individuals who have a response to HepB vaccination (anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL), assessment of anti-HBs titers approximately every 5 years can be considered. If anti-HBs titers fall below 10 mIU/mL, they should be provided a booster, and anti-HBs titers should be checked 4 to 6 weeks after a booster dose (weak, very low); if anti-HBs is still < 10 mIU/mL, completion of the standard three-dose series should be done. Waning of anti-HBs levels below 10 mIU/mL after HBV immunization in children with HIV is common, and only 24% to 46% of patients developed an anamnestic response, as defined as an anti-HBs titer ≥ 10 mIU/mL 4 weeks after one vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Disease recommends annual anti-HBs testing and booster doses when the anti-HBs levels decline to < 10 mIU/mL for hemodialysis patients and other immunocompromised people if they have an ongoing risk for HBV exposure; one study of nonresponders demonstrated that 92% of children had anti-HBs titers of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after completion of the vaccine series, and one study in children with HIV who responded to HepB vaccine found that B-cell memory decreased after 4 years and were below appropriate levels by 6 years post-vaccine. Thus, assessment of anti-HBs approximately every 5 years can be considered in children.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116sTxoW]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The probability of acquiring HIV infection in UK dialysis units is very low and therefore does not justify regular surveillance for otherwise low risk patients. However, unless there is a robust system of routinely questioning patients to assess for risks of new BBV infection, there is a potential to miss new cases of BBV. Therefore many units routinely screen for HIV antibody on a 6–12 monthly basis. Similarly, in an attempt to reduce complexity with BBV surveillance, many units in the UK routinely screen for HBsAg and HCV on a 3 monthly basis in all patients and this approach is perfectly acceptable.

Guideline 3.5 – BBV infection: management of patients returning from dialysis outside UK

We recommend that patients planning to dialyse outside the UK should have a risk assessment prior to travel for potential exposure to BBV abroad. Where exposure is considered likely, enhanced surveillance testing for BBV should be planned and instituted and patients should have dialysis in a segregated area as detailed below (1B).

Rationale

Good practice guidelines for renal dialysis and transplant units by DoH provides guidance on classifying countries at low, medium or high risk of BBV exposure for patients dialysing away from base (see Appendix 1). Prior to travel units should review the immunisation status of the patient and administer booster vaccinations if needed.

Individual units may wish to undertake a risk assessment of the planned DAFB unit (accepting that the assessment of risk is subjective), counsel patients regarding the potential risks of BBV infection and the plans for segregation and surveillance on return. The level of risk for BBV exposure will depend on the prevalence of BBV in the country visited, infection control policies in the DAFB unit and lifestyle activities of individual patients.

On return from DAFB, patients should be risk assessed for potential exposure to BBV whilst abroad. Examples of questions to be included in this risk assessment on return are highlighted in Appendix 2.

Depending on the risk of BBV exposure we recommend the following level of surveillance:

Our previous guidelines have suggested that enhanced surveillance for HBV is not required if immune with HBsAb level > 100 mIU/mL in the last 12 months. However, antibody titres can fall over time, leading some patients to become unprotected. In view of this and in an attempt to reduce the level of complexity in the guidelines, which can lead to errors if misinterpreted, we have recommended same level of surveillance irrespective of HBsAb levels.

### Management of chronic hepatitis B: an overview of practice guidelines for primary care providers [^1179BT9C]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the introduction of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination programs, chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains an important disease burden worldwide and in the United States. A number of clinical practice guidelines are available to assist in the clinical management of CHB by providing recommendations regarding screening and diagnosis, treatment indications, and the choice, duration, and monitoring of treatment. Adherence to these guidelines has proven beneficial in terms of better treatment compliance, improved clinical outcomes, and lower likelihoods of emergency admission. This review summarizes current recommendations from the major clinical CHB practice guidelines and presents a simple algorithm for the treatment of patients with CHB to help primary care providers make informed choices in clinical practice. In general, antiviral treatment should be initiated in patients with CHB who have a high risk of liver-related morbidity and who are likely to respond to treatment, that is, patients with persistently elevated serum HBV DNA and either increased serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations or advanced liver disease. In patients who are eligible for antiviral therapy, treatment should be initiated with one of the recommended first-line therapies (pegylated interferon-α, entecavir, or tenofovir), and treatment efficacy should be monitored regularly for serum HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and serologic responses. Patients who are not immediately considered for treatment should be monitored and started on antiviral therapy in case of disease progression. A number of issues in CHB management remain controversial or unresolved, such as identifying treatment candidates, managing partial or nonresponders, and predicting treatment response; we discuss some of the latest evidence around these topics.

### Hepatitis B virus screening and management for patients with cancer prior to therapy: ASCO provisional clinical opinion update [^115nWUtt]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This Provisional Clinical Opinion update presents a clinically pragmatic approach to hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management.

Provisional Clinical Opinion

All patients anticipating systemic anticancer therapy should be tested for HBV by 3 tests-hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen-but anticancer therapy should not be delayed. Findings of chronic HBV (HBsAg-positive) or past HBV (HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive) infection require HBV reactivation risk assessment. Patients with chronic HBV receiving any systemic anticancer therapy should receive antiviral prophylactic therapy through and for minimum 12 months following anticancer therapy. Hormonal therapy alone should not pose a substantial risk of HBV reactivation in patients with chronic HBV receiving hormonal therapy alone; these patients may follow noncancer HBV monitoring and treatment guidance. Coordination of care with a clinician experienced in HBV management is recommended for patients with chronic HBV to determine HBV monitoring and long-term antiviral therapy after completion of anticancer therapy. Patients with past HBV infection undergoing anticancer therapies associated with a high risk of HBV reactivation, such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or stem-cell transplantation, should receive antiviral prophylaxis during and for minimum 12 months after anticancer therapy completion, with individualized management thereafter. Careful monitoring may be an alternative if patients and providers can adhere to frequent, consistent follow-up so antiviral therapy may begin at the earliest sign of reactivation. Patients with past HBV undergoing other systemic anticancer therapies not clearly associated with a high risk of HBV reactivation should be monitored with HBsAg and alanine aminotransferase during cancer treatment; antiviral therapy should commence if HBV reactivation occurs. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines.

Clinical Question

What are the screening guidelines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults in the United States?

Bottom Line

Patients with a high risk of infection, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who use injection drugs, or who live in a household where someone is infected with HBV; men who have sex with men; or patients who come from countries with a high prevalence of HBV infection, should be screened.

HIV/HBV coinfection — proposed chronic HBV monitoring in children outlines phase-specific intervals and general management. Immunotolerant: ALT and CBC 1–2 times per year, HBeAg/Anti-HBe annually, HBV DNA N/A, HBsAg/Anti-HBs N/A. Immunoactive: ALT and CBC every 2 months ×3a, HBeAg/Anti-HBe every 6 months, HBV DNA every 6 months, HBsAg/Anti-HBs N/A. Chronic carrier: ALT and CBC 1–2 times per year, HBeAg/Anti-HBe N/A, HBV DNA N/A, HBsAg/Anti-HBs every 2–3 years. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis: ALT and CBC every 2 months ×3a, HBeAg/Anti-HBe N/A, HBV DNA every 6 months, HBsAg/Anti-HBs N/A. If abnormal ALT persists for 6 months, HBV treatment should be considered. HBV disease activity should be closely monitored with determination of serum ALT every 6 to 12 months depending on disease status, and if serum transaminase levels are persistently elevated (more than twofold the upper limit of normal for ≥ 6 months), HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA levels should be obtained before the initiation or escalation of anti-HBV therapy. Liver biopsy is not required before treatment but may help to determine the severity of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and to exclude other causes of liver disease. Clinical and laboratory exacerbations of hepatitis and hepatic flare also can occur if agents with anti-HBV activity are discontinued; once ARV drugs with anti-HBV activity are begun they should be continued indefinitely unless contraindicated, and if discontinuation of therapy for chronic HBV infection results in hepatic flare, therapy for chronic HBV should be reinstituted.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116tfADc]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Response should be assessed by measuring plasma anti HBs antibody 8 weeks after completion of the immunisation schedule. There is on-going debate about what constitutes a response to immunisation.

Conventionally > 100mIU/ml was regarded as conferring immunity but there is evidence that even patients who have a lower peak response (10–100mIU/ml) will not become chronic carriers of HBV.

The significance of this titre was illustrated in a five-year follow-up study of 773 homosexual men vaccinated in 1980; most severe infections occurred among those who never achieved a titre > 9.9mIU/ml. The risk of late infection in those with an initial titre of > 9.9mIU/mL increased markedly when antibody levels decreased below 10mIU/mL, but only 1 of 34 of these late infections resulted in viraemia and liver inflammation.

In a series of haemodialysis patients, with anti HBs antibody titres > 10mIU/ml who received transplants from HBsAg positive donors, 67% seroconverted to anti-HBc positivity - suggesting that such an anti-HBs titre does not always protect against HBV infection in HD patients.

It is worth being aware of the possibility of HBV surface mutants that can cause HBV infection in patients with apparently adequate anti HBs titres and seem to occur in endemic regions with large HBV vaccination programs (vaccine escape mutants).

More than half of haemodialysis patients who respond to immunisation do not maintain detectable antibody. In one of the early randomised controlled studies of immunisation there were 4 cases of hepatitis B infection in dialysis patients who had an apparent response to immunisation in whom the antibody levels had waned, suggesting a strategy of antibody surveillance and booster doses may be worthwhile.

In one small Italian study the monitoring of antibody titres and the administration of additional doses enabled maintenance of protective HBV antibody levels in 96% of patients 4 years after initial immunisation.

Retrospective reviews from the 1990s convincingly demonstrate a higher response in non-dialysis compared to dialysis patients (80% compared to 50% in one analysis). In 2003 Da Rosa et al. prospectively demonstrated that GFR was an independent positive predictive variable of seroconversion in response to the vaccination.

Previous guidelines have also recommended annual testing of patients who have ever achieved a HBV titre > 10mIU/mL with administration of a booster dose of vaccine if titre < 100mIU/ml but we acknowledge that the frequency of surveillance and the titre to trigger a booster dose is debatable.

Guideline 3.4 – BBV infection: management of patients who do not consent for BBV testing

We suggest that patients who do not consent to BBV surveillance as described above should have dialysis in a segregated area unless they are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months. If patients who are known to be HBV immune in the previous 6 months do not consent to BBV surveillance then they should be managed in the same way as patients with HCV infection (see section 4) (2C).

Audit Measure 3: What proportion of prevalent dialysis patients are known to be immune to HBV (anti HBs > 10 mU/mL within the last year). Of the remainder, what proportion has a HBsAg test result from within the last 3 calendar months?

Audit Measure 4: The proportion of incident patients starting regular hospital haemodialysis who have anti HBs antibody titre > 10mIU/mL.

Rationale (for 3.1–3.4)

BBV infections are asymptomatic in the majority of individuals and therefore a surveillance system is required to detect new BBV infection and implement measures to limit the opportunity for nosocomial spread. The frequency of surveillance testing should be determined in part by patient specific risk factors, the local prevalence and incidence of infection. The UK is a low prevalence country for BBV infection in patients with.

Established renal failure and so surveillance can be less frequent than in higher risk countries. Surveillance needs to be enhanced if the patient's overall risk is high or if the individual patient experiences an event that increases the risk. Our previous guidelines have recommended patients on regular hospital haemodialysis who are immune to hepatitis B infection (annual anti HBs antibody titre > 100 mIU/ml) only need to be tested for HBsAg once a year. However, antibody titres can fall over time, leading some patients to become unprotected. In a US study, 8% of chronic haemodialysis patients became unprotected due to a fall in antibody titres over a 12 month period. For this reason, we recommend testing this group of patients on a 6 monthly basis.

Children and adolescents with HIV — post-HepB vaccination serologic testing and initial screening states that due to the high prevalence of HBV infection, all infants, children, and adolescents with HIV should be tested for HBsAg as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (strong, high). If there is no documentation of routine infant/child vaccination for hepatitis B, initial screening with the triple panel consisting of HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) will determine infection and immune status and guide clinical management. Anti-HBs titers should be evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the vaccination series (strong, moderate), and individuals with the isolated anti-HBc serologic profile should also be vaccinated for hepatitis B.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^114u4ARf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isolated anti-HBc in people with HIV during pregnancy — interpretation and vaccination steps are outlined: testing of anti-HBc alone can be a false positive, and the incidence of HBV viremia with the isolated anti-HBc pattern ranges from 1% to 36% in patients with HIV. Most people with HIV with isolated anti-HBc are HBV DNA–negative and not immune to HBV infection; therefore, they would benefit from HBV vaccination. While routinely checking HBV DNA is currently not recommended in other adults with HIV and isolated anti-HBc, it may be considered in pregnancy, and if HBV viremia is identified during pregnancy with isolated anti-HBc, ART should be adjusted to assure control of both HBV and HIV. People with isolated anti-HBc and negative or unknown HBV DNA should be vaccinated with one standard dose of HBV vaccine, anti-HBs titers should be checked 1 to 2 months after vaccination, if the anti-HBs titer is > 100 IU/mL no further vaccination is needed, and if the titer is < 100 IU/mL a complete HBV vaccine series should be given followed by anti-HBs testing. Isolated anti-HBc and occult HBV infection are typically associated with very low levels of HBV DNA and therefore extremely low risk of transmitting HBV perinatally.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Prevention of hepatitis B reactivation in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy: a case series and appraisal of society guidelines [^1116yEsx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

SOCIETY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS AT RISK OF HBVR

HBVr is preventable. Identifying patients at risk and initiating adequate treatment or close surveillance is important because a delayed detection of HBVr or the failure to start prophylaxis may lead to severe hepatic injury and liver failure that may not be reversible, even after the initiation of antiviral therapy (such as in cases 1–3). Several major international gastroenterology and hepatology organizations have published recommendations for the testing and management of HBV infection in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy: the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), and the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL). Small differences aside, the guidelines agree in the general principles for the prevention of HBVr which include (1) recognizing the need to screen patients prior to the initiation of immunosuppression, (2) stratifying the risk of HBVr based on serostatus and immunosuppressive regimen, and (3) tailoring management strategies based on the risk and including close monitoring with preemptive treatment or antiviral prophylaxis.

Screening

Most guidelines recommend screening for HBV infection in all patients planned to receive immunosuppressive regimens including HBsAg and anti-HBc, followed by a HBV DNA test if either one is positive. The role of anti-HBs screening in addition to HBsAg and anti-HBc is controversial: EASL and APASL recommend anti-HBs as a part of screening, while AGA and AASLD do not. The role of anti-HBs screening is even less clear, since the presence of anti-HBs does not prevent HBVr. However, the level of anti-HBs may provide additional information regarding the risk of HBVr, as a titer > 100 IU/ml has been associated with a decreased HBVr incidence. In addition, the presence of anti-HBs may confirm past infection in HBsAg−/anti-HBc+ patients, and conversely, a loss of anti-HBs may be a predictor of HBVr. APASL furthermore recommends the assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis in all CHB patients and in all patients with resolved HBV infection, since patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis are at higher risk of mortality and morbidity in case of HBVr.

### Technical systematic review supporting 2025 AASLD practice guidelines on management of chronic hepatitis B [^1151NqYH]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

With rapid changes in the management landscape of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), this technical systematic review addresses four critical Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) questions to provide guidance to the formulation of recommendations to the 2025 AASLD practice guidelines for management of CHB.

Methods

The review was reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Outcomes were evaluated across four key PICOs: (1) antiviral therapy for prevention of horizontal HBV transmission in high-risk groups, (2) antiviral therapy versus observation for persons in the immune-tolerant phase, (3) discontinuation versus continuation of nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy in HBeAg-negative individuals with undetectable HBV DNA, and (4) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in non-cirrhotic individuals with HBsAg clearance or co-infections with HCV, HDV, or HIV.

Results

For PICO 1, limited evidence suggests antiviral therapy may reduce horizontal transmission risk, though with low certainty. PICO 2 analyses reveal uncertain benefits of treating persons in the immune-tolerant phase, with very low certainty due to heterogeneity and bias. PICO 3 analyses demonstrate that discontinuing antiviral therapy in persons who are HBeAg negative with undetectable HBV DNA increases HBsAg loss rates (OR 12.65, 95% CI 1.58–101.51) but carries moderate risks of virologic relapse (OR 47.17, 95% CI 2.79–797.35), and clinical flares. PICO 4 analyses on several cohort studies showed that in patients co-infected with HCV, HBV, or HIV, annual incidence of HCC was higher than the level where screening becomes cost-effective, suggesting that regular liver cancer screening could be beneficial for these patients.

Conclusions

Despite low certainty, the findings support shared decision-making in high-risk horizontal transmission scenarios or in treating individuals in the immune tolerance phase, caution in discontinuing antiviral therapy in virologically suppressed individuals without HBsAg loss, and tailored HCC surveillance for those with co-infection or cirrhosis.

### Comparison of nine commercially available assays for quantification of antibody response to hepatitis B virus surface antigen [^114PW1Hv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Quantitative measurement of anti-HBs is used to evaluate the response to hepatitis B vaccination in health care workers and to optimize postexposure management. The different guidelines for hepatitis B vaccination and booster policy imply that the measurement of anti-HBs levels by different assays is accurate and consistent, yielding comparable quantitative results. We measured anti-HBs levels in 200 serum samples from patients and health care professionals by nine different anti-HBs assays and compared the quantitative results and the performance characteristics of the different test systems. The assay specificity ranged between 96.8 and 100% when sera from individuals without a vaccination history and with negative anti-HBc status were defined as true negatives. Sensitivity ranged between 93.5 and 100%. A high number of sera showed discrepancies between measurements by the different systems. The mean coefficient of variation between the different measurements was 47.1% (range, 15.0 to 201.0%), and the factors of multiplication ranged from 2.8 to 105. Hemolysis or lipemia did not seem to influence the measurement, and there was no difference between anti-HBc-positive and -negative individuals. The classical enzyme immunoassays tend to find lower anti-HBs levels than the automated systems, with higher values by the Abbott AXSYM assay. The serial dilution of the international standard preparation was measured accurately by most of the assays. In conclusion, the quantitative measurement of anti-HBs levels is not reliable, even though an international standard is used for the calibration of the systems. Some systems showed specific problems that should be addressed by the manufacturers.

Persons with Resolved (Past) HBV Infection

Patients should be counseled about their history of HBV infection and risk for reactivation. Therapies with the highest risk for reactivation include B-cell depleting agents (e.g. rituximab and ofatumumab). American Society of Clinical Oncology and AASLD guidelines have more information on therapies and conditions associated with increased risk for reactivation, as well as recommendations for treatment. Antiviral therapy for HBV infection, when initiated before immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy, can prevent reactivation of disease. The systematic review indicated the prevalence of resolved HBV infection (i.e. HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive) in the general population ranges from 4.8% to 14.0% (median = 6.2%). Notification, testing, and vaccination of household, sex partners, and needle-sharing contacts of patients with HBV infection or a history of HBV infection are recommended, as appropriate.

Persons Who Are Susceptible to HBV Infection

Persons who are susceptible to HBV infection should be told that they have never been infected with HBV and are not protected from future infection. All persons who are susceptible to infection should be offered HepB vaccine per ACIP recommendations. Anti-HBs concentrations can wane over time among vaccine responders. For persons with a clearly documented vaccination series who test negative for anti-HBs, refer to Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Vaccine should be offered to persons who have initiated, but not completed, the HepB vaccine series, regardless of anti-HBs status. HepB vaccine series completion is important for long-term immunogenicity.

Persons who are susceptible, refuse vaccination, and are at increased risk for HBV infection should be periodically tested. Frequency of periodic testing should be a shared decision between the patient and provider and be based on individual risk factors and immune status.

Persons Who Are Fully Vaccinated Against HBV Infection

Persons are considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a HepB vaccine series and can be reassured about protection against future illness. Vaccination status should be clearly documented in the medical record. Anti-HBs concentrations can wane over time among vaccine responders. For persons with a clearly documented vaccination series who test negative for anti-HBs, refer to Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for specific populations for whom revaccination might be recommended (e.g. patients on hemodialysis). Revaccination or booster doses are not routinely recommended for persons who are immunocompetent.

Postvaccination Serologic Testing

Serologic testing for immunity is not necessary after routine vaccination of infants, children, or adults.
Testing for anti-HBs after vaccination is recommended for the following persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status (Box 7): BOX 7 Persons recommended to receive postvaccination serologic testing * following a complete series of HepB vaccination
- Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)–positive mothers or mothers whose HBsAg status remains unknown (e.g. when a parent or person with lawful custody safely surrenders an infant confidentially shortly after birth infants safely surrendered at or shortly after birth) †
- Health care personnel and public safety workers
- Hemodialysis patients and others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g. predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home dialysis)
- HIV-infected persons
- Other immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy)
- Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons * Postvaccination serologic testing for persons other than infants born to HBsAg-positive (or HBsAg-unknown) mothers consists of anti-HBs. † Postvaccination serologic testing for infants born to HBsAg-positive (or HBsAg-unknown) mothers consists of anti-HBs and HBsAg. Persons with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers or mothers with an unknown HBsAg status should be revaccinated with a single dose of HepB vaccine and receive postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months later. Infants whose anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL following single dose revaccination should receive two additional doses of HepB vaccine, followed by postvaccination serologic testing 1–2 months after the final dose. Based on clinical circumstances or family preference, HBsAg-negative infants with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL may instead be revaccinated with a second, complete 3-dose series, followed by postvaccination serologic testing performed 1–2 months after the final dose of vaccine. For others with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL after the primary series, administration of 3 additional HepB vaccine doses on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after ≥ 1 dose of vaccine. infants born to HBsAg-positive women and infants born to women whose HBsAg status remains unknown (e.g. infants safely surrendered shortly after birth). Postvaccination serologic testing should consist of testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg; HCP and public safety workers at risk for blood or body fluid exposure; hemodialysis patients (and other persons who might require outpatient hemodialysis), HIV-infected persons, and other immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy), to determine the need for revaccination and the type of follow-up testing; and sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons, to determine the need for revaccination and for other methods of protection against HBV infection.
Testing should be performed 1–2 months after administration of the final dose of the vaccine series using a method that allows determination of a protective concentration of anti-HBs (≥ 10 mIU/mL). Persons found to have anti-HBs concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series are considered to be immune. Immunocompetent persons have long-term protection and do not need further periodic testing to assess anti-HBs levels. Immunocompromised persons might need annual testing to assess anti-HBs concentrations (See Revaccination). Persons found to have anti-HBs concentrations of < 10 mIU/mL after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated. Administration of all doses in the second series, on an appropriate schedule, followed by anti-HBs testing 1–2 months after the final dose, is usually more practical than serologic testing after one or more doses of vaccine (except for when revaccinating infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers). Persons who do not have a protective concentration of anti-HBs after revaccination should be tested for HBsAg. If the HBsAg test result is positive, the person should receive appropriate management, and any household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts should be identified and vaccinated. Prevaccination testing (consisting of anti-HBc, HBsAg, and anti-HBs) to identify infected persons is recommended for household, sexual, or needle-sharing contacts of HBsAg-positive persons; serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination, and the first HepB vaccine dose should be administered immediately after collection of the blood for serologic testing. Persons who test negative for HBsAg should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be counseled about precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG postexposure prophylaxis for any known or likely exposure to an HBsAg-positive source.
Testing HCP with documentation of complete HepB vaccination for anti-HBs upon hire or matriculation (i.e. pre-exposure assessment of prior response to HepB vaccination), followed by one or more additional doses of HepB vaccine for HCP with anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL, helps to ensure that HCP will be protected if they have an exposure to HBV-containing blood or body fluids.
Anti-HBs levels of ≥ 10 mIU/mL are generally considered seroprotective; however, different assays have different assay cutoff values based on which reported levels of anti-HBs might vary depending on the assay used. Refer to the package insert of the test for the determination of actual/correct levels of anti-HBs antibodies.

### Recommendations for screening, monitoring, and referral of pediatric chronic hepatitis B [^114AV8tN]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Most children with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (persistent hepatitis B surface antigen-positive for > 6 months) are asymptomatic and do not generally require treatment. These children are, however, at increased risk for severe complications later in life, including advanced liver disease and liver cancer. On November 11, 2008, the Hepatitis B Foundation, a nonprofit research and disease advocacy organization, convened a panel of nationally recognized North American pediatric liver specialists to consider and recommend an approach for the screening, monitoring, initial management, and referral of children with chronic hepatitis B. The panel developed recommendations to provide guidance to practitioners on determining what additional tests to conduct, how often to monitor on the basis of test results, and when to refer to a pediatric liver specialist to build a partnership between the practitioner and liver specialist to enhance the success of management of children with this lifelong infection.

### Asian consensus recommendations on optimizing the diagnosis and initiation of treatment of hepatitis B virus infection in resource-limited settings [^1175bY9q]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

Asia has an intermediate-to-high prevalence of and high morbidity and mortality from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Optimization of diagnosis and initiation of treatment is one of the crucial strategies for lowering disease burden in this region. Therefore, a panel of 24 experts from 10 Asian countries convened, and reviewed the literature, to develop consensus guidance on diagnosis and initiation of treatment of HBV infection in resource-limited Asian settings. The panel proposed 11 recommendations related to diagnosis, pre-treatment assessment, and indications of therapy of HBV infection, and management of HBV-infected patients with co-infections. In resource-limited Asian settings, testing for hepatitis B surface antigen may be considered as the primary test for diagnosis of HBV infection. Pre-treatment assessments should include tests for complete blood count, liver and renal function, hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBe, HBV DNA, co-infection markers and assessment of severity of liver disease. Noninvasive tests such as AST-to-platelet ratio index, fibrosis score 4 or transient elastography may be used as alternatives to liver biopsy for assessing disease severity. Considering the high burden of HBV infection in Asia, the panel adopted an aggressive approach, and recommended initiation of antiviral therapy in all HBV-infected, compensated or decompensated cirrhotic individuals with detectable HBV DNA levels, regardless of HBeAg status or alanine transaminase levels. The panel also developed a simple algorithm for guiding the initiation of treatment in noncirrhotic, HBV-infected individuals. The recommendations proposed herein, may help guide clinicians, to optimize the diagnosis and improvise the treatment rates for HBV infection in Asia.

Tdap, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations — ACIP-aligned preventive care in IBD: Vaccination against Tdap, HAV, HBV, and HPV should be administered as per ACIP guidelines (conditional recommendation, with very low level of evidence). All adult patients with IBD should receive non-live vaccines per national guidelines, and for HBV care clinicians should recognize reactivation risk and, before anti-TNF's, perform testing for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb with vaccination of the nonimmune patient. HBV vaccine response is high in healthy individuals (> 95%) but lower in IBD (33–76%); in immunocompromised patients hepatitis B surface antibody levels should be checked 1–3 months after completing the series, some experts advise checking every 12–24 months, there is debate on protective titers (above 10 vs above 100 IU/l), and if titers do not rise appropriately consider administration of another 3 vaccination series at the regular dose.

### The 2024 updated WHO guidelines for the prevention and management of chronic hepatitis B: main changes and potential implications for the next major liver society clinical practice guidelines [^116h7Fuf]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Progress towards global elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been slow and most countries are far from reaching the elimination targets set out by the World Health Organization (WHO). The burden of chronic hepatitis B is mainly borne by resource-limited countries where only a minority of people living with HBV are diagnosed and treated, and international guidelines are hardly applicable in real-life. In March 2024, the WHO released its revised guidelines for the prevention and management of chronic hepatitis B. Simplification of care and expansion of treatment criteria represent the core of this revision. Whether and how these updated WHO guidelines will influence the next hepatitis B recommendations from the international liver societies (EASL, AASLD and APASL) remain uncertain. Yet, the European, American and Asian regions encompass multiple low, middle and intermediate-income countries with high HBV endemicity and vulnerable populations that should benefit from simplified clinical algorithms. Here, from an analysis of the WHO guideline development process and its new recommendations, we aimed to identify the anticipated areas of agreement and controversies with the next liver society hepatitis B guidelines, which will have to balance clinical risks and benefits for patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^113jZw59]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.

Conclusions

This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1131TvQM]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — detection and prevention of reactivation of HBV infection — patients on immunosuppressive agents are at risk for reactivation, and guidelines have been developed recommending routine pretreatment screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Based on serological profile and immunosuppression factors, the risk of HBV reactivation during treatment can be estimated as high (≥ 10%), moderate (1%-10%), and low (< 1%); depending on the risk category, a preemptive treatment or monitoring strategy with the intent of on-demand therapy can be developed. Prophylactic antiviral therapy, preferably with high-potency agents, has been recommended for patients at high to moderate risk, while watchful monitoring with intent of on-demand therapy has been recommended for patients at low risk. The risk of HBV reactivation in patients with AIH who are treated with conventional regimens of prednisone or prednisolone in combination with AZA is unknown, and reported risk levels in glucocorticoid-treated patients relate mainly to individuals with HBsAg who are at risk of developing viremia detected by HBV DNA; these patients warrant antiviral prophylaxis but constitute a small percentage of patients with AIH who would be considered for glucocorticoid therapy. HBsAg-negative patients with anti-HBc constitute another risk category for reactivation, but reverse seroconversion has occurred mainly in patients treated with B cell-depleting agents, TNF inhibitors, and chemotherapeutic agents.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^1126Ce9e]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

We recommend that non-responders to HBV should receive no further immunisation - the likelihood of benefit is low, compared to the cost burden. However there is some evidence that non-responders to a 4 dose 40 μg schedule might subsequently respond to a large dose given intra-dermally. In high risk groups (potential transplant recipients, individuals intending to dialyse away from base in a high risk area) this should be considered. Anecdotal evidence suggests that those more likely to respond to second courses include non-smokers, low BMI, age < 40, or high levels of immunosuppressive drugs at the time of the first vaccination.

A non-responder patient, who is therefore not immune to HBV, should be counselled about how to minimize risk of HBV exposure and recommended actions needed to take in the advent of a potential Hepatitis B exposure (this is likely to include urgent receipt of Hepatitis B immunoglobulin). (1B).

They should also be advised about the risks of overseas travel and dialysis away from base. Patients who are not immune to HBV who dialyse in units where the prevalence of risk of HBV is higher should undergo a period of enhanced surveillance on their return to the UK, and be dialysed on their own machine, ideally in a segregated area. (1C).

Guideline 5.7 – BBV infection: management of patients prior to overseas travel or high risk exposure

We recommend that responders to the HBV vaccine should have the anti HBs titre checked prior to travel overseas or high risk exposure (1C), with a booster dose administered if the Anti HBs antibody titre is < 100miU/ml. (1C).

Rationale

Haemodialysis patients who mount a good response to vaccine appear unable to maintain high antibody levels. Fleming et al. showed that 57% of haemodialysis patients who mounted a good response had lost detectable anti-HBs within 6 months of immunisation, and therefore will need a booster dose of the vaccine to maintain their immunity.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination — indications and timing include patients without chronic HBV infection and without immunity to HBV (anti-HBs < 10 mIU/mL) and patients with isolated anti-HBc; early vaccination is recommended before CD4 count falls below 350 cells/mm3, but vaccination should not be deferred until CD4 reaches > 350 cells/mm3 because some patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 do respond; for isolated anti-HBc, give one standard dose of HBV vaccine followed by anti-HBs at 1–2 months, with no further vaccination if the titer is > 100 mIU/mL and a complete series if the titer is < 100 mIU/mL.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113jMngm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in people with HIV — definition, activity criteria, HDV testing, and isolated anti-HBc — should be approached as follows: Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on two occasions at least 6 months apart, and people with chronic HBV infection should be tested further for HBV e antigen (HBeAg), antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe), and HBV DNA; "Active" disease can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of both serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations, defined as ≥ 2 times the upper limit of normal (≥ 70 U/L for males and ≥ 50 U/L for females). Because people with chronic HBV infection are at risk for coinfection with HDV, anti-HDV should be checked once chronic HBV infection is diagnosed, and if positive, then HDV RNA should be obtained to look for chronic infection. In low-prevalence settings, isolated anti-HBc may represent a false-positive, but its presence can signify past HBV infection with subsequent loss of anti-HBs; isolated anti-HBc occurs in 7% to 19% of people with HIV, and among people with HIV and isolated anti-HBc the frequency of HBV viremia typically ranges from 1% to 10%, so routinely checking HBV DNA is not recommended. People with HIV — particularly with hepatitis C virus coinfection — have a higher frequency of isolated anti-HBc, and people whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg negative with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc.

### Risk management of HBsAg or anti-HCV positive healthcare workers in hospital [^112r8ibF]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Recommendations are made for controlling the transmission of the hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses from healthcare workers to patients. These recommendations were based both on the literature and on experts' opinions, obtained during a Consensus Conference. The quality of the published information and of the experts' opinions was classified into 6 levels, based on the source of the information. The recommendations can be summarised as follows: all healthcare workers must undergo hepatitis B virus vaccination and adopt the standard measures for infection control in hospitals; healthcare workers who directly perform invasive procedures must undergo serological testing and the evaluation of markers of viral infection. Those found to be positive for: 1) HBsAg and HBeAg, 2) HBsAg and hepatitis B virus DNA, or 3) anti-hepatitis C virus and hepatitis C virus RNA must abstain from directly performing invasive procedures; no other limitations in their activities are necessary. Infected healthcare workers are urged to inform their patients of their infectious status, although this is left to the discretion of the healthcare worker; whose privacy is guaranteed by law. If exposure to hepatitis B virus occurs, the healthcare worker must undergo prophylaxis with specific immunoglobulins, in addition to vaccination.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116uficx]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccination for people with isolated anti-HBc advises one standard dose of any hepatitis B vaccine followed by testing for quantitative anti-HBs 1 to 2 months post-dose; if the titer is > 100 mIU/mL, no further vaccination is needed, if the titer is ≤ 100 mIU/mL, a complete series of hepatitis B vaccine should be completed followed by repeat anti-HBs testing (BII), and if an anti-HBs quantitative titer is not available, then a complete hepatitis B vaccine series is recommended, followed by qualitative anti-HBs testing (BII).

### AASLD guidelines for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^112Hquz5]. Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B natural history and progression risks — Resolved chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is defined by HBsAg clearance with anti-HBs acquisition, and in inactive CHB about 0.5% clear HBsAg yearly. Among untreated adults with CHB, cumulative 5-year incidence of cirrhosis is 8%-20%; among those with cirrhosis, 5-year risks are hepatic decompensation 20% and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 2%-5%. HBV DNA levels, ALT levels, and HBeAg status are key determinants; risk stratification has been shown in adults with HBV DNA levels above 2,000 IU/mL, where higher HBV DNA is associated with progressively higher rates of cirrhosis and HCC. Clearance of HBsAg reduces risk of hepatic decompensation and improves survival, and low-level HBV DNA may be transiently detected in a minority after seroclearance.

### Management of healthcare personnel living with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus in US healthcare institutions [^1174EpAi]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in healthcare personnel (HCP) — vaccination follow-up and transmission data: The current CDC guidelines recommend that negative persons be tested 1–2 months after the last dose of the HBV vaccination series, and the vaccination series be followed by assessment of post-vaccination immunity (anti-HBs). If anti-HBs determination is negative, CDC recommends re-vaccination; if the second course does not produce protective levels of anti-HBs, CDC recommends that HCP be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) to determine infectivity. A report documented 4 instances of chronic HBV infection in HCP who failed to respond to 2 courses of vaccination. Since the previous guidance, only 2 instances of HCP-to-patient transmission of HBV have been reported, and in both events the HCP had viral loads > 10⁸ (≈ 2.0 × 10⁷ IU/mL).

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^111DrVxf]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Pregnancy with chronic hepatitis B — screening and residual transmission risk: Screening for HBV infection in all pregnant persons during their initial prenatal visit, for every pregnancy, using a triple panel (HBsAg, anti-HBs and total anti-HBc) is strongly recommended by the CDC and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines (USPSTF), and a positive HBsAg result should be followed by quantitative HBV DNA, HBeAg, and ALT testing. Despite the appropriate administration of HBIG and birth-dose vaccination within 24 hours of birth, perinatal transmission of HBV occurs in approximately 8–10% of infants born to HBsAg-positive pregnant persons with HBV DNA levels > 200,000 IU/mL. The 2018 AASLD conditional recommendations for these individuals included initiating TDF therapy (preferred) at gestational weeks 28–32, continuing until delivery or up to three months postpartum.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Hepatitis B reactivation: a review of clinical guidelines [^116UawMc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) can occur spontaneously, but more often occurs when a patient is in an immunocompromised state or on immunosuppressive therapy. HBVr can lead to clinical hepatitis, acute liver failure, and even death. HBVr is preventable with screening of at-risk patients and initiation of prophylactic antiviral therapy for appropriate candidates. Screening for hepatitis B virus is recommended for all patients who plan to initiate immunosuppressive therapy. An individual's serological profile, underlying disease, and planned type of immunosuppression contribute to their risk of HBVr. This review serves to summarize the major society guidelines regarding screening, management of, and monitoring for HBVr in individuals on anticancer therapy and immunosuppressive therapy.

### Significance of anti-HBc alone serological status in clinical practice [^1151o2e3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Serum samples identified as positive for total anti-HBc, but negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, are referred to as anti-HBc alone. This serological response is compatible with acute, resolved, and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)infection but might also signify occult HBV infection. Once the anti-HBc alone pattern is detected, false-positive reactivity should be ruled out and further analyses can resolve the clinical status of the donor. The identification of anti-HBc positivity in the absence of HBsAg in organ transplant donors and in candidate patients for chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy requires further investigation because of the risk of HBV reactivation. False-positive detection, acute infection during the window phase, and resolved or chronic HBV infection are all possible and only distinguishable if the additional assays are done and measures of liver damage are taken into account. Measurement of serum anti-HBs responses after the administration of HBV vaccination can be useful to distinguish this serological profile. In view of the low risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc alone patients who are candidates for immunosuppressive treatment, such patients might not require pre-emptive antiviral therapy, but should be followed up on a monthly basis for alanine aminotransferase followed by quantitative HBV DNA testing in those with alanine aminotransferase increase. According to specific guidelines, nucleoside analogue prophylaxis is recommended in anti-HBc-positive liver allograft recipients and anti-HBc alone individuals who receive chemotherapy or biological therapy and should be continued for 6–12 months after discontinuation of such immunosuppressive therapies to protect against HBV reactivation.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^116zE2K8]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B epidemiology and prevention in the United States are outlined as follows: CHB affects ~258 million individuals (2022) globally and leads to an estimated 1.1 million deaths annually; data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017–2020) identified an estimated 660,000 (Confidence Interval (CI): 410,000–1,000,000) persons with HBV infection, but with adjustments among foreign-born persons immigrating to the United States the estimated disease burden may be as high as 1.8 million (C. I.: 1.3–2.6 million); importantly, half of those infected are unaware of their diagnosis; to reduce morbidity and mortality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends screening for hepatitis B in all adults aged ≥ 18 years at least once during a lifetime and all pregnant persons during each pregnancy, preferably in the first trimester, regardless of vaccination status or history of testing using a triple panel (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc); HBV vaccination is recommended for all infants, all children and adolescents younger than 19 who have not been vaccinated, all adults aged 19–59 years regardless of risk factors and adults aged 60 years and older with risk factors for HBV or without known risk factors but who desire protection.
