## Question

In a 1-year-old with eczema who now has a more widespread rash, could this be impetigo?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a more widespread rash in a 1-year-old with eczema could be impetigo, how to differentiate it from mimics, what tests to obtain, and how to treat safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline risk in atopic dermatitis for bacterial superinfection. Then, I should verify the classic clinical features of impetigo and how they differ from an eczema flare. Next, I will review the priority differentials to exclude, especially eczema herpeticum, and decide when to test. After that, I need to check the guideline-supported diagnostic approach, including when to obtain Gram stain and culture. Finally, I will examine treatment pathways for localized versus widespread disease, incorporate MRSA risk, align pediatric dosing considerations, and close with complications, contagion, and practical follow-up recommendations.

> Let me consider the baseline condition first. In infants with atopic dermatitis, skin barrier dysfunction and frequent Staphylococcus aureus colonization increase susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection, making impetiginization of eczema common during flares; I should confirm that this background elevates the pretest probability of impetigo in a 1-year-old with a rapidly spreading rash [^1169YisK] [^116pxvKP].

> I should double-check the epidemiologic signal. Children with atopic dermatitis have higher odds of cutaneous infections, including an approximately 55% increased odds of impetigo compared with peers without eczema, and impetigo remains one of the most common pediatric bacterial skin infections worldwide, which further supports clinical suspicion in this scenario [^115AqAC7] [^114KKiDo] [^116pxvKP].

> Next, I will now examine the clinical phenotype I'm looking for. Nonbullous impetigo classically begins as papules or vesicles that evolve into pustules and then rupture, leaving honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base; bullous impetigo presents with flaccid bullae that rupture to erosions with thinner crusts. Distribution often involves the face and extremities; the honey-crusted hallmark helps distinguish it from a simple eczematous flare, although overlap can occur in impetiginized eczema [^116pxvKP] [^114EwzT8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review key differentials for a "widespread rash" in atopic dermatitis. An eczema flare typically shows ill-defined, pruritic, erythematous plaques without discrete vesiculopustules or honey crusts, whereas eczema herpeticum (HSV) must be actively excluded if there are vesicles, punched-out erosions, hemorrhagic crusts, fever, or malaise because it requires urgent antiviral therapy. Scabies can present with intensely pruritic papules and burrows, often with secondary impetiginization, and tinea may produce annular scaly plaques that can be mistaken for bacterial infection in young children [^111kjE7o] [^114Q88Ae] [^115Ko85Q].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before treating. IDSA guidelines recommend Gram stain and culture of pus or exudate from suspected impetigo or ecthyma to identify S. aureus versus beta-hemolytic streptococci; however, if the presentation is classic and localized, empiric therapy without culture is reasonable. In atopic dermatitis, I need to ensure I'm not missing MRSA or a viral mimic; if eczema herpeticum is suspected, HSV PCR or rapid testing should be pursued promptly while initiating acyclovir [^112bwZ7j] [^115sBtfH] [^111kjE7o].

> Let me think about first-line therapy for localized disease. For limited impetigo, topical antibiotics are preferred. Initially, I thought of older labeling that used mupirocin 2% applied three times daily for 7–10 days; wait, I should correct that to align with current IDSA guidance recommending mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily for 5 days in typical cases, which simplifies care and supports stewardship, while ozenoxacin 1% cream is an evidence-based alternative with pediatric data down to 2 months of age. I need to ensure the application is confined to affected lesions and reassess at approximately 48–72 hours for clinical response [^114iNUF3] [^113icsrx] [^116kxG6g] [^116yDAXB].

> Now, I should review management for widespread or severe involvement. Systemic therapy is indicated for numerous lesions, rapidly progressive disease, or when topical therapy is impractical; IDSA lists dicloxacillin or cephalexin as first-line oral agents for 7 days given the predominance of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with penicillin VK appropriate if cultures yield streptococci alone. But wait, those tabulated doses (for example, cephalexin 250 mg QID) are adult reference doses; in a 1-year-old I must use weight-based pediatric dosing and adjust to renal function and local susceptibility patterns, so I should confirm the exact mg/kg regimen using pediatric references and current antibiograms. If MRSA risk is high or there is failure on first-line therapy, a MRSA-active oral agent such as clindamycin is reasonable pending culture results and local resistance data [^115Bo85M] [^1158JWET] [^111GN5r7].

> I need to ensure concurrent eczema care is optimized. Gentle skin care with liberal emollients should continue, and anti-inflammatory control of noninfected eczematous areas using appropriate-potency topical corticosteroids can proceed, but I should avoid applying topical steroids directly to actively purulent impetiginized lesions until bacterial burden is controlled; after infection improves, reintroducing anti-inflammatory therapy helps restore barrier and reduce scratching that perpetuates inoculation. For secondarily infected eczema or localized impetigo in young children, topical mupirocin is specifically endorsed in pediatric guidance as safe and effective [^1169YisK] [^116LLyni].

> Next, I should review complications and public health aspects. Nonbullous impetigo associated with S. pyogenes carries a risk of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (approximately 1–5%), underscoring the value of timely therapy and community measures during outbreaks. Impetigo is highly contagious; families should be counseled on hand hygiene, avoiding sharing towels, trimming nails, and temporary exclusion from close-contact settings if drainage is uncontrolled, while also considering the contribution of scabies co-infection where relevant because it can reduce treatment success for impetigo if unaddressed [^116pxvKP] [^116sV4qD] [^116RmfBS].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the working diagnosis clinically and with targeted testing when indicated. In a 1-year-old with eczema and a more widespread acute rash, secondary impetigo is highly plausible given the elevated risk in atopic skin; the presence of vesicles or pustules that rupture to honey-colored crusts favors impetigo over a pure eczema flare, but I must actively exclude eczema herpeticum if vesiculopustular lesions have punched-out erosions or systemic features. If the presentation is typical and localized, initiate topical therapy (mupirocin or ozenoxacin) and reassess early; if widespread or rapidly progressive, obtain a swab for Gram stain and culture, begin an oral antistaphylococcal agent with pediatric weight-based dosing, and tailor to culture results and local MRSA epidemiology. Throughout, maintain skin-barrier care and limit contagion through hygiene counseling [^112bwZ7j] [^113icsrx] [^116kxG6g] [^111kjE7o].

A 1-year-old with eczema who develops a more widespread rash is at **increased risk for impetigo** [^115AqAC7] due to skin barrier defects and scratching [^1169YisK] [^116pxvKP]. Impetigo is suggested by **honey-colored crusts** and rapid spread, especially on the face and extremities [^1169YisK]. Confirm with **clinical exam** [^115sBtfH] and, if atypical or severe, obtain **bacterial cultures** [^112bwZ7j]. Treat localized disease with topical mupirocin [^116yDAXB] [^113icsrx] or ozenoxacin [^116kxG6g] [^111L6Rsh]; use oral cephalexin [^115Bo85M] or clindamycin for extensive or MRSA-suspected cases [^111GN5r7]. Continue eczema care and monitor for complications such as cellulitis [^notfound] or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [^116pxvKP].

## Clinical features differentiating impetigo from eczema

Impetigo and eczema can overlap, but **key differences** help distinguish them:

| **Feature** | **Impetigo** | **Eczema (atopic dermatitis)** |
|-|-|-|
| Lesion appearance | Honey-colored crusts [^116wmEs5]; vesicles or bullae [^1169YisK]; erosions | Erythematous, scaly, pruritic patches [^1169YisK]; lichenification |
| Distribution | Face, extremities, perioral, perinasal [^115Ko85Q] | Flexural areas, cheeks, scalp [^113is5MC] |
| Progression | Rapid spread [^116pxvKP]; autoinoculation | Chronic, relapsing course [^113is5MC] |
| Systemic symptoms | Rare; fever, lymphadenopathy possible [^116wmEs5] | Rare; usually localized |

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis is primarily **clinical**, with additional tests as indicated [^115sBtfH]:

- **Clinical examination**: Look for honey-colored crusts [^116wmEs5], vesicles, bullae [^1169YisK], and rapid spread.
- **Bacterial culture**: Obtain from lesions if atypical, severe [^112bwZ7j], or unresponsive to initial therapy.
- **Differential diagnosis**: Consider eczema herpeticum [^111kjE7o], scabies [^114Q88Ae], tinea [^115Uicf2], and other infectious or inflammatory conditions.

---

## Recommended treatment strategies

Treatment depends on **severity and extent**:

| **Severity** | **Treatment** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Localized (≤ 5 lesions) | Topical mupirocin [^116yDAXB] [^113icsrx] or ozenoxacin [^116kxG6g] [^111L6Rsh] | 5–7 days |
| Extensive (> 5 lesions) or MRSA suspected | Oral cephalexin [^115Bo85M], clindamycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [^111GN5r7] | 7–10 days |

---

Adjunctive measures include continuing **eczema care**, avoiding scratching, and maintaining **hygiene** [^111FX78s] to prevent spread.

---

## Potential complications

If untreated or inadequately managed, **impetigo may lead to**:

- **Cellulitis**: Deeper skin infection [^116wmEs5].
- **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis**: Rare kidney complication [^115DgkHG].
- **Sepsis**: Rare systemic infection [^116wmEs5].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventing **impetigo** in children with eczema involves:

- **Skin care**: Regular emollients and gentle cleansing [^1169YisK].
- **Infection control**: Hand hygiene and avoiding contact with infected individuals [^116sV4qD].
- **Prompt treatment**: Early management of eczema flares and secondary infections [^114EwzT8].

---

A 1-year-old with eczema and a widespread rash is at **increased risk for impetigo** [^115AqAC7]. Clinical features, bacterial cultures, and appropriate treatment are essential for management [^112Njy1r].

The following constitutes key background information on ecthyma and impetigo:

- **Definition**: Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Ecthyma is a deeply ulcerated form of impetigo that extends into the dermis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Impetigo is nearly always caused by S. aureus and/or β-hemolytic Streptococcus species. Community-acquired MRSA is an increasingly frequent etiological agent.

- **Epidemiology**: Impetigo predominantly affects children. In patients under 18 years of age, the incidence of impetigo is estimated at 206 per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Impetigo begins as erythematous papules that rapidly evolve into vesicles and pustules that rupture, with the dried discharge forming honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base. Ecthyma begins as vesicles that rupture, resulting in circular, erythematous ulcers with adherent crusts, often with surrounding erythematous edema.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a serious complication that affects between 1 and 5 percent of patients with nonbullous impetigo. Rheumatic fever does not appear to be a potential complication of impetigo. Impetigo usually resolves without scarring within two weeks if left untreated. Unlike impetigo, ecthyma heals with scarring.

### Increased risk of cutaneous and systemic infections in atopic dermatitis-a cohort study [^115AqAC7]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

We examined the prevalence of multiple common cutaneous and noncutaneous infections, including warts, dermatophyte infection, impetigo, molluscum contagiosum, otitis media, pneumonia, and streptococcal throat infection (codes available in Supplementary Table S1 online). We found that all the infectious illnesses we had determined to test a priori were more prevalent in those with atopic dermatitis (AD). Using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, we examined the odds of each infectious outcome at any time point and found that the strength of association for cutaneous infections varied from a 55% increased odds of impetigo to a 3-fold increased odds of molluscum contagiosum after adjusting for sex, age, time of observation, and practice. Associations with noncutaneous infections varied from a 27% increased odds of streptococcal throat infections to a 2-fold increase in otitis media.

- **Sensitivity analyses**: We performed sensitivity analyses exploring the definition of AD. When estimating the association with a longer list of less-specific dermatitis codes (see Supplementary Table S1), we found that most associations were diminished. When estimating the association with a more narrow designation, AD plus asthma or seasonal rhinitis, the magnitude of most associations increased. This highlighted a potential link between underlying immune dysfunction in atopic disease and increased susceptibility to infection.

Prior publications have found higher rates of infections among patients with AD.

### Topical antibacterial agent for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: Pooled analysis of phase 3 clinical trials [^111L6Rsh]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Ozenoxacin is a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria, developed as a 1% cream for the treatment of impetigo. This article presents pooled results of pivotal clinical trials of ozenoxacin to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin 1% cream after twice-daily topical treatment for 5 days in patients with impetigo.

A pooled analysis was performed on individual patient data from two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 registration studies conducted in patients with impetigo. Both clinical trials followed a similar methodology. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ozenoxacin or vehicle. One trial included retapamulin as an internal control. Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were evaluated.

Ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success versus vehicle after 5 days of therapy and superior microbiological success versus vehicle after 2 days of therapy. It was safe and well-tolerated. Ozenoxacin showed superior clinical and microbiological response versus vehicle in children as young as 2 months of age and adults with impetigo.

### Children atopic dermatitis: Diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^1169YisK]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Impetigo**: Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection caused mainly by Staphylococci and Streptococci. It takes the form of pain, erythema, and serum scabs. It may, therefore, be confused with AD or coexist with it. Typically, it presents with oozing serum that has dried up, giving it a honey-crusted appearance surrounded by an erythematous base. Impetiginous lesions may also present with fluid-filled blisters (bullous impetigo). Furthermore, impetigo can occur in eczema-affected skin that is open and "weepy". People with AD are more likely than the general population to have colonized Staphylococcus aureus, leaving them more prone to infections.

- **Molluscum dermatitis**: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral infection of the skin, especially in children. It is found more frequently in individuals with AD, but there is not necessarily an association. Skin barrier defects predispose patients with AD to MC, and long-term scratching leads to the spread by autoinoculation. MC infection in AD has been associated with FLG mutations. The diagnostic doubt arises when an itchy eczema (molluscum dermatitis) develops around the molluscum. However, a careful objective examination will highlight the papule of MC.

### Mupirocin [^111h1fVi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of topical mupirocin ointment in impetigo was tested in two trials:

- **First trial**: Subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment or a vehicle placebo three times daily for 8 to 12 days. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations (including adults and pediatric subjects) were 71% for mupirocin ointment (n = 49) and 35% for vehicle placebo (n = 51). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 94% for mupirocin ointment and 62% for vehicle placebo.

- **Second trial**: Subjects with impetigo were randomized to receive either mupirocin ointment three times daily or 30 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg oral erythromycin ethylsuccinate per day for 8 days (this was an unblinded trial). A follow-up visit occurred one week after the treatment ended. Clinical efficacy rates at the follow-up visit in the evaluable populations (including adults and pediatric subjects) were 93% for mupirocin ointment (n = 29) and 78.5% for erythromycin (n = 28). Pathogen eradication rates in the evaluable populations were 100% for both test groups.

- **Pediatrics**: There were 91 pediatric subjects aged 2 months to 15 years in the first trial described above. Clinical efficacy rates at the end of therapy in the evaluable populations were 78% for mupirocin ointment (n = 42) and 36% for vehicle placebo (n = 49). In the second trial described above, all subjects were pediatric except two adults in the group receiving mupirocin ointment. The age range of the pediatric subjects was from 7 months to 13 years.

### Topical corticosteroid withdrawal in a pediatric patient [^1179Sy7S]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Topical corticosteroid (TCS) withdrawal was first described by Sneddon in 1968. It is a clinical adverse effect resulting from the inappropriate, prolonged, and frequent use of mid- to high-potency TCS, most commonly on the face or genital region. This effect is distinct from other well-described effects, such as skin atrophy and steroid rosacea, as it is precipitated by the sudden cessation of TCS.

It typically affects middle-aged women who have used a mid- or high-potency TCS on the face, usually for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In a systematic review by Hajar and colleagues, only 7% of reported cases occurred in patients younger than 18 years.

The literature on steroid withdrawal dermatosis describes two morphologically distinct subtypes: a papulopustular variant and an erythematoedematous variant, which at times overlap. In our case, the patient fits best into the papulopustular subtype, with prominent features of pustules, rather than the erythematous scaling and symptoms of burning or stinging seen in the erythematoedematous variant.

The triad of erythema, edema, and extensive pustulation, in particular, has been described as rapidly occurring after stopping long-term application of fluorinated corticosteroids for the treatment of facial rash, often associated with rosacea. In the pediatric literature, individual cases describe a nonspecific dermatitis treated with fluorinated steroids that causes steroid rosacea, resulting in a "rebound phenomenon" upon any attempt at discontinuation of the topical treatment. This usually occurs within the first week of cessation and consists of an increased severity of symptoms.

### Use of primary care data for detecting impetigo trends, United Kingdom, 1995–2010 [^113KwpeU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Although changes in health-seeking behavior or data recording could underlie the increased consultation rate, the fact that similar increases were reported from other primary and secondary care datasets suggests that our findings are not artifacts. The Read codes used to identify patients were unchanged throughout the study period, and we are unaware of any changes in clinical practice that would lead to an increased tendency to diagnose impetigo.

Impetigo is frequently dismissed as a mild infection that spontaneously resolves with a good outcome. By contrast, this study suggests that an undetected increase in impetigo in the community drove a major increase in hospital admissions of children in England from 1989–1990 through 2003–2004. Awareness of this epidemic by general practitioners could have triggered the development of specific guidelines on the management of this condition, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing hospital admissions. Routinely collected primary care data are an underused and potentially rich source of information about infectious diseases in the community. We should do more to find novel ways of incorporating this information into international surveillance networks and using it to guide evidence-based treatment and prescribing decisions in primary care.

### A pemphigus-like presentation of secondary syphilis [^1121eqSy]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species are bacteria that can cause superinfections on the skin, manifesting as impetigo. The clinical presentation of impetigo usually appears in nonbullous or bullous forms. Characteristically, they present as 2- to 4-mm vesicles or pustules that progress to typical honey-crusted papules. They can also present as small vesicles that enlarge to 1- to 2-cm bullae, progressing into eroded scaly lesions. The clinical presentation of the lesions from our patient also simulated lesions that present in impetigo; this motivated us to obtain a bacterial culture of a pustule to rule out this differential diagnosis. The culture result was negative.

Rarely, congenital syphilis can present with acantholytic lesions. In a case report by Kim et al, congenital syphilis presented as a generalized bullous and pustular eruption with desquamation at birth. Similar to our patient, neutrophilic infiltration was visualized on dermatopathology analysis. It is possible that the same process occurs in some patients with adult syphilis, similar to lesions found in congenital bullous syphilis. For example, a case report by Miller described a 37-year-old man with a pustular lesion on his penile shaft that tested positive for T. pallidum. The rare manifestation of pustular secondary syphilis also presented itself in three individual patients. Another case report by Mignogna et al. described anti-Dsg/indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG against Dsg1 and Dsg3 in an adult patient who had secondary syphilis with oral pemphigus.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^115PmxzW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

This was a community randomized open-label study conducted in Malaita province of the Solomon Islands. Six communities were randomized to one of two arms: an ivermectin arm or a combined-treatment arm. We selected communities that were isolated from each other to reduce contamination between the two study arms. All residents living in selected communities were eligible to participate. Community engagement and education were conducted by the study team prior to commencement of the study. Written informed consent was obtained from adults and from the parent or guardian of children. Assent was also obtained from children who were able to provide it.

Study visits took place at three timepoints. At baseline, participants were seen for enrollment, initial data collection, and treatment. At three months, we reexamined children (aged ≤ 12 years) in each community to allow for the collection of swabs to monitor for antimicrobial resistance; this age group was selected as they were anticipated to have the highest prevalence of impetigo. At the 12-month follow-up visit, we again aimed to examine all participating residents in participating communities. Prior to visits at both baseline and 12 months, the study team conducted a village census. At baseline and 12 months, participants underwent a standardized examination by an experienced clinician (MM) with data recorded on the presence or absence of any skin lesions, their location, and whether they were consistent with scabies, impetigo, or another diagnosis.

### Topical minocycline foam for the treatment of impetigo in children: Results of a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study [^116zn4jC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). High credibility.

Currently, available treatment options for impetigo are limited by either systemic side effects associated with oral therapy or lack of ease of use associated with topical ointments. A novel foam formulation of minocycline for topical use may improve convenience and treatment utilization for pediatric patients with impetigo.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically applied minocycline foam (FMX-102 1% and 4%) in the treatment of impetigo and determine the optimal therapeutic active ingredient concentration.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, comparative clinical trial, 32 subjects aged ≥ 2 years with a clinical diagnosis of pure impetigo, impetigo contagiosa, or uncomplicated blistering impetigo were randomized to treatment with FMX-102 1% or 4%, twice daily for 7 days. Subjects were followed for up to 7 days post-treatment.

- **Results**: Clinical cure, defined as ≥ 80% cured lesions (fully recovered lesions, visually determined by investigators), was achieved by 57.1% and 50.0% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, at the end of treatment (visit 3). Clinical success, defined as the absence of lesions or the drying or improvement of treated lesions (decrease in size of affected area, lesion number, or both), was demonstrated in 81.3% and 78.6% of FMX-102 1% and 4% subjects, respectively, following 3 days of treatment (visit 2). At the end of treatment, clinical success was observed in 92.3% and 100% of the respective subjects, and reached 100% in both groups at follow-up (visit 4). Bacteriologic success rates at the end of treatment were defined as complete pathogen eradication.

### A 3-year-old child with multiple superficial erosions and yellowish crusts on the scalp and seborrheic areas [^115tgBE4]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Answers:

- **Bullous impetigo**: Incorrect. Bullous impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection. Although in this condition, antibodies also target Dsg1 similar to PF, the clinical course is distinct. Bullous impetigo generally resolves in 1–2 weeks and responds favorably to systemic and topical antibiotics against *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes* bacteria. The organism should be apparent in the staining findings of the tissue.

- **Inverse psoriasis**: Incorrect. The histopathology of psoriasis typically reveals several distinctive features including elongation of rete ridges and the presence of neutrophils in the epidermis, notably in the form of Munro's microabscesses. DIF is typically negative in psoriasis.

- **Pemphigus foliaceus (PF)**: Correct. PF is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder in children. The cutaneous manifestations are often found on the face, scalp, axilla, intertriginous region, and in particular instances, the seborrheic distribution. Characteristics include crusted plaques and superficial erosions in a polycyclic pattern that can progress to erythroderma and exfoliative dermatitis. Histological examination revealed an intraepidermal blister with acantholytic cells within or adjacent to the granular layer. Dsg1 is being targeted and DIF revealed IgG and C3 deposition in a granular pattern at the intercellular junction confirming the diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus.

- **Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)**: Incorrect. Even though the scalp, diaper area, and seborrheic distribution were conspicuous in this instance, histological testing co…

### Childhood osteomyelitis-incidence and differentiation from other acute onset musculoskeletal features in a population-based study [^111BKVUG]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

We conducted a population-based, multicenter study in three counties in Southeastern Norway (Akershus, Buskerud, and Oslo) between May 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005. The total number of children under the age of 16 was 255,303 as of January 1, 2004. In Norway, the majority of patients receive care in their county of residence, and the homogeneous healthcare and social security system, based on equality of access, facilitates recruitment to epidemiological studies.

The children were examined at county pediatric departments or at the regional department of rheumatology (i.e. at Akershus University Hospital, Buskerud Hospital, Ullevål University Hospital, or Rikshospitalet Medical Centre). All primary care physicians were sent a letter every three months asking them to refer children with possible or evident osteomyelitis or arthritis to the appropriate hospital on the day the patient was first seen. The recruitment criteria were one or more of the following characteristics (under six weeks' duration and not caused by trauma):

- **Joint swelling**
- **Limited range of motion**: Including walking with a limp or other functional limitations affecting arms and/or legs.
- **Pain in one or more joints or extremities**: Together with CRP > 20 mg/L and/or ESR > 20 mm/hr and/or WBC > 12 × 10⁹/L.

At the end of the study, we searched the hospitals' computerized records for 181 relevant diagnoses based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10), to identify any patients who met the recruitment criteria but had not been included during the initial recruitment phase.

### New insights into pustular dermatoses in pediatric patients [^1157WzNi]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Pustular eruptions are common in the pediatric population. The focus of this review is to highlight entities that present with pustules, signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation, and other organ involvement. Although these conditions are rare, awareness of them should facilitate early recognition, faster evaluation (including genetic testing, if appropriate), and adequate treatment.

### Osteomyelitis in immunocompromised children and neonates, a case series [^1163FCQM]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

In developed countries, acute osteomyelitis (OM) occurs in about 8 in 100,000 children, with boys being affected more than girls. The classical clinical picture includes an unwell and pyrexic child with pain and signs of inflammation around a long bone. The most common sites include the femur (23–29%), tibia (19–26%), and humerus (5–13%). Most of our cases involved the long bone, which is congruent with the literature. However, we have also demonstrated that unusual infection sites need to be considered in immunocompromised patients. We reported infections of the tarsal and metatarsal bones, phalanges of the hand, and base of the skull. These are sites that are estimated to be involved in less than 1% of OM cases.

The classical presentation of a child with OM includes fever, bone pain, reduced ambulation, and bone swelling. They can also present with generalized malaise. Severe tenderness, reduced range of movement, local edema, erythema, and warmth can be commonly found on physical examination. Our case series highlights that immunocompromised children are less likely to present with these classical features, which could be due to the inability of a compromised immune system to produce an adequate inflammatory response. About 64% of our patients presented with a fever over 38°C, 66.7% presented with bone pain, and 28.6% presented with reduced active mobility. Their sensitivity in detecting OM in our patient pool is 64.3%, 42.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. This demonstrates the difficulty of clinically diagnosing an immunocompromised child with OM. However, features like bone swelling and…

Eczema herpeticum is an easily missed entity most commonly seen in the pediatric population and carries the risk of systemic compromise and a 10% mortality rate. Clinicians should maintain high clinical suspicion when encountering children or young adults with a history of atopic dermatitis or other erosive dermatoses who present with vesicular lesions, punched-out erosions, and systemic symptoms. We present three severe cases of eczema herpeticum that were potentially overlooked and demonstrate the need for elevated awareness to avoid potential pitfalls.

### First trimester impetigo herpetiformis in multiparous female successfully treated with oral cyclosporine [^113hR9he]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Impetigo herpetiformis, or gestational pustular psoriasis, can account for 4.25% of all pregnancy dermatoses seen. Unlike other pregnancy dermatoses, it can be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fever, rigors, arthralgia, and complications like secondary infection and sepsis. There is an increased risk of fetal anomalies and stillbirths.

A 25-year-old para 1 presented to primary care at 7 weeks gestation with a peri-umbilical rash unresponsive to topical steroids and was admitted to the hospital at 31 weeks with fever and a widespread painful erythematous rash. Her condition worsened despite high-dose oral steroids. With the use of cyclosporine and regular opioid analgesia over 2 weeks, her symptoms were adequately controlled. She went into spontaneous labor at 41(+2) weeks and delivered a healthy male infant.

Impetigo herpetiformis can initially be treated with topical and oral steroids and supportive measures. However, immunomodulatory therapies such as cyclosporine have shown success in treating resistant cases.

### Differentiating hidradenitis suppurativa flare from infection in the emergency department and recommendations for transitioning care to the outpatient setting [^111YSahf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa is a painful and often progressive inflammatory skin condition that presents with papules, nodules, abscesses, and tunnels in the axillary, inframammary, and anogenital regions. Differentiating hidradenitis suppurativa from a skin infection, such as a bacterial abscess, is important as management often requires long-term follow-up and specialist care. Emergency physicians should be aware of how to differentiate acute hidradenitis suppurativa flares from similarly presenting conditions, particularly skin and soft tissue infections, when encountered in the emergency department and know the steps necessary to adequately bridge care to the outpatient setting.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^116rBw1F]. JAAD case reports (2020). Low credibility.

Differentiating bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) can occasionally present a significant clinical challenge. In the 18th and 19th centuries, physicians mistakenly christened infantile BI as pemphigus neonatorum, highlighting the significant clinical similarity between the two diseases. Although there are rare reports of severe BI in the immunocompetent adult population, the infrequency can confound correct diagnosis. Patients with BI and PF can both present with crusted, scaly superficial erosions with morphologically indistinguishable, easily denuded blisters. Although similarly flaccid, the blisters of PF are typically smaller, and lesions as large as 1 to 2 cm are uncommon.

Another useful clinical differentiator to consider is the rapidity of disease progression. BI tends to generalize quickly, as was the case with our patient, whereas PF is more likely to progress over weeks to months. In both conditions, lesions localize to the superficial epidermis, commonly sparing mucous membranes. This phenomenon results from desmoglein-1-specific pathology, allowing for desmoglein compensation at mucosal sites, which have much higher levels of desmoglein-3 expression compared with the nonmucosal epidermis.

Histologically, the blisters of both BI and PF are subcorneal, exhibiting dyskeratotic, acantholytic granular cells in the superficial epidermis, where desmoglein-1 is preferentially expressed. In one study, neonatal mice injected with either exfoliative toxin A, the toxin characteristically produced by S. aureus in BI, or PF antibodies were found to develop both clinically and histologically relevant features of the diseases described.

### Topical corticosteroid withdrawal in a pediatric patient [^1175TLXk]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis included TCS withdrawal, impetigo, herpes simplex, pustular psoriasis, and acute localized exanthematous pustulosis. Bacterial and viral cultures were obtained, and the patient was given empiric doxycycline and continued on acyclovir while cultures were pending. She was also instructed to restart triamcinolone ointment to the face, every other day with a slow taper off. The cultures were negative, and on phone follow-up 4 days later, the parents reported the patient's face had returned to normal. She was continued on a taper of topical triamcinolone to hydrocortisone ointment and continued on oral doxycycline.

### The importance of scabies coinfection in the treatment considerations for impetigo [^116RmfBS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). High credibility.

Skin infections account for a high disease burden in indigenous children living in northern Australia. Although the relationship between impetigo and scabies is recognized, the prevalence of scabies in children with impetigo is not well reported. We report the prevalence, demographics, and treatment success outcomes of impetigo and scabies coinfection in indigenous children who were participants in a randomized controlled trial of impetigo treatment conducted in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia.

- **Methods**: Of 1,715 screening episodes for impetigo, 508 children were randomized to receive intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin (BPG), twice daily co-trimoxazole (SXT) for 3 days (4 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 20 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose), or once daily SXT for 5 days (8 mg/kg trimethoprim plus 40 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole per dose). A clinical diagnosis of scabies, tinea of the skin, scalp, or nail, and head lice was made on all children. Scabies presence was not confirmed using diagnostic scrapings. In a post-hoc analysis, we determined whether coinfection with scabies had an impact on treatment success for impetigo.

- **Results**: Of children randomized to receive treatment for impetigo, 84 of 508 (16.5%) had scabies. The presence of scabies ranged from 14.3% to 20.0% in the three treatment groups. Treatment success for impetigo with and without scabies coinfection, independent of the treatment groups, was 75.9% and 86.6%, respectively; absolute difference 10.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): +1% to +21%].

### Levofloxacin [^113WQTJD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of several conditions:

- **Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections**: Levofloxacin is used to treat uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (mild to moderate), including abscesses, cellulitis, furuncles, impetigo, pyoderma, and wound infections caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

- **Chronic bacterial prostatitis**: It is indicated for the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis due to Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis [see Clinical Studies (14.6)].

- **Inhalational anthrax (post-exposure)**: Levofloxacin is indicated for post-exposure inhalational anthrax to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis. The effectiveness of levofloxacin is based on plasma concentrations achieved in humans, a surrogate endpoint reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. However, it has not been tested in humans for the post-exposure prevention of inhalation anthrax. The safety of levofloxacin in adults for durations of therapy beyond 28 days or in pediatric patients for durations of therapy beyond 14 days has not been studied. Prolonged levofloxacin therapy should only be used when the benefit outweighs the risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2) and Clinical Studies (14.9)].

- **Plague**: Levofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of plague, including pneumonic and septicemic plague, due to Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) and for prophylaxis of plague in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 months and older.

### Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo [^114EwzT8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin infection that most commonly affects children two to five years of age. The two types of impetigo are nonbullous impetigo (i.e. impetigo contagiosa) and bullous impetigo. Diagnosis is usually made clinically, though a culture may rarely be useful. Although impetigo usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without scarring, treatment helps relieve discomfort, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent the spread of organisms that may cause other illnesses, such as glomerulonephritis.

There is no standard treatment for impetigo, and many options are available. Topical antibiotics like mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective and may be superior to oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be considered for patients with extensive disease; however, oral penicillin V is seldom effective. There is no clear preference among antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides, though resistance rates to erythromycin are rising. Topical disinfectants are not useful in the treatment of impetigo.

### Use of primary care data for detecting impetigo trends, United Kingdom, 1995–2010 [^116sV4qD]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial infection primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It is the fourth most common dermatologic condition among children seen in general practice. Although most infections are mild, outbreaks have a considerable negative effect because infected children may be barred from attending schools and nurseries.

In the United Kingdom, hospitalizations for impetigo increased fivefold from 1989–1990 through 2003–2004; among children, the increase was twelvefold. To investigate whether this increase was fueled by increasing rates of infection in the community rather than increased pathogenicity, we used a large and nationally representative primary care database to calculate time trends in incidence of consultations and medications prescribed for impetigo.

### Efficacy and safety of ozenoxacin cream for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with impetigo: A randomized clinical trial [^116kxG6g]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). High credibility.

Ozenoxacin, a novel topical antibacterial agent with potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, has been developed as a cream with 1% active drug for the treatment of impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ozenoxacin cream, 1%, following a 5-day twice-daily topical treatment in patients with impetigo.

The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial. It included patients aged 2 months or older with impetigo, who were enrolled at centers in six countries from June 2, 2014, through May 30, 2015. Data were analyzed based on the intention to treat from July 9 through July 22, 2015. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either topical ozenoxacin or a placebo control.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Efficacy was measured using the Skin Infection Rating Scale and microbiological culture. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Among the 411 patients who received treatment (210 males [51.1%]; mean [SD] age, 18.6 [± 18.3] years), ozenoxacin demonstrated superior clinical success compared with placebo. This was evident after 5 days of therapy (112 of 206 [54.4%] vs. 78 of 206 [37.9%]; p = 0.001). Ozenoxacin also demonstrated superior microbiological success compared with placebo after 2 days of therapy (109 of 125 [87.2%] vs. 76 of 119 [63.9%]; p = 0.002). Ozenoxacin was well tolerated, with 8 of 206 patients experiencing adverse effects, and only 1 of these effects was potentially related to the study treatment; none were serious.

### Common skin rashes in children [^115Ko85Q]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash, the clinical course, and associated symptoms such as pruritus or fever. Fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection.

- **Roseola**: The key feature is a rash presenting after the resolution of a high fever.

- **Pityriasis rosea**: The distinguishing features are a herald patch and a bilateral, symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern.

- **Scarlet fever**: The rash usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles.

- **Impetigo**: A superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children.

- **Erythema infectiosum**: Characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the "slapped cheek" facial rash.

- **Molluscum contagiosum**: Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with this highly contagious viral infection, which usually resolves without intervention.

- **Tinea**: A common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails.

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that may present with a variety of skin changes.

### Beyond the herald patch: Exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Several conditions may mimic pityriasis rosea (PR) and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:

- **Secondary syphilis**: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution. Lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.

- **Tinea corporis**: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.

- **Erythema multiforme**: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.

- **Guttate psoriasis**: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis. The scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.

- **Pityriasis lichenoides chronica**: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution. One or more of them show a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.

- **Pityriasis alba**: Hypopigmentation can be mistaken for PR in some cases.

### International comparison of guidelines for management of impetigo: A systematic review [^111FX78s]. Family Practice (2022). High credibility.

Impetigo is a common superficial skin infection that affects people worldwide and is usually treated with antibiotics; therefore, its management has implications for global antibiotic stewardship.

- **Objective**: This systematic review and narrative synthesis compares and contrasts international impetigo management guidelines.

- **Methods**: Guidelines for the treatment of impetigo that were produced by a national authority, available to primary care physicians, and published since 2008 were included. Following a comprehensive search strategy, data extraction from eligible studies was performed independently in duplicate. Details of antiseptic and antibiotic treatment, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus treatment, and conservative management and preventative measures were tabulated and analyzed descriptively.

- **Results**: Fifty-one guidelines were included from 42 different countries. All guidelines recommended systemic antibiotics, with 78% of these only for widespread lesions or failure of topical antibiotic treatment. The first-line systemic antibiotic treatment was restricted to narrow-spectrum options in 21 (41%), whilst 7 (14%) recommended only broad-spectrum antibiotics first-line. Thirty-four (67%) guidelines included recommendations for topical antibiotic use. Twenty guidelines (39%) did not mention antiseptic treatment for impetigo. Guidelines did not always provide clear indications for different treatment options.

- **Conclusions**: Despite potentially equal efficacy to systemic antibiotics, only two-thirds of guidelines include topical antibiotic options. Many fail to provide clear guidance on treatment choices.

### Treatment of impetigo in the pediatric population: Consensus and future directions [^113KZvir]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a common, contagious superficial bacterial skin infection. Treatment of localized lesions can be achieved through topical antibiotics, while oral antibiotics are reserved for extensive disease. Increasing antimicrobial resistance to existing therapies has raised concerns. Antimicrobial stewardship, achieved through the responsible use of antibiotics, is an important measure to reduce bacterial resistance. This review highlights treatment options for impetigo and shares consensus statements to help guide the management of impetigo in the pediatric population.

- **Objective**: An expert panel of dermatologists and pediatricians convened in February 2019 to establish evidence-based consensus on the management of impetigo in the pediatric patient population.

- **Methods**: The consensus was created in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. Prior to the consensus meeting, a systematic literature review was conducted, with the selected literature deemed clinically relevant to the consensus statements. Statements were further refined and assessed systematically following established standards. The consensus process consisted of a modified Delphi approach, and was established through a minimum 75% "agree" rate.

- **Results**: Thirteen consensus statements were developed addressing clinical challenges, existing treatment options and their limitations, and new therapeutic alternatives.

- **Conclusion**: Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials commonly used in treating impetigo has been reported. Antimicrobial stewardship remains critical in managing resistance effectively.

### Impetigo herpetiformis unresponsive to therapy in a pregnant adolescent [^114B18wQ]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Impetigo herpetiformis is a rare pustular disorder affecting mainly pregnant women. We report a 16-year-old adolescent primigravida who presented with impetigo herpetiformis at 27 weeks gestation. She had a pustular erythroderma covering her entire body, except for the face, scalp, and palmoplantar regions, with severe pruritus and pain. After unsuccessful attempts of treatment with systemic corticosteroids, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, treatment was switched to cyclosporine, but no therapeutic effect could be achieved. Because of the deteriorating condition of the patient, an early delivery decision was made. Her symptoms resolved after delivery, and by day 20 postpartum, her skin lesions were completely resolved.

### Unexplained fractures: Child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^1147kvp6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem, and an improper diagnosis carries tremendous consequences for the patient, their family, and the doctor. A substantial degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with a missed diagnosis, with a reinjury rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 10% for unprotected children. In addition, the emotional trauma for the patient and family undergoing a prolonged investigation by Child Protective Services (and perhaps even the wrongful removal of custody) demonstrates the power of a misguided diagnosis of abuse. With fractures representing the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft tissue trauma, orthopaedic surgeons are at the forefront of evaluating patients with potential CAN.

Many studies have described the musculoskeletal manifestations of child abuse: rib fractures, skull fractures, humeral and femur fractures are among the most common. Recent studies demonstrated that the combination of patient age and fracture location can reproducibly differentiate abuse from accidental trauma. Among these factors, a suspicious history, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months are associated with CAN.

In 1962, Kempe et al. introduced the concept of "battered child syndrome". The authors included osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) as part of the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with potential abuse. The authors noted that OI should be easily distinguishable from abuse based on history and physical examination.

### Reduced bacterial skin infections in HIV-infected African children randomized to long-term cotrimoxazole prophylaxis [^115imnFo]. AIDS (2016). Low credibility.

The global burden of bacterial skin infections has generally been underappreciated; a recent systematic review estimated that 162 million children are affected at any time by impetigo, predominantly in tropical, low-income countries. In tropical regions, S. pyogenes is the predominant pathogen causing impetigo; despite previous uncertainty, S. pyogenes is susceptible to cotrimoxazole in vitro. A trial among indigenous Australian children with impetigo showed noninferiority of short-course oral cotrimoxazole compared with intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin for treatment.

There is increasing recognition that S. aureus is also an important cause of skin infections in tropical settings and that S. pyogenes and S. aureus coinfection is common. Published cotrimoxazole resistance rates among S. aureus isolates from sub-Saharan Africa are 25–100%, suggesting that cotrimoxazole has limited efficacy for staphylococcal skin infections; however, high intracellular concentrations may facilitate its antibacterial activity. Many previous studies have noted that cotrimoxazole retains prophylactic activity against a range of infections despite high rates of resistance among causative organisms. It is also plausible that the benefits of cotrimoxazole for skin infections are particularly driven by its activity against S. pyogenes; there are few published data on cotrimoxazole resistance among S. pyogenes isolates in sub-Saharan Africa.

For primary skin infections, it is effective against conditions such as impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Secondary skin infections treated with Gentamicin Sulfate include infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (such as poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial superinfections of fungal or viral infections.

Please note that Gentamicin Sulfate, being a bactericidal agent, does not target viruses or fungi in skin infections. It proves useful in treating infected skin cysts and specific skin abscesses if preceded by incision and drainage, enabling adequate antibiotic contact with infecting bacteria. Successful outcomes have been reported in treating infected stasis ulcers, other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations, abrasions, and wounds from minor surgeries.

Patients sensitive to neomycin may be managed with Gentamicin Sulfate, though it is advisable to regularly observe patients sensitive to topical antibiotics when used. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream USP, 0.1% is suitable for wet, oozing primary infections as well as greasy secondary infections like pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. Meanwhile, gentamicin sulfate ointment, which aids in moisture retention, has shown usefulness in infections on dry eczematous or psoriatic skin. When a water-washable preparation is preferred, the cream formulation is recommended.

### Treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin infections in the pediatric and adolescent patient populations [^1176HJpQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Before 1980, superficial pyodermas in the US were caused primarily by streptococci. Studies conducted in Miami show that during the early 1980s, the predominant pathogen associated with impetigo in pediatric patients shifted from *Streptococcus pyogenes* to *Staphylococcus aureus*. Subsequent reports revealed a trend of increasing resistance of *S. aureus* to penicillins. By regularly monitoring local sensitivity patterns, physicians are more likely to select the appropriate antibiotic. The recommendation for the treatment of pediatric skin disease is cephalosporins due to their low likelihood of resistance by *S. aureus*.

### A 14-year-old girl with multiple, firm, dome-shaped eroded nodules and itching on the limbs [^117HBhsA]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of prurigo nodularis (PN) includes antihistamines, ultraviolet light, and topical and systemic corticosteroids; unfortunately, PN is notoriously resistant to conventional therapy. Herein, one case of PN is described, which was initiated with herose as the first-line therapy, resulting in complete clinical clearance. Results of follow-up examinations from 2005 to 2009 showed no evidence of recurrence. Findings indicate that herose monotherapy is a potentially promising therapeutic option for PN.

### Common pediatric and adolescent skin conditions [^112143Jm]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, and it is therefore important for physicians to understand the fundamentals of explaining and diagnosing common skin conditions. This article begins with a discussion of description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders, such as vitiligo, are depicted.

- **Cutaneous growths**: Found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment of these growths usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication.

- **Scaling patches and plaques**: Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema are comprised of these; poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids, while phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases.

- **Acne vulgaris**: This is the most common skin disease of the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating, thus proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic.

- **Vascular anomalies**: Most commonly exemplified by port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress.

### Analytical study of pustular eruptions in neonates [^117X3ppW]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Pustular eruptions are commonly encountered in neonatal practice. Much confusion exists among clinicians because of the similarity in clinical lesions, paucity of relevant literature, and varied nomenclature used for these diseases. This often results in inappropriate diagnoses and therapies, besides subjecting the neonates to invasive and traumatic investigative procedures. We conducted a comprehensive study of pustular eruptions in 100 neonates, using the clinical examination and simple laboratory tests to arrive at a practical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this problem.

Of the 100 neonates with pustular eruptions, 36% were in the early neonatal period (first week of life). A slight male preponderance with a male-to-female ratio of 1:0.79 was observed. The majority of the families of these infants had poor socioeconomic status (96%) and were living in slums (71%). A study of their educational status revealed that 54% of the mothers were uneducated. Fifty-seven percent of the neonates were born at home.

The clinical pattern of diseases among these neonates was that 58% of them had infections, with impetigo (23%), intertrigo (14%), scabies (6%), and viral diseases (6%). Noninfectious diseases (42%) included miliaria pustulosa, erythema toxicum neonatorum, epidermolysis bullosa, and contact dermatitis. Simple laboratory investigations helpful in establishing the diagnosis were smears processed with Gram (24%) and Giemsa (39%) stains and wet mounts with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution (27%) for direct microscopic examination.

### Treatment of impetigo: Oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed [^113wF4zr]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin disease frequently seen in children. While data support the use of topical antibiotics for treatment, the medications actually prescribed in practice are not well documented.

- **Objectives**: To determine the prescribing pattern of dermatologists and nondermatologists when treating impetigo and the demographics of the patients treated.

- **Methods**: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data on office visits for impetigo were analyzed from 1997 to 2007. Patient demographics and the treatments for impetigo were recorded.

- **Results**: During this 10-year period, dermatologists managed an estimated 274,815 impetigo visits and nondermatologists managed an estimated 3,722,462 visits. Both dermatologists and nondermatologists most frequently prescribed oral antibiotics to treat impetigo. Topical antibiotics were the second most common, and a variety of combination treatments were used.

- **Conclusions**: Oral antibiotics are the most common class of medications used to treat impetigo. There is an opportunity for physicians to take advantage of the equally efficacious topical antibiotics for treating impetigo. A shift towards topical antibiotics would likely decrease morbidity resulting from adverse effects associated with the use of oral agents.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^112VrynA]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?

- **Options**:
	- A. Impetigo bullosa
	- B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
	- C. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)
	- D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome
	- E. Erythema multiforme

- **Answers**
- **A. Impetigo bullosa – Incorrect**. Impetigo bullosa is a skin infection caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, with the rare appearance of intact vesicles or bullae. Typically, the lesions are copious, especially in the mouth and nose regions. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained with Gram stain and culture.

- **B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect**. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of the main types of bullous epidermolysis, characterized by fragility of the skin where nonscarring blisters and erosions form due to minor mechanical trauma. Diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing and skin biopsy.

- **C. DCM – Correct**. DCM is characterized by generalized infiltration of mast cells in the skin, frequently forming bullae. Bullous lesions are often observed, with involvement in 62% to 69% of patients, and may be the first presentation of DCM. Bullae appear mainly on the trunk, scalp, and extremities, developing into erosions and thickening of the skin. Clinically, patients present with pruritus, generalized erythema, pachydermia, and a darker skin color compared to normal-appearing skin. Histologic examinations are typically performed to assist with the diagnosis. Frequent follow-up and proper treatment are essential for significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes.

### Risk factors for severe impetiginized atopic dermatitis in Japan and assessment of its microbiological features [^1123ma3B]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are susceptible to cutaneous bacterial infection. When such patients develop infection, some have extensive impetiginized dermatitis with high fever. To clarify the risk factors for severe impetiginized AD and its microbiological features, we reviewed clinical and microbiological data of 14 patients with impetiginized AD who were admitted to our hospital between the years 1999 and 2006. All patients had poorly controlled AD with eczematous lesions on the extensive body surface. The mean age was 28.2 years (range 18–35). Cultures of the lesional skin yielded both Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in 12 patients; S. pyogenes alone was isolated in two cases. These observations suggest that poorly controlled AD in adults is a risk factor for severe impetiginized AD and that S. pyogenes might play an important role in the development of severe clinical symptoms.

### Bullous impetigo rapid diagnostic and therapeutic quiz: A model for assessing basic dermatology knowledge of primary care providers [^1168hFNv]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) is a common dermatologic condition, particularly in children, yet confusion regarding its diagnosis and treatment persists. This study measured pediatricians' ability to diagnose and appropriately treat BI and explored factors that might influence pediatricians' accuracy in managing BI.

- **Methods**: We administered an expert-validated survey to 64 pediatrics house staff and faculty at three Johns Hopkins Medicine facilities. The survey requested demographic information, diagnoses for five "unknown" cases, and preferred treatments for localized and widespread BI.

- **Results**: Overall, BI was diagnosed correctly 31.9% of the time. There was little difference between house staff and faculty performance, although faculty 50 years of age and older demonstrated better diagnostic acumen. Regarding treatment of localized BI, 92% of faculty members and 84.6% of house staff listed mupirocin as first- or second-line treatment. The second most common medication listed for localized BI was bacitracin. Regarding treatment of widespread BI, faculty listed cephalexin or clindamycin as first- or second-line treatment 56.0% of the time, and house staff listed one of these two medications 51.3% of the time. Results for faculty 50 years of age and older were comparable.

- **Conclusions**: Improved pediatrician proficiency in the diagnosis and treatment of BI is needed for safe, cost-effective management. Physician age and experience appear to have a limited effect on the accuracy of BI diagnosis and management. Future educational efforts must be directed at training pediatricians to enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic skills in managing BI.

### The limping child: Evaluation and diagnosis [^117BjqJz]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

A limp is a common reason for a child to present to the orthopaedist. Because of the long list of potential diagnoses, some of which demand urgent treatment, an organized approach to evaluation is required. With an understanding of normal and abnormal gait, a directed history and physical examination, and the development of a differential diagnosis based on the type of limp, the patient's age, and the anatomic site most likely affected, the orthopaedist can take a selective approach to diagnostic testing.

Laboratory tests are indicated when infection, inflammatory arthritis, or a malignant condition is in the differential diagnosis. The C-reactive protein assay is the most sensitive early test for musculoskeletal infections; an abnormal value rapidly returns to normal with effective treatment. Imaging should begin with plain radiography. Ultrasonography is particularly valuable in assessing the irritable hip and guiding aspiration, if necessary.

### Randomized trial of community treatment with azithromycin and ivermectin mass drug administration for control of scabies and impetigo [^116Zx6RD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

At 12 months, the prevalence of scabies and impetigo had fallen to 1.0% (95% CI 0.3–2.6%) and 2.5% (95% CI 1.4–4.5%), respectively, in the ivermectin-only treatment arm and to 0.7% (95% CI 0.2–1.8%) and 3.3% (95% CI 2.1–5.1%), respectively, in the combined treatment arms. There was no significant difference between the two groups (91.5% vs. 92.4%, P = 0.31) in the change from baseline to 12 months in scabies prevalence or the change in impetigo prevalence (75.2% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.49).

- **Post hoc sensitivity analysis**: We performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis to assess whether the lower follow-up in the ivermectin-only arm might have affected our results. We calculated the prevalence of impetigo that would have been seen in the ivermectin-only treatment arm if we had achieved a follow-up at a level similar to the combined treatment arm and the prevalence amongst participants not seen at 12 months had been unchanged from baseline. Under these assumptions, the prevalence of impetigo in the ivermectin-only treatment arm would have been 4.1% at twelve months. In this analysis, there was no significant difference in the relative reduction in impetigo between arms (60.2% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.23).

- **Swab collection and culture results**: Swabs were collected from 73 people with impetigo at baseline, 36 people at 3 months, and 22 people at 12 months. At baseline, 80% of impetigo lesions from which we obtained a swab yielded S. aureus on culture, and 62% yielded pyogenic streptococci (predominantly S. pyogenes, 56%). At 3 and 12 months, the proportion of S. aureus was unchanged (78% and 86%, respectively).

### A review of common pediatric lip lesions: Herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas [^1124j51u]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Lip lesions frequently present in pediatricians' offices. While typically benign in children and without significant functional morbidity, their prominent placement and role in communication can be alarming to both patients and their parents. Thus, pediatricians play a crucial role in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating various types of labial dermatoses commonly encountered in pediatric practice, such as herpes simplex/recurrent herpes labialis, impetigo, mucoceles, and hemangiomas. This paper reviews the literature on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these four lesions.

### The generalized rash: part I. Differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often face challenges in diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment.

In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### It looks like childhood eczema but is it [^113is5MC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2019). Low credibility.

In childhood, the most common type of eczema or dermatitis is atopic dermatitis, which occurs in up to 25% of children worldwide. However, the diagnosis may sometimes be challenging as atopic dermatitis can resemble other types of dermatitis, as well as skin diseases such as psoriasis, infections, infestations, and malignancies, alongside metabolic, genetic, and autoimmune disorders. This review focuses on recognizing the most common types of dermatitis in children and adolescents and how to differentiate them from the most common differential diagnoses both clinically and histologically.

### Do antimicrobial resistance patterns matter? An algorithm for the treatment of patients with impetigo [^11699DEX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly occurring in young children, although adults may also be affected. The superficial skin infection is mainly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* (S. aureus) and less frequently by *Streptococcus pyogenes* (S. pyogenes). Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide concern and needs to be addressed when selecting treatment for impetigo patients. An evidence-based impetigo treatment algorithm was developed to address the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.

- **Methods**: An international panel of pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists employed a modified Delphi technique to develop the impetigo treatment algorithm. Treatment recommendations were evidence-based, taking into account antimicrobial stewardship and the increasing resistance to oral and topical antibiotics.

- **Results**: The algorithm includes education and prevention of impetigo, diagnosis and classification, treatment measures, and follow-up. It distinguishes between localized and widespread or epidemic outbreaks of impetigo. The panel adopted the definition of localized impetigo as fewer than ten lesions and an area affected smaller than 36 cm² in patients aged two months and up with no compromised immune status. Resistance to oral and topical antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of impetigo, such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid, has been widely reported.

- **Conclusions**: When prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to know the local trends in antibiotic resistance.

### Pediatric burn wound impetigo after grafting [^116HLPxW]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Modern burn care techniques have reduced the risk of infection of the acute burn wound, resulting in more rapid healing and a lower incidence of graft loss. However, secondary breakdown may still occur. The loss of epithelium, in association with multifocal superficial abscesses and ulceration, has been termed burns impetigo. This condition may result in considerable morbidity and require prolonged treatment.

Events preceding the development of burns impetigo, its impact on the patient, and the ideal treatment remain unclear and poorly reported. Over a 5-year period between 2006 and 2011, 406 pediatric burns were treated with skin grafts, with 7% developing burns impetigo. The time to resolution ranged from 5 to 241 days. The mean time to complete healing was greatest with conservative management (96 days), followed by antibacterial dressings (37 days), oral antibiotics (36 days), topical steroids (16 days), and oral antibiotics in combination with topical steroids (13.5 days).

Burns impetigo resulted in significant morbidity, requiring multiple visits to the treatment center and causing prolonged symptoms. Delays in diagnosis and treatment resulted in worse outcomes. Prompt consideration of burns impetigo should occur when postgraft patients present with suggestive clinical signs, and treatment with oral antibiotics plus topical steroids should be considered.

### Bullous impetigo masquerading as pemphigus foliaceus in an adult patient [^113vw2BE]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Bullous impetigo (BI) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are two distinct cutaneous conditions with substantial clinical overlap. BI is a common, highly contagious cutaneous infection often affecting children, whereas PF is a relatively rare autoimmune blistering condition. Lesions arise from the disruption of desmoglein-1, a desmosomal protein required for keratinocyte adhesion, by an epidermolytic toxin or IgG autoantibodies, respectively. Given their shared pathophysiology, it is not surprising that these diseases can have similar clinical presentations and have been mistaken for one another in the literature. Correct diagnosis is critical, as BI is managed with antibiotics to curb rapid spread, and the disease course of PF is meaningfully affected by early systemic immunosuppression. We discuss the diagnosis of a case of BI masquerading as PF and the means of distinguishing the two cutaneous conditions.
