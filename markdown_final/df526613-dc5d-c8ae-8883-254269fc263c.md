## Question

A 54-year-old woman with a 2-year history of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) presents to clinic complaining of persistent fatigue that has been worsening over the past 6 months. She is currently on ursodeoxycholic acid with stable liver function tests. She denies pruritus or jaundice. On review of systems, she reports poor sleep and occasional low mood, but no overt symptoms of hypothyroidism or anemia. Physical examination is unremarkable. She asks if there is any medication you can prescribe specifically to treat her fatigue.

Based on current APASL guidelines, how should you address this patient's complaint of fatigue?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage fatigue in a 54-year-old woman with primary biliary cholangitis who is already on ursodeoxycholic acid with stable liver tests, and specifically whether there is any medication that can be prescribed to treat her fatigue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the prevalence and pathophysiology of fatigue in PBC and whether it tracks with disease stage. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (APASL, AASLD, BSG/UK-PBC) say about pharmacologic therapy for fatigue. Next, I will review the evidence for modafinil and other agents. After that, I need to outline a structured, stepwise evaluation for reversible contributors. Finally, I will propose nonpharmacologic strategies and summarize a practical plan with clear counseling points and follow-up, making sure I anchor each step to the best available guidance and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the nature of PBC-related fatigue. Fatigue is extremely common in PBC, reported in roughly 50–80% of patients, and importantly, its severity does not correlate with liver disease stage or biochemical activity, which explains why patients with stable LFTs can still have debilitating fatigue; this is consistently emphasized in APASL and AASLD guidance and supported by observational data and reviews [^b55c629b] [^7ab83715] [^0ef737a4].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before jumping to treatment implications. The mechanism of fatigue in PBC is multifactorial and incompletely understood, with both central and peripheral components proposed; central fatigue may manifest with cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance, and peripheral contributors include metabolic changes and possibly autonomic dysfunction, though no single pathway has been proven causal, which helps explain the lack of disease-modifying symptom therapies [^0ef737a4] [^84ef9ae5].

> I should confirm the guideline stance on pharmacologic therapy for fatigue. APASL explicitly states there is no specific medical therapy available for PBC-related fatigue, and recommends focusing on identifying and treating coexistent conditions such as anemia, hypothyroidism, sleep disturbance, and depression; AASLD similarly notes no recommended therapy for fatigue and emphasizes education and counseling rather than medications; BSG/UK-PBC likewise advises a structured, nonpharmacologic approach and cautions that fatigue is not an indication for liver transplantation [^de0ef102] [^410b2b8e] [^0ef737a4] [^ef76834f].

> Hold on, I should review modafinil specifically because patients often ask about it. Observational data suggest modafinil may attenuate fatigue in selected patients, particularly when excessive daytime sleepiness is present, with improvements in Epworth Sleepiness Scale and PBC-40 QoL, but APASL frames this as promising rather than standard of care and highlights side effects such as insomnia, nausea, headache, and nervousness; moreover, there are no robust randomized trials establishing efficacy or safety in PBC fatigue, so routine use is not guideline-endorsed and should be considered investigational or reserved for carefully selected cases after other measures fail [^de0ef102] [^126cf6c3].

> Next, I should review a structured, stepwise evaluation for reversible contributors, and I need to ensure I don't miss common culprits. I will examine for anemia with CBC, iron studies, and B12/folate; screen for hypothyroidism with TSH and free T4; assess sleep quality and consider insomnia, restless legs, or obstructive sleep apnea; evaluate mood with a validated tool such as PHQ-9; check for autoimmune associations like Sjögren's and celiac disease; review medications that worsen fatigue (e.g., beta-blockers, sedatives); and consider cardiopulmonary contributors when indicated; this approach is consistently recommended across APASL, BSG/UK-PBC, and AASLD documents [^de0ef102] [^0ef737a4] [^410b2b8e].

> Let me think about nonpharmacologic management, because this is where meaningful improvement is most likely. I should confirm that structured exercise is safe and potentially beneficial; pilot and feasibility work supports moderate-intensity, home-based programs using RPE 12–14, with supervision to individualize intensity and progression; cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based approaches can help with coping, sleep hygiene, and mood; patient education about the nature of PBC fatigue and its independence from liver test stability is essential; and connecting patients with support groups can mitigate social isolation, which is common and impactful in PBC fatigue [^e69350b2] [^0ef737a4] [^d4305f4b] [^2e753b8c].

> I should double-check that I am not inadvertently suggesting disease-modifying therapy for fatigue. UDCA improves survival and slows histologic progression but does not improve fatigue, and second-line agents like obeticholic acid or fibrates target biochemical response and pruritus rather than fatigue; thus, escalating disease therapy solely for fatigue is not appropriate, though optimizing biochemical control remains important for long-term outcomes [^a7d07935] [^26509718] [^e6ca4f5d].

> But wait, what if the patient is profoundly fatigued and requests a trial of modafinil despite the limited evidence? I need to ensure shared decision-making: explain the observational nature of the data, potential benefits in alertness, and common adverse effects; screen for contraindications such as arrhythmias or significant anxiety; start low (e.g., 100 mg morning) with close follow-up; and discontinue if there is no meaningful benefit or if side effects emerge, documenting the rationale and patient preferences [^de0ef102] [^126cf6c3].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. I will reassess fatigue severity and impact using a validated tool such as the PBC-40 or Fatigue Impact Scale to quantify change over time; revisit reversible contributors periodically; reinforce adherence to UDCA and evaluate biochemical response at 6–12 months; and consider referral to a hepatology center if fatigue remains severe and refractory after a structured approach, as specialized centers may offer access to supportive programs and trials [^b55c629b] [^38e41542] [^8f3bc80a].

> In summary, I need to ensure the patient understands that there is no guideline-recommended medication for PBC-specific fatigue at this time, that fatigue is common and not tied to liver test stability, and that our best strategy is a structured, stepwise plan: screen comprehensively for reversible causes, implement nonpharmacologic interventions centered on exercise, sleep, mood, and education, and consider modafinil only as a cautious, off-label, time-limited trial after shared decision-making if other measures fail; this aligns with APASL, AASLD, and BSG/UK-PBC guidance and reflects the current evidence base [^de0ef102] [^410b2b8e] [^0ef737a4].

---

Based on current APASL guidance, there is **no specific pharmacologic therapy** for PBC-related fatigue [^de0ef102]. Fatigue is common in PBC, often persists despite optimized UDCA, and is not correlated with disease stage or biochemical response [^b55c629b] [^7ab83715]. Management should focus on **identifying and treating reversible contributors** (anemia, hypothyroidism, sleep disturbance, depression, medications) [^de0ef102] and using nonpharmacologic strategies such as graded exercise, sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioral therapy [^0ef737a4] [^e69350b2]. Modafinil may be considered case-by-case for excessive daytime sleepiness after other causes are excluded, but evidence is limited and it is not guideline-recommended [^de0ef102] [^126cf6c3]. Liver transplantation is not indicated for fatigue alone [^ef76834f].

---

## Pathophysiology of fatigue in PBC

Fatigue in PBC is **multifactorial**, with both central and peripheral mechanisms proposed:

- **Central mechanisms**: Neurotransmitter imbalances, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment contribute to fatigue [^0ef737a4].

- **Peripheral mechanisms**: Metabolic disturbances, muscle weakness, and autonomic dysfunction are implicated [^notfound].

Importantly, fatigue severity **does not correlate with disease stage or biochemical activity**, indicating that fatigue is a distinct symptom complex requiring separate management [^b55c629b] [^7ab83715].

---

## Current APASL guidance on fatigue management

APASL provides **clear guidance** on managing fatigue in PBC:

- **No specific pharmacologic therapy**: There is no approved medication specifically for PBC-related fatigue [^de0ef102].

- **Identify and treat reversible contributors**: Evaluate for anemia, hypothyroidism, sleep disturbances, depression, and medications that may exacerbate fatigue [^de0ef102].

- **Nonpharmacologic interventions**: Emphasize graded exercise, sleep hygiene, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) [^0ef737a4].

- **Modafinil**: May be considered in select cases with excessive daytime sleepiness after excluding other causes, but evidence is limited and it is not guideline-recommended [^de0ef102] [^126cf6c3].

---

## Evidence for pharmacologic interventions

Several pharmacologic agents have been studied for PBC-related fatigue, but **none have robust evidence** supporting routine use:

| **Medication** | **Evidence summary** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Modafinil | Observational data suggest potential benefit in reducing fatigue and improving quality of life, but evidence is limited and inconsistent [^de0ef102] [^126cf6c3] | Not recommended routinely; consider case-by-case after excluding other causes |
| Antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs) | Limited evidence; may help if depression contributes to fatigue | Not specifically recommended for PBC-related fatigue |
| Hormonal therapies (e.g. testosterone) | No evidence supporting benefit in PBC-related fatigue | Not recommended |

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic strategies are **strongly recommended** by APASL and other guidelines:

- **Graded exercise**: Structured, moderate-intensity exercise programs have been shown to improve fatigue and functional capacity [^e69350b2].

- **Sleep hygiene**: Addressing sleep disturbances through behavioral interventions and sleep hygiene practices.

- **Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Effective in managing fatigue-related distress and improving quality of life [^notfound].

- **Patient education and support**: Providing information about fatigue and connecting patients with support groups can improve coping strategies [^d4305f4b].

---

## Clinical evaluation and monitoring

A **structured approach** to evaluating fatigue in PBC includes:

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to identify reversible contributors [^de0ef102].

- **Validated fatigue scales**: Use of tools such as the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) or PBC-40 to quantify fatigue severity and monitor response to interventions [^b55c629b].

- **Regular follow-up**: Ongoing reassessment of fatigue and adjustment of management strategies as needed [^0ef737a4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, there is **no specific pharmacologic therapy** for PBC-related fatigue per current APASL guidance. Management should prioritize identifying and treating reversible contributors, with nonpharmacologic interventions such as graded exercise, sleep hygiene, and CBT as first-line strategies. Modafinil may be considered in select cases with excessive daytime sleepiness after other causes are excluded, but evidence is limited and it is not guideline-recommended. Liver transplantation is not indicated for fatigue alone [^ef76834f].

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic, cholestatic, autoimmune disease with a variable progressive course. PBC can cause debilitating symptoms including fatigue and pruritus and, if left untreated, is associated with a high risk of cirrhosis and related complications, liver failure, and death. Recent changes to the PBC landscape include a name change, updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment as well as new treatment options that have recently become available. Practicing clinicians face many unanswered questions when managing PBC. To assist these healthcare providers in managing patients with PBC, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Institute for Clinical Research & Education, in collaboration with the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation (CLDF), organized a panel of experts to evaluate and summarize the most current and relevant peer-reviewed literature regarding PBC. This, combined with the extensive experience and clinical expertise of this expert panel, led to the formation of this clinical guidance on the diagnosis and management of PBC.

Given the unmet need of fatigue in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), the PBC working group of the European Reference Network for Rare Liver Diseases assessed and summarised the current evidence relating to fatigue in PBC to provide guidance for clinical practice and identify knowledge gaps to shape the future research agenda. Six key questions regarding PBC-related fatigue were summarised through systematic review and meta-analyses. Fatigue is highly prevalent in PBC and substantially affects health-related quality of life. Several measurement tools are available but future research should emphasise longitudinal designs to track symptoms with easy-to-apply and accurate tools. The pathophysiology of fatigue in PBC remains largely unknown and involves a complex interplay of various factors. Pilot studies suggest the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments, which warrant further investigation. Pending the results of clinical trials, no pharmacological treatment can be recommended for PBC-related fatigue. Finally, we introduce a practical, three-step ASK-MEASURE-TREAT algorithm that can be applied in all patients with PBC.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — fatigue and quality of life states that symptomatic PBC patients usually present with fatigue, pruritus, or jaundice, and fatigue occurs in up to 80% of patients and fluctuates independently of disease activity or stage. The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), especially the PBC‑40, helps to measure the severity of fatigue in PBC patients. Early presentation of fatigue severely affects the health‑related quality of life (HRQoL) and has been viewed as a predictor of mortality, and fatigue may not be completely resolved by UDCA or even liver transplantation.

Service standards/audit recommendations for PBC

Opportunities exist to implement the BSG/UK-PBC PBC guidelines into clinical practice through audit of current and future clinical care. We propose that the following service standards and targets be adopted by clinical teams caring for patients with PBC, with the goal being improved and more effective and uniform care for patients with PBC:
To exclude alternative aetiologies for cholestasis, all patients with suspected PBC should have an abdominal ultrasound as part of their baseline assessment (standard 90%).
All patients should be offered therapy with UDCA. UDCA at 13–15 mg/kg/day is recommended for first-line use in all patients with PBC (standard 90% of patients receiving therapy at adequate dose or documented to be intolerant).
To facilitate the identification of patients at risk of progressive disease, individualised risk stratification using biochemical response indices is recommended following 1 year of UDCA therapy (standard 80% of patients receiving UDCA therapy to have their response status recorded in the notes and the criteria used recorded).
To highlight the impact on QoL and to ensure appropriate investigation and treatment, all patients should be evaluated for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch (standard 90% of patients have the presence/absence of fatigue and pruritus recorded in the notes in the last year).
To maximise the opportunity for all patients to be considered in a timely way for liver transplantation, all patients with a bilirubin > 50 µmol/L or evidence of decompensated liver disease should be discussed with a hepatologist linked to a transplant programme (s tandard 90% documentation that discussion has taken place within 3 months of the bilirubin exceeding 50 µmol/ L and the actions taken recorded)
To optimise prevention of osteoporotic bone fractures, all patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to national guidelines (standard 80% assessment within the last 5 years).
To ensure timely but considered diagnosis and treatment, overlap with AIH should be recognised as rare and, when suspected, liver biopsy with expert clinicopathological assessment is recommended to make the diagnosis (standard 90% of patients in whom the diagnosis of overlap is made having had liver biopsy confirmation and the clinicopathological assessment discussion noted).

Recommendation 22

We recommend that rifampicin can be a safe and effective second-line therapy for pruritus; prescribers must, however, evaluate the risks and benefits of use and ensure appropriate monitoring for side effects. (Strong; Moderate)

Fatigue

Although fatigue is not specific to PBC, it is frequently reported by patients (over 50%) and when severe, as it is in 20% of patients, is a significant cause of QoL impairment. There are peripheral and central components to it, with central fatigue frequently associated with cognitive impairment (poor memory and concentration) which can be mistaken for HE. Fatigue is, with the exception of very endstage patients where it is the norm, not related to severity of liver disease and is not responsive to UDCA therapy. The approach to fatigue and its management therefore needs to run, as is the case for pruritus, in parallel with the management of the underlying disease process. Post-transplant patients with PBC typically have ongoing fatigue, and transplant for severe fatigue in the absence of other indications is not appropriate. High quality clinical trials in this area have been limited to date, and there is no licensed therapy. Fatigue in PBC as in other chronic diseases is inherently complex in nature and a structured approach to it is essential if improvement is to be seen. A structured approach to management, quantifying fatigue and its impacts (through the use of tools such as the PBC-40 QoL measure), addressing contributing and exacerbating factors and supporting patients to cope with its impact has been shown to be effective. It is important, when addressing fatigue, to identify other disease processes and therapies linked to PBC either directly or indirectly which may be contributing to fatigue. These include other autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism or autoimmune anaemias and demography-associated conditions and therapies such as type 2 diabetes and antihypertensive therapy. The steps to management of fatigue in PBC, which should be taken sequentially, are outlined in table 3. There is no evidence to suggest that exercise is harmful in PBC fatigue. Indeed, there are pilot data to suggest that structured exercise initiated at levels which can be tolerated by fatigued patients may be beneficial.

APASL PBC guidance — Fatigue management: No effective therapy for fatigue is available at this moment, although only modafinil exhibits promising results with observational data showing attenuation of fatigue related to excessive daytime sleepiness and improvement in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and PBC-40-Quality of Life; side effects include insomnia, nausea, headache, and nervousness. Recommendation 15 states that no specific medical therapy is available for fatigue and that treating co-existent conditions such as anemia, extra-hepatic autoimmune disease, sleep disturbance, and depression are recommended to manage fatigue (III, 2).

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — management of symptoms and fatigue: The symptoms of PBC significantly impair quality of life and do not typically improve with UDCA or OCA treatment, therefore they warrant separate evaluation and treatment. At this time, there is no recommended therapy for the fatigue resulting from PBC, education and counseling for patients in how to deal with these symptoms are important, and intractable fatigue is not a valid indication for liver transplantation because fatigue usually persists post transplant.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — clinical features and diagnostic markers: PBC is a chronic intrahepatic cholestatic disease that typically affects middle-aged women and presents with fatigue and pruritus or with asymptomatic elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), especially the M2 subtype (AMA-M2), are described as highly sensitive and specific for PBC in clinical settings, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is noted as the treatment of choice for this disease.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^705b1e23]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) future research and horizons — Although PBC is considered an autoimmune liver disease, the environmental factors that trigger loss of self-tolerance to BECs remain unclear, and despite the remarkable diagnostic utility of anti‑mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), their pathogenic role remains to be elucidated; experimental animal models and translational studies are proposed to generate new knowledge and enable discovery of novel therapies. The clinical features and natural history of atypical phenotypes or variants (preclinical or subclinical, AMA‑negative disease, vanishing bile duct; PBC with AIH features; PBC recurrence after liver transplantation) should be further investigated to optimize management strategies. Although ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the treatment of choice, therapeutic responses are not always predictable, so it is necessary to investigate clinical and laboratory stratification factors to individualize care with available agents including UDCA, obeticholic acid (OCA), fibrates, and budesonide. Collaborative efforts are emphasized, with targets that may trigger autoimmune reactivity against intrahepatic BECs or mediate symptoms such as intractable fatigue and pruritus; the merit of early immunomodulatory therapy should be explored, and immunological agents such as rituximab (anti‑CD20 antibody) and ustekinumab (anti–IL‑12/IL‑23 antibody) are noted as likely efficacious for early‑stage PBC but not for advanced stage with UDCA‑resistance, with stringent ethical rules needed for clinical trial design.

Obeticholic acid (OCA) for PBC with inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) shows biochemical improvements with defined dosing and safety cautions. In a phase II add‑on trial, three doses of OCA (10, 25, and 50 mg/day) were studied in patients with suboptimal response to UDCA (ALP > 1.5 x ULN), and ALP reductions persisted at the end of a 12‑month open‑label extension; in a phase II monotherapy study, ALP and other markers were reduced in both OCA 10 mg and OCA 50 mg groups at the end of a 3‑month double‑blind phase with improvement observed at the end of a 6‑year open‑label extension. In the phase III POISE program, after 12 months of OCA therapy nearly half of prior biochemical non‑responders or UDCA‑intolerant patients had better biochemical improvement than placebo, and a 3‑year interim analysis from the 5‑year extension showed ALP and total bilirubin significantly decreased after 12 months and 48 months. Common adverse events were pruritus (77%) and fatigue (33%), and dose‑dependent pruritus led to discontinuation in 15% (OCA 10 mg) to 38% (OCA 50 mg) of patients. The Food and Drug Administration warned that use of OCA in PBC patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child–Pugh–Turcotte B and C) was associated with clinical worsening or even death, and use in decompensated cirrhosis was not recommended. Recommendation: 5. It is recommended that OCA (starting at 5 mg/day, increasing to 10 mg/day after 6 months if tolerated well) be added to UDCA therapy for PBC patients (non‑cirrhotic or cirrhosis with Child–Pugh–Turcotte A) and an inadequate response to UDCA or used as monotherapy in those intolerant to UDCA. Potential risks and adverse events of OCA should be discussed in detail with the patient, carefully evaluated and appropriately monitored.

Executive summary

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease. It continues to have a burden of morbidity and mortality that spans both the consequences of a sometimes progressive biliary injury, alongside a symptom profile notably encompassing pruritus, sicca complex, fatigue, abdominal discomfort and arthralgias/bone pain. UK-PBC and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) have partnered to develop a comprehensive guideline document to provide detailed advice and recommendations on the best approaches to the management of the disease. A series of recommendations and audit standards are proposed to ensure that patients are offered timely licensed therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), obeticholic acid (OCA)) in addition to being actively managed for symptoms as well as complications of progressive liver disease.

JOURNEY OF THE PATIENT WITH PBC: THE CONTINUED NEED FOR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT

Symptoms of PBC may extend beyond those of liver disease alone, including extrahepatic complications of the disease (Figure 2). Lifelong management of patients with PBC is necessary and should be personalized to the patient's disease state and symptoms. Medical therapy to prevent disease progression and complications of cirrhosis, as well as to manage the associated symptoms of the disease, is recommended.

Figure 2.
Symptoms and manifestations of PBC. Fatigue and pruritus, common complaints associated with PBC, are considered symptoms directly associated with the disease. The 3 most common extrahepatic conditions associated with PBC are sicca syndrome, thyroid disorders, and systemic sclerosis. PBC is also associated with a clustering of other autoimmune conditions (e.g. Raynaud phenomenon or scleroderma); however, a recent population-based study found that concomitant autoimmune conditions did not influence outcomes in patients with PBC. Other symptoms that are poorly characterized but reported by patients with PBC include restless leg syndrome, cognitive impairment, and bone and joint pain, the severity of which may not be proportionate to the severity of the underlying liver disease. Furthermore, chronic cholestasis associated with PBC may be associated with extrahepatic manifestations, such as hyperlipidemia, metabolic bone disease, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Patients with PBC can also experience impaired quality of life attributed to associated fatigue, cognitive symptoms, social and emotional dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and depression. PBC, primary biliary cholangitis.

The rate of progression of PBC from early-stage disease to cirrhosis to liver-related morbidity/mortality can vary among patients; however, progression is typically slow, with no visible symptoms. Studies of patients with PBC with cirrhosis indicate that 10 years after the initial diagnosis, progression to decompensated liver disease (ascites, bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, or liver failure) occurs at rates of 10%–26%. Treatment can slow progression and reduce the need for liver transplantation. A large international meta-analysis that included 4,845 patients with PBC demonstrated that UDCA significantly improved transplant-free survival at 5, 10, and 15 years compared with nontreated individuals (90%, 78%, and 66% vs 79%, 59%, and 32%, respectively).

Recommendation 32

We recommend that all patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to national guidelines. (Strong; High)

When should patients be considered for clinical trials?

For many years following the original UDCA trials there has been little or no trials activity in PBC. This is now changing with a number of trials targeting areas of perceived unmet clinic need in the condition, with progress to new licensed second-line therapies such as OCA, which has FDA and EMA approval, as well as NICE evaluation in the UK. Currently there are trials in three distinct areas and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate if they fall into targeted groups (see).

High-risk/UDCA-unresponsive disease

The significantly worse clinical outcome seen in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA has focused interest on trials of enhanced or second-line therapy. Trials currently under development target two aspects of the disease process — namely, the upstream autoimmune response causing initial bile duct injury (typically but not exclusively using second-generation biological-based approaches) and the cycle of cholestatic injury (using second-line bile acid-targeting therapeutics such as FXR agonists that suppress bile acid production and fibrates, which have anecdotal evidence but as yet no randomised placebo-controlled data). The standard approach in current and proposed enhanced disease therapy trials is to target patients not meeting UDCA response criteria at the end of 1 year of treatment at 13–15 mg/kg/day (or who are intolerant of UDCA) and any patient failing to meet this criterion should be considered for participation in ongoing trials of second-line or enhanced therapy.

Pruritus resistant to current therapy

Current and proposed trials are targeting resistant pruritus including through breaking of the enterohepatic circulation for bile acids and, it is proposed, targeting the autotoxin pathway. Protocols vary, but typically target patients with significant residual pruritus (defined in terms of severity and/or frequency) following first and established second-line therapy or who are intolerant of current therapy, and should therefore be considered for participation in clinical trials.

Fatigue

Trials targeting fatigue are complex, reflecting the nature of the clinical problem. They form part of the management approach undertaken in specialist centres and patients with severe fatigue should be considered for referral to such centres. Critical for trials of fatigue in PBC is the need to exclude confounding causes, and the systematic approach to addressing such confounding processes outlined elsewhere in these guidelines should be followed before trial participation is considered.

### Widespread gaps in the quality of care for primary biliary cholangitis in UK [^5f633a22]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease characterised by destruction of intrahepatic cholangiocytes and progressive fibrosis. The chronic disease course culminates in end-stage biliary cirrhosis and its associated complications such as portal hypertension. The UK prevalence of PBC is estimated to be 15 000.

Clinical features and the impact of PBC on the quality of life (QoL) are highly variable. Common features include pruritus, fatigue, memory problems and decreased bone mineral density. The aims of life-long treatment are to minimise the symptom burden, slow down disease progression and manage complications. Individuals with inadequate biochemical response to first-line therapy, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), following 1 year of treatment, are regarded as high risk of progressive disease.

Updated guidelines for PBC management were published in 2017 by European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and in 2018 by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) in collaboration with UK-PBC — both recommend the utilisation of audit tools. At the time of writing, no formal analysis has been undertaken on the management of PBC nationally.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: a patient-friendly summary of the 2018 AASLD practice guidance [^8f12145a]. Clinical Liver Disease (2021). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — definition, course, and care needs: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system harms the liver by mistakenly attacking bile ducts, and in PBC it is primarily the small ducts in the liver that are harmed, leading to substances accumulating in the liver and blood that cause itching, fatigue, and issues with the body's metabolism; in late stages, PBC can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. The direct cause is not completely known and is believed to be a combination of genetic risk factors and environmental triggers, and people with PBC progress to cirrhosis at different rates and respond differently to treatment; however, most people respond very well to medical treatment. As a chronic condition, individuals should routinely see a hepatologist (liver specialist) for care.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — pruritus prevalence and course notes that pruritus affects 20–70% of patients. A recent cross‑sectional study in Japan showed that about 30% of patients with PBC suffered from moderate‑to‑severe pruritus. It may occur in any stage, before, at or after the development of jaundice, is usually mild and tolerable in most PBC patients but may be severe and persistent in some patients, and the severity of pruritus seems to not correlate with the disease stage or activity.

Given the heightened awareness of poorer outcomes, attention should be given to managing high-risk, younger and UDCA non-responsive patients in specialist centres. Deterioration of PBC can be rapid in the end stages (particularly once a patient is jaundiced) and timely referral for consideration of transplantation, which is an effective treatment for end-stage disease, is essential. Recurrence of disease post-transplant is reported, but only rarely clinically relevant.

While the majority of patients will have good QoL, for a significant and important minority, impairment is notable and clinicians should enquire specifically about symptoms. Cholestatic pruritus affects about a third of patients and effective first-line (bile acid sequestrants) and second-line (rifampicin) therapies exist, although with tolerability and side effect concerns. Fatigue is a significant problem in up to half of patients and is complex in nature. Social isolation is an important factor in poor QoL in fatigued patients with PBC. There is no single effective therapy for fatigue and a structured approach, including effective treatment of comorbid conditions such as pruritus (nocturnal itch can be a significant factor in sleep disturbance contributing to fatigue) and depression, is needed.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) AASLD practice guidance — scope and intent — is described as follows: This American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2018 Practice Guidance on Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is an update of the PBC guidelines published in 2009, and it provides a data-supported approach for screening, diagnosis, and clinical management of patients with PBC. It differs from more recent AASLD practice guidelines that are supported by systematic reviews and a multidisciplinary panel; in contrast, this guidance was developed by consensus of an expert panel, its guidance statements are based on formal review and analysis of published literature, and the quality (level) of the evidence and the strength of each guidance statement are not rated. Intended for use by health care providers, it identifies preferred approaches to the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of care for patients with PBC, provides general guidance to optimize the care of the majority of patients and should not replace clinical judgment for a unique patient, and major changes include information about obeticholic acid (OCA) and the adaptation of the guidance format.

The use of international web sites by patients is not recommended as the clinical practice described may differ from that in the UK, causing confusion.

Fatigue has been shown to be the symptom with the biggest impact on patients. Fatigued patients perceive a poor QoL compared with controls and their levels of social engagement are lower. Very little is written in relation to social isolation and improving support mechanisms in PBC, but there are a number of telephone helplines and patient support groups that offer free qualified peer support to patients. It is recommended (based on expert opinion) that details of helplines can be suggested to patients who may be at risk of social isolation. Information can be found on the following web pages:
(The PBC Foundation)
(LIVErNorth)
(Liver4Life)

There may be scope for psychological approaches, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, to be used to support patients with PBC. Such approaches have been found to be effective in other chronic conditions for managing distress resulting from debilitating symptoms. Blackburn et al explored the psychological impact of fatigue in PBC using semi-structured interviews and validated assessment tools for psychological symptoms. Patients with PBC who report high levels of fatigue were found to be more vulnerable to emotional distress and are more likely to perceive that their QoL has been negatively affected. We therefore advise that a patient with profound psychological distress associated with fatigue should be referred to appropriate psychological services for assessment.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^c26bc419]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — clinical features and epidemiology report that PBC typically affects middle‑aged women, with a female to male ratio as high as 10:1, but recently reported cohorts from Korea, Japan, China Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan show a female to male ratio of 3.9–6.2:1. Asymptomatic patients are increasingly diagnosed at an early disease stage mainly due to routine testing of liver biochemistry, especially in East Asia. In elderly asymptomatic PBC patients (≥ 55 years), mortality was similar to that of the age‑ and sex‑matched general population, yet if left undiagnosed or untreated, two thirds of asymptomatic patients will develop into the symptomatic phase within five years.

### Widespread gaps in the quality of care for primary biliary cholangitis in UK [^f98bd62c]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a progressive, autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease affecting approximately 15 000 individuals in the UK. Updated guidelines for the management of PBC were published by The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in 2017. We report on the first national, pilot audit that assesses the quality of care and adherence to guidelines.

Design

Data were collected from 11 National Health Service hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland between 2017 and 2020. Data on patient demographics, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) dosing and key guideline recommendations were captured from medical records. Results from each hospital were evaluated for target achievement and underwent χ² analysis for variation in performance between trusts.

Results

790 patients' medical records were reviewed. The data demonstrated that the majority of hospitals did not meet all of the recommended EASL standards. Standards with the lowest likelihood of being met were identified as optimal UDCA dosing, assessment of bone density and assessment of clinical symptoms (pruritus and fatigue). Significant variations in meeting these three standards were observed across UK, in addition to assessment of biochemical response to UDCA (all p < 0.0001) and assessment of transplant eligibility in high-risk patients (p = 0.0297).

Conclusion

Our findings identify a broad-based deficiency in 'real-world' PBC care, suggesting the need for an intervention to improve guideline adherence, ultimately improving patient outcomes. We developed the PBC Review tool and recommend its incorporation into clinical practice. As the first audit of its kind, it will be used to inform a future wide-scale reaudit.

### Management of symptom complexes in primary biliary cholangitis [^84ef9ae5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare autoimmune liver disease that increasingly is diagnosed at early stages of disease. Although survival has improved, a majority suffers from one or more symptom complexes associated with PBC. Much remains unknown about the mechanisms, significance, or effective treatment of these symptoms. The present review will outline the latest understanding and management of the most common symptoms of PBC.

Recent Findings

Patients rate fatigue as the most impactful on their quality of life, yet its specificity to PBC remains unsettled. Both central and peripheral nervous system mechanisms have been proposed, but remain enigmatic. Lysophosphatidic acid and G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 have emerged as potential targets for cholestatic-specific pathways of pruritus. Fibrates have also shown promise as a new class of antipruritic in cholestatic patients. PBC and Sjogren's syndrome share many demographic and histological features, but the clinical significance of their association is not well understood.

Summary

Common symptoms in PBC carry an increasing share of the disease burden as patients live longer, yet existing therapies are frequently ineffective or poorly tolerated. Targeted therapies may emerge as the molecular pathways of PBC-associated symptoms are unraveled.

Recommendation 27

We recommend that patients with suspected portal hypertension should be screened for gastro-oesophageal varices according to BSG guidelines. (Strong; Moderate)

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)

HE can be the cause of significant life quality impairment in patients with advanced disease but is relatively unusual in PBC (and should not be mistaken for the much commoner cognitive impairment associated with fatigue). Where present, HE in PBC characteristically affects older patients. The first-line management is with lactulose (at a dose achieving 2–3 soft stools per day). Some patients may require regular enemas in addition to lactulose. In any patient with HE, it is important to rule out secondary causes such as constipation, dehydration, infection and upper GI bleeding. For patients with refractory encephalopathy, rifaximin is frequently used and is now NICE approved. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that improves HE, reduces hospital admission rates due to HE and the incidence of recurrent HE. It must be remembered that patients with HE cannot drive.

Recommendation 20

We recommend all patients should be evaluated for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch. Clinicians should recognise that the severity of symptoms does not correlate with stage of disease. (Strong; Moderate)

Pruritus

Pruritus is one of the characteristic cholestatic symptoms in PBC and results in impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Approximately 80% of patients experience pruritus at some time during the course of their disease. It can occur at any stage of the disease process, but it is important to note that itch can improve as liver disease worsens. Patients with the ductopenic variant of PBC have particular problems with itch. Follow-up of patients and evaluation of change in pruritus and potential side effects is appropriate when changes are made in anti-pruritic therapy.

Bile duct obstruction must be excluded as the cause of pruritus, given the increased risk of gallstone disease in PBC, although in practice this distinction is rarely problematic. Bile sequestrants are used as first-line therapy but tolerability is often an issue with side effects including bloating and constipation. Cholestyramine is a non-absorbable resin that may help relieve pruritus. It is important to note that bile sequestrants must be given 2–4 hours before or after other medications (in particular UDCA) as they interfere with intestinal absorption. Patient education is important here (by clinicians and pharmacists) to avoid drug interactions. There is limited evidence to suggest that UDCA has any effect on pruritus. Colesevelam is a newer, often better tolerated, bile sequestrant which may have a role in management given the better side effect profile compared with cholestyramine. Despite clinicians describing anecdotal experience of benefit, and significant decreases in serum bile acid levels, a recent placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate effectiveness.

### Definition and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis and an incomplete response to therapy [^c5c316fa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an immune-mediated chronic liver disease characterized by biliary epithelial injury, cholestasis, and progressive fibrosis that can lead to cirrhosis and requirement for liver transplantation. All patients with PBC should receive initial treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and odds for response are based on characteristics at baseline. It is important to have clear definitions of patients at risk for a poor response to therapy, of biochemical markers of an incomplete response, and standardized management. Patients typically are assessed after 12 months of treatment with UDCA for biochemical markers of response. However, evaluation at 6 months has been proposed for patients with more severe disease or symptoms (such as pruritus or fatigue). Markers of response to therapy include reduced serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin (Paris-2, Toronto, GLOBE, and so forth); patients with high levels of total and conjugated bilirubin or levels of alkaline phosphatase more than 1.5-fold the upper limit of normal should be considered for second-line therapy. Patients with adequate biochemical responses can continue UDCA monotherapy. Incomplete responders should be considered for second-line therapies with obeticholic acid (licensed) or fibrates (unlicensed) in addition to continued treatment with UDCA. Patients with PBC should be followed up for life.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^ca25df2a]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

APASL PBC guidance — Liver transplantation indications and outcomes: Liver transplantation (LT) should be considered in PBC patients with decompensated cirrhosis (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, or hepatic encephalopathy), with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score > 15, or with a Mayo Risk Score > 7.8, and severe intractable pruritus that heavily compromises the HRQoL is an exceptional indication. Long-term outcomes are favorable with a 5-year survival rate of 80–85%, while post-transplant recurrence occurs approximately in 22%, 21–37%, and 40% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively, with a median time range of 3–6.9 years; diagnosis relies on histology and biochemical abnormalities since AMA may remain positive after LT even without recurrence.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^33cb7658]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, which when untreated will culminate in end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of serum liver tests indicative of a cholestatic hepatitis in association with circulating antimitochondrial antibodies. Patient presentation and course can be diverse and risk stratification is important to ensure all patients receive a personalised approach to their care. The goals of treatment and management are the prevention of end-stage liver disease, and the amelioration of associated symptoms. Pharmacologic approaches in practice, to reduce the impact of the progressive nature of disease, currently include licensed therapies (ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid) and off-label therapies (fibric acid derivatives, budesonide). These clinical practice guidelines summarise the evidence for the importance of a structured, life-long and individualised, approach to the care of patients with PBC, providing a framework to help clinicians diagnose and effectively manage patients.

### The treatment of primary biliary cholangitis: time for personalized medicine [^198d07cc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary Biliary Cholangitis is an autoimmune liver disease distinguished by Anti-mitochondrial Antibodies and chronic non-suppurative lymphocytic microcholangitis. UDCA remains the exclusively recommended initial therapy for PBC. However, 40% of patients experience either incomplete biochemical response or intolerance to UDCA, which represents poorer outcomes and increased mortality. Therefore, early identification of high-risk patients and timely intensive treatments are necessary to delay the progression of PBC and better improve the prognosis. Intensive therapeutic strategies based on more stringent treatment goals and early efficacy assessment criteria are elaborated in this review. To exclude AIH-PBC overlap syndrome, liver biopsy is required for cholestasis patients with negative AMAs or PBC patients who respond inadequately to UDCA, especially those with elevated ALT and IgG. Combined immunosuppressants are considered for patients with moderate-to-severe hepatitis. ALP normalization is considered the improved therapeutic goal for high-risk patients, which has been verified achievable in multiple treatment attempts. The control of pruritus and fatigue constitutes the key therapeutic targets in the symptom management of PBC. Bezafibrate, Seladelpar, and IBAT inhibitors have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in pruritus. Last but not least, Liver Stiffness Measurement is substantiated as efficient in the fibrotic monitoring of PBC patients. OCA and fibrates are respectively useful for compensated and decompensated fibrotic patients. Moreover, the conventional efficacy assessment procedure, which is the "wait-to-fail" strategy, exhibits suboptimal sensitivity in the timely detection of treatment-responsive patients. Therefore, early prediction and evaluation criteria at baseline and 1-month treatment will help in timely interventions for patients with insufficient efficacy. This improved identification strategy is expected to provide precise and personalized treatment for PBC patients.

### Use of bezafibrate in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis… [^cf1a4f85]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Use of Bezafibrate in Patients With Primary Biliary Cirrhosis to Archive Complete Biochemical Response in Non-respondersClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview The primary biliary cholangitis, formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, treatment is based in the use of ursodeoxycholic acid at a daily dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg, without other treatment options. Patients with good or complete response to UDCA have more liver transplant-free survival and delay histologic progression compared to patients with partial or no response. Nowadays there is an estimated partial response to UDCA in approximately 30 to 50% of patients with PBC. There is a need for new second line management strategies for patients without a biochemical response to UDCA. The addition of bezafibrate to the treatment of PBC patients with partial biochemical response to UDCA, will increase the biochemical response and improve the long term prognosis.

And if so, which are the efficacy and security of bezafibrate in PBC patients without biochemical response. There are case reports and pilot studies in patients with primary biliary cholangitis In the literature in which the effect of fibrates on the improvement of biochemical cholestasis have been seen, however the clinical benefit has not been reported and likewise the response criteria used in previous studies is very heterogeneous. In previous studies, bezafibrate has been proved to be a secure drug in this patients, with few adverse events, also it is an economic and of easy access drug. For all this the investigators intent to study the utility of bezafibrate as an additional treatment in PBC patients without response to UDCA.

This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to enroll a total of 34 patients with diagnosis of PBC without a complete response to the use of UDCA for more than a year, then the participants will be divided by randomization to receive bezafibrate or placebo, resulting in a total of two groups of 17 patients each. Both groups will be followed every 3 months for a total of 1 year with clinical and laboratory follow-up to determine the efficacy and security of the treatment. The investigators will measure all the laboratory variables related to the disease and possible adverse effects of the use of fibrates, also the investigators will measure the quality of life variables, and determine the fibrosis stage at the beginning and end of the study by non-invasive methods.

The study is directed to patients with PBC diagnosis who have had management with standard UDCA dose for at least 6 months and had not reached complete biochemical response, defined by Paris II criteria. The dose of fibrate to use will be bezafibrate 200 mg every 12 hours or placebo every 12 hours for 12 months, both having the exact characteristics to avoid their recognition. Patients will continue the administration of UDCA at the same dose at enrollment. The intervention will be for a period of 12 months, with a follow-up every 3 months completing 5 medical follow-up visits. Drug: Bezafibrate Drug: Ursodeoxycholic Acid Drug: Placebo

### Development of a question prompt list for people living with primary biliary cholangitis: a Delphi study [^bc65c038]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Clinical practice guidelines support caregivers to manage liver diseases. However, people with lifelong conditions often lack guidance to understand what aspects of care are most important and how their disease should be managed. This study aimed to create a question prompt list (QPL) for individuals with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) including key questions (directed) to their treating physician that are most likely to improve their outcome.

Methods

International PBC professionals including patient representatives rated and ranked questions related to 9 aspects of PBC care. Questions rated by > 70% as moderately/very important were considered best candidate questions (BCQs) for the QPL. Results of the survey were discussed during 2 in-person meetings, upon which the questions and/or QPL were amended.

Results

Based on 108 respondents, 11 of 43 questions were considered BCQs. After 2 in-person meetings (64 attendees), the final QPL contained 8 questions and was unanimously approved by 19 members of the study team during the consensus meeting. The included questions referred to the risk of disease progression, presence of cirrhosis, need of second-line therapy, need of repeated liver stiffness measurements, bone health, and availability of patient information and support. Two BCQs addressing options to manage pruritus and fatigue were combined on the QPL. In addition, one question regarding first-line therapy was included despite being rated as moderately/very important by 68.5%.

Conclusions

The PBC patient question prompt list serves as a user-facing document, to enhance the patient experience, and drive value-based healthcare in routine clinical practice.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) management — lifestyle risks and counseling: smoking has been implicated in development and progression, alcohol intake (> 20 g/d) may contribute to progression, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with body mass index ≥ 25 has been associated with more severe biliary injury; lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, alcohol abstinence, and body weight reduction are justified, and Recommendation: 2. In the context of the negative impacts of cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and obesity on human health, PBC patients should be encouraged to quit smoking, stop alcohol drinking, and keep on ideal body weight.

Recommendation 28

We recommend that ascites and hepatic encephalopathy should be treated as in standard practice. (Strong; Moderate)

Transplantation

Liver transplantation is an established and successful procedure that prolongs the life of patients with chronic liver disease and, in certain settings, improves their QoL as well. PBC was among the very early indications for liver transplantation and remains a strong disease indication for surgery. Liver transplantation, however, remains a challenging procedure and, in most settings, organ availability has a significant impact on determining the precise timing and indications for surgery.

In the UK, patients should have a clear indication for transplantation as well as, usually, a UKELD score of 49 or greater (ie, meet minimal listing criteria based on a biochemical marker of disease severity calculated using the latest bilirubin, INR, creatinine and sodium). Patients with certain variant indications are eligible for listing for transplantation in the absence of an elevated UKELD score, and for patients with PBC this may be relevant (pruritus in particular).

The UKELD score is effective in risk stratification in the context of transplantation and most UK patients are listed for transplantation based on an elevated UKELD score with accompanying liver failure/end-stage liver disease (jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, sarcopenia, HCC) that is not responsive to medical therapy. Fatigue in isolation is not an indication for transplantation. Intractable pruritus unresponsive to medical therapy is an indication for transplantation with good outcomes in terms of pruritus.

In practice it is optimal to ensure patients who may be potentially eligible for transplantation are referred early and/or discussed with centres linked to transplant programmes because this facilitates ready access to transplant services. In practice, in view of the varied nature and timescale for overt decompensation, clinicians should actively consider whether transplantation is the best treatment in any patient with advanced PBC as evidenced by a UKELD score > 49, jaundice, portal hypertension or signs of early decompensation (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, sarcopenia).

Evidence levels (as per Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system)

The recommendations are based on the GRADE classification system (Strong/Weak; quality of evidence: High/Moderate/Low/Very low).

GRADE classifies recommendations as strong or weak. Strength of recommendation is determined by the balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, quality of evidence, variability in values and preferences, and resource use. The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted. The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted. The higher the costs of an intervention — that is, the greater the resources consumed — the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. Strong recommendations mean that most informed patients would choose the recommended management and that clinicians can structure their interactions with patients accordingly. Weak recommendations mean that patients' choices will vary according to their values and preferences, and clinicians must ensure that patients' care is in keeping with their values and preferences.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) pathogenesis — PBC is complex and is thought to be caused by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors; exposure to PDC-E2 initiates innate and adaptive immune responses that target biliary epithelial cells and cause inflammation, and injured cholangiocytes with dysfunctional anion exchanger 2 (AE2) are sensitive to apoptosis and senescence, ultimately leading to cholestasis and liver fibrosis.

Background

Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease involving the autoimmune-mediated destruction of biliary epithelial cells. PBC is a progressive disorder, and may ultimately result in hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and decompensated liver disease. Patients are frequently asymptomatic from the disorder for a period of years or even decades. If symptoms do eventually develop, they are most commonly pruritus and fatigue and less commonly jaundice or abdominal pain. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the preferred, first-line pharmacologic agent for treatment of PBC and is indicated in all patients with the disorder. UDCA is administered at a dose of 13–15 mg/kg/day, typically divided into 2–4 doses per day. The medication is generally well tolerated and, when used for PBC, the only true contraindication is hypersensitivity. In the absence of UDCA pharmacotherapy, the median survival for patients with PBC ranges from 5 to 8 years from the onset of symptoms. Treatment with UDCA has been consistently shown to improve biochemical indices, delay histologic progression, delay development of esophageal varices, and improve transplant-free survival in patients with PBC.

Biochemical non-response at one year of UDCA (Paris-II not fulfilled) significantly increased future HCC risk. Close monitoring of HCC is strongly recommended for males, patients with advanced-stage disease, and non-responders to UDCA (II, 2).

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) tolerability and adjunctive considerations note minimal side effects and general tolerability, with a 5-pound weight gain over the first year reported and not progressive; loose stools and/or thinning of the hair have also been reported infrequently. For suboptimal response, issues of adherence, superimposed liver disease including fatty liver, and coadministration with bile sequestrants such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevalam should be considered. UDCA use has been associated with reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, a reduced risk of developing varices, and slower histologic progression, but it does not improve fatigue, pruritus, associated bone disease, or autoimmune features found in association with primary biliary cholangitis.

### Fatigue in primary biliary cirrhosis [^126cf6c3]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic, autoimmune, cholestatic liver disease with a slowly progressive course. Without treatment, most patients eventually develop fibrosis of the liver and may need liver transplantation in the late stage of disease. Fatigue and pruritus are the most common symptoms of PBC, but the majority of patients are asymptomatic at first presentation. There is no specific treatment for fatigue in PBC, but modafinil has shown some potential beneficial effects, such as increased energy levels and decreased total sleep time. This Review article discusses the natural history and the measurement of fatigue in patients with PBC. The central and the peripheral mechanisms that have been suggested for the pathogenesis of fatigue in PBC are also discussed and treatment options are reviewed.

Criteria of biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in primary biliary cholangitis — about 30–40% of patients have insufficient biochemical responses and remain at risk for progression; multiple criteria have been proposed to stratify risk and identify those needing second-line therapy, with Paris I (advanced PBC, stage III–IV) and Paris II (early PBC, stage I–II) being well-validated and widely used. Two continuous scoring systems, the GLOBE score and the UK-PBC score, have been proposed from multicenter cohorts, provide more accurate and individualized survival information than existing models, and have been validated internationally with excellent prognostic performance. Most studies indicate alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin are the two most important variables in evaluating UDCA response.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) features — treatment approaches and recommendation: Patients with PBC with AIH features have poorer outcomes than those with AIH or PBC alone, and for these patients two therapeutic approaches could be considered; one is to treat the patients with UDCA for 3–6 months and add immunosuppressive therapy if the AIH is not controlled (with combination therapy with UDCA recommended for those who need immunosuppression), and the other is to administer immunosuppressives and UDCA simultaneously if the evidence for PBC with AIH features is strong. Studies showed that corticosteroids with or without azathioprine, or second-line immunosuppressants (i.e., mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and cyclosporins A) added to UDCA is useful to increase the response rates and improve the prognosis. Recommendation 21 states: Immunosuppressive agents (including corticosteroid with or without azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) could be used as add-on therapy to UDCA, or de novo combination therapy with UDCA.

Stratification of future risk and prognostic scoring systems

PBC is primarily a biliary disease, so when signs of failure of hepatocyte function develop, such as coagulopathy (not corrected by vitamin K) or jaundice, these usually indicate advanced and typically irreversible disease (assuming there is no additional reversible element such as drug injury). There are no symptoms present in patients with purely compensated disease which correlate with outcome (neither fatigue nor pruritus correlate with the severity of disease as judged by serum bilirubin or the Mayo risk score; indeed, pruritus frequently diminishes as the disease progresses). In one report of development of advanced disease features in 770 patients, ascites was present in 20% and bleeding varices in 10.5% after 10 years of follow-up. The outlook for patients who develop these complications is worse, and new portal hypertension complicated by ascites is an indicator of poor short-term prognosis. In 143 patients who first developed ascites or peripheral oedema, the mean time to death was 3.1 years. Once a patient develops jaundice, the natural history of disease in the absence of treatment is more predictable, with the degree of bilirubin elevation correlating strongly with survival. The liver insufficiency phase is characterised by worsening jaundice and is typically pre-terminal: mean survival once the bilirubin is 34 μmol/L is 4 years, and when the bilirubin reaches 102 μmol/L mean survival is only 2 years. This underpins the concept of thinking about liver transplantation once a patient has a bilirubin level > 50 μmol/L and, if otherwise appropriate, listing for liver transplantation when bilirubin is > 100 μmol/L. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), when it occurs, is usually during this phase. As with pruritus, ALP and cholesterol may all paradoxically improve in the pre-terminal stage. The introduction of UDCA therapy, which was demonstrated in early studies to reduce serum bilirubin concentrations, has been shown not to invalidate either the absolute serum bilirubin or the Mayo risk score as prognostic markers.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — pruritus management includes first- and second-line therapy and emerging options. It is recommended that cholestyramine (4–16 g/day) as the first-line therapy for pruritus, and to avoid interference with absorption, other medications including ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) should be taken at least 1 h before or 4 to 6 h after taking cholestyramine. Rifampicin (150–300 mg twice a day) can be used as second-line therapy for pruritus with close monitoring of side effects, and rifampicin could cause severe liver injury, hemolytic anemia, and renal damage and affect the metabolism and activity of other drugs. Additional notes include that nalfurafine hydrochloride, a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist, has been approved for intractable pruritus in patients with PBC in Japan. The ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor linerixibat is being evaluated for intractable pruritus; in a phase 2a study, 14 days of linerixibat treatment could reduce the pruritus severity, confirmed by an international phase 2b trial, and it is generally well tolerated although mild to moderate diarrhea occurred.

### Clinical management of primary biliary cholangitis-strategies and evolving trends [^b0511dab]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

PBC is a chronic progressive autoimmune disorder involving the destruction of intrahepatic small bile ducts, cholestasis, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis if left untreated. It is largely driven by the autoimmune response, but bile acids and the intestinal microbiota are implicated in disease progression as well. The only drugs licensed for PBC are UDCA and OCA. UDCA as a first-line and OCA as a second-line therapy are safe and effective, but the lack of response in a significant portion of patients and inadequate control of symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus remain as concerns. Liver transplantation is an end-stage therapy for many patients refractory to UDCA, which gives excellent survival rates but also moderate to high recurrence rates. The limited options for FDA-approved PBC therapies necessitate the development of alternative approaches. Currently, a wide variety of experimental drugs exist targeting immunological and physiological aspects of PBC to suppress inflammation. Immunological therapies include drugs targeting immune molecules in the B cell and T cell response, and specific cytokines and chemokines implicated in inflammation. Drugs targeting bile acids are also noteworthy as bile acids can perpetuate hepatic inflammation and lead to fibrosis over time. These include FXR agonists, ASBT inhibitors, and PPAR agonists such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate. Nonetheless, many of these drugs can only delay disease progression and fail to enhance patients' quality of life. Nanomedicine shows great potential for treatment of autoimmune diseases, as it provides a new approach that focuses on tolerance induction rather than immunosuppression. Tolerogenic nanoparticles carrying immune-modifying agents can be engineered to safely and effectively target the antigen-specific immune response in autoimmune diseases. These may work well with PBC especially, given the anatomical features and immunological specificity of the disease. Nanobiological therapy is thus an area of highly promising research for future treatment of PBC.

INTRODUCTION

People living with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) frequently have impaired quality and quantity of life, resulting from a chronic autoimmune-mediated, cholestatic, and fibrosing liver injury. PBC is a rare, progressive in nature, and usually female-predominant liver disease. Cholestatic liver injury is characterized by variable rates of immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts accompanied by portal inflammation. – Bile duct loss (ductopenia) leads to cholestasis and hepatocellular injury and a progressive liver injury with fibrosis, end-stage liver disease, and, ultimately, liver failure.– Independent of disease stage, many people living with PBC experience significant impairment to quality of life, particularly from fatigue and pruritus.

Histologic damage characterized by a granulomatous lymphocytic cholangitis is associated with abnormal serum liver tests, including elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), aminotransferase activity, and total bilirubin. These biochemical indices of disease correlate with disease severity, treatment efficacy, and outcomes. – Elevated ALP and total bilirubin [1.67× upper limit of normal (ULN) and 1×ULN, respectively] have been incorporated into clinical end points because they serve as surrogates of disease activity related to risk for disease progression that are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Recent analyses demonstrating that outcomes for patients are improved with normal ALP and total bilirubin emphasize the importance of normalizing serum liver tests. Treatment of PBC focuses on initial use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) followed by add-on therapy with the conditionally approved farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist obeticholic acid or off-label fibrates, such as bezafibrate, in patients not having a satisfactory biochemical response. There is no approved therapy for fatigue, and pruritus is managed with limited success. Obeticholic acid and other FXR agonists have been noted to exacerbate pruritus in some patients.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) — vitamin D deficiency and osteoporosis guidance addresses screening, supplementation, and pharmacotherapy. EASL nutritional guidelines recommend supplement vitamin D orally in cirrhotic patients with vitamin D levels < 20 ng/ ml, to reach serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) ≥ 30 ng/ml, and for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women sufficient calcium (1000–1500 mg/day) and vitamin D (1000 IU/day) in the diet or as supplements are recommended if they have no history of renal stones. It is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for serum vitamin D status and it is recommended that all PBC patients should be evaluated for osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women. The risk fracture in PBC patients is two times higher than that in the health population, and supplements of calcium and vitamin D are recommended with particular care in patients with a history of renal stones. Bisphosphonates are generally well-tolerated, with potential side effects including gastroesophageal irritation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal pain, and atrial fibrillation, and are not recommended for people with severe impairment of renal function or hypocalcemia; people with specific problems of the esophagus may not be able to take the oral tablets. Evidence for fracture prevention includes a recent randomized clinical trial showing that either weekly alendronate or monthly ibandronate treatment could improve bone mass in patients with PBC; however, hormone replacement therapy in women with PBC is not supported by reliable evidence, and a report confirmed the efficacy and safety of denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, for osteoporosis in patients with PBC.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) diagnosis — initial suspicion and confirmation — states that "The diagnosis of PBC should be suspected in the setting of chronic cholestasis after exclusion of other causes of liver disease, particularly in a middle-aged female with an unexplained elevation of serum ALP", and "The diagnosis is largely confirmed with tests for AMA"; "A liver biopsy can be used to further substantiate the diagnosis but is rarely needed".

Primary biliary cholangitis histologic scoring — Nakanuma et al. proposed new histological assessment criteria for PBC that consist of both grading (cholangitis activity and hepatitis activity) and staging (scoring of fibrosis, bile duct loss, and deposition of orcein-positive granules), and these novel criteria could stratify the risk for PBC progression and outcomes. More recently, PML expression was found highly specific for histological diagnosis of PBC and could be used to discriminate PBC from other liver diseases including small-duct PSC.

Recommendation 9

We suggest that at baseline it is reasonable to screen all patients with PBC for celiac, thyroid disease and Sjögren's syndrome. During follow-up, patients should be monitored clinically, and we suggest testing considered for the development of associated autoimmune conditions including celiac, thyroid disease and Sjögren's syndrome based on clinical need.

Introduction

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a rare chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease characterised by ductopenia, cholestasis and biliary fibrosis resulting in end-stage liver disease and associated complications. The global prevalence of PBC is estimated to range from 1.9 to 40.2 per 100 000 individuals. Diagnosis is typically made between 55 and 65 years of age, and women are disproportionately affected with a female-to-male ratio of up to 9:1.

Pruritus is one of the most common conditions associated with PBC, affecting approximately 50% of patients at any given point after diagnosis and up to 75% of patients over the course of the disease. Other conditions associated with PBC include extrahepatic autoimmune diseases, as well as symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bone and joint pain, restless legs syndrome and cognitive dysfunction. The burden associated with PBC may be further compounded by pruritus, which has a profoundly negative impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of affected patients. Pruritus is also associated with sleep disturbance, fatigue and depression, and suicidal ideation.

The recommended first-line therapy for patients with PBC, for which treatment is usually life-long, is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Treatment can improve prognosisand reduce mortality, but does not improve fatigue or alleviate pruritus. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is approved and recommended as second-line therapy for PBC either alone (for those who are unable to tolerate UDCA) or in combination with UDCA (for those without a sufficient response to UDCA). However, pruritus is the most commonly reported adverse effect with OCA, and has been included as a warning and precaution in the prescribing information by the US Food and Drug Administration.

The only treatment for cholestatic pruritus with a specific indication is the bile-acid sequestrant cholestyramine. However, cholestyramine interferes with the absorption of other medications, including UDCA or OCA. It also has several gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability issues. Treatment options for pruritus that are used off-label include rifampicin, fibrates, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline), opiate antagonists (eg, naltrexone) and antihistamines (primarily for their sedative properties). However, these treatments have limited efficacy.

Regarding medical management for primary biliary cholangitis, more specifically with respect to setting of care, BSG 2018 guidelines recommend to consider providing hospital-led care in patients with any of the following:

- UDCA non-responsive disease

- advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis

- features of portal hypertension

- complex symptoms.

How should patients with PBC be managed?

The care of patients with PBC encompasses many aspects addressing disease progression and symptom control (figure 1).

Drug therapy to prevent disease progression

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)

Oral UDCA has been studied widely and discussed in depth with regard to its efficacy. The use of UDCA is recommended for all patients with PBC by AASLD and EASL, as well as in this guideline. A number of other agents have been studied including immunosuppressants, but reproducible and/or consistent evidence of benefit has been universally lacking. Prior studies of failed alternative therapies are not reviewed here in detail.

UDCA normally accounts for about 4% of bile acids, but with pharmacotherapy it becomes the predominant bile acid. Several studies have confirmed a correlation between the degree of bile enrichment and improvement in liver biochemistry. Overall, the data suggest that the optimum dose is 13–15 mg/kg per day, which can be given as a single oral daily dose or in divided doses if tolerability is an issue. When evaluating the UDCA trial data, note must be taken of the treatment dose used because some earlier studies applied lower than optimal treatment paradigms. In PBC, a dose of 13–15 mg/kg/day has been shown to be superior to 5–7 mg/kg/day or 23–25 mg/kg/day. UDCA at the recommended dose is very safe with minimal side effects (weight gain of ~3 kg in the first 12 months, hair loss and, rarely, diarrhoea and flatulence are reported). There are no data to suggest that UDCA is teratogenic. Evidence-based advice over use in pregnancy is lacking, but expert clinical practice generally includes safe use before and during the first trimester; a good safety profile exists from its use in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.

### Home-based exercise in patients with refractory fatigue associated with primary biliary cholangitis: a protocol for the EXerCise intervention in cholesTatic livEr disease (EXCITED) feasibility trial [^e69350b2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Access to healthcare professionals appears to reduce self-reported fatigue and positively influence the attitudes towards exercise and the long-term benefits on overall QoL. Moreover, home-based exercise programmes (HBEPs) performed at moderate intensity (rate of perceived exertion (RPE) 12–14) have been shown to be safe and improve functional capacity in patients with end-stage liver disease. However, there are no studies that explore the feasibility and efficacy of a moderate-intensity HBEP on improving fatigue or functional capacity in patients with PBC.

Prior to performing a dedicated randomised controlled trial (RCT), a pilot feasibility study is required to determine whether intervention can be conducted within patients' homes, determine whether a larger programme is possible and highlight preferential design features. To this effect, our aim is to conduct a single-centre trial of a structured HBEP, which attenuates fatigue associated with PBC. Efficacy assessment will be through validated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures, and fatigue-specific and functionality assessment tools.
