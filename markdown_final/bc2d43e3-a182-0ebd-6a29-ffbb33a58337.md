## Question

What are the specific indications for bisphosphonate therapy in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the specific indications for bisphosphonate therapy in patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what an elevated alkaline phosphatase actually implies and how to confirm a bone source. Then, I should verify the major disease contexts where bisphosphonates are indicated and how ALP guides treatment. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence and guideline positions, including any treat-to-target controversies. After that, I need to check dosing choices and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, contraindications, and when not to use bisphosphonates despite elevated ALP, before summarizing a practical decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the clinical meaning of an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Total ALP reflects bone formation and is commonly used as a first-line biochemical screen for metabolically active Paget's disease of bone, but I need to ensure I exclude hepatic or biliary sources with liver function tests before attributing it to bone turnover, because otherwise I might misdirect therapy [^9e2d18bd] [^ad5fe6fe]. Hold on, I should verify that ALP correlates with disease extent and treatment response; yes, in Paget's disease, ALP correlates with skeletal involvement and the likelihood of achieving biochemical remission with potent bisphosphonates, which supports its use as a disease activity marker in that context [^ad5fe6fe].

> Next, I should review the primary indication: Paget's disease of bone. I need to ensure I'm precise about thresholds and scope. FDA labeling for alendronate and zoledronic acid indicates treatment in Paget's disease when ALP is at least two times the upper limit of normal, or when patients are symptomatic, or at risk for complications, which operationalizes ALP elevation as a treatment trigger alongside clinical risk [^6efd8056] [^099565e3]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence; randomized trials and meta-analyses show bisphosphonates reduce ALP and improve pain compared with placebo, with nitrogen-containing agents outperforming non–nitrogen-containing ones, and zoledronic acid achieving faster, more complete, and more durable biochemical responses than risedronate, including 96% therapeutic response and 89% ALP normalization at 6 months in pooled trials [^a5c040c5] [^10f6e541] [^c0e4de43].

> I will now examine the treat-to-target controversy, because elevated ALP alone can tempt a strategy of normalizing markers. The PRISM randomized trial compared intensive bisphosphonate therapy aimed at normalizing ALP versus symptom-driven management and found no differences in fractures, orthopedic procedures, quality of life, or pain, despite lower ALP in the intensive arm, so I should not assume that forcing ALP into the normal range improves hard outcomes [^530d221c] [^634b444d]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; guidelines align with symptom-focused care rather than a treat-to-target approach, emphasizing that ALP is useful for diagnosis and monitoring but should not be the sole determinant of treatment intensity [^9e2d18bd] [^5db47068].

> Let me consider dosing and agent selection. I should confirm first-line therapy. Guidelines and head-to-head data support zoledronic acid 5 mg IV once as the preferred agent for most patients without contraindications, given superior and more sustained biochemical suppression, with 88–89% ALP normalization at 6 months and durable remissions in many patients for years, while oral options like risedronate 30 mg daily for 2 months or alendronate 40 mg daily for 6 months are reasonable alternatives when IV therapy is not feasible or contraindicated [^40e1dd4a] [^10f6e541] [^c0e4de43] [^be3d00f5] [^3e9b4ccb]. I should double-check that ALP response is a valid efficacy endpoint; yes, regulatory trials and reviews consistently use ALP normalization or large reductions as primary outcomes in Paget's disease, reflecting suppression of pathologic bone turnover [^3e9b4ccb] [^508b3144].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. Wait, I initially thought to recheck ALP at 2–3 months, but I should correct that; while resorption markers like βCTX drop within 10 days, total ALP reaches a nadir at about 2–3 months, so measuring ALP at 3–6 months is appropriate to assess initial response, with earlier resorption markers if rapid feedback is needed in active disease [^c20e93a0]. I need to ensure calcium and vitamin D status are optimized to mitigate hypocalcemia risk, especially with potent IV bisphosphonates, and I should plan retreatment only if symptoms recur or ALP rises significantly from nadir, recognizing that clinical relapse can occur without biochemical relapse and vice versa [^aadc4b4d] [^8d9b25eb].

> But wait, what if the elevated ALP is not from Paget's disease? I should confirm the differential. Elevated ALP can also signal primary hyperparathyroidism, metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, vitamin D deficiency, liver disease, or hypophosphatasia, and bisphosphonates are not indicated solely for an unexplained ALP elevation without a compatible diagnosis, so I must tailor therapy to the underlying condition rather than the marker itself [^81a6e251] [^8fd13b2a]. Hold on, I should verify a key pitfall: in hypophosphatasia, bisphosphonates are generally contraindicated because they can worsen impaired mineralization, so a low or inappropriately normal ALP in the right clinical context should prompt me to avoid bisphosphonates rather than use them [^9768d062] [^2dbf8c7d].

> I need to check special scenarios where elevated ALP still guides care. In patients with active Paget's disease who require surgery on pagetic bone, preoperative bisphosphonate therapy is suggested to reduce bone vascularity and potentially decrease intraoperative bleeding, even though high-quality randomized data are limited and observational results are mixed, so I should individualize this decision and coordinate with surgery [^d249ff30] [^e239710d]. Let me reconsider whether asymptomatic patients with elevated ALP should be treated; guidelines allow treatment of active disease at high-risk sites even if asymptomatic, but emphasize that evidence for preventing long-term complications is limited, so shared decision-making is essential [^9e2d18bd] [^532f9489].

> I should confirm safety and contraindications before prescribing. Hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to therapy, renal function should be assessed because zoledronic acid is contraindicated in significant renal impairment, and patients should have a dental examination and preventive dentistry before IV bisphosphonates to mitigate osteonecrosis of the jaw risk, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation routinely recommended during therapy [^aadc4b4d] [^099565e3] [^29a0eaed]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost overlooked acute phase reactions; transient flu-like symptoms are common after the first nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate dose, so I should counsel patients and consider premedication strategies when appropriate [^b44ad48a].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. If ALP is elevated, I should first confirm a bone source and establish a diagnosis, with Paget's disease, metastatic bone disease, and hyperparathyroidism high on the list depending on context. In confirmed Paget's disease, I should treat if ALP is at least two times the upper limit of normal, or if the patient is symptomatic or at risk for complications, using zoledronic acid 5 mg IV once when not contraindicated and monitoring ALP at 3–6 months, with retreatment guided by symptoms and biochemical trends rather than a rigid treat-to-target strategy. If Paget's is excluded, I should treat the underlying condition and avoid bisphosphonates unless there is a separate indication such as osteoporosis or malignancy-related bone disease, and I should never use bisphosphonates for unexplained ALP elevation alone [^6efd8056] [^099565e3] [^9e2d18bd] [^81a6e251].

Bisphosphonates are indicated for elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) when it reflects **active Paget's disease of bone** [^6efd8056] (ALP ≥ 2× ULN or symptomatic/asymptomatic with high-risk sites) [^8e32186c] or **metastatic bone disease** [^9bc3dca9] (e.g. breast, prostate, multiple myeloma) with elevated bone turnover markers [^cf4e3768]. They are not indicated for isolated ALP elevation from liver disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, or other non-bone sources. Zoledronic acid is **first-line for Paget's** [^40e1dd4a] due to superior and sustained ALP suppression [^10f6e541]; monitor ALP at 3–6 months [^c20e93a0] and retreat if symptoms recur or ALP rises [^5db47068]. Bisphosphonates are contraindicated in hypocalcemia, severe renal impairment, and pregnancy; correct calcium/vitamin D and perform dental care before therapy [^aadc4b4d] [^29a0eaed].

## Indications for bisphosphonate therapy in elevated ALP

### Paget's disease of bone (PDB)

- **Definition**: PDB is characterized by disorganized bone remodeling with elevated ALP reflecting increased bone turnover [^79b2f217].

- **Indications**: Treat when ALP is ≥ 2× ULN [^6efd8056], or when patients are symptomatic (bone pain, deformity, neurological symptoms) [^69e8d620], or at risk of complications (weight-bearing bones, skull, vertebrae, upcoming surgery) [^b44ad48a].

- **First-line therapy**: Zoledronic acid 5 mg IV once [^40e1dd4a] achieves rapid, sustained ALP normalization and symptom control [^10f6e541] [^c0e4de43].

- **Monitoring**: Recheck ALP at 3–6 months [^c20e93a0]; retreat if symptoms recur or ALP rises [^5db47068].

---

### Metastatic bone disease

In metastatic bone disease, **indications** include solid tumors (breast, prostate, lung) and multiple myeloma with elevated ALP and bone turnover markers [^cf4e3768]. Bisphosphonates reduce skeletal-related events and bone pain [^0aa29491]. Zoledronic acid or denosumab are standard options [^5348b853]; monitor renal function and consider denosumab if renal impairment limits bisphosphonate use [^5348b853].

---

### Hypercalcemia of malignancy

For hypercalcemia of malignancy, **indications** include elevated ALP from increased bone resorption. Bisphosphonates lower calcium and relieve symptoms [^0aa29491]. Zoledronic acid 4–8 mg IV is preferred for rapid, durable correction.

---

## Conditions where elevated ALP does not indicate bisphosphonate therapy

| **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Liver disease (cholestasis, hepatitis) | ALP elevation is hepatobiliary, not bone-derived [^notfound] |
| Primary hyperparathyroidism | ALP may be elevated, but bisphosphonates do not address the underlying pathology [^notfound] |
| Growth spurts in children | Physiological ALP elevation from bone growth [^notfound] |
| Vitamin D deficiency | Secondary hyperparathyroidism elevates ALP; treat deficiency first [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Paget's disease**: Treat symptomatic patients or those with ALP ≥ 2× ULN [^6efd8056]; zoledronic acid is first-line [^40e1dd4a] [^54f0c93e].

- **Metastatic bone disease**: Use bisphosphonates to reduce skeletal-related events and pain [^0aa29491] [^5348b853].

- **Hypercalcemia of malignancy**: Bisphosphonates are standard therapy [^0aa29491].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **ALP at 3–6 months** [^c20e93a0] to assess response and guide retreatment [^5db47068]. Also assess calcium and vitamin D status, renal function, and dental health before and during therapy [^aadc4b4d] [^29a0eaed].

---

## Potential risks and contraindications

- **Hypocalcemia**: Correct before therapy; monitor during treatment [^aadc4b4d].

- **Renal impairment**: Use cautiously; adjust dose or choose denosumab if severe [^1a8b6caf] [^5348b853].

- **Osteonecrosis of the jaw**: Risk increases with prolonged therapy; maintain oral hygiene and avoid invasive dental work [^8296fa40].

- **Atypical femur fractures**: Rare but serious; reassess risk with long-term use [^notfound].

---

Bisphosphonates are indicated for elevated ALP when it reflects **active bone turnover** in Paget's disease, metastatic bone disease, or hypercalcemia of malignancy. They are not indicated for non-bone sources of ALP. Zoledronic acid is **first-line for Paget's** [^40e1dd4a]; monitor ALP and clinical response, and manage risks.

Background

Bisphosphonates are considered to be the treatment of choice for people with Paget's disease of bone. However, the effects of bisphosphonates on patient-centred outcomes have not been extensively studied. There are insufficient data to determine whether reducing and maintaining biochemical markers of bone turnover to within the normal range improves quality of life and reduces the risk of complications.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of bisphosphonates for adult patients with Paget's disease of bone.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ISI Web of Knowledge and trials registers up to March 2017. We searched regulatory agency published information for rare adverse events.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of bisphosphonates as treatment for Paget's disease in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed studies for risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 20 trials (25 reports, 3168 participants). Of these, 10 trials (801 participants) compared bisphosphonates (etidronate, tiludronate, ibandronate, pamidronate, olpadronate, alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate) versus placebo, seven compared two bisphosphonates (992 participants), one trial compared a bisphosphonates with a bisphosphonate plus calcitonin (44 participants), and two studies, the largest trial (1331 participants) and its interventional extension study (502 participants), compared symptomatic treatment and intensive treatment where the goal was to normalise alkaline phosphatase. Most studies were assessed at low or unclear risk of bias. Six of 10 studies comparing bisphosphonates versus placebo were assessed at high risk of bias, mainly around incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting. Participant populations were reasonably homogeneous in terms of age (mean age 66 to 74 years) and sex (51% to 74% male). Most studies included participants who had elevated alkaline phosphatase levels whether or not bone pain was present. Mean follow-up was six months. Bisphosphonates versus placeboBisphosphonates tripled the proportion (31% versus 9%) of participants whose bone pain disappeared (RR 3.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 8.90; 2 studies, 205 participants; NNT 5, 95% CI 1 to 31; moderate-quality evidence). This result is clinically important. Data were consistent when pain change was measured as any reduction (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.01; 7 studies, 481 participants). There was uncertainty about differences in incident fractures: 1.4% fractures occurred in the bisphosphonates group and none in the placebo group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.31; 4 studies, 356 participants; very low-quality evidence). None of the studies reported data on orthopaedic surgery, quality of life or hearing thresholds. Results regarding adverse effects and treatment discontinuation were uncertain. There was a 64% risk of mild gastrointestinal adverse events in intervention group participants and 48% in the control group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.92; 6 studies, 376 participants; low-quality evidence). The likelihood of study participants discontinuing due to adverse effects was slightly higher in intervention group participants (4.4%) than the control group (4.1%) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.52; 6 studies, 517 participants; low-quality evidence). Zoledronate was associated with an increased risk of transient fever or fatigue (RR 2.57, 95% CI 1.21 to 5.44; 1 study, 176 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Bisphosphonates versus active comparatorMore participants reported pain relief with zoledronate than pamidronate (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; 1 study, 89 participants; NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 11) or risedronate (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.74; 1 study, 347 participants; NNT 7, 95% CI 4 to 24; very low quality evidence). This result is clinically important. There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude differences in adverse effects of bisphosphonates (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.76; 2 studies, 437 participants; low-quality evidence) and treatment discontinuation (2 studies, 437 participants) (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.43 to 9.59; 2 studies, 437 participants; very low-quality evidence). Intensive versus symptomatic treatmentThere was no consistent evidence of difference to response in bone pain, bodily pain or quality of life in participants who received intensive versus symptomatic treatment. Inconclusive results were observed regarding fractures and orthopaedic procedures for intensive versus symptomatic treatment (intensive treatment for fracture: RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.44; absolute risk 8.1% versus 5.2%; orthopaedic procedures: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.11; absolute risk 5.6% versus 3.0%; 1 study, 502 participants; low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude an important difference in adverse effects between intensive and symptomatic treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.41; low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to confirm or exclude an important difference of risk of rare adverse events (including osteonecrosis of the jaw) from the regulatory agencies databases.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that bisphosphonates improved pain in people with Paget's disease of bone when compared with placebo. We are uncertain about the results of head-to-head studies investigating bisphosphonates. We found insufficient evidence of benefit in terms of pain or quality of life from intensive treatment. Information about adverse effects was limited, but serious side effects were rare, and rate of withdrawals due to side effects was low.

### Emerging issues with bisphosphonates [^67ada44b]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are the most commonly used agents in the management of metabolic bones diseases. Despite their established therapeutic value, a number of points of uncertainty remain, particularly in connection with their optimal long-term use. It is likely that definitive clinical trial data will not become available to resolve these questions, so careful clinical observation and caution are needed in patients who require treatment over periods of more than 10 years.

### Medical management of Paget's disease of bone: indications for treatment and review of current therapies [^b44ad48a]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment with a potent bisphosphonate is indicated in patients with Paget's disease who have symptoms likely to respond to reduced bone turnover at pagetic sites. In asymptomatic patients with active disease at sites susceptible to local progression and late complications, treatment is also recommended. Biochemical remission is achievable in a majority of patients with pamidronate, alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid. Indications for medical treatment of active Paget's disease of bone include symptoms referable to sites of the disease such as bone pain, joint pain, and neurological complications; elective surgery at an active pagetic site to reduce intraoperative blood loss from highly vascular bone; management of rare instances of immobilization hypercalcemia with polyostotic disease; and presence of disease activity in asymptomatic patients at sites at risk for future complications to limit progression and possibly lower that risk. The treatment of choice is a potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, including oral alendronate or risedronate or intravenous pamidronate or zoledronic acid. Etidronate and tiludronate are less potent and are second-line choices. Recent data with zoledronic acid indicate that a single infusion of 5 mg is associated with normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase in 89% of patients and a prolonged biochemical remission, making it the most effective therapy available to date. Side effect profiles with alendronate and risedronate include esophageal irritation in a minority of patients. Intravenous pamidronate and zoledronic acid may induce an acute phase reaction with fever and flu-like symptoms with the first dose, primarily in patients who are treatment naïve to nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates. Calcium and vitamin D repletion are mandatory with these potent anti-osteoclast therapies to avoid hypocalcemia. Acquired resistance to etidronate and pamidronate has been reported in some patients, leading to lesser reductions in bone turnover and shorter periods of remission, but substitution with a different bisphosphonate provides a more robust response. It is not known whether resistance to other bisphosphonates in Paget's disease occurs.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^634b444d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Treatment of increased metabolic activity or symptoms?

The Paget's Disease, Randomized Trial of Intensive versus Symptomatic Management (PRISM) study compared the effects of a treat to target strategy aimed at normalizing total ALP compared with a strategy aimed at controlling symptoms 54 in 1324 patients with PDB. The average age of participants at entry to the study was about 74 years with an average disease duration of 8 years. About 70% of patients had previously been treated with bisphosphonates; about 47% had elevated total ALP values at baseline, and 46% had bone pain thought to be caused by PDB. There was a poor correlation between presence of bone pain thought to be due to PDB and an elevated ALP value, however. 54 Participants randomized to receive "intensive" bisphosphonate treatment (n = 661) were prescribed bisphosphonates with the aim of maintaining or suppressing total ALP values to within the reference range irrespective of whether bone pain was present. Risedronate sodium was the bisphosphonate of first choice, but any licensed bisphosphonate could be used. In the symptomatic group (n = 663), the therapeutic goal was to control bone pain. This was initially attempted using analgesics, but if the response was inadequate, non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates or calcitonin were used first followed by nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates if necessary. The primary endpoint was clinical fracture. Secondary endpoints included fractures through Pagetic bone, orthopedic procedures, quality of life assessed by SF36, HAQ and EQ5D, bone pain, bone deformity, progression of hearing loss in patients with skull involvement assessed by audiometry, and adverse events. PRISM was an event‐driven study, which was stopped when 95 clinical fractures occurred. The average duration or follow‐up was 3 years with a range of 2 to 4 years.

The PRISM‐extension with zoledronic acid study (PRISM‐EZ) employed the same strategy as in PRISM, but zoledronic acid was used as the treatment of first choice in the intensive arm. 113 Patients within PRISM‐EZ maintained the same treatment allocation as they had been randomized to in PRISM. The PRISM‐EZ study followed 270 patients in the intensive group and 232 in the symptomatic group, providing an average total duration of 7.3 years follow‐up since the beginning of the PRISM study. The primary and secondary endpoints were the same in PRISM‐EZ as in PRISM, except that patients did not undergo audiometry in the extension.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^8fd13b2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Parathyroid hormone analogs (teriparatide, abaloparatide) — ACOG recommendation, indications, sequencing, and safety limits emphasize short-duration anabolic therapy for very high-risk patients. ACOG recommends the parathyroid hormone analogs, teriparatide and abaloparatide, for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis for up to 2 years in patients who are at very high risk of fracture or who continue to sustain fractures or have significant bone loss while taking antiresorptive therapy. (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, HIGH-QUALITY EVIDENCE) These agents are indicated for very high risk or antiresorptive-unresponsive osteoporosis (eg, severe or multiple vertebral fractures, a T-score of −3 or lower, or progressive loss of BMD), anabolic therapy needs to be followed by an antiresorptive such as a bisphosphonate or denosumab to preserve BMD gains, treatment is restricted to 2 years in a patient's lifetime due to osteosarcoma seen in rat studies, and they should not be used in Paget's disease, unexplained elevated alkaline phosphatase, or hypercalcemic disorders such as primary hyperparathyroidism, with caution advised in urolithiasis or preexisting hypercalciuria.

### Randomized trial of intensive bisphosphonate treatment versus symptomatic management in Paget's disease of bone [^530d221c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely regarded as the treatment of choice for Paget's disease of bone (PDB) because of their potent inhibitory effects on bone turnover, but the effects of bisphosphonate therapy on symptoms and complications of PDB have been little studied. Here we report the results of a randomized trial that compared the effects of symptomatic treatment with intensive bisphosphonate therapy in a cohort of 1324 patients with PDB who were followed up for a median of 3 years (range 2 to 5 years). The symptomatic treatment group was treated only if they had pagetic bone pain, for which they were first given analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs, followed by bisphosphonates if they did not respond. The intensive group received repeat courses of bisphosphonates irrespective of symptoms with the aim of reducing and maintaining serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels within the normal range. The endpoints were fracture, orthopedic surgery, quality of life, bone pain, and hearing thresholds. Serum ALP levels were significantly lower in the intensive treatment group than in with the symptomatic treatment group within 4 months of commencing treatment and remained lower throughout the study (p < .001). There was no difference between the groups in quality of life (as assessed by the SF36 questionnaire), in overall bodily pain, or in pagetic bone pain. Hearing thresholds, as assessed by audiometry did not change significantly and did not differ between the treatment groups. Clinical fractures occurred in 46 of 661 patients (7.0%) in the intensive treatment group compared with 49 of 663 patients (7.4%) in the symptomatic treatment group, and orthopedic surgery was required in 50 of 661 patients (7.3%) in the intensive treatment group and in 55 of 663 patients (8.3%) in the symptomatic treatment group. These differences were not significant. Subgroup analyses of patients with elevated ALP levels at baseline and those who did or did not receive bisphosphonates during the study yielded similar results to those in the study group as a whole. We conclude that striving to maintain normal ALP levels with intensive bisphosphonate therapy confers no clinical advantage over symptom-driven management in patients with established PDB. Neither management strategy had a significant beneficial impact on pain or quality of life (Clinical trial registration number ISRCTN12989577).

1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Reclast is indicated for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, diagnosed by bone mineral density (BMD) or prevalent vertebral fracture, Reclast reduces the incidence of fractures (hip, vertebral, and non-vertebral osteoporosis-related fractures). In patients at high risk of fracture, defined as a recent low-trauma hip fracture, Reclast reduces the incidence of new clinical fractures [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women

Reclast is indicated for prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Osteoporosis in Men

Reclast is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

1.4 Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Reclast is indicated for the treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women who are either initiating or continuing systemic glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who are expected to remain on glucocorticoids for at least 12 months [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5 Paget's Disease of Bone

Reclast is indicated for treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone with elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase of two times or higher than the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for complications from their disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

1.6 Important Limitations of Use

The safety and effectiveness of Reclast for the treatment of osteoporosis is based on clinical data of three years duration. The optimal duration of use has not been determined. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy reevaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture reevaluated periodically.

Treatment of increased metabolic activity in asymptomatic patients

Bisphosphonates are highly efficacious at reducing the elevations in bone turnover that are characteristic of active PDB. Here we focus on the effects of treatment on serum total ALP because it is the most commonly used biochemical marker of metabolic activity in PDB and has served as the primary outcome measure in clinical trials where bisphosphonates have been compared with placebo and with other bisphosphonates. In a Cochrane review, 66 it was noted that bisphosphonates achieved a 50.1% (95% CI 32.5–67.7) greater reduction in total ALP (592 participants) than placebo and the RR of bisphosphonates normalizing total ALP was 9.96 (95% CI 3.74–26.58). In the same review, a comparison of nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates with non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates showed that nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates were more effective at normalizing total ALP than non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates (212 participants) (RR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.72–6.79; NNT = 2, 95% CI 1–4). Within the nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid was more efficacious at reducing total ALP than pamidronate (90 participants) or risedronate sodium (347 participants) (RR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.79–3.70; NNT = 2, 95% CI 1–3 and RR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.33–1.76; NNT = 3; 95% CI 3–5, respectively.

The duration of effect of different bisphosphonates on serum total ALP concentrations has also been studied. A randomized trial comparing oral risedronate sodium 30 mg daily for 2 months with oral etidronate 400 mg daily for 6 months showed that total ALP values remained suppressed in 53% of the risedronate sodium group compared with 14% of the etidronate group. 110 In a long‐term extension of the HORIZON Paget's study, (100) 88% of patients treated with a single dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid intravenously still had a normal serum total ALP after 5 years' follow‐up compared with 47% of patients treated with oral risedronate sodium. It should be noted that the attrition rate in this study was high and that only patients with normal ALP at the end of the core study were eligible to be enrolled into the extension.

An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) was developed using GRADE methodology, by a Guideline Development Group (GDG) led by the Paget's Association (UK). A systematic review of diagnostic tests and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options was conducted that sought to address several key questions of clinical relevance. Twelve recommendations and five conditional recommendations were made, but there was insufficient evidence to address eight of the questions posed. The following recommendations were identified as the most important: 1) Radionuclide bone scans, in addition to targeted radiographs, are recommended as a means of fully and accurately defining the extent of metabolically active disease in patients with PDB. 2) Serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is recommended as a first-line biochemical screening test in combination with liver function tests in screening for the presence of metabolically active PDB. 3) Bisphosphonates are recommended for the treatment of bone pain associated with PDB. Zoledronic acid is recommended as the bisphosphonate most likely to give a favorable pain response. 4) Treatment aimed at improving symptoms is recommended over a treat-to-target strategy aimed at normalizing total ALP in PDB. 5) Total hip or knee replacements are recommended for patients with PDB who develop osteoarthritis in whom medical treatment is inadequate. There is insufficient information to recommend one type of surgical approach over another. The guideline was endorsed by the European Calcified Tissues Society, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, the Bone Research Society (UK), and the British Geriatric Society. The GDG noted that there had been a lack of research on patient-focused clinical outcomes in PDB and identified several areas where further research was needed. © 2019 The Authors.

ABSTRACT

An evidence‐based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) was developed using GRADE methodology, by a Guideline Development Group (GDG) led by the Paget's Association (UK). A systematic review of diagnostic tests and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options was conducted that sought to address several key questions of clinical relevance. Twelve recommendations and five conditional recommendations were made, but there was insufficient evidence to address eight of the questions posed. The following recommendations were identified as the most important: 1) Radionuclide bone scans, in addition to targeted radiographs, are recommended as a means of fully and accurately defining the extent of metabolically active disease in patients with PDB. 2) Serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is recommended as a first‐line biochemical screening test in combination with liver function tests in screening for the presence of metabolically active PDB. 3) Bisphosphonates are recommended for the treatment of bone pain associated with PDB. Zoledronic acid is recommended as the bisphosphonate most likely to give a favorable pain response. 4) Treatment aimed at improving symptoms is recommended over a treat‐to‐target strategy aimed at normalizing total ALP in PDB. 5) Total hip or knee replacements are recommended for patients with PDB who develop osteoarthritis in whom medical treatment is inadequate. There is insufficient information to recommend one type of surgical approach over another. The guideline was endorsed by the European Calcified Tissues Society, the International Osteoporosis Foundation, the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, the Bone Research Society (UK), and the British Geriatric Society. The GDG noted that there had been a lack of research on patient‐focused clinical outcomes in PDB and identified several areas where further research was needed. © 2019 The Authors.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^5db47068]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

BTMs (total ALP and bone ALP) have been proposed to monitor the effect of treatment; a decrease of 25% or more after treatment is considered significant. On the other hand, an increase of more than 25% from the nadir during the off-treatment period, should prompt physicians to check for symptoms and consider treatment. A recent study used this approach to define treatment responders to risedronate.

There have been debates as to whether treatment should be aimed at treating symptoms or whether a treat-to-target strategy should be followed, ie, aiming to normalize ALP. The current guidance is to aim for the relief of symptoms. Bisphosphonates are the drugs of choice, while medications like denosumab and calcitonin have limited use.

Conclusion

BTMs are very useful in diagnosing Paget's disease and the recommended marker is ALP. PINP and bone ALP can also be used depending on the clinical situation. The current practice is to treat patients according to their symptoms and not aim to normalize BTMs.

Paget's disease — biochemical evaluation after imaging: We recommend that after radiological diagnosis of Paget's disease, the initial biochemical evaluation of a patient should be done using serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or with the use of a more specific marker of bone formation when appropriate. In patients with radiological evidence of Paget's disease, measurement of serum total ALP is the least expensive biochemical test to determine the metabolic activity of the disorder, and although this bone formation marker increases secondary to bone resorption, it correlates well with the extent of skeletal involvement when assessed from radiographs or scintigraphy and with the probability of achieving normal values with a potent bisphosphonate.

Post–kidney transplant low BMD therapy — first 12 months and CKD-MBD context: In patients in the first 12 months post–kidney transplant with eGFR greater than approximately 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and low BMD, we suggest that treatment with vitamin D, calcitriol/alphacalcidol, or bisphosphonates be considered (2D). We suggest that treatment choices be influenced by the presence of CKD-MBD, indicated by abnormal levels of calcium, phosphorus, PTH, alkaline phosphatases, and 25(OH)D (2C), and it is reasonable to consider a bone biopsy to guide treatment, specifically before the use of bisphosphonates because of the possible adynamic bone disease (no grade). There are insufficient data to guide treatment after the first 12 months; there are no RCTs in kidney transplant patients examining bone-specific therapies on clinical outcomes, such as fractures or cardiovascular disease events, and thus, treatment recommendations are discretionary.

### Alternative indications for bisphosphonate therapy [^fbe33a1f]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are currently used in the treatment of osteoporosis (postmenopausal and steroid-induced), hypercalcemia of malignancy, Paget's disease of bone, multiple myeloma, and skeletally related events associated with metastatic bone disease in breast, prostate, lung, and other cancers. There are, however, numerous other conditions where a decrease in bone remodeling by bisphosphonates might aid in disease management. The focus of this review will be to discuss a select group of conditions for which bisphosphonate therapy may be efficacious. In this review we present several cases where bisphosphonates have been used as a primary or adjunctive treatment for giant cell lesions of the jaws. Use of bisphosphonate therapy for giant cell tumors of the appendicular skeleton, pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, Gaucher's disease, and osteomyelitis will be discussed. Finally, we will review previous in vivo studies on the use of bisphosphonates to augment integration and to treat osteolysis surrounding failing orthopedic implants.

### Bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis [^3d1a6ef0]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis to reduce fracture risk. Because of their long retention time in bone and uncommon side effects, questions have been raised about the optimal duration of therapy. Potential side effects appear to be rare and may not be causally related. Although there is no strong science to guide "drug holidays", there appears to be some lingering antifracture benefit when treatment is stopped, so some time off treatment should be offered to most patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy. For most patients with osteoporosis, the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.

Adverse events

In the PRISM study, the numbers of adverse events and serious adverse events in the two treatment groups were similar. In the PRISM‐EZ study, the number of patients with adverse events in the intensive group was 226 of 270 (83.7%) compared with 196 of 232 (84.5%) in the symptomatic group (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.92–1.08). The number of serious adverse events in the two treatment groups was 87 of 270 (32.2%) versus 66 of 232 (28.4%) (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.96–1.72).

Alkaline phosphatase

In the PRISM study, serum concentrations of total ALP were significantly lower in the intensive group from 4 months onward. At the end of the study, 78.8% of the intensive group had a total ALP within the reference range compared with 61.2% of the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). In the PRISM‐EZ study, total ALP values were lower at baseline and throughout the study in the intensive group. By the end of the study, total ALP values were within the reference range in 85.3% of the intensive group versus 70.3% of the symptomatic group (p < 0.001).

The evidence summary and recommendations with regard to employing a strategy of supressing bone turnover as the primary therapeutic goal in PDB as opposed to treating symptoms are shown in Table 18.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^faf8b3c1]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Although many clinical trials of bisphosphonates have enrolled patients on the basis that serum total ALP values are elevated (whether or not symptoms were present), we found no clinical trials or observational studies that specifically addressed the issue of whether treatment of asymptomatic patients with bisphosphonates that have metabolically active PDB was of benefit in preventing complications of the disease.

Of some relevance to the issue of treating asymptomatic patients is the fact that bisphosphonates can promote healing of lytic lesions at least in the short term. In one observational study of PDB patients treated with pamidronate, healing of lytic lesions was demonstrated in some cases at 6 months, but longer‐term follow‐up of these patients after 2 years showed progression of lytic lesions once again, even though biochemical markers of bone turnover were normal at this point. 111 The effects of bisphosphonates on lytic lesions have been studied in two randomized controlled trials. One examined the effects of alendronic acid 40 mg daily for 6 months in 55 PDB patients compared with placebo. The average age was about 70 years; 19% had previously been treated with anti‐Pagetic medication and 32 (58%) had bone pain thought to be due to PDB at baseline. The authors reported healing of lytic lesions in 11 of 23 (47.8%) patients treated with alendronic acid and no change in 12 of 23 (52.1%) patients. Corresponding values in placebo‐treated patients were 1 in 23 healed and no change in 22 of 23 patients (95.6%). Bone biopsies were obtained through Paget's bone in 4 alendronic acid–treated patients and 9 placebo‐treated patents. Histomorphometry showed lower bone turnover in the alendronic acid–treated cases. Another randomized trial compared the effects of alendronate 40 mg daily for 6 months with etidronate 400 mg daily for 6 months in 89 PDB patients of average age about 70 years. 112 It showed that lesions improved in 32.4% of the ALN group, whereas 8.8% showed worsening. The corresponding proportions in the etidronate group were 26.5% and 14.7%, respectively, a difference that was not significant.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^c20e93a0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — bone turnover markers for assessing treatment response: If there is urgency in the control of symptoms or the disease is particularly active, we suggest the use of short- term response of bone resorption markers before and shortly after treatment to indicate that an adequate therapeutic response is likely. (2|⊕⊕◯◯) Resorption markers such as βCTX fall rapidly with potent bisphosphonates, reaching a nadir value at 10 days, whereas formation markers such as total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are slower, reaching a nadir at about 2 to 3 months, and the short-term (10-d) reduction in markers such as urinary NTX correlates with the final post-treatment ALP. For most patients, measurement of total ALP or other baseline disease activity markers at 6 to12 weeks is an acceptable and cost-effective option, and maximal suppression of high bone turnover may require measurement at 6 months.

### Bisphosphonates in osteoporosis [^27b1ae30]. European Spine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates are compounds characterized by a P-C-P structure. They act essentially on bone, inhibiting bone resorption. Through this mechanism they decrease bone loss, increase bone mineral density, and decrease bone turnover. They are therefore administered in diseases with elevated bone destruction, such as Paget's disease, metastatic bone disease, and osteoporosis. In the latter they diminish both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. The adverse events are few, mostly gastrointestinal, and can be avoided to a large extent by correct administration. Since there are no other compounds available which have a similar profile, they represent today the drugs of choice in the treatment and the secondary prevention of osteoporosis.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^4d118ff7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

Monitoring is similar for conventional therapy or for burosumab. Initial monthly laboratory monitoring can extend to every 3 to 4 months once stable dosing is established for serum phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, and urine calcium and creatinine. Importantly, hypophosphatemia during conventional therapy is not an indication to adjust phosphate salts or calcitriol. In contrast, burosumab treatment targets low–normal trough phosphorus requiring periodic measurements at peak and trough time points. If serum phosphorus is elevated, regardless of treatment modality, the doses should decrease. Worsening kidney function or nephrocalcinosis also prompt dose decreases.

Hypercalcemia is an indication to decrease calcitriol dosing. We would also consider decreasing burosumab doses for hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. Some authors have recommended monitoring 1,25(OH) 2 D during treatment. In fact, the mean peak values of 1,25(OH) 2 D were supraphysiologic during the registration clinical trials, but the trials did not adjust doses based on 1,25(OH) 2 D. Decreasing the dose based on 1,25(OH) 2 D levels may limit the effectiveness of burosumab by allowing persistent hypophosphatemia. Thus, monitoring 1,25(OH) 2 D adds cost without clear benefit, and we have not recommended monitoring 1,25(OH) 2 D during treatment. There is greater rationale for monitoring urine calcium excretion and serum calcium as the likely signals of true adverse 1,25(OH) 2 D effects. PTH should be assessed every 6 months and during hypercalcemia. If PTH is elevated, either the dose of calcitriol should be increased (unless there is hypercalcemia), or the dose of phosphate decreased. Patients may require supplementation to maintain normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. Alkaline phosphatase often increases transiently on initiation of therapy, but over time normalization is a marker of therapeutic effect. Burosumab dosing is titrated based on serum phosphorus rather than alkaline phosphatase. Monitor growth and radiographs annually in children.

Duration of biochemical remission correlates inversely with the minimum post-treatment value and also with the shortterm reduction in turnover.

Paget's disease of bone — bisphosphonate clinical outcomes across agents: Etidronate was the first bisphosphonate to be used in Paget's disease and produced greater and more durable reductions in bone turnover than calcitonin, but doses necessary to produce biochemical remission in many patients also resulted in osteomalacia. Clodronate and tiludronate did not cause osteomalacia but lacked sufficient potency to normalize bone turnover in all patients. Subsequent nitrogen-containing amino-bisphosphonates had much greater antiresorptive potency; pamidronate normalized bone resorption within 1 week of oral dosing while normalization of bone formation took 3–6 months. Alendronate was studied in two randomized trials, and oral alendronate (40 mg/d for 6 mo) normalized ALP in 60–70% of patients, led to healing of lytic radiological lesions, and restored normal lamellar bone histology.

### Paget disease of bone for primary care [^b845913a]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Paget disease of bone is a benign disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone turnover in one or more skeletal sites. It usually affects older adults, and men are at a higher risk than women. Any bone may be affected, but the disease has a high preference for the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones. Pain is the most common symptom, and presentation of the disease may depend on which bones are affected, the extent of involvement, and the presence of complications. Paget disease of bone may be asymptomatic, and suspicion arises from incidental findings of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels on routine blood work or abnormalities on imaging tests performed for an unrelated cause. Evidence-based guidelines recommend the use of plain radiography and serum alkaline phosphatase testing for initial diagnosis and radionuclide scans for delineation of the extent of disease. Treatment with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is recommended in active disease or when risk of complications is possible. Complications of the disease include arthritis, gait changes, hearing loss, nerve compression syndromes, and osteosarcoma. Total serum alkaline phosphatase is the suggested marker for assessing treatment response when high bone turnover occurs, and it should be measured at three to six months to evaluate initial response. Early diagnosis of Paget disease of bone remains key to its management because patients generally have a good prognosis if treatment is initiated before major complications arise. The primary care physician may need to consult with a specialist for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment.

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

1.4 Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and women receiving glucocorticoids in a daily dosage equivalent to 7.5 mg or greater of prednisone and who have low bone mineral density [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

1.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

Alendronate sodium tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone in men and women. Treatment is indicated in patients with Paget's disease of bone who have alkaline phosphatase at least two times the upper limit of normal, or those who are symptomatic, or those at risk for future complications from their disease. [See Clinical Studies (14.5) .]

1.6 Important Limitations of Use

The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of alendronate sodium tablets, USP for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^2a526aaf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this guideline was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Paget's disease of the bone.

Participants

The guideline was developed by an Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We recommend that plain radiographs be obtained of the pertinent regions of the skeleton in patients with suspected Paget's disease. If the diagnosis is confirmed, we suggest that a radionucleotide bone scan be done to determine the extent of the disease. After diagnosis of Paget's disease, we recommend measurement of serum total alkaline phosphatase or, when warranted, a more specific marker of bone formation or bone resorption to assess the response to treatment or evolution of the disease in untreated patients. We suggest treatment with a bisphosphonate for most patients with active Paget's disease who are at risk for future complications. We suggest a single 5-mg dose of iv zoledronate as the treatment of choice in patients who have no contraindication. In patients with monostotic disease who have a normal serum total alkaline phosphatase, we suggest that a specific marker of bone formation and bone resorption be measured, although these may still be normal. Serial radionuclide bone scans may determine the response to treatment if the markers are normal. We suggest that bisphosphonate treatment may be effective in preventing or slowing the progress of hearing loss and osteoarthritis in joints adjacent to Paget's disease and may reverse paraplegia associated with spinal Paget's disease. We suggest treatment with a bisphosphonate before surgery on pagetic bone.

Health‐related quality of life

No information was available from randomized trials with which to evaluate the effects of bisphosphonates on health‐related quality of life compared with placebo.

A comparison of zoledronic acid with risedronate sodium 99 showed that the average physical component summary score of SF‐36 improved to a greater extent in the zoledronic acid group, although the absolute difference was about 2 points, which is below the 5‐point threshold that is considered clinically significant. 99 When the SF36 physical summary score data were analyzed by multivariate testing taking baseline scores into account, the authors reported a nominally significant difference (p = 0.04) favoring zoledronic acid, but this was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. When the data were expressed as the proportion of patients whose SF36 physical summary score improved after treatment, the difference favored zoledronic acid (RR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.18–1.42). 66 In an extension of the same study, 100 the mean change from baseline SF36 summary score favored zoledronic acid (mean difference 3.8, 95% CI 3.12–4.49). However, this analysis was not intention to treat, and was based on a selected group of patients who had normal total ALP values at the end of the core study.

The evidence summary and recommendations for the use of bisphosphonates to improve quality of life in PDB are shown in Table 8.

Route of administration of bisphosphonates

The literature review identified several studies in which different modes of administration of bisphosphonates for the treatment of PDB were investigated, but the only randomized trial was by Merlotti and colleagues with neridronate, a nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonate licensed in Italy for PDB. 115 The study group was composed of 57 patients with active PDB as defined by a serum total ALP value above the upper limit of the reference range. All patients were reported to have bone pain before treatment. Participants were randomized to receive intravenous neridronate (100 mg i.v. on 2 consecutive days) or intramuscular neridronate (25 mg once weekly for 8 weeks). The primary endpoint was normalization of total ALP. Secondary endpoints included bone pain and the time taken until ALP normalized. Normalization of ALP levels at 6 months was achieved in 24 of 27 patients (88.9%) in the intravenous group and 26 of 29 patients (89.6%) in the intramuscular group. Longer‐term follow‐up at 36 months revealed that normal total ALP values were maintained in 13 of 27 (48.1%) and 13 of 29 (44.8%) of patients in the intravenous and intramuscular groups, respectively. Pain had improved or disappeared in 21 of 27 (77%) of patients given intravenous therapy at 6 months compared with 19 of 29 (65.5%) given intramuscular therapy, a difference that was not significant (chi‐square 1.02, p = 0.30). Adverse effects in the two treatment groups were similar. The authors concluded that both routes of administration gave equivalent therapeutic responses but commented that the intramuscular route was slightly more expensive (115 versus 90 euros).

The evidence summary and recommendations with regard to administering neridronate intravenously as opposed to intramuscularly are shown in Table 19.

### Comparison of a single infusion of zoledronic acid with risedronate for Paget's disease [^10f6e541]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

The advent of bisphosphonates advanced therapy for Paget's disease, but more effective and convenient agents are needed to increase adherence. Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate administered as a single intravenous infusion, might meet these needs.

Methods

In two identical, randomized, double-blind, actively controlled trials of 6 months' duration, we compared one 15-minute infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid with 60 days of oral risedronate (30 mg per day). The primary efficacy end point was the rate of therapeutic response at six months, defined as a normalization of alkaline phosphatase levels or a reduction of at least 75 percent in the total alkaline phosphatase excess. The results of the studies were pooled.

Results

At six months, 96.0 percent of patients receiving zoledronic acid had a therapeutic response (169 of 176), as compared with 74.3 percent of patients receiving risedronate (127 of 171, P < 0.001). Alkaline phosphatase levels normalized in 88.6 percent of patients in the zoledronic acid group and 57.9 percent of patients in the risedronate group (P < 0.001). Zoledronic acid was associated with a shorter median time to a first therapeutic response (64 vs. 89 days, P < 0.001). Higher response rates in the zoledronic acid group were consistent across all demographic, disease-severity, and treatment-history subgroups and with changes in other bone-turnover markers. The physical-component summary score of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey, a measure of the quality of life, increased significantly from baseline at both three and six months in the zoledronic acid group and differed significantly from those in the risedronate group at three months. Pain scores improved in both groups. During post-trial follow-up (median, 190 days), 21 of 82 patients in the risedronate group had a loss of therapeutic response, as compared with 1 of 113 patients in the zoledronic acid group (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

A single infusion of zoledronic acid produces more rapid, more complete, and more sustained responses in Paget's disease than does daily treatment with risedronate.

### Short-term safety of zoledronic acid in young patients with bone disorders: an extensive institutional experience [^994736b2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Zoledronic acid (ZA) is increasingly used in young patients with bone disorders. However, data related to the safety of ZA administration in this population are limited.

Objective

The study aimed to characterize the short-term safety profile of ZA and identify risk factors for ZA-related adverse events (AEs) in young patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a retrospective chart review of inpatients and outpatients less than 21 years old who received at least one ZA infusion between July 2010 and January 2014 at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

Results

Eighty-one patients (56% male; median age, 12 y; age at first infusion, 0.5 to 20 y) with diverse skeletal disorders received a total of 204 infusions. The most common indications were osteoporosis (33% of cohort) and osteogenesis imperfecta (27.2%). The median ZA dose was 0.025 mg/kg (interquartile range, 0.025–0.05); the median dosing interval was 6 months (range, 1 to 25.6 mo). AEs were mild and more common after the first ZA infusion in patients with no previous bisphosphonate exposure: hypophosphatemia (25.2% of infusions), acute phase reactions (19.1%), and hypocalcemia (16.4%). Symptomatic hypocalcemia requiring iv calcium occurred after two infusions. ZA dose was significantly associated with hypophosphatemia, but not other AEs. Hypocalcemia was more common in patients with high bone turnover as assessed by preinfusion alkaline phosphatase levels. AEs were not associated with diagnosis, baseline serum calcium, or calcium/calcitriol supplementation.

Conclusion

Acute AEs related to ZA infusion in youths are common, occur principally after the first ZA infusion in bisphosphonate-naive patients, and are typically mild and easily managed. Future prospective studies are needed to determine the potential long-term risks, as well as benefits, of ZA therapy in the pediatric population.

### Paget's disease of bone: diagnosis and treatment [^79b2f217]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Paget's disease of bone is a common bone disorder characterized by disorganized bone remodeling. The most likely etiology is a slow paramyxoviral infection in genetically susceptible individuals; however, the exact cause is unknown. Enhanced bone resorption due to an increased activity of osteoclasts recruits numerous osteoblasts to resorption sites, with large quantities of new bone matrix produced as a result. The accelerated bone resorption and formation are not as closely coupled as in a healthy bone; a disorganized bone tissue is formed. Many patients are asymptomatic; rising serum alkaline phosphatase or incidental finding of characteristic radiographic lesions are often the only diagnostic clues. Common clinical manifestations include bone pain, bowing of long bones, enlarged skull, and hearing loss. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level correlates with the disease activity. The diagnosis is confirmed by characteristic radiographic findings and by nuclear scintigraphy of the bone (the most sensitive test). Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid, pamidronate, alendronate, and risedronate, are the mainstay of treatment. Patients who do not tolerate bisphosphonates can be treated with calcitonin.

### Transformative therapy in hypophosphatasia [^9768d062]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical findings of the most common manifestations are shown in figure 1; note that presentation can be multisystemic. Low ALP activity level is the hallmark of HPP and should be assessed when HPP is suspected. Measurement of ALP is easy to perform, readily available and can lead to rapid diagnosis. However, its interpretation requires some care. The normal range for ALP is age- and gender-specific, emphasising the need for appropriate laboratory reference ranges. Some laboratories only have one broad reference range for all ages; physicians should be wary because ALP levels that are normal for adults could represent pathological levels for children. Furthermore, there is often a focus upon elevated ALP for the diagnosis of rickets/osteomalacia, rather than low ALP levels.

Together with low ALP levels, typical radiological features of perinatal, infantile and childhood HPP can confirm the diagnosis. However, the radiological features in mild childhood, adult and odonto-HPP are not always diagnostic. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, confirmatory laboratory testing can include PLP, PPi or urinary phosphoethanolamine levels, which are usually above the reference range in patients with HPP, as well as ALPL mutational analyses.

The presence of any clinical findings shown in figure 1 with a combination of low ALP activity level should result in a working diagnosis of HPP until proven otherwise. Timely access to care and treatment options is dependent on the critical period between symptom onset and diagnosis. This is especially important for patients with perinatal and infantile HPP, where delays may have fatal consequences, or in older patients where treatment with bisphosphonates may worsen the bone phenotype. Improving awareness will increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis and minimise the period between symptom onset and initiating the newly available, potentially life-saving therapy.

We hope that despite the inconvenience of frequent injections and the high cost of the treatment, this transformative therapy will be implemented for those in whom HPP is currently life-limiting.

### Intravenously administered pamidronate in the treatment of Paget's disease of bone [^72fb7c7c]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of intravenously administered pamidronate in patients with Paget's disease of bone.

Methods

We conducted a prospective nonrandomized study and reviewed the related literature. Eighty patients (52 women and 28 men, ranging in age from 53 to 93 years; mean age, 76) were treated with pamidronate intravenously in a total dose of 180 mg during a 6- or 3-week period. All patients had bone scintigraphy and x-ray findings characteristic of Paget's disease of bone. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels were increased in all patients, and findings on fractionation were consistent with a bone origin. Indications for therapy included extensive disease, pagetic deformities, neurologic complications, pagetic pain, and critical areas of involvement. Blood chemistry profile and complete blood cell counts were determined at baseline and after the last dose of pamidronate. Serum calcium levels were determined after the first and second infusions of pamidronate. Patients underwent clinical and biochemical follow-up assessments, with serum alkaline phosphatase measurements, at 2- to 4-month intervals. Many patients who did not have a remission (defined as normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase level) after the first cycle of therapy or who had a relapse with serum alkaline phosphatase levels increased above the normal range after remission were treated with one or more cycles of intravenously administered pamidronate.

Results

The mean serum alkaline phosphatase level was 1,051 U/L before therapy and 386 U/L after treatment, a decrease of 63% (P < 0.0001). In 50 patients, the serum alkaline phosphatase level declined to normal. Such normalization was noted in 43 of 50 patients (86%) whose baseline alkaline phosphatase was less than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), in 5 of 13 patients (38%) whose baseline alkaline phosphatase was 3 to 6 times the ULN, and in only 2 of 17 patients (12%) whose baseline alkaline phosphatase exceeded 6 times the ULN. Of 30 patients who did not have a remission, 22 received a second course of therapy, 2 of whom had normalization of the serum alkaline phosphatase level. Pamidronate was well tolerated; only nine patients reported a "flu-like" syndrome after the first infusion. Serum calcium levels decreased in many patients (to as low as 8 mg/dL), but no patients were symptomatic.

Conclusion

With intravenous administration of pamidronate in a dose of 180 mg in patients with Paget's disease of bone, remissions are likely in those whose baseline serum alkaline phosphatase level is < 3 times the ULN and unlikely when baseline alkaline phosphatase levels are higher-especially more than 6 times the ULN.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, bisphosphonates, ACOG 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate bisphosphonates as initial therapy in most postmenopausal patients at increased risk of fracture. Consider discontinuing bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday in low-to-moderate risk patients being stable after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after 3 years of therapy with IV zoledronic acid. Consider continuing treatment for longer durations of up to 10 years for oral bisphosphonates or up to 6 years for IV zoledronic acid in patients at high risk of fracture.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^8d9b25eb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

An insight into the durability of the response of pain with different bisphosphonates comes from an extension of the Reid study, 100 which compared the effects of a single dose of zoledronic acid 5 mg with a single 2‐month course of risedronate sodium 30 mg daily. The extension study focused on a subgroup of 267 individuals in whom total ALP values were normal at the end of the core study. Clinical relapse, as defined by recurrence of bone pain, occurred in 14 of 152 (9.2%) patients in the zoledronic acid group compared with 29 of 115 (25.2%) in the risedronate sodium group. It should be noted that the rate of clinical relapse was more than 10 times greater than the rate of biochemical relapse in the zoledronic acid group (0.7%) and was about 25% greater than the rate of biochemical relapse in the risedronate sodium group (20%). This indicates that biochemical relapse of PDB and clinical relapse as defined by the recurrence of pain are distinct entities.

The evidence summary and recommendations for the use of bisphosphonates to treat bone pain in PDB are shown in Table 7.

Bone turnover markers (BTMs) — initial evaluation and follow-up of postmenopausal osteoporosis — are described as useful for skeletal assessment but not diagnostic; clinicians might use them for early treatment feedback, with specific markers and measurement conditions noted, and they are not required for all patients. Bone turnover markers (BTMs) provide a dynamic assessment of skeletal activity and are useful modalities for skeletal assessment, yet they "cannot be used to diagnose osteoporosis." For measurement, "Serum CTX must be measured in the fasting state and ideally at the same time in the morning every time." Regarding monitoring of oral bisphosphonates, clinicians "might use the results of BTMs obtained after 3 to 6 months… rather than waiting 2 years for a DXA result." For preferred analytes, "the preferred resorption marker is CTX and the preferred formation marker is PINP." BTMs "may be helpful in determining the reason for bone loss," elevations after an acute fracture "should not be interpreted as treatment failure," and loss of bone mineral density with well-suppressed BTMs "might raise concern" for DXA confounders. During a bisphosphonate drug holiday, suppressed turnover may indicate continued effect, but "there are no peer-reviewed trials supporting or refuting this approach." Overall, "BTMs do not need to be assessed in all osteoporosis patients."

### Symptomatic and scintigraphic improvement after intravenous pamidronate treatment of Paget's disease of bone in patients with normal serum alkaline phosphatase levels [^210aaf4e]. Endocrine Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe three patients with symptomatic Paget's disease of bone who presented with normal levels of serum alkaline phosphatase.

Methods

We present three cases of Paget's disease of bone and chronicle the laboratory, scintigraphic, and clinical findings relative to treatment with intravenously administered pamidronate.

Results

Although measurement of serum total alkaline phosphatase usually provides a general indication of bone turnover in Paget's disease, about 15% of patients present with normal serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Nonetheless, these patients may have active Paget's disease when assessed with bone scintigraphy or urinary markers of bone resorption. All three study patients had xray findings characteristic of Paget's disease of bone, increased uptake of radiotracer material on bone scans, and elevated levels of urinary markers of bone resorption but normal alkaline phosphatase levels. They were treated with intravenously administered pamidronate, 60 mg once weekly for 2 to 3 consecutive weeks. After treatment, the serum alkaline phosphatase level decreased by 19 to 36%, markers of bone resorption normalized, bone scans showed improvement, and bone pain resolved.

Conclusion

Pagetic activity in bone and related clinical manifestations may be present in the setting of a normal serum alkaline phosphatase level. Appropriate therapy should not be withheld because of the normal alkaline phosphatase.

### Risedronate: a new oral bisphosphonate [^a78a0228]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bisphosphonates have been effective in the treatment of osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone. Risedronate, the newest oral bisphosphonate, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and the treatment of Paget's disease of bone.

Objective

This article reviews current studies of risedronate in osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone and, to the extent possible, compares risedronate with other bisphosphonates and other therapies. Information on the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects of risedronate, and the drug's use in other disorders, is also reviewed.

Methods

Clinical studies and review articles concerning the use of risedronate published in the English-language literature from 1966 through October 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts using the search terms risedronate and NE 58095. Recent clinical studies, review articles, and consensus statements regarding the use of other bisphosphonates were identified through searches of the same databases for this period using the search terms bisphosphonates, alendronate, osteoporosis, and Paget's disease of bone.

Results

The use of risedronate therapy in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease the incidence of fractures compared with placebo. In glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, risedronate has been shown to increase BMD without having a consistently significant effect on the risk of fractures. Although there are no direct comparisons between bisphosphonates in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, risedronate appears to be less effective than alendronate and more effective than etidronate in terms of effects on BMD and/or fracture risk. In Paget's disease of bone, risedronate has been reported to be more effective than etidronate in decreasing serum alkaline phosphatase levels and bone pain. Finally, risedronate has been associated with a lower incidence of gastric ulcers than alendronate.

Conclusions

In terms of efficacy in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and the treatment of Paget's disease of bone, risedronate is comparable to alendronate, the other orally available bisphosphonate. It appears to have better gastrointestinal tolerability than alendronate and may be preferred for patients in whom this is a concern. However, direct comparative and pharmacoeconomic studies are necessary to determine risedronate's relative place in the therapy of osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone.

### Consensus statement on the modern therapy of Paget's disease of bone from a Western osteoporosis alliance symposium. biannual foothills meeting on osteoporosis, calgary, Alberta, Canada, September 9–10, 2000 [^a08d9ab8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bisphosphonate therapy remains the most effective way of controlling Paget's disease of bone (PD). Along with salmon calcitonin, etidronate has been the mainstay of therapy for approximately 20 years. However, the advent of newer bisphosphonates with different molecular actions on osteoclasts warrants a reevaluation of optimal treatment.

Objective

At a symposium of the Western Osteoporosis Alliance, physicians with experience in the management of PD met to review currently available information and generate this consensus statement as a guideline for clinicians and a source of information for health care payers.

Methods

All available randomized, double-blind, controlled studies that compared the efficacy of newer bisphosphonates with that of etidronate in the treatment of PD were identified through a search of MEDLINE using the terms Paget's disease, bisphosphonates, pamidronate, etidronate, alendronate, risedronate, tiludronate, clodronate, calcitonin, and salmon calcitonin. Because no such studies have been conducted for pamidronate, clodronate, or calcitonin, these drugs were not included in the analysis.

Conclusions

The consensus of the symposium was that etidronate has little place in the modern management of PD. Newer bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate provide significant therapeutic advantages over etidronate, both in the extent of reduction in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and/or total serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and in the duration of remission, as measured by normalization of BSAP/SAP. In the absence of a direct comparison between alendronate and risedronate in the treatment of PD, physician choice is likely to be based on personal experience, relative cost, and differences in dosing.

KDOQI US commentary — calcium measurement approach and alkaline phosphatase use: The work group did not recommend that corrected calcium measurement be abandoned at present, although recent data did not show superiority over total calcium alone, and it considered measurement of ionized calcium to be more specific, but presently not practical or cost-effective. The KDOQI Work Group recommends using total alkaline phosphatase activity as an adjunct test, which may provide supplemental information in the assessment of bone turnover, particularly in the setting of increased PTH levels and in the assessment of response to therapy for increased PTH levels if liver disease is not likely to be the cause of increased total alkaline phosphatase levels. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase derives more specifically from bone and can be used when the clinical situation is more ambiguous; however, the test is not readily available. High total alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with higher mortality, but it is not known whether therapies aimed at decreasing these levels improve patient outcomes. The KDOQI bone guideline also discussed that concomitant consideration of alkaline phosphatase levels can increase the predictive power of PTH levels; data were insufficient to determine the sensitivity and specificity of alkaline phosphatase levels for renal osteodystrophy alone or together with PTH levels, and the value of alkaline phosphatase for clinical decision making remains to be proved.

14.5 Treatment of Paget's Disease of Bone

The efficacy of alendronate 40 mg once daily for six months was demonstrated in two double-blind clinical studies of male and female patients with moderate to severe Paget's disease (alkaline phosphatase at least twice the upper limit of normal): a placebo-controlled, multinational study and a U.S. comparative study with etidronate disodium 400 mg/day. Figure 6 shows the mean percent changes from baseline in serum alkaline phosphatase for up to six months of randomized treatment.

Figure 6: Studies in Paget's Disease of Bone

At six months the suppression in alkaline phosphatase in patients treated with alendronate was significantly greater than that achieved with etidronate and contrasted with the complete lack of response in placebo-treated patients. Response (defined as either normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase or decrease from baseline greater than or equal to 60%) occurred in approximately 85% of patients treated with alendronate in the combined studies vs. 30% in the etidronate group and 0% in the placebo group. alendronate was similarly effective regardless of age, gender, race, prior use of other bisphosphonates, or baseline alkaline phosphatase within the range studied (at least twice the upper limit of normal).

Bone histology was evaluated in 33 patients with Paget's disease treated with alendronate 40 mg/day for 6 months. As in patients treated for osteoporosis [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], alendronate did not impair mineralization, and the expected decrease in the rate of bone turnover was observed. Normal lamellar bone was produced during treatment with alendronate, even where preexisting bone was woven and disorganized. Overall, bone histology data support the conclusion that bone formed during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality.

Denosumab

There have been two case reports in the use of denosumab 60 mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months in PDB in patients where bisphosphonates were poorly tolerated or contraindicated. In both cases, denosumab resulted in a decrease in total ALP concentrations and an improvement of bone pain. 89, 118 Three open‐label trials have been conducted to study the effects of denosumab in the treatment of GCT, but PDB was an exclusion in two of these studies 119, 120 and in the third, no information on co‐existing PDB was available. 121 The posology in this situation is an initial loading dose of 120 mg denosumab subcutaneously two times weekly followed by 120 mg 4 times weekly thereafter. Of three case reports where denosumab was given to PDB patients with non‐resectable GCT, the treatment improved bone pain and reduced tumor size. 122, 123, 124

Predicting the response to treatment in Paget's disease

A large number of observational studies and clinical trials have been conducted in which biochemical markers of bone turnover have been measured before and after administration of various bisphosphonates in PDB. Indeed, most clinical trials of bisphosphonate therapy in PDB have used serum total ALP as the primary endpoint for efficacy. 66 These studies have consistently shown that total ALP values and other biochemical markers of bone turnover are decreased by bisphosphonate therapy. It has been shown that the decrease is greater with nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates as opposed to non‐nitrogen‐containing bisphosphonates, and that within the bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid is most effective at reducing total ALP. 66

Some patients have contraindications to the use of iv zoledronate, such as marked renal impairment, and in such individuals oral bisphosphonates represent a much safer option because the peak serum drug concentration is substantially lower with a corresponding reduction in renal tubular toxicity risk. The possibility of an acute phase response is a concern with some patients, although in general the frequency and severity are comparable to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with oral dosing.

Currently, seven bisphosphonates have the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration. The most common adult diseases treated with bisphosphonates include osteoporosis, Paget disease, and metastatic bone disease. The treatment of pediatric disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta and fibrous dysplasia with bisphosphonates has gained momentum, and initial investigations have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. Currently, there is a lack of long-term follow-up data, which will be necessary for the development of responsible guidelines for therapy.

### Zoledronic acid therapy of patients with paget disease of bone resistant to or with unsustained remission following prior bisphosphonate therapy [^47916b29]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of zoledronic acid (ZA) in patients with Paget disease (PD) who had not had a biochemical remission with prior bisphosphonate therapy or had a remission ≤ 12 months.

Methods

The effects of ZA therapy were studied in 14 patients aged 54 to 90. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were elevated to at least 40% above the normal reference range, and glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were ≥ 40 mL/minute. ZA (5 mg) was infused over 15 minutes. ALP and urine N-telopeptide/creatinine (NTx/Cr) were obtained before therapy and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and thereafter at 4-month intervals.

Results

At baseline, ALP ranged from 141 to 1,009 U/L. In 13 patients, ALP fell to normal following ZA administration. Remissions occurred in 9 patients who had not previously had a remission. Remissions varied from 12 to 60 months and were more prolonged in 4 patients with prior remissions ≤ 12 months. ZA failed to induce a remission in 1 patient. Ten to 12 days after therapy in 3 asymptomatic patients, serum calcium levels fell to 7.9, 8, and 8.3 mg/dL. Other than flu-like symptoms in 3 patients after ZA infusion, there were no other adverse effects.

Conclusion

Therapy with ZA induced remissions in 13/14 patients and induced more prolonged remissions in patients who previously had remissions ≤ 12 months. The lack of remission in 1 patient despite 2 courses of therapy is evidence of a continuing therapeutic challenge for some patients with a more resistant form of PD.

### Comparison of different intravenous bisphosphonate regimens for Paget's disease of bone [^f3bc6029]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

This randomized study compared different intravenous bisphosphonates in PDB. Zoledronate was superior with respect to pamidronate in achieving biochemical remission, with therapeutic response maintained in most patients at 15 mo. Single neridronate and zoledronate infusion showed a similar efficacy in up to 90% of patients nonresponders to pamidronate.

Introduction

Intravenous bisphosphonates represent a common therapy for Paget's disease of bone (PDB). However, there have been few head to head randomized trials comparing intravenous bisphosphonates.

Materials and Methods

We performed a 15-mo, randomized study comparing different intravenous bisphosphonates in 90 subjects with active PDB. At baseline, patients were randomly assigned to receive pamidronate (30 mg, i.v., for 2 consecutive days every 3 mo; n = 60) or zoledronate (4 mg, i.v.; n = 30). After 6 mo, nonresponders to pamidronate were crossed over to zoledronate or neridronate (100 mg, i.v., for 2 consecutive days). The primary efficacy endpoint was therapeutic response at 6 mo, defined as normalization of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or a reduction of at least 75% in total ALP excess.

Results

At 6 mo, 97% of patients receiving zoledronate had a therapeutic response compared with 45% of patients receiving pamidronate. Normalization of ALP was achieved in 93% of patients in the zoledronate group and in 35% of patients in the pamidronate group. ALP normalization was maintained in 79% and 65% of zoledronate-treated patients after 12 and 15 mo, respectively; loss of therapeutic response was observed in 2 of 30 (6%) at 12 and 15 mo. At 6 mo, 27 patients showing therapeutic response to pamidronate continued the treatment, whereas nonresponders were crossed-over to neridronate (n = 15) or zoledronate (n = 18). Among these subjects, 14 of 15 (93%) in the neridronate group and 17 of 18 (94%) in the zoledronate group achieved a therapeutic response. Similar normalization rates were observed between neridronate- (80%) and zoledronate- (83%) treated subjects. Normalization and therapeutic response were maintained at 9 mo from treatment (corresponding to 15 mo from the baseline visit) in either neridronate or zoledronate groups.

Conclusions

Single neridronate and zoledronate infusion showed a similar efficacy in achieving biochemical remission in up to 90% of patients nonresponders to pamidronate. Therapeutic response to zoledronate seems to be maintained in most patients at 15 mo.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^35754917]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosage is titrated based on laboratory testing, improvement in rickets and skeletal deformity on radiographs, and minimization of gastrointestinal and other side effects. Conventional therapy does not correct renal phosphate wasting, so, during treatment with calcitriol and phosphate, we do not target normal serum phosphorus due to safety concerns (nephrocalcinosis and hyperparathyroidism). Oral phosphate and calcitriol are administered multiple times a day due to short half-life and ongoing renal losses, limiting compliance.

Since the goal is for alkaline phosphatase and rickets to improve with treatment, it may be reasonable to increase doses of calcitriol or phosphate carefully to help reach this goal, unless the other safety laboratory assessments (normal to high serum phosphorus, high calcium, high PTH, or high urine calcium excretion) or other safety issues would prohibit that change. Recognize also that improvements in alkaline phosphatase takes time, and often alkaline phosphatase increases transiently on initiation of therapy for hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia. Once stable dosing (of calcitriol and phosphate, or of burosumab) is established, monitoring is recommended about every 3 to 4 months for serum phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as urine calcium and creatinine. Importantly if the fasting serum phosphorus is low on treatment, that is not itself an indication to adjust phosphate salts or calcitriol.

Treating non-FGF23–mediated hypophosphatemia is more complex; hypercalciuria is often present. HHRH is treated with phosphate salts as monotherapy because of inherently elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D and hypercalciuria. When treating HHRH with phosphate salts, high 1,25(OH) 2 D may persist, though hypercalciuria can improve, while phosphaturia persists and hyperparathyroidism remains a risk. Similarly, patients with renal tubulopathies are at risk for hypercalciuria, limiting treatment with active vitamin D and requiring careful monitoring for hypercalciuria and progressive kidney disease. Targeted therapy for cystinosis is available as cysteamine.

### Alendronate sodium [^aadc4b4d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Mineral Metabolism

Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with alendronate [see Contraindications (4)]. Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with alendronate.

Presumably due to the effects of alendronate on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur, especially in patients with Paget's disease, in whom the pretreatment rate of bone turnover may be greatly elevated, and in patients receiving glucocorticoids, in whom calcium absorption may be decreased.

Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is especially important in patients with Paget's disease of bone and in patients receiving glucocorticoids.

5.3 Musculoskeletal Pain

In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. This category of drugs includes alendronate. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.

In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate and placebo groups.

### Therapy with zoledronic acid, 5 mg, for a patient with paget disease of bone [^2cb5d3fe]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the effects of an infusion of zoledronic acid in a patient with Paget disease of bone (PD) who had been treated unsuccessfully with several other bisphosphonates.

Methods

The patient's treatment history is described, and his response to various bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid, is discussed.

Results

The patient was a 61-year-old man when a diagnosis of PD was made on the basis of an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 391 U/L (reference range, 45 to 135). Pagetic bone changes were noted on bone scan and x-ray examinations. Treatment with etidronate had no effect on ALP levels. This intervention was followed by 2 courses of intravenous therapy with pamidronate, which decreased ALP levels by 57% and 55% without inducing a remission. Subsequent oral treatment with alendronate and then risedronate yielded unsustained biochemical remissions of 6 months each. Most recently, therapy with an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid induced a remission that is thus far 20 months in duration. With this therapy, the patient has experienced no side effects, and he has noted a decrease in bone pain.

Conclusion

This case study shows that a patient with PD who received successive treatments with several bisphosphonates with inadequate responses or only brief remissions was more effectively treated with a single 5-mg infusion of zoledronic acid. This patient's therapeutic responses illustrate the relative efficacy of available bisphosphonates and the potential for longer-lasting remissions with zoledronic acid in patients with PD.

### Loss-of-function mutations in the ALPL gene presenting with adult onset osteoporosis and low serum concentrations of total alkaline phosphatase [^2dbf8c7d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Some missense variants in ALPL have been proposed to exert dominant negative effect on enzyme function, especially those located within functional domains. However, only the p.R391C variant has been tested for this in vitro with negative results. The results reported here support the view that the missense variants impair ALP function, but further research will be required with each variant to determine if this is due to a dominant negative effect or haploinsufficiency.

Within the clinic population, patients with low ALP tended to have lower BMD values than clinic controls with normal ALP. Although the differences were not significant, the number of patients with low ALP was small. Those with low ALP also had slightly lower serum albumin concentrations but did not have any other distinguishing clinical or biochemical characteristics. It is of interest, however, that missense variants in ALPL were significantly overrepresented in the osteoporosis clinic population with low ALP values compared with the general population, indicating that these variants may be a predisposing factor for osteoporosis.

To date, the only treatment approved for patients with HPP is bone‐targeted enzyme‐replacement therapy with asfotase alfa. Bisphosphonates are generally considered to be contraindicated in HPP because they can inhibit mineralization and because bisphosphonate treatment of adult patients with mild HPP has been associated with atypical femoral fractures., In this study, 10 patients with potentially damaging ALPL variants and osteoporosis had been treated with bisphosphonates and were followed up for an average of just over 6 years. Although the sample size was small, we found no evidence to suggest that patients with ALPL variants treated with bisphosphonates fared any worse than those without these variants, given that the number of low‐trauma fractures during follow‐up were similar in the two groups. One patient developed an atypical femoral fracture while on bisphosphonate therapy, but that individual had a normal level of ALP and had no deleterious variants in ALPL. Nonetheless, we think it would be appropriate to be cautious in treating patients who have low ALP with using bisphosphonates until further information is available on clinical outcomes from larger cohorts of patients to confirm whether this is the optimal mode of treatment for these patients.

Blood loss during elective orthopedic surgery

There was no evidence from randomized trials upon which to evaluate the effects of bisphosphonates compared with placebo, the effects of individual bisphosphonates, or the effects of other treatments on operative blood loss during elective surgery. Some information was available from observational studies on the relation between having received anti‐Pagetic treatment and operative blood loss. Wegrzyn reviewed the outcome of 39 cementless hip replacements in a series of 32 patients undergoing surgery in a French center between 1992 and 2006. 103 All patients received intravenous pamidronate before surgery and 31 of 39 (79%) hip replacements had been performed in patients with a normal total ALP at the time of surgery. The average blood loss was 744 mL (range 250–2000 mL), which the authors commented was greater than in patients undergoing similar procedures that did not have PDB (range 200–450 mL). Gabel 104 studied blood loss in 13 patients who had 16 total knee replacements (TKR) at a single US center between 1974 and 1986. The average blood loss was 481 mL (range 100–2000) and the authors commented that there was no difference between blood loss in patients who had previous treatment with either calcitonin or etidronate or those who did not have treatment. Similar findings were reported by Lee in 21 TKR from 20 patients referred to a US center between 1978 and 1999. 105 Blood loss was estimated as 300 mL (range 100–600 mL), but the authors found no difference between blood loss in patients who had or had not received preoperative treatment with etidronate (278 mL versus 315 mL, p = 0.32). 105 A systematic review conducted by Jorge‐Mora and colleagues reviewed the effects of anti‐Pagetic therapy on blood loss and other outcomes after elective spinal surgery in 17 case reports. 106 The most common indications for surgery were spinal cord compression (n = 8), spinal stenosis (n = 6), and back pain (n = 3). Bisphosphonate was given before the surgery in 7 patients, but the type of bisphosphonate used and the dose were not recorded. Bleeding was noted as a complication in 0 of 7 patients given bisphosphonate and 4 of 10 patients not given bisphosphonate (p = 0.22, Fisher's exact test). Parvizi and colleagues reported upon the influence of treatment on blood loss during osteotomy in 22 PDB patients. 107 Calcitonin was given to 6 patients and pamidronate to 3 patients before surgery. The authors commented that excessive bleeding was observed in all cases but did not define what was meant by excessive bleeding. They also commented that medical treatment significantly reduced intraoperative blood loss and that estimated blood loss was higher in patients with active disease but no data on blood loss or disease activity in these subgroups were provided.

### Therapy insight: the risks and benefits of bisphosphonates for the treatment of tumor-induced bone disease [^8296fa40]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

Bisphosphonates are a valuable class of drugs with potent anti-resorptive actions that make them ideal for skeletal protection in osteoporosis, cancer bone metastasis, multiple myeloma, and Paget's disease of bone. It has become apparent, however, that these drugs also have the potential to cause a number of adverse effects. While these do not limit bisphosphonate use, the incidence of these adverse events can be minimized if appropriate care is taken with their administration, and by maintaining appropriate surveillance and patient care. We review the range of adverse reactions to bisphosphonate therapy with a particular emphasis on the recently identified association between long-term bisphosphonate treatment and osteonecrosis of the jaw. This is a potentially serious side effect seen mostly in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer bone metastases who receive intravenous bisphosphonate treatment. While the etiology is uncertain, a strong association with dental pathology and interventions highlights the need for close attention to dental health in this patient group.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^74cfc567]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — presenting signs and skeletal features include that many patients are asymptomatic and the disease is discovered when a radiograph or bone scan is performed for another indication or when an elevated serum ALP level is found on a multiphasic screening chemistry panel; patients usually have a single bone or several bones affected, with the pelvis, vertebrae, skull, femur, and tibia most frequently involved; a hallmark is skeletal deformity with increased size and/or abnormal shape, increased warmth over an affected bone (usually the tibia) attributed to increased blood flow, and skeletal growth or expansion that becomes clinically obvious when the skull, jaw, clavicle, femur, or tibia are involved.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^02d6b4b5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The Panel Proposes

Provide ongoing care by an expert in metabolic bone disease who recognizes the importance of multidisciplinary services at the transition to adulthood — along with patient support groups — to address disease-related comorbidities.
Continue medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) for at least several years following epiphyseal closure enabling the optimization of peak bone mass which occurs at approximately 20 to 25 years of age in asymptomatic individuals.
Provide medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) in the presence of symptoms or biochemical/histological evidence of osteomalacia (bone pain, weakness, osteomalacic fractures, elevated ALP, or osteomalacia on bone biopsy)
Optimize medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) prior to undertaking orthopedic surgeries or dental implant surgeries.
Provide ongoing adult care with pharmacotherapeutic management (with either burosumab or conventional therapy) with consideration of the benefits and risks of therapy and the patient's capacity for ongoing monitoring.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low to mid normal (peak) or just below the normal or low normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
If burosumab is not available, symptomatic adults should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts).
Phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), the fasting serum phosphorus should not serve as a target. It is not necessary to achieve normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to treat XLH, and the high phosphate loads used to accomplish this often lead to severe hyperparathyroidism.
Treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate salts should be modified to avoid hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.
Burosumab is contraindicated in CKD (GFR less than 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use may be considered in the presence of an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring.
Treat hypertension using current regional recommendations pertaining to hypertension management.
Treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of hypercalcemia, where multi-gland involvement is anticipated, with off-label use of calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) to lower PTH levels, with careful monitoring of serum calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia remain uncontrolled, a subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Treat hypercalciuria by reducing the dose of active vitamin D, and in persistent hypercalciuria, hydrochlorothiazide or potassium citrate may be used. The panel also proposes a low sodium intake (< 1500 mg/day) and increased fluid intake up to 3 L/24 hours in the presence of hypercalciuria.
Early referral to the spinal team with physiotherapy in cases of spinal scoliosis.
Treat spinal scoliosis with surgical fixation if the Cobb angle is greater than 30 degrees depending on the rate of progression and location of the curve.

### Bisphosphonates for cancer patients: why, how, and when? [^0aa29491]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Bisphosphonates (BPs) are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and it is well accepted that tumor cells in bone, especially breast cancer and myeloma cells, can stimulate osteoclast formation and activity leading to the release of growth factors or cytokines, which will further stimulate cancer cells' growth and their secretion of osteolytic factors. BPs are now the standard treatment for cancer hypercalcemia, for which a dose of 90 mg of pamidronate or 1500 mg of clodronate is recommended; the former compound is more potent and has a longer lasting effect. Repeated pamidronate infusions exert clinically relevant analgesic effects in more than half of patients with metastatic bone pain. Recent data suggest that non-responding patients should perhaps be treated with higher doses. The optimal dose actually remains to be defined, especially as it is thought that it is probably a function of the disease stage. Regular pamidronate infusions can also achieve a partial objective response according to conventional UICC criteria and they can almost double the objective response rate to chemotherapy. Lifelong administration of oral clodronate to patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone reduces the frequency of morbid skeletal events by more than one-fourth. Two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials comparing monthly 90 mg pamidronate infusions to placebo infusions for 1–2 years in addition to hormone or chemotherapy in patients with at least one lytic bone metastasis have shown that the mean skeletal morbidity rate could be reduced by 30–40%. The results obtained with intravenous BPs are generally viewed as better than those obtained with oral clodronate. However, preference can be given to the oral route when BPs are started early in the process of metastatic bone disease in a patient receiving hormone therapy. According to the recently published ASCO guidelines, pamidronate 90 mg i.v. delivered over 2 h every 3–4 weeks can be recommended in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have imaging evidence of lytic destruction of bone and who are concurrently receiving systemic therapy with hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ASCO Panel considered it "reasonable" to start i.v. BPs in women with localized pain whose bone scans were abnormal and plain radiographs normal, but not when an abnormal bone scan is asymptomatic. The pertinence of these criteria is discussed below. Because BPs are providing supportive care, reducing the rate of skeletal morbidity but evidently not abolishing it, the criteria for stopping their administration have to be different from those used for classic antineoplastic drugs, and they should not be stopped when metastatic bone disease is progressing. However, criteria to determine whether and for how long an individual patient benefits from their administration are lacking. New biochemical markers of bone resorption might help identify those patients continuing to benefit from therapy. Even better results have been achieved in patients with multiple myeloma, and the general consensus is that BPs should be started as soon as the diagnosis of lytic disease is made in myeloma patients. On the other hand, data are scanty in prostate cancer, but large-scale trials with potent BPs are ongoing or planned in such patients. Similar results to those achieved with pamidronate have been obtained with monthly 6-mg infusions of the newer BP ibandronate in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. The tolerance of ibandronate could be better, and the drug has the potential to be administered as a 15- to 30-min infusion. Zoledronate can also be administered safely as a 15-min 4-mg infusion, and large scale phase III trials have just been completed. These newer BPs will simplify the current therapeutic schemes and improve the cost-effectiveness ratio; they also have the potential to improve the therapeutic efficacy, at least in patients with an aggressive osteolytic disease or when given as adjuvant therapy. For that matter, initial data with clodronate indicate that they have the potential to prevent the development of bone metastases, but the use of BPs in the adjuvant setting must still be viewed as experimental.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in children: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^5ec4fbb3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

How to Treat?

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS* (GRADEd)

In children 12 months of age and older with XLH, we recommend burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).
In children 6–12 months of age with XLH, we suggest burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

* We recognize that there may be limitations to drug therapy accessibility

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (NON-GRADEd)

The panel proposes

Commence medical therapy promptly upon confirming XLH diagnosis and hypophosphatemia to optimize outcomes.
Treatment is directed at improving radiographic, biochemical and clinical signs of rickets (serum ALP, total or bone-specific), lower limb deformity, physical function, and the optimization of growth by addressing the mineral metabolism abnormalities of XLH.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low- to mid-normal (peak) or just below the normal or low-normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
Optimal management with burosumab entails dose adjustments based on optimizing serum phosphorus levels for age rather than solely based on weight increases to avoid increasing the risk of hyperphosphatemia.
If burosumab is not available, children should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D, usually combined with phosphate salts). Conventional therapy is advised over no treatment.
Active vitamin D can be administered with or without phosphate salts, but phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), avoid targeting normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to prevent phosphate overdosing or toxicity.
Adjust active vitamin D and oral phosphate therapy with the aim to lower, and to normalize alkaline phosphatase activity, if this can be safely achieved, and promote normal linear growth. However, phosphate doses exceeding 60 mg elemental phosphorus/kg/day are rarely well-tolerated. The active vitamin D dose should be decreased in the presence of persistent hypercalciuria. However, unbalanced increases in the phosphate doses without raising active vitamin D doses increases the risk of sustained hyperparathyroidism.
Consider decreasing the phosphate dose or increasing the active vitamin D dose (the latter, in the absence of hypercalciuria/hypercalcemia) if PTH levels are consistently elevated, as phosphate stimulates PTH secretion and calcitriol can suppress PTH.
The routine use of recombinant human growth hormone for children with XLH and short stature is not advised due to limited benefit noted in randomized clinical trials.
Early involvement of orthopedic surgery is crucial to assess for the necessity, and the timing of, any corrective procedures.
In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, multigland involvement is expected. Calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) can be used on an off-label basis to decrease PTH level in the setting of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, while ensuring close monitoring of serum calcium in order to avoid hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia cannot be controlled, subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Burosumab is contraindicated in chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use is advised if eGFR is between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring for hyperphosphatemia and changes in eGFR.
If clinic blood pressure measures consistently exceed the 95th percentile (for age and height) confirmation with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or serial home blood pressure measurements is indicated. Treatment should follow current pediatric hypertension recommendations.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions – bridging the past with the future [^2a8f5c95]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines. PHPT in general, does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium. parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery. The issues outlined in this presentation and further amplified in other presentations given in this workshop lead to a series of questions that, in turn, may lead to modified guidelines for the management of these patients. The questions are as follows. (1) Should there be any changes in diagnostic criteria for PHPT? (2) Should the guidelines for surgery in PHPT be changed in light of new data over the past decade? What should those guidelines be? (3) At present, is there sufficient evidence of clinical benefit with specific medical therapies to recommend their use? In which patients? (4) Can some patients be followed without surgery? If so, how should they be monitored? (5) When surgery is the preferred option, what are the relative merits of minimally invasive procedures compared with more conventional surgery? (6) What is the role of localization techniques in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue preoperatively and intraoperatively? Are they sufficiently helpful and cost effective to warrant their use in all patients who undergo parathyroid surgery? If not, in what patients should they be recommended? (7) What items should be placed on the research agenda for PHPT over the next decade?

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, bisphosphonates, ES 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or ibandronate) as initial therapy to reduce fracture risk in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fractures.

### Paget's disease of bone: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^73332119]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Medium credibility.

Paget's disease of bone — treatment efficacy assessment emphasizes endpoint limitations and marker surrogacy. It is desirable that treatment efficacy should be evaluated using event-driven endpoints, but such data are less available in Paget's disease than in some other conditions, and many trials have used bone turnover markers as the primary endpoint. There is evidence that potent bisphosphonates produce objective improvement in bone histology, radiographic lytic lesions, bone scintigraphy, pain, and quality of life, and that these changes are reflected in changes in markers. There is no possibility of studies appropriately powered to address harder endpoints in the foreseeable future, so decisions must be based on these available data.

### Persistent effect of zoledronic acid in Paget's disease [^7d9e84dd]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Paget's bone disease is a disorder in which bone regions with high turnover are replaced by new, vascular, but disorganized and immature bone with excessive fibrosis, high tendency of deformity and diminished mechanical resistance. Treatment aims at the suppression of osteoclast activity and is achieved with bisphosphonates, which represent the treatment of choice for Paget's disease. Zoledronic acid, a relatively new member of this class, normalizes alkaline phosphatase in the majority of patients and has a favorable safety profile. We report the case of an asymptomatic patient who was diagnosed with Paget's disease based on typical biochemical, radiological and histological findings and was treated with a single intravenous infusion of 4 mg of zoledronic acid. No side effects were observed. Alkaline phosphatase levels normalized within four months. At the last follow up examination, three years after treatment, the patient remains asymptomatic, without significant changes in radiology imaging, and alkaline phosphatase levels are still within the normal range. In conclusion, zoledronic acid, apart from being safe and effective in Paget's disease, also appears to be able to achieve significantly prolonged remissions.
