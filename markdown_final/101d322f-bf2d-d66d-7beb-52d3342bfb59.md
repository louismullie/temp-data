## Question

Digital therapeutics are different from mobile health appa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how digital therapeutics (DTx) differ from mobile health (mHealth) apps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and scope. Then, I should verify regulatory status and pathways. Next, I will examine evidence requirements and clinical validation. After that, I need to check clinical use models, access, and integration. I will then review safety, quality, and governance. Finally, I will synthesize the key distinctions and consider exceptions and edge cases, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Digital therapeutics are evidence-based therapeutic interventions delivered via high-quality software to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease, and they are used independently or with other therapies to optimize outcomes; this is the Digital Therapeutics Alliance definition adopted across multiple sources, and it implies a treatment-level claim rather than mere wellness support [^c6c01b78] [^0a918a47]. By contrast, mobile health apps are a broader category of mobile technologies that support health objectives, including wellness, tracking, education, and communication; many mHealth apps are consumer-facing and not designed as treatments, which places them outside the DTx umbrella unless they meet therapeutic claims and evidence standards [^bca2fadf] [^430c6f23].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory dimension because this is where confusion often arises. DTx products are regulated as medical devices in many jurisdictions, typically as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD), and may require FDA clearance or approval via 510(k), de novo, or PMA pathways depending on risk and novelty; examples include reSET for substance use disorder and AspyreRx for type 2 diabetes, which underwent rigorous review and are prescription-only in the U.S [^c6c01b78] [^259807fc]. In contrast, most mHealth apps are not regulated as medical devices unless they make diagnostic or therapeutic claims; the FDA exercises enforcement discretion for many low-risk wellness apps, and only a subset of mHealth apps meet the definition of a mobile medical application subject to device regulation [^30b693b1] [^d9bf2583].

> I need to check the evidence bar next. DTx must demonstrate clinically meaningful outcomes in randomized controlled trials or equivalent high-quality studies to support regulatory authorization and payer coverage; for example, AspyreRx reduced HbA1c by about 0.3–0.4% versus control in a 180-day RCT, and multiple meta-analyses show DTx for hypertension reduce systolic/diastolic blood pressure versus usual care, reflecting a treatment-level effect size expectation [^259807fc] [^4593ac4c]. Hold on, I should verify the counterexample: a recent RCT of a prescribed migraine app failed to show superiority over a control app, underscoring that not all "prescribable" digital health apps meet efficacy thresholds and that RCTs remain the cornerstone for validating DTx claims [^3bb53fb5] [^3f740fa2]. By comparison, many mHealth apps lack robust evidence; systematic reviews show most apps are untested or supported by small, short-term, high-risk-of-bias studies, and popular app-store metrics do not correlate with clinical utility, highlighting a stark evidence gap relative to DTx [^b33bfae2] [^d6e68c52] [^cf05fbc6].

> Let me consider clinical use and access models, because this affects real-world adoption. DTx are often prescription-only, integrated into care pathways, and sometimes reimbursed; clinicians can monitor patient progress via dashboards, and patients access the product through enrollment codes or pharmacy-like fulfillment, which aligns with a medical device workflow rather than a consumer app experience [^22fe1ab5]. In contrast, mHealth apps are typically direct-to-consumer, downloaded from app stores, variably integrated with clinical systems, and rarely covered by payers; this creates a fragmented landscape where clinicians struggle to identify quality options and patients face information overload without quality assurance [^e0655fe8] [^90202a1e].

> I should confirm safety, quality, and governance distinctions. DTx are held to medical-device standards for risk management, clinical safety, cybersecurity, and post-market surveillance; developers must document intended use, contraindications, and adverse events, and regulators scrutinize algorithmic transparency and updates, which is a higher bar than consumer apps face [^d9bf2583] [^db21e8fd]. Conversely, many mHealth apps operate with minimal oversight, and evaluations show poor performance on clinical content, technical reliability, and alignment with end-user needs; this variability contributes to clinician skepticism and patient safety concerns in the absence of standardized validation frameworks [^cf05fbc6] [^efc4b70d].

> But wait, what if an mHealth app starts making treatment claims — does it become a DTx? Hold on, I should verify that nuance. Yes, function dictates classification: if a mobile app is intended to diagnose, treat, mitigate, or prevent disease, it may be regulated as a medical device and, if it meets evidence standards, could be considered a DTx; however, most consumer mHealth apps do not meet these thresholds and remain wellness or support tools rather than treatments [^30b693a1] [^d9bf2583]. I should double-check that this boundary is consistent with FDA guidance distinguishing low-risk wellness tools from higher-risk SaMD that require premarket review, which it is [^30b693a1].

> Let me synthesize the key distinctions succinctly. DTx are treatment-grade, evidence-based, regulated medical devices designed to deliver therapeutic benefit for specific diseases, whereas mHealth apps are a broad, mostly unregulated category of mobile tools that support health, wellness, or communication without guaranteed clinical efficacy; this difference manifests in regulatory pathways, evidentiary rigor, clinical integration, and safety governance, with DTx resembling pharmaceuticals or devices in development and deployment, while mHealth apps resemble consumer software [^c6c01b78] [^bca2fadf] [^e0655fe8].

> Finally, I should review practical implications so the distinction guides clinical decision-making. When selecting digital tools, clinicians should confirm whether a product has regulatory clearance or approval, review RCT data for clinically meaningful outcomes, assess integration with the EHR and care workflow, and consider payer coverage; for DTx, this means verifying FDA status and pivotal trial results, while for mHealth apps, it means scrutinizing validation studies, usability, and security, recognizing that most lack sufficient evidence to be "prescribed" as therapy [^e0655fe8] [^cf05fbc6] [^259807fc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some mHealth apps may still be useful adjuncts, but they should not be equated with DTx in terms of therapeutic claims or regulatory assurance without explicit evidence and labeling to that effect [^c6c01b78].

---

Digital therapeutics (DTx) are **clinically validated, FDA-regulated software** that deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions to prevent, manage, or treat disease [^c6c01b78], whereas mobile health (mHealth) apps are **consumer-facing tools** for wellness, tracking, or education that typically lack rigorous clinical validation and regulatory oversight [^ef257c4b]. DTx require **prescription or clinician oversight**, demonstrate outcomes in RCTs [^3bb53fb5], and integrate with clinical workflows, whereas mHealth apps are self-selected, variably evidence-based, and rarely integrated into care [^e0655fe8]. This distinction matters for **clinical adoption, reimbursement, and patient safety** [^e0655fe8].

## Definitions and core distinctions

| **Attribute** | **Digital therapeutics (dtx)** | **Mobile health (mhealth) apps** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Evidence-based therapeutic interventions delivered via software to prevent, manage, or treat disease [^c6c01b78] | Mobile tools for wellness, tracking, or education [^bca2fadf] |
| Regulatory status | FDA-regulated as medical devices (SaMD) [^d9bf2583] | Largely unregulated; not medical devices [^5972db3d] |
| Clinical evidence | RCTs demonstrating efficacy and safety [^3bb53fb5] | Limited or inconsistent evidence [^b33bfae2] |
| Clinical integration | Prescription-based; integrated into care [^22fe1ab5] | Self-selected; rarely integrated [^e0655fe8] |
| Examples | reSET (SUD), AspyreRx (T2D), EndeavorRx (ADHD) [^c6c01b78] [^259807fc] | MyFitnessPal, Headspace, Apple Health [^notfound] |

---

## Regulatory oversight and clinical validation

DTx undergo **rigorous FDA review** (510(k), De Novo, or PMA) [^d9bf2583] to ensure safety, efficacy, and quality [^c6c01b78], whereas mHealth apps are generally unregulated unless they make medical claims [^5972db3d]. DTx are supported by RCTs showing clinically meaningful outcomes [^3bb53fb5], whereas mHealth apps often lack robust evidence [^b33bfae2].

---

## Clinical integration and use

DTx are **prescribed or clinician-supervised** and integrated into care with monitoring and outcomes tracking [^22fe1ab5], whereas mHealth apps are user-initiated with minimal clinical integration [^e0655fe8]. DTx align with treat-to-target strategies and shared decision-making, whereas mHealth apps are typically adjunctive and not care-coordinated [^f1b5edbe].

---

## Evidence base and clinical outcomes

DTx have **strong RCT evidence** for conditions such as SUD, T2D, ADHD, and hypertension [^c6c01b78] [^4593ac4c], whereas mHealth apps show variable, often low-quality evidence [^b33bfae2] [^d6e68c52]. DTx demonstrate durable, clinically significant benefits, whereas mHealth apps often show small, short-term effects [^259807fc] [^b09a08aa].

---

## Patient safety and quality assurance

DTx adhere to **medical device standards** for safety, quality, and post-market surveillance [^d9bf2583], whereas mHealth apps have minimal quality controls and may pose safety risks [^cf05fbc6]. DTx undergo continuous monitoring and updates, whereas mHealth apps rarely do [^notfound].

---

## Reimbursement and market access

DTx are increasingly covered by payers given their evidence and regulatory status, whereas mHealth apps are **rarely reimbursed** due to limited evidence and lack of regulatory endorsement [^e0655fe8]. DTx have defined CPT codes and pathways, whereas mHealth apps do not [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications and future directions

DTx are poised to **transform chronic disease management** by expanding access, improving adherence, and enabling personalized care [^c6c01b78], whereas mHealth apps will remain useful for wellness and engagement but are unlikely to replace DTx in treatment. Clinicians should prioritize DTx with strong evidence and regulatory backing, and use mHealth apps as supportive tools [^e0655fe8].

---

Digital therapeutics are **clinically validated, regulated treatments** integrated into care, whereas mHealth apps are consumer tools with limited evidence. This distinction drives adoption, reimbursement, and safety, and should guide clinical decision-making.

### Regulating digital health technologies with transparency: the case for dynamic and multi-stakeholder evaluation [^d9bdff0e]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of smartphones today, paired with the increasing precision and therapeutic potential of digital capabilities, offers unprecedented opportunity in the field of digital medicine. Smartphones offer novel accessibility, unique insights into physical and cognitive behavior, and diverse resources designed to aid health. Many of these digital resources, however, are developed and shared at a faster rate than they can be assessed for efficacy, safety, and security-presenting patients and clinicians with the challenge of distinguishing helpful tools from harmful ones.

Main Text

Leading regulators, such as the FDA in the USA and the NHS in the UK, are working to evaluate the influx of mobile health applications entering the market. Efforts to regulate, however, are challenged by the need for more transparency. They require real-world data on the actual use, effects, benefits, and harms of these digital health tools. Given rapid product cycles and frequent updates, even the most thorough evaluation is only as accurate as the data it is based on.

Conclusions

In this debate piece, we propose a complementary approach to ongoing efforts via a dynamic self-certification checklist. We outline how simple self-certification, validated or challenged by app users, would enhance transparency, engage diverse stakeholders in meaningful education and learning, and incentivize the design of safe and secure medical apps.

### A prescribed digital health app and number of migraine days: a randomized clinical trial [^3bb53fb5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is a prescribed mobile app more effective than a control app in reducing the number of migraine days among patients with migraine headaches in Germany?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 477 patients with migraine, the prescribable digital health app did not demonstrate a superior reduction in the number of migraine days compared with a control app that provided only basic documentation features during a 12-week period.

Meaning

The findings suggest that even if promising observational data exist for digital therapeutics, robust randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness.

### The effect of digital therapeutics intervention on improving hypertension management in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^55a0da9e]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Mobile health and telemedicine technologies have great potential for development in chronic disease management in recent years. Several review articles evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth or smartphone apps for promoting blood pressure management, medication adherence, and lifestyle improvement. Nevertheless, despite the widespread availability of mobile health interventions and software as a medical device(SaMD) claiming to promote hypertension control or medication adherence, not many products have been developed with the involvement of health professionals, have an independent core program, and have been rigorously validated for BP-lowering efficacy. In 2019, the International Digital Therapeutics Alliance defined digital therapeutics (DTx) as, delivering evidence-based therapeutic interventions that are driven by high-quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. Digital therapeutics emphasizes evidence-based interventions and high-quality devices to optimize patient care and health outcomes, further rigorously specifying the techniques and categories of digital interventions used for disease treatment and management. Some randomized controlled trials (RCTs), such as HERB-DH1, demonstrated the efficacy of digital therapeutics systems in reducing BP and improving home self-measurement without medications compared with conventional lifestyle interventions. A 2023 narrative review reported potential BP-lowering mechanisms of DTx in hypertension and the process of treating hypertension with DTx. However, due to the ambiguity of the necessary attributes of DTx and the lack of consistency of diverse interventions of DTx products, the analysis only reported a review of the mhealth app interventions. The evidence on the digital therapeutic approach has not yet been synthesized and appraised and the pooled quantitative effect of DTx in hypertension management remained unclear.

Therefore, the current systematic review and meta-analysis centers on the ability of DTx products to generate and deliver validated and measurable medical effects directly to hypertension patients from RCTs, including lower BP and other relevant characteristics. It also further explores where the effects varied by trial duration, and setting, as well as to identify individuals who might benefit most from digital therapeutics products.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^d3a9ac4a]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With the arrival of digital therapeutics (DTx), digital health products are becoming more and more sophisticated—closer to medicines than to apps. Digital therapeutics use technology like data analytics, artificial intelligence and an understanding of behavioral psychology to provide an alternative to current typical methods of chronic disease treatment. They can collect health data in real time, all the time, via wearable devices and applications, and communicate it, pre-analyzed, to health care practitioners and patients, providing them with an infinitely more complete understanding of the patient’s condition and habits to inform care plans. They enable patients to maintain frequent contact with health care professionals (HCPs), to keep them motivated and help them take specific actions when required. Both parties come to appointments with reliable information and can use the consultation to develop, together, a much more compliable care plan, with the HCP aware of progress and able to take actions to motivate or change the course of treatment if necessary. Their potential to improve the management of chronic diseases, such as Diabetes, is huge. However, they continue to present something of a grey area in terms of regulation. How should developers of these exciting new products maximize their ability to improve patient outcomes and continue to innovate while ensuring patient safety? In this article we consider the benefits and potential risks of digital therapeutics, the current regulatory situation, the responsibility of developers to “self-regulate”, and ways they can do this—including by setting the HCP front and center.

### What is the clinical value of mHealth for patients? [^ef257c4b]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite growing interest from both patients and healthcare providers, there is little clinical guidance on how mobile apps should be utilized to add value to patient care. We categorize apps according to their functionality (e.g. preventative behavior change, digital self-management of a specific condition, diagnostic) and discuss evidence for effectiveness from published systematic reviews and meta-analyses and the relevance to patient care. We discuss the limitations of the current literature describing clinical outcomes from mHealth apps, what FDA clearance means now (510(k)/de novo FDA clearance) and in the future. We discuss data security and privacy as a major concern for patients when using mHealth apps. Patients are often not involved in the development of mobile health guidelines, and professionals' views regarding high-quality health apps may not reflect patients' views. We discuss efforts to develop guidelines for the development of safe and effective mHealth apps in the US and elsewhere and the role of independent app reviews sites in identifying mHealth apps for patient care. There are only a small number of clinical scenarios where published evidence suggests that mHealth apps may improve patient outcomes.

### Beyond validation: getting health apps into clinical practice [^cc1f16a9]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Digital technology offers tremendous potential for improving the prevention, diagnosis and management of disease. The proliferation of health apps in particular—there are now more than 300,000 which have been developed—is changing how patients interact with the healthcare system. Through apps, patients can have immediate access to their health data, schedule virtual visits with their providers, integrate with devices like blood pressure cuffs, manage medication dosing, improve wellness, and many other health-related activities. Apps are also increasingly accessible especially via smartphones—more Americans now have a smartphone than a desktop or laptop computer.

Health apps exist on a spectrum: from consumer facing, non-regulated, non-interventional apps like fitness trackers, to regulated, prescription-only apps like a digital therapeutic to manage substance use disorder. Some are standalone apps, while others require connection to an external device, like an inhaler. Here, we consider apps that are used by individuals, typically on a mobile device such as a smartphone or smartwatch, to support many aspects of health—including, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Similar to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition of a “Mobile Application,” we define “apps” as software applications that may run on a variety of mobile platforms or be web-based but optimized for mobile devices.There is significant work underway to develop apps, build an evidence base, validate functionality, create standards for development, and design frameworks for app evaluations. – Capital is pouring in—more than $9 billion was invested by venture capital and private equity towards digital health companies in 2018, $2 billion more than 2017.Additionally, the FDA recently launched a Digital Health Innovation Action Plan.A key component of this plan is a new regulatory pathway for certain software devices called “precertification” that is intended to streamline approval by focusing on application developers and processes as opposed to specific products. In 2018, the World Health Organization published guidelines on digital health interventions,and recently, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published an evidence framework for digital health technologies.

### Mobile app validation: a digital health scorecard approach [^f1009bed]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Digital health technologies, including mobile health applications (apps), hold great potential to improve American health and healthcare—there is nearly ubiquitous use of smartphones by Americans and an ever-growing and increasingly sophisticated suite of health apps. These apps are providing a wide range of medical functions that span the care continuum from prevention to diagnosis to care management,. They are also increasingly demonstrating an impact on clinical outcomes with recent successes in cancer, cardiac health, and mental health. The adoption of these digital solutions is further amplified by their accessibility, low cost, and personalized features. In addition, their ability to provide practical functions such as health education, tracking of symptoms and side effects, appointment management, and social support make them compelling healthcare tools.

While the range and number of healthcare apps directly accessible to patients continue to grow, it remains difficult to reliably discern quality, which is hindered by the lack of standardized evaluation and validation processes,. Historically, only a fraction of health apps are appropriate for use, which is concerning since patients are influenced by the health information they discover on their own. In addition, common online metrics (e.g. star rating or the number of downloads) do not correlate with clinical utility or validity. While identifying quality in mobile apps is an issue for all stakeholders in medicine, it is more acutely experienced by patients and physicians who directly seek these solutions. As the technology capabilities underpinning these apps increase, so do the potential risks. This trend makes the need for nimble evaluation even greater. Several recent studies have provided a broad overview of mobile apps in oncology, and others have focused on provider, and patient perspectivesin general; however, very few have focused on the pragmatic implementation of app evaluation. Moreover, widely cited generalized mobile app evaluation frameworks, like the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS), are underdeveloped in the area of clinical appropriateness. The App Quality Assessment Tool or Health-Related Apps (AQUA)combines MARS with Enlight, an assessment tool that does incorporate therapeutic concepts. However, this tool, as with its component frameworks, does not include key technical elements beyond privacy and security of data. The THESIS approachuses the domains of transparency, health content, technical content, security/privacy, usability, and subjective ratings. However, it is does not incorporate clinical evidence. While these frameworks have advanced quality assessment, a pragmatic quality assessment tool that incorporates end-user requirements as well as technical, usability, and clinical dimensions is still needed.

### Digital therapeutic based randomized investigation to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and residual hyperglycemia on stable medical therapy: rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the BRIGHT trial [^0ba739b6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

An advantage of a digital therapeutic over pharmacotherapy is that the treatment effect may be expected to persist after the treatment course is completed.Moreover, digital therapeutics offer innovative solutions for managing diabetes by integrating technology with personalized care. The interventions include tools such as mobile apps, wearable devices, and telehealth platforms to monitor glucose levels, provide behavioral advises, and enhance medication adherence. Digital therapeutics empower patients to make informed decisions about their health, improving glycemic control and reducing complications. Additionally, the streamlined communication between patients and health care providers through digital therapeutics may support to improve outcomes and quality of life of patients affected by diabetes. However, different questions are still unsolved such as the long‐term benefits and safety as well as the real‐world application and generalizability of digital therapeutics.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^bf8ae099]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

The potential risk has been around ever since digital health applications could be downloaded by anyone with a smartphone—as far back as 2011, one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world was forced to withdraw its rheumatology calculator app after errors were found in its calculation formulas. Ten years later, there is an exponentially larger number and variety of applications—over 350,000 are currently available to consumers according to a recent IQVIA study. In general, these are either wellness-related, or what the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory body (FDA) classifies as “low risk” applications. They are simple to download from the App or Play Store without any prescription, qualification, or oversight—and the potential for damage is likewise generally fairly limited.

However, the latest generation of digital health applications—digital therapeutics or “software as medical device” (SaMD)—are far more advanced in their ability to diagnose and offer treatment advice. According to the Digital Therapeutics Alliance (DTA), digital therapeutics “deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions that are driven by high quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. They are used independently or in concert with medications, devices, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes”.

Challenges in chronic diseases treatment—the impact of DTx on data analysis

DTx are varied but tend to work with chronic diseases or neurological disorders. Chronic noncommunicable diseases have become the biggest killers in Latin America and across the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), they now account for seven of the ten main causes of death globally. In Latin America a third of adults suffer from at least one chronic disease, while two thirds of deaths are related to one or various of them. Yet, even as they become more prevalent, they are still poorly served by most healthcare systems, which are set up to manage acute illness: sudden, with clear symptoms and of limited duration, to be dealt with by one or a small number of discrete medical interventions. Chronic illness on the other hand is often characterized by a slow onset and unclear symptoms, and requires monitoring and attention for the long-term or even for life. Trying to deal with the latter with a system set up for the former means that treatment for chronic disease can be fearsomely inefficient, leading to repeating cycles of worsening health, leading to hospitalizations or emergency interventions.

### Development features and study characteristics of mobile health apps in the management of chronic conditions: a systematic review of randomised trials [^d6e68c52]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings highlight further methodological issues concerning app testing.

A recent review of study protocols available via clinicaltrials.gov examined the clinical evidence underlying digital health interventions, highlighting the studies’ relatively low quality, small size and limited likelihood of being significantly powered to demonstrate treatment effects compared to drugs and traditional medical devices, which mandate stricter regulatory guidelines on safety and efficacy. Although we considered published peer-reviewed reports of interventional studies and not study protocols, our results agree with the previous contribution: relatively short follow-ups—only 13 studies followed up >6 months—and median sample size of 94 patients, with several studies adopting convenience sampling and others not reaching the expected enrolment level or inadequately accounting for drop-out rates in their sample size calculations. Furthermore, 28 were pilot RCTs in need of subsequent investigation. Also, formal risk-of-bias assessment performed according to standard tools revealed a high risk of bias for the majority of RCTs, highlighting the inability of both currently published studies and available assessment metrics to keep up with the specific methodological challenges of mobile apps.

These results should be assessed considering the ongoing literature debate on the evaluation of digital health interventions and mHealth apps. While some reject digital exceptionalism and accept RCTs as the golden standard, others think that digital technologies cannot be held to the same standards as new drugs/devicesand support the adoption of more agile, yet equally robust, methodologies. Given the distinguishing characteristics of mHealth apps, designs other than parallel-group RCTs have been proposed. These include the multiphase optimisation strategy (MOST), the sequential multiple assignment randomised trial (SMART) and the micro-randomised trial –. This also seems to be the direction embraced by some regulatory bodies such as—for instance—the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, BfArM) that recognises the relevance of alternative study designs and methods such as Pragmatic Clinical Trials, SMART or MOST.

### Cognitive behavioral therapy delivered via digital mobile application for the treatment of type 2 diabetes: rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of a randomized, controlled trial [^18516e14]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to rise in the United States and worldwide. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to improve glycemic control in patients with T2D, but broad implementation has been limited by inherent access and resource constraints. Digital therapeutics have the potential to overcome these obstacles.

Hypothesis

To describe the rationale and design of a trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of a digital therapeutic providing CBT to improve glycemic control in adults with T2D.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial evaluates the hypothesis that BT-001, an investigational digital therapeutic intended to help patients with T2D improve their glycemic control, on top of standard of care therapy, will lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to a control app across a broad range of patients in a real-world setting. The study is designed to provide evidence to support FDA review of this device as a digital therapeutic. The intervention is provided within the digital application (app) and includes no person-to-person coaching. The primary endpoint is the difference in HbA1c change from baseline to 90 days for BT-001-allocated subjects compared with those assigned to the control app. Safety assessment includes adverse events and adverse device effects. The study incorporates pragmatic features including entirely remote conduct with at-home visits for physical measures and blood sample collection.

Conclusions

This randomized, controlled trial evaluates a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered via smartphone app which has the potential to provide a scalable treatment option for patients with T2D.

### Behavioral digital therapeutics in gastrointestinal conditions: where are we now and where should we Go? [^ad85e1a4]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Behavioral digital therapeutics represents a diverse range of health technology tools that can offer beneficial options for patients with gastrointestinal disorders, particularly with the shortage of mental health providers. Challenges to the uptake of behavioral digital interventions exist and can be addressed with mobile device applications, improved interoperability of technology platforms, and flexible integration into clinical practice.

### Personalized medicine: risk prediction, targeted therapies and mobile health technology [^d5cc3cdf]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Personalized medicine is increasingly being employed across many areas of clinical practice, as genes associated with specific diseases are discovered and targeted therapies are developed. Mobile apps are also beginning to be used in medicine with the aim of providing a personalized approach to disease management. In some areas of medicine, patient-tailored risk prediction and treatment are applied routinely in the clinic, whereas in other fields, more work is required to translate scientific advances into individualized treatment. In this forum article, we asked specialists in oncology, neurology, endocrinology and mobile health technology to discuss where we are in terms of personalized medicine, and address their visions for the future and the challenges that remain in their respective fields.

### Why is it so difficult to govern mobile apps in healthcare? [^43556fe8]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2019). High credibility.

Our key conclusion is that the area of health apps is immature; this is unsurprising as apps are a radical and new development, which relies on sophisticated technology that has a record of frequent innovation. Patients, clinicians, developers and regulators are inevitably beholden to this current immaturity. Unlike established healthcare fields (eg, pharmaceuticals, radiotherapy, anaesthetics, etc) there is—as yet—no professional foundation, such as requiring certified and registered developers. Once there is a professional foundation, we envisage professional developers moving to regulation, just as registered pharmacists move into pharma regulation—this is a slow process, but without it, regulation is likely to remain behind the curve. The role of citizen developers in this ecosystem needs to be carefully considered. Given IT’s record of continual radical innovation, regulatory lag is likely to be permanent, and therefore, an effective clinical governance response must be, or partly be, of a different sort than conventional regulation. This paper has set out some of the issues that must be addressed. Ultimately, apps should not be considered just by their form but by their function and as part of the digital health ecosystem.

### Empowering the digital therapeutic relationship: virtual clinics for digital health interventions [^c5af2dab]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The digital therapeutic relationship

The digital therapeutic relationship for mobile health has been ignored because it is often invisible to those building apps. App developers create impressive apps that are marketed to clinicians or patients as a discrete tool. For example, most symptom monitoring apps log information but few facilitate the meaningful sharing of that information or are able to connect it to the electronic medical record. In small print in the terms and conditions of most apps, these products are careful to note they are not therapeutic tools, and that in case of an emergency the user should seek actual care with a health professional. Or scientists, often also with limited current patient contact, study apps in idealistic research settings that frequently ignore clinical realities. These apps, while impressive on paper, do not fare well when users are no longer paid for use, offered free phones, or given extra support as in studies. The result is a plethora of apps that are innovative, impressive, and even efficacious—but lack effectiveness or real-world applicability. The present climate of unprincipled machine learning, artificial intelligence, user centric design, or other features has not yet helped in bridging the gap.

Bridging the gap through addressing the digital therapeutic relationship is one pragmatic solution. Mental health clinicians respect the clinical utility of a strong therapeutic relationship and this relationship is a good predictor for treatment response across both medication and therapy interventions.While there isn’t a consensus definition of the therapeutic relationship, elements include mutual trust, alliance, respect, empathy, and positive regard between the patient and clinician.The current therapeutic relationship is developed in the brick and mortar clinic and strengthened through future in-person clinical visits. The nature of the clinical workflow, appointments, electronic medical records, liability, and billing reinforce the predominance of face to face therapeutic relationships. The clinical impact of therapeutic relationships spans all healthcare from psychiatry to surgery and is well summarized in a 1988 paper by Suchman and Matthews stating, “the connectional experience is basic to medical care”.This impact has also been quantitativelystudied and often reported as a moderate effect across a range of conditions.The current model of apps as independent tools focused on either patients or clinicians,however, ignores the therapeutic power of this relationship, the reluctance of both patients and clinicians to abandon it, and the potential damage that can be caused to the relationship through fragmenting care.

### The heartline experience: achieving long-term participant engagement in digital health technology trials [^a144967c]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The recently published Food and Drug Administration guidance for decentralized clinical trials underscores a broader effort to modernize clinical trials by improving efficiency, expanding access, and reducing participant burden.Digital and smart devices offer great promise as a scalable solution for collecting important medical information and providing health interventions. However, a major challenge for digital monitoring and therapeutics has been limited sustained engagement with these technologies over time. For example, early research into mobile health (mHealth) applications for asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and Parkinson disease found that the proportion of daily users across all 5 apps declined to <25% within 2 months.Digital monitoring also has the potential to improve participant data collection in research studies, facilitating decentralized trial designs and improving collection of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs). Unfortunately, while high short-term engagement rates in remote digital health studies having been achieved,,,,long-term engagement has proven more challenging.,These challenges transcend both diagnostic, and double-blind intervention studies,which have ranged from >95% engagement after 3 monthsto 44% over 9 months(Supplemental Table 1). This report details the design of the Heartline Study mobile app–based heart health program and shows longitudinal participant engagement to date.

### Tepid uptake of digital health technologies in clinical trials by pharmaceutical and medical device firms [^fcb68a2a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Digital health technologies (DHTs) can enable more patient-centric therapeutic development by generating evidence that captures how patients feel and function, enabling decentralized trial designs that increase participant inclusivity and convenience, and collecting and structuring patient-generated data for regulators to use in approval decisions alongside traditional clinical outcomes. Although a growing body of evidence has documented increasing use of DHTs in clinical trials overall, the use of DHTs in clinical trials supporting medical product development is unclear; here, we quantify the use of DHTs in clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical and medical device firms. Despite interest from pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in DHTs, we find tepid uptake of DHTs in trials by these sponsor types over time. Further, to date, these sponsors have most frequently used conventional, hardware-based technologies that have been available for many years (e.g., Holter monitors and glucose meters) rather than newer activity monitors, mobile apps, and other online-based tools that are frequently used by non-industry sponsors. Considering the recent and evolving nature of regulatory guidance around DHT use in clinical trials, our findings suggest that organizations pursuing product development still appear hesitant to incorporate DHTs in trials that provide the most critical evidence for regulatory review and impact how new products are used. This suggests there are likely additional opportunities for sponsors of regulated trials to incorporate (more) DHTs and patient-centric endpoints into product development clinical trials. However, additional regulatory clarity and efforts to reduce operational barriers may be needed in order to more fully capture these opportunities.

### Why is it so difficult to govern mobile apps in healthcare? [^d0bfa9a1]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2019). High credibility.

Apps are highly versatile

The versatility of apps means they can be used to support a wide variety of health information or communication services at all levels of care delivery and in the community. As apps can support a single service or a combination of services, their function may not be clear at the outset to designers. A fundamental problem here is that there is no standard use cases for apps of any type and therefore the implementation of information and communication services is ad hoc.While NICE’s guidelines for digital health technologies distinguish broad categories of functionality,their implementation is left to developers. For instance, asthma management: the use case for what specific functions apps must support, including information provision, peak flow and symptom diaries, and medication tracking, is fluid and currently evolving with developments in technology and medical research. While the functionality of apps, or any other software to support health services, should be based on clinical standards that provide evidence-based requirements for information and communication, the slow rate at which such standards are produced presents a challenge for clinical governance because without standardised use cases, apps are providing functionality where there is no clear understanding of risk.

The lack of standard use cases makes it difficult to lay down clear rules for clinical governance of apps. With current regulations for medical devices, there is only a subtle difference between apps which are considered medical devices and those that are not. For example, symptom checkers are considered to be a medical device if they provide a subset of medical conditions matching the symptoms entered by users, indicate the likelihood of a match, or provide treatment recommendations.Yet, those that list all conditions matching the symptoms entered by users and provide signposts to suitable care are not considered medical devices.

Apps also pose challenges for applying clinical governance processes because they are used at all levels of care delivery and in the community. For instance, consumer health information is the purview of public health where the reliability and credibility of information is a prime consideration. In contrast, prevention and management of disease involve formal care delivery settings often with treatment by health professionals. This raises complex issues in processes to assess and manage risk because across these contexts, there is no consensus about the level of acceptable safety among health service providers, clinicians and regulators.

### FDA perspective on the importance of digital health technologies in clinical trials (...) [^305c1f25]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Digital health technologies provide opportunities to record data from trial participants wherever they may be. The data collection may involve passive monitoring by the DHT or the acquisition of data while participants are actively interacting with the DHT. A DHT is a system that uses computing platforms, connectivity, software, and/or sensors for health care and related uses. 1 Some examples of DHTs include products like fitness trackers that monitor steps or heart rate, room sensors that monitor sleep patterns, and devices like continuous glucose monitors used for diabetes. DHTs may also work with other technologies that support their operation, such as general-purpose computing platforms and communication networks.

The use of DHTs to remotely collect data from trial participants may allow for more frequent or continuous data collection compared to intermittent trial visits. DHTs can also measure new concepts that were not previously easily measurable. DHT measurements may provide broader pictures of how participants feel or function in their daily lives. Third, the FDA sees the potential for DHTs to capture novel measures that are used to support end points in medical product clinical trials. 4 To facilitate the development of novel measures, collaboration from many different interested parties such as patients, caregivers, clinicians, engineers, statisticians, and regulators is needed to ensure the data are adequately captured by the DHT and are clinically meaningful to the patient. Digitally derived end points that accurately, meaningfully, and reproducibly reflect how patients feel and function can support registration, label expansion, and safety monitoring of medical products.

The FDA Digital Health Center of Excellence 9 provides technological advice to support further use of safe and effective DHTs. The DHCoE provides strategic direction in digital health policy and collaborates and coordinates digital health-related efforts across the FDA. DHCoE has developed a Digital Health Policy Navigator10 to help interested parties navigate the digital health regulatory landscape by helping to identify whether their product’s software functions are potentially subject to FDA’s regulatory oversight as a device, and if so, providing considerations that may assist in determining the applicable FDA-specific regulatory requirements and recommendations.

The existence of digital therapeutic relationships is itself not new and supported by an abundance of high quality evidence from psychology, the social sciences, user experience, user interface, and design research. – Perhaps it is no wonder that telehealth, an innovation that enables provider-patient contact remotely, is one of the most enduring technological advances today.But as smartphone apps and remote sensing technologies for health continue to rapidly expand, it is now time to revisit the digital therapeutic relationship in the context of mobile health.

### Mobile app validation: a digital health scorecard approach [^efc4b70d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical performance was low and driven by the low number of apps making any clinical claim. This finding likely reflects the present state of mobile apps in oncology and highlights a significant gap in the current solution landscape. In addition to most apps not reaching a high clinical bar, some made misleading or false claims. This latter scenario presents a potentially dangerous situation particularly as apps become more sophisticated through advancements in technology such as image and movement sensors and machine learning based artificial intelligence. This presents an opportunity for medical societies, academic centers, and other trusted entities to partner with developers to produce trustworthy, high-quality, and evidence-based solutions.

The vast majority of apps did not adequately satisfy end-user requirements. The cohort average was 37.2% which highlights the significant discrepancy between what is being built for patients and physicians and what these stakeholders actually want apps to do. Incorporating these stakeholder perspectives in the product development lifecycle may help improve the overall functionality and effectiveness of the product. These results and the findings more generally demonstrated the wide disparity between what is popular and what is high quality. An initial step in bridging this gap is making the gap transparent to all stakeholders. Without systematic and transparent evaluation and a clear determination of end-user needs, patients, physicians, and other stakeholders have no reliable way to assess app quality. Our results also demonstrate that users cannot discriminate quality by using assessments available through the traditional digital gatekeepers—app stores.

### Characteristics and challenges of the clinical pipeline of digital therapeutics [^22fe1ab5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

If the DTx is prescription-only, physicians must currently complete and send a patient enrollment to the DTx manufacturer, who then onboards the patient directly onto the DTx via a mobile app store access code. Patients interact with the DTx over a predetermined period of time, per the drug’s label, directly from a personal smartphone or tablet; clinicians may also be able to monitor their patients’ progress and input-related information, such as drug screen results and appointment compliance, on a dedicated web dashboard.

DTx may serve as a useful complement, and in certain cases, replacement, to biomedical therapeutics. DTx to date have largely targeted neurological and psychiatric conditions with significant unmet needs that are challenging to manage with existing therapeutics. DTx also allow clinicians to remotely collect real-time data from patients, making subsequent office visits more efficient. Because DTx are software-based, patient progress and adherence to treatment may be more accurately measured relative to pharmaceuticals. Decreased capital requirements and lower risk profile for DTx may also translate into lower prices for DTx relative to novel therapeutics for the same indication. However, how and whether DTx will be evaluated against conventional therapeutics through comparative effectiveness studies also has yet to be explored. Finally, akin to many biotech startups, DTx companies have partnered with large pharmaceutical companies and their investment arms for the development, licensing, and commercialization of their products (Table 1). Understanding and overcoming obstacles to effective regulation and reimbursement of DTx is a key element to the development of long-lasting partnerships with traditional pharmaceutical companies and movement of DTx into the clinic.

### Digital therapeutics as a new therapeutic modality: a review from the perspective of clinical pharmacology [^798e7d9a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

The promise of transforming digital technologies into treatments is what drives the development of digital therapeutics (DTx), generally known as software applications embedded within accessible technologies-such as smartphones-to treat, manage, or prevent a pathological condition. Whereas DTx solutions that successfully demonstrate effectiveness and safety could drastically improve the life of patients in multiple therapeutic areas, there is a general consensus that generating therapeutic evidence for DTx presents challenges and open questions. We believe there are three main areas where the application of clinical pharmacology principles from the drug development field could benefit DTx development: the characterization of the mechanism of action, the optimization of the intervention, and, finally, its dosing. We reviewed DTx studies to explore how the field is approaching these topics and to better characterize the challenges associated with them. This leads us to emphasize the role that the application of clinical pharmacology principles could play in the development of DTx and to advocate for a development approach that merges such principles from development of traditional therapeutics with important considerations from the highly attractive and fast-paced world of digital solutions.

### Diabetes digital app technology: benefits, challenges, and recommendations. A consensus report by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American diabetes association (ADA) diabetes technology working group [^5972db3d]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Digital health technology, especially digital and health applications ("apps"), have been developing rapidly to help people manage their diabetes. Numerous health-related apps provided on smartphones and other wireless devices are available to support people with diabetes who need to adopt either lifestyle interventions or medication adjustments in response to glucose-monitoring data. However, regulations and guidelines have not caught up with the burgeoning field to standardize how mobile health apps are reviewed and monitored for patient safety and clinical validity. The available evidence on the safety and effectiveness of mobile health apps, especially for diabetes, remains limited. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have therefore conducted a joint review of the current landscape of available diabetes digital health technology (only stand-alone diabetes apps, as opposed to those that are integral to a regulated medical device, such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems, and automated insulin delivery systems) and practices of regulatory authorities and organizations. We found that, across the U.S. and Europe, mobile apps intended to manage health and wellness are largely unregulated unless they meet the definition of medical devices for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes. International organizations, including the International Medical Device Regulators Forum and the World Health Organization, have made strides in classifying different types of digital health technology and integrating digital health technology into the field of medical devices. As the diabetes digital health field continues to develop and become more fully integrated into everyday life, we wish to ensure that it is based on the best evidence for safety and efficacy. As a result, we bring to light several issues that the diabetes community, including regulatory authorities, policy makers, professional organizations, researchers, people with diabetes, and health care professionals, needs to address to ensure that diabetes health technology can meet its full potential. These issues range from inadequate evidence on app accuracy and clinical validity to lack of training provision, poor interoperability and standardization, and insufficient data security. We conclude with a series of recommended actions to resolve some of these shortcomings.

### Digital therapeutics in neurology [^0a918a47]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term digital health is rooted in eHealth, defined as “the use of information and communications technology in support of health and health-related fields.”. It describes all technologies, platforms, and systems that engage consumers for lifestyle, wellness, and health-related purposes; capture, store or transmit health data; and/or support life science and clinical operations. Digital therapeutics (DTx) is a section of digital health defined by the Digital Therapeutics Alliance as “delivering evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by software to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease. They are used independently or in concert with medications, devices, or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes.”. DTx could overcome several limits related to traditional clinical practice, reduce costs associated with attending hospital or doctor’s clinic, improve adherence to healthy lifestyle behavior and prescribed medications allow continuous monitoring, and optimize the time of administrative tasks and routine communication. Therefore, chronic disabling diseases could greatly benefit from DTx.

DTx tools include several screen devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and videogame platforms that converge with software algorithms and that can be applied for improvement of therapy management and rehabilitation. This narrative review provides an overview of DTx in the care of patients with neurological dysfunctions.

### Digital therapeutics from bench to bedside [^c2094185]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the development of IT, numerous healthcare technologies using personal smart devices and information have been proposed, and are expected to introduce a paradigm shift in medicine and healthcare. These new healthcare technologies have been provided in the form of health apps and is primarily used to support major medical practices or to promote wellness in prevention and prognosis management. However, as the amount and value of health-related data increase, the demands of consumers and medical service providers for digital medical technology transform from wellness products that have not proven clinically effective to products that have proven clinical effectiveness for the prevention, management, and treatment of diseases. This means digital technology can supplement and replace medical treatment beyond simple bio-signal measurement or health management. From this perspective, digital therapeutics (DTx), treatment techniques based on digital technology, have been defined and studied in earnest since the establishment of Digital Therapeutics Alliance (DTA), which consists of healthcare companies and stakeholders in 2017. DTx is considered as a subcategory of digital medicine, part of a broader category called digital health. Digital health, digital medicine, and DTx products have different requirements for clinical evidence and regulatory oversight because of different claim levels and therefore have different risk levels. DTx with prescription-only characteristics are classified as prescription DTx (PDTx). The primary difference between DTx and wellness applications is that DTx applications are developed with clinical evidence to target specific medical conditions, particularly major chronic diseases.

Commercial DTx that have been released thus far was primarily developed for indications such as chronic and neuropsychiatric diseases which can be treated through behavioral change. DTx are rapidly being commercialized in the United States and Europe,. However, even for commercialized products, they have not been fully implemented into clinical practice owing to insufficient evidence to prove their effectiveness.

The objective of this study is to propose challenges and recommendations for DTx to be used in clinical settings beyond research and development. We explore trends and characteristics in the major DTx domains through literature and case studies on definitions, intended indications, commercial products, clinical trial studies, and regulations. In addition, we derive major challenges by analyzing the interconnections between research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory domains by comprehensively considering commercial or under-researched DTx. Furthermore, from the results of the investigation and analysis, we suggest essential considerations for each DTx domains and present the discourse required for DTx to be effectively established as a general medical practice in the future.

### Prescribable mHealth apps identified from an overview of systematic reviews [^b33bfae2]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Smartphone popularity and mHealth apps provide a huge potential to improve health outcomes for millions of patients. However, we found only a small fraction of the available mHealth apps had been tested and the body of evidence was of very low quality. Our recommendations for improving the quality of evidence, and reducing research waste and potential harm in this nascent field include encouraging app effectiveness testing prior to release, designing less biased trials, and conducting better reviews with robust risk of bias assessments. Without adequate evidence to back it up, digital medicine and app 'prescribability' might stall in its infancy for some time to come.

Navigating regulatory pathways in a rapidly-evolving field

Mobile technologies and their applications are evolving faster than drugs and biologics; these rapid changes encompass commercial sensors, proprietary algorithms, and applications that are constantly being changed and updated. And yet several workshop participants emphasized that it remains critically important to ensure accuracy, validity, utility, and value.

From a regulatory perspective, digital health technologies may be defined as medical devices if they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or if they are intended to impact the structure or function of the human body through a non-chemical action (For the formal definition of medical devices, see section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321).). Medical devices can be classified into one of three categories with different levels of regulatory control based, in part, on the individual risk/benefit profile of the device.The Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Center for Devices and Radiological Health has developed guidance on mobile medical applicationsand encourages developers to go through the free presubmission process.This process is designed to help identify and address key issues early in the development process and may be particularly important in this innovative domain. In 2017, the FDA released a Digital Health Innovation Action Plan,which outlines practical policies and approaches and describes next steps, and has recently announced additional steps to spur innovation in digital health.

### Digital inhalers and remote patient monitoring for asthma [^c78591cd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Digital inhaler systems, remote patient monitoring, and remote therapeutic monitoring offer great promise as diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions to improve adherence and inhaler technique for patients with difficult-to-control asthma. In turn, improvements in adherence and inhaler technique may translate into decreasing the need for high side effect treatments such as oral corticosteroids and costly therapies including biologics. Although more clinical trials are needed, studies that use digital inhaler systems to collect objective real-time data on medication-taking behavior via electronic medication monitors and feed this data back to patients on their mobile asthma app, and to health care professionals on the clinician dashboard to counsel patients, show positive outcomes. This article addresses the use of these diagnostic and therapeutic tools in asthma care, how to choose a digital inhaler system, how to teach patients to use the system, strategies for the adoption of these technologies in large health care systems as well as smaller practices, coding and reimbursement, liability concerns, and research gaps.

### Digital therapeutics in hypertension: evidence and perspectives [^50dc277d]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Digital therapeutics refers to the use of evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs to treat, manage, or prevent a medical condition. This approach is being increasingly investigated for the management of hypertension, a common condition that is the leading preventable cardiovascular disease risk factor worldwide. Digital interventions can help facilitate uptake of important guideline-recommended lifestyle modifications, reinforce home blood pressure monitoring, decrease therapeutic inertia, and improve medication adherence. However, current studies are only of moderate quality, and are highly heterogeneous in the interventions evaluated, comparator used, and results obtained. Therefore, additional studies are needed, focusing on the development of universally applicable and consistent digital therapeutic strategies designed with health care professional input and evaluation of these interventions in robust clinical trials with objective end points. Hopefully, the momentum for digital therapeutics triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic can be utilized to maximize advancements in this field and drive widespread implementation.

Eligibility criteria

Eligible RCTs included the following characteristics:
adult patients (≥18 years) with hypertension who were defined: as patients with inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg or home BP ≥ 135/95 mmHg whether or not they are receiving hypertension medication) and stage 1 hypertension (BP is 130–139 or 80–89 mmHg).
software was included if it was used for more than one disease (e.g. diabetes and hypertension) and patients with hypertension or comorbid diseases were included as study participants.
the intervention in the experimental group fit into the following intervention criteria for DTx.
changes in SBP or diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood pressure control, and and health related outcomes were reported, excluding articles that reported only outcomes not related to improvements of health management.
had a comparison group receiving usual clinical care, health education, advice only, or standard follow-up.

Both peer-reviewed publications and conference abstracts were included, but conference abstracts need to report RCT findings as a complement to the RCT’s research design and rationale articles.

According to the definition and core principles of the DTx Alliance, the criteria for digital therapeutics were explicated in this study as (1) Software driving: the interventions of products need to be computer-based software, platforms, and smartphone applications(apps). Through other channels that are not specifically designed for hypertension management algorithms or programs are not eligible, such as telephone, WeChat, SMS, and e-mail, etc (2) Algorithm and model supporting: independent algorithms or models for digital therapeutic products need to be designed for or developed with the collaboration of medical professionals (3) Intervention: software or apps that respond to user input and aim to generate tailored content to blood pressure control or other multiple hypertension care behaviors improvement domains through feedback, customized antihypertensive plans (including dynamically adjusted medication, lifestyle, and disease care prescriptions and advice), reinforcement and rewards, risk scoring and alerts, patient decision support, goal setting, or reminders. Any program, website, or app that is used only for hypertension monitoring or self-reporting, without a feedback interactive system, only for communication or general health education between patients and professionals, and only targeted exclusively at health professionals is not eligible.

### Empowering the digital therapeutic relationship: virtual clinics for digital health interventions [^fead8f78]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

On paper, digital health tools like smartphone apps appear to be the ideal solution to the current mental health crisis. Depression is now the leading cause of disability worldwide, and mental health disorders impact one in four people globally, yet current and projected future access to care and treatment remain inadequate. Today’s limited access to clinical care stands in contrast to the ubiquity of smartphones, heterogeneity in care delivery in contrast to standardized protocols of apps, and snapshot diagnostic assessments in contrast to continuous longitudinal monitoring by phone sensors. Digital phenotyping, the moment-by-moment quantification of individual-level human behavior and physiology in situ using data from smartphones and other personal digital devicesoffers a new window into understanding and addressing the real-world lived experience of illness. Yet the reality of digital health services like apps is different—uptake is low in clinics and engagement remains poor among the public. Searching for the cause of this striking disparity has proven difficult because it is neither tangible nor a fault in apps, clinicians, or patients. Rather we propose that a failure to address the digital interaction between patients and clinicians—the digital therapeutic relationship—and resulting lack of support for this new relationship limits the true potential of digital care.

### The effect of digital therapeutics intervention on improving hypertension management in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^4593ac4c]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Principal results

To our knowledge, this study presents the first synthesis of the pooled effectiveness of different DTx interventions in reducing BP and improving other risk factors. Strengths of our study include the use of rigorous standard methodology as documented in the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines; the comprehensive series of sensitivity analyses performed to ensure the robustness of the calculated summary effect size; and the inclusion of implementation metrics, by limiting inclusion to only randomized controlled trials, thereby restricting potential confounders.

Of the 5943 records identified, 15 RCTs (n = 3789 participants) were included in the meta-analysis, that digital therapeutic interventions were more effective in reducing BP (both SBP and DBP) and improving BP control than usual care. These effects were generally consistent across the different trial settings, sample sizes, intervention durations, and among various population subgroups, which suggested a wide target of hypertensive patients of DTx intervention. In addition, DTx was clinically and statistically significant for improving lifestyle-related metrics such as lower BMI, weight loss, increased physical activity, and reduced waist circumference, compared to traditional interventions. Smartphone APPs are the primary mode of delivering digital health therapy interventions (13 studies, 87%), and therefore smartphone-based DTx interventions are becoming increasingly common ways to support medication adherence and management of hypertension. Our findings provided evidence that DTx intervention could be an important strategy for promoting BP control and improving hypertension health management. From the standpoint of the control group, the mode was not only the usual care and clinical treatment, but also included other modes such as self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP), health coaching, and so on. Thus, there provided even stronger evidence of the superiority of the digital therapeutic intervention versus the conventional intervention in terms of lowering BP and improvement in the effects of risk factors.

Necessity for clear clinical protocols to validate digital therapeutics' efficacy

The development of DTx has progressed significantly over the past decade, positioning DTx as promising treatments for a wide range of diseases, including NDDs, neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Clinical evidence of therapeutic efficacy is essential for DTx development, and thus well‐developed clinical protocols are needed to certify DTx as reliable therapeutic devices. First, clinical trials for DTx should consider how patient adherence and data collection methods can influence outcomes. Critical considerations for data accrual/assessment include the Hawthorne effect, biases from repeated assessments, and disease progression over time, and statistical regression to the mean should be controlled.Second, clinical protocols for DTx should clearly outline safety assurance. Primary safety issues for mobile apps include inaccurate or misleading information, erroneous clinical calculations, and diagnostic errors.These risks underscore the necessity of proper regulatory oversight to mitigate patient safety concerns. Finally, clinical protocols for DTx should consider the delivery method and design of training content. The clinical efficacy outcomes of cognitive behavioral training (CBT) have been shown to vary depending on the delivery method. Specifically, two types of digital CBT (telephone‐delivered CBT (TCBT) and web‐based CBT (WCBT)) lead to significantly greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes compared with face‐to‐face CBT.However, the primary outcomes also differ significantly between TCBT and WCBT, indicating that selecting an appropriate delivery mechanism based on therapeutic context is critical for clinical efficacy.In sum, comprehensive clinical protocols for DTx are essential for optimal validation of DTx efficacy and demonstrating that DTx are innovative and reliable therapeutic tools.

### Characterisation of digital therapeutic clinical trials: a systematic review with natural language processing [^f72164ea]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

Digital therapeutics clinical trials were identified through theapplication programming interface by use of a set of 27 search terms related to DTx, including “digital therapeutic”, “digital therapy”, “smartphone”, “mobile app”, and “video game” (appendix p 1). Searches were limited to the fields for BriefSummary, BriefTitle, InterventionName, InterventionDescription, Keyword, DetailedDescription, EligibilityCriteria, or OfficialTitle, and only trials registered for FDA-regulated devices and not listed as having a “basic science purpose” were included. We used thefield IsFDARegulatedDevice to identify trials “studying a device product subject to section 510(k), 515, or 520(m) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act”.Thus, even if FDA clearance or approval had not been granted for any of these trials, there was a high degree of confidence that they were for FDA-regulated products. Basic science studies were identified with the DesignStudyPurpose field and were removed to focus on trials of DTx with an established mechanism of action. By use of the OverallStatus field, trials that had been terminated, withdrawn, suspended, or had an unknown status were also excluded to limit analysis to active trials. The scope of the systematic review was also limited to studies with start dates occurring after 2010, or expected completion dates listed after 2030. Following these filtering steps, the full record from each remaining DTx trial was then extracted from the completedataset, which was downloaded on Aug 3, 2022. We report our findings in line with PRISMA guidelines. Since this systematic review does not assess health outcomes, no protocol is registered on PROSPERO. The full list of data fields available for each trial can be found onon the Protocol Registration Data Element Definitions page.

### Characterisation of digital therapeutic clinical trials: a systematic review with natural language processing [^efc2ca9f]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2024). High credibility.

Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a somewhat novel class of US Food and Drug Administration-regulated software that help patients prevent, manage, or treat disease. Here, we use natural language processing to characterise registered DTx clinical trials and provide insights into the clinical development landscape for these novel therapeutics. We identified 449 DTx clinical trials, initiated or expected to be initiated between 2010 and 2030, from ClinicalTrials.gov using 27 search terms, and available data were analysed, including trial durations, locations, MeSH categories, enrolment, and sponsor types. Topic modelling of eligibility criteria, done with BERTopic, showed that DTx trials frequently exclude patients on the basis of age, comorbidities, pregnancy, language barriers, and digital determinants of health, including smartphone or data plan access. Our comprehensive overview of the DTx development landscape highlights challenges in designing inclusive DTx clinical trials and presents opportunities for clinicians and researchers to address these challenges. Finally, we provide an interactive dashboard for readers to conduct their own analyses.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^4237e9ef]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

In response to the specific characteristics of digital health products, the FDA is piloting a Pre-Certification program that aims to provide a new approach to regulation for SaMD, including a more rapid initial response, and ongoing monitoring and data collection to support what is likely to be a continually iterating product. The agency appeared to confirm its commitment to digital therapeutics by relaxing some regulatory requirements to address particular health problems aggravated by the pandemic and its immediate consequences. For example, it temporarily expanded patient access to digital therapeutics for psychiatric disorders, and allowed limited modifications to certain remote monitoring devices used by chronic sufferers.

The UK’s National Health Service (NHS) launched in February 2021 its Digital Technology Assessment Criteria (DTAC), to be used by both developers of digital health tools, and by those in the NHS that will eventually be seeking them, including criteria around safety, data protection, technical assurance, interoperability and usability. They also require a CE or UKCA mark, putting them in the same category as traditional medical devices. Post pandemic and post Brexit, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulation Agency (MHRA) is in the process of developing a new delivery plan, although there are no clues yet as to what that may mean for digital health. Meanwhile, in the European Union, where DTx are also defined as medical devices, new legislation appears to mean that a greater number of new DTx products will have to provide clinical data to gain market access.

In Latin America things are still nebulous. In most jurisdictions, DTx have the potential to be regarded as medical devices and therefore should, at least theoretically, be subject to the same rules, but there are no clear standards for digital health.

In Mexico, there is currently no regulation for these products, and as of August 2021, Mexico’s National Health Regulator COFEPRIS stated that it had not yet issued a marketing authorization for any medical application. However, a new draft technical standard on good manufacturing practices, which incorporates a definition of SaMD, is expected to be published in the country this year.

In Colombia, the regulator Invima has considered some cases in which software, including apps, is considered a medical device, for example patient medical data analysis and interpretation, or software that sets alarms in biomedical equipment, although again, it has no specific regulation yet for this type of product.

### Digital health technologies: opportunities and challenges in rheumatology [^f1b5edbe]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

The past decade in rheumatology has seen tremendous innovation in digital health technologies, including the electronic health record, virtual visits, mobile health, wearable technology, digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The increased availability of these technologies offers opportunities for improving important aspects of rheumatology, including access, outcomes, adherence and research. However, despite its growth in some areas, particularly with non-health-care consumers, digital health technology has not substantially changed the delivery of rheumatology care. This Review discusses key barriers and opportunities to improve application of digital health technologies in rheumatology. Key topics include smart design, voice enablement and the integration of electronic patient-reported outcomes. Smart design involves active engagement with the end users of the technologies, including patients and clinicians through focus groups, user testing sessions and prototype review. Voice enablement using voice assistants could be critical for enabling patients with hand arthritis to effectively use smartphone apps and might facilitate patient engagement with many technologies. Tracking many rheumatic diseases requires frequent monitoring of patient-reported outcomes. Current practice only collects this information sporadically, and rarely between visits. Digital health technology could enable patient-reported outcomes to inform appropriate timing of face-to-face visits and enable improved application of treat-to-target strategies. However, best practice standards for digital health technologies do not yet exist. To achieve the potential of digital health technology in rheumatology, rheumatology professionals will need to be more engaged upstream in the technology design process and provide leadership to effectively incorporate the new tools into clinical care.

### The effect of digital therapeutics intervention on improving hypertension management in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^4eecb0bb]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review of RCTs was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 6.4). The results were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement (2020). The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CDR 42024501858).

Search strategy

The search focused on the identification of studies relating to digital therapeutic for hypertension management conducted worldwide. Medline (via Ovid), Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews for the period up to September 10, 2023 were searched to identify relevant studies. A combination of search terms was used, including Hypertension; Hypertension or Blood Pressure, High or Blood Pressures, High or High Blood Pressure or High Blood Pressures (for the disease type); Smartphone App, Smartphone Apps, Smartphone application, APP Mobile; Telemedicine, Computer-Assisted Drug therapy, Medical Informatics Application, eHealth, Telecommunication, Mobile health, mhealth, Digital health, Telemonitoring (for digital therapeutic). The full search strategy was included in the Appendix p2. Reference lists from related original articles and reviews were also investigated. No language limitation was applied. To ensure the comprehensiveness of the search, we also scanned clinical research database, the product library of the digital therapeutics alliance and the catalog of cleared and approved medical device information from U.S. Food and Drug Administration to obtain current clinical trials and products related to antihypertensive digital therapeutics to look back upon the potentially additional studies.

Study selection

To determine the studies to be assessed further, two review authors independently scanned the abstract, title, or both sections of every record retrieved. All potentially relevant articles were investigated as full text. Two investigators (JXT and GJY) independently screened all titles and abstracts to determine eligibility for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In cases of discordance of opinion, a third author (LL) was consulted to achieve consensus. We identified studies among adults and only randomized controlled trials by manually reviewing titles, abstracts, and texts from eligible articles.

### A prescribed digital health app and number of migraine days: a randomized clinical trial [^3f740fa2]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this RCT involving patients with migraine, there was no evidence for a superiority of the prescribable digital health app over a control app providing basic documentation features in reducing the number of migraine days across a 12-week period. However, our study highlighted the feasibility and rapid recruitment capabilities in digital health research along with the challenges of conducting a fully remote trial within the established German DiGA fast-track process. This study underscores the critical need for RCTs as a cornerstone of a robust evaluation framework, ensuring both treatment efficacy and patient safety in an expanding digital therapeutics market.

### Advancing digital health: FDA innovation during COVID-19 [^37cad345]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Digital health innovation for COVID-19

Several milestones demonstrate how thoughtful regulatory strategies can advance the development of digital health products. For example, the FDA cleared the first-ever digital health therapeutic in 2018, and has cleared several products since then, most recently a game-based therapeutic for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,. Additionally, the agency has continued to iterate on its Software Pre-Certification Pilot program, publishing an update on initial lessons in 2020.

However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically and rapidly increased the value proposition of digital health, with unprecedented adoption and utilization of new software tools and digital platforms by payers and providers to meet patient needs during the public health emergency. The FDA has sought to expand access to clinically-appropriate, low-risk digital health tools during the COVID-19 pandemic by stating its intention not to enforce certain regulatory requirements for some devices.

A clear use case of regulatory flexibility is mental health care. Research indicates the pandemic has taken a toll on the wellbeing of many Americans, with the number of adults reporting symptoms of psychological distress more than tripling in April 2020 compared to April 2018. To address the enhanced mental health burden, the FDA issued guidance to temporarily expand patient access to digital health therapeutics for psychiatric disorders. Under this policy, FDA stated its intention not to object to the distribution and use of such devices (e.g. computerized behavioral therapy, mobile medical applications for mental health) for the duration of the public health emergency without the submission of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act or compliance with other requirements, such as those for Unique Device Identification.

Likewise, experts are concerned about the health consequences of pandemic-induced interruptions to chronic disease management. Consequently, the FDA issued guidance stating that it does not intend to object to limited modifications to the indications, claims, functionality, or hardware or software of certain non-invasive remote monitoring devices (e.g. blood pressure measurement systems) that are used to support patient monitoring during the public health emergency to help reduce the risk of infection from in-person clinical visits.

### Beyond validation: getting health apps into clinical practice [^30b693b1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Regulatory environment

Both the US FDA and the EU, largely through the European Medicine Agency (EMA), have long recognized the importance of software’s role in diagnostic and therapeutic devices. More recently, to address the increasing importance of digital health, the US FDA launched a Digital Health Innovation Action Plan.Run through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the plan includes several areas of updated or new guidance, additional personnel and digital health expertise at the FDA, and a “precertification” program to streamline device approvals by focusing on developers and processes as opposed to specific products. The FDA considers two main subsets of device software functions: Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and Software in a Medical Device (SiMD). Software that ultimately meets the definition of a device can be deployed on a mobile platform, at which point it is defined as a “mobile medical app.”As such, in the US, regulation of mobile apps follows guidelines set by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), recently updated by the 21st Century Cures Act to exclude certain software capabilities. In September 2019, the FDA updated its guidance on Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical Applications to further clarify its oversight role for software.Importantly, the guidance documentation indicates that the FDA will not enforce requirements for software (and thus medical apps) that (1) help patients self-manage their disease without suggesting specific treatments, and (2) automate simple tasks for healthcare providers. In the US, additional examples of federal oversight include the Federal Trade Commission’s Health Breach Notification Rule and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

Similarly, in Europe, there have been multiple efforts to provide frameworks and regulatory best practices in this space. The European Commission eHealth Action Plan 2012–2020, for example, set out a policy roadmap and “digital agenda” for eHealth in Europe.Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices (MDR), which began in 2017 and will fully apply in May 2020, is the most recent EU framework for medical devices. As in the US, “apps” are vehicles for software deployment, and thus whether software qualifies as a device is independent of where it is deployed.The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in May of 2018, also provides important guidance for app developers, particularly around data protection and privacy.

### Digitizing clinical trials [^2b0d9709]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials are a fundamental tool used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs and medical devices and other health system interventions. The traditional clinical trials system acts as a quality funnel for the development and implementation of new drugs, devices and health system interventions. The concept of a "digital clinical trial" involves leveraging digital technology to improve participant access, engagement, trial-related measurements, and/or interventions, enable concealed randomized intervention allocation, and has the potential to transform clinical trials and to lower their cost. In April 2019, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) held a workshop bringing together experts in clinical trials, digital technology, and digital analytics to discuss strategies to implement the use of digital technologies in clinical trials while considering potential challenges. This position paper builds on this workshop to describe the current state of the art for digital clinical trials including (1) defining and outlining the composition and elements of digital trials; (2) describing recruitment and retention using digital technology; (3) outlining data collection elements including mobile health, wearable technologies, application programming interfaces (APIs), digital transmission of data, and consideration of regulatory oversight and guidance for data security, privacy, and remotely provided informed consent; (4) elucidating digital analytics and data science approaches leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms; and (5) setting future priorities and strategies that should be addressed to successfully harness digital methods and the myriad benefits of such technologies for clinical research.

### Developing and adopting safe and effective digital biomarkers to improve patient outcomes [^9db2b458]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biomarkers are characteristics (such as a physiologic, pathologic, or anatomic characteristic or measurement) that are objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to a therapeutic intervention.Building on this standard definition, we describe an emerging class of biomarker, the “digital biomarker”, which has important implications for both clinical trials and clinical care. “Digital” refers to the method of collection as using sensors and computational tools, generally across multiple layers of hardware and software. The measurements are often made outside the physical confines of the clinical environment using home-based connected productsincluding wearable, implantable, and ingestible devices and sensors. Digital biomarkers span a broad range of diagnostic and prognostic measurements (Table 1). We discuss development and evaluation of the digital biomarkers, outlining opportunities and challenges associated with their use in clinical research and routine care. As remote monitoring of digital biomarkers becomes increasingly prevalent, we discuss the challenges to patient privacy and patient autonomy.

[*] Digital biomarker under development

[**] Digital biomarker in use (in a clinical trial or an FDA cleared/approved digital health product, or a digital health app in use not requiring approval)

Just as clinicians must evaluate a drug’s safety and effectiveness by critically appraising clinical trials, they will increasingly need to know how to evaluate, select, and “prescribe” digital health tools and biomarkers. Some biomarkers are immediately familiar to patients or physicians as they are digitized versions of well-established metrics—for example, glucometer readings transmitted by Bluetooth, or the timed six-minute walk test measured with the smartphone’s built-in gyroscope and accelerometer. Others, such as the smartphone-derived tapping test for Parkinson’s disease severity, are novel and evolving.Digital biomarkers are an essential component in autoregulated closed loop systems. For example, in an “artificial pancreas” model, a continuous glucose sensor linked to an insulin pump can automatically dose insulin in patients with diabetes.

### The transformative potential of digital therapeutics in pediatrics [^5f4f0391]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Digital therapeutics (DTx) are applied healthcare technologies designed to prevent, manage, or treat health conditions. In pediatric pain, DTx can enhance access to evidence-based, effective pain assessment and management. This article explores technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), extended reality (XR), mobile health (mHealth), and sensors (eg, smartwatches). Equitable DTx deployment can address geographic disparities by enabling on-demand pain care, necessitating an intelligent learning DTx-enabled health system. Ensuring safety will require comprehensive regulatory frameworks at national and international levels. Achieving this transformation requires robust regulatory frameworks, workforce training, and equitable codesign to ensure accessible, evidence-based care for all pediatric populations.

### Randomized controlled study of a digital data driven intervention for depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms [^fca7b55d]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As mental health disorders like Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder rise globally, effective, scalable, and personalized treatments are urgently needed. This 16-week prospective, decentralized, randomized, waitlist-controlled study investigated the effectiveness of a digital data-driven therapeutic integrating wearable sensor data with a mobile app to deliver personalized CBT-based interventions for individuals with depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms. 200 adults were randomized to intervention or control groups, with 164 completing the study. The intervention group demonstrated significant reductions in depressive (mean change = -5.61, CI = -7.14, -4.08) and anxiety symptoms (mean change = -5.21, CI = -6.66, -3.76), compared to the control group, with medium-to-large effect sizes (r = 0.64 and r = 0.62, P<0.001). Notably, these improvements were also observed in participants with clinically significant depression and anxiety, further reinforcing the potential of digital therapeutics in targeting more severe cases. These findings, combined with high engagement levels, suggest that data-driven digital health interventions could complement traditional treatments, though further research is needed to assess their long-term impact.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^4fdee38c]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

The DTA asks its members to abide by its decalogue of principles in their development of DTx, planned to promote the design and commercialization of safe, secure, ethical products that do what they say they will. These principles include, of course, the duty to be “reviewed and cleared or certified by regulatory bodies as required” and to “incorporate patient privacy and security”, but also ways to build in safety and patient-centricity further upstream in the design process. For example, they suggest that developers “incorporate design, manufacture, and quality best practices”, and that they “engage end users in product development and usability processes”.

One simple principle of self-regulation is to put the HCP front and center in the development process and beyond. After all, the natural regulator of the product is the one who will be using it, particularly when that person is an expert. This may sound like a given in a software industry that talks so much about the user experience. And yet, most digital health apps are developed without medical professional involvement. A 2018 University College London study found that just 20% of the health apps they reviewed had been developed with participation of health experts.

### Digital health: a path to validation [^68e405c5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The use of health technology is also expanding into areas that are ambiguous from a regulatory perspective. For example, the 21st Century Cures act amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to remove certain clinical decision support functionalities from the definition of “medical device”, thus removing, or at least changing, the regulatory oversight responsibilities of these technologies by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In response, the FDA started pilot projects and published a number of guidance documents to elucidate their position on these topics.A representative illustration of the varying regulatory considerations based on clinical risk and technical complexity for digital technologies is shown in Fig. 1. Other Federal Agencies also have a role in regulation of digital health technologies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) prohibits deceptive or unfair acts or practices, including false or misleading claims about the safety or performance of digital health technologies. To provide clarity about the regulatory environment for a mobile app developer, the FTC, FDA, Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information technology (ONC), and Office for Civil Rights (OCR) have developed a tool for developers to use to understand what federal laws are applicable to their technology.

### The effect of digital therapeutics intervention on improving hypertension management in adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial [^7047e3e5]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Four studies included medication reminder, providing alerts to remind patients when they need to take their medications and generate medication adherence reports based on BP or a list of medications and their preferred dosing times from patients. One included medication adherence measurement, automatically selecting from the information base to tailor the feedback to the user based on the medication adherence (MA) grading. One included medication change reminder, prescribers were asked via email to implement pre-planned medication changes when the average home BP was above target. Three included tailored medication strategies, and embedded algorithms that analyze the input medication data and generate recommendations for the user.

Apps were also used for self-care like generating self-care plans, and health reports to help hypertensive patients improve and maintain self-care behaviors. Interventionists managed weekly shared board posts to solicit discussions on self-efficacy, self-regulation, social support, and barriers/facilitators to healthy lifestyles. Due to the smartphones’ capabilities, apps included features reinforcing support, providing advice by “virtual nurses” based on biological, psychological, social data, and saving user-recorded information in a web portal for physicians and researchers. Additional functionality included emergency care: Users can call the emergency number with one click to get timely medical treatment.

Nine studies assessed the effect of the intervention on promoting a healthy diet and reducing salt intake, reducing alcohol and cigarette consumption, weight control, physical activities, improving sleep conditions, coping with stress, and providing cessation incentives. DTx delivered evidence-based health information to patients about hypertension management or online education sessions, ranging in frequency from once a day to once a week. Some interventions allowed participants to interact with health professionals via face-to-face communication. Two studies assessed the feasibility of apps.

Most studies were designed to control groups with usual care or enhanced usual care, (eg, laboratory tests and ancillary clinical services tailored to the condition). In most studies, the control group received education only at baseline; however, some studies provided ongoing health education. One study allowed control participants to delay access to the DTx intervention. Three studies required patients to conduct self-monitoring of BP (SMBP), and one provided a BP tracking app with home monitoring.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^db21e8fd]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

DTx regulation: a framework under construction

The IQVIA report identified “at least” 25 DTx products which have now been granted market authorization through regulatory processes, variously in the US, Europe and Japan, with another 23 commercially available. It noted that 20 of these are available by prescription only.

In general, regulatory and public health bodies are still defining what to do with these new tools. For instance, what are they? Should they be approached from a regulatory, legal and public health standpoint in the same way as pharmaceuticals? Medical devices? Consumer applications? On a global level, despite the efforts of the DTA and others, there isn’t even a common nomenclature (with different agencies using the expressions DTx, SaMD, Medical Device Software (MDSW) and others, usually to mean the same thing) or agreement on definitions. There is also a plethora of different potential focal points—on user safety, on security and privacy of personal data, on the validity of medical claims—while DTx’s various constituent parts can be problematic in and of themselves (both the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities and the World Health Organization have recently published guidance on the use of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare).

Even those developers under the jurisdiction of the FDA, perhaps the most advanced regulatory world body, do not have a completely clear path. This agency conceives DTx as medical devices and is approaching their regulation accordingly, using risk classification to define which pathway each should use, which in the most extreme cases means a full 501(k) clearance. On the one hand, the digital health applications available for access on all smart phones have generally come under little or no regulatory scrutiny. The more novel a product and the greater its potential risk, the more likely the FDA will apply the same regulatory pathway as it would to a standard medical device. For example, Pear Therapeutics’ reSET product for substance abuse, generally considered the first FDA-approved DTx, had to submit results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in order to receive regulatory approval. These are lengthy and burdensome processes, particularly for digital health products that generate much of their value precisely through their rapid and innovative response to customer feedback. Meanwhile, those products that can’t easily be categorized as either DTx or consumer wellness applications, which meet the definition of medical devices but present lower risk, find themselves in a grey area of “enforcement discretion”.

### Towards eHealth to support the health journey of headache patients: a scoping review [^b086a55e]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

With the pressing demand on the health care system, a shift towards the use of eHealth, mHealth, and digital therapeutic modalities has been advocated as the way forward to improve patient care and provide support to larger (underserved) groups of patients. We define eHealth as an abbreviation for electronic health to refer to the use of digital information and services in communication over the Internet to support and improve health or healthcare delivery to individuals. mHealth is the abbreviation for mobile health with refers to the use of mostly personal mobile or wearable electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and wearables in health and healthcare delivery. If evidence-based treatment interventions are rendered to diagnosed patients via high-quality medically approved eHealth or mHealth software technology, we have reserved the specific but recent term of digital therapeutics or, short named, DTx. As compared to traditional approaches, where patients have to visit the out-patient clinic for diagnosis and treatment, eHealth enabled care is about reducing the number of in-person visits while at the same time getting more (accurate) information from the patients via remote devices. If properly validated on safety and outcome, digital form of consult and/or treatment could make care delivery safer, decrease patient burden, be more cost-efficient and more effective in patient outcome. For instance, within the mental healthcare, behavioral eHealth interventions have shown promising results which are comparable to traditional face-to-face treatment effects. In addition, studies also show that eHealth approaches are very well accepted by patients and could be implemented in the clinical practice. A systematic review concluded that eHealth to remotely monitor patients with the long-term condition of heart failure reduced all-cause mortality by 34% and hospitalization by 21%, but that there are still mixed and heterogeneous effects for eHealth for heart failure across studies.

With respect to headache treatment and management, the use of eHealth applications or digital therapeutics has also been advocated. This has resulted in the development of mobile applications for diagnosis and disease management. However, due to the many (fast) developments in eHealth, it is largely unknown which eHealth tools are available and, more importantly, also effective in the treatment of headache patients. Hence, the aim of this study is to (1) review the digital health tools that have been used in headache studies, and (2) discuss the effectivity and reliability of these tools.

### WHO digital health guidelines: a milestone for global health [^acf36c2c]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the first-ever evidence-based guidelines for digital health. The guideline provides nine recommendations on select digital health interventions that involve the use of a mobile phone or device. It also provides information on implementation considerations, quality and certainty of extant evidence, factors related to acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, and gaps in the evidence that can inform future research. Given the pivotal role digital health can play in supporting health systems, seen especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, these guidelines can help provide a roadmap for governments and policymakers in introducing and scaling up digital health interventions to support population health outcomes.

### Digital health: a path to validation [^8711fe5f]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Digital health solutions continue to grow in both number and capabilities. Despite these advances, the confidence of the various stakeholders - from patients and clinicians to payers, industry and regulators - in medicine remains quite low. As a result, there is a need for objective, transparent, and standards-based evaluation of digital health products that can bring greater clarity to the digital health marketplace. We believe an approach that is guided by end-user requirements and formal assessment across technical, clinical, usability, and cost domains is one possible solution. For digital health solutions to have greater impact, quality and value must be easier to distinguish. To that end, we review the existing landscape and gaps, highlight the evolving responses and approaches, and detail one pragmatic framework that addresses the current limitations in the marketplace with a path toward implementation.

As "digital phenotyping" and monitoring technologies begin to unleash the potential of data insights for mental health care, we propose here a complementary concept of the "digital therapeutic relationship" to unleash the power of the patient-provider alliance in clinical care. In millions of clinics today, care decisions are made on a daily basis in the context of a relationship honed through professional training to be respectful, protective, and empowering of patients. Now as clinical care evolves toward online and especially mobile platforms, it is critical to not ignore the digital therapeutic relationship and instead to realize that supporting it will require new and innovative means of care delivery. Here, we propose that technology can be harnessed to facilitate, augment, and expand these relationships directly, and identify virtual clinics as the currently missing but necessary environment to unleash the true potential of digital medicine.

### Beyond validation: getting health apps into clinical practice [^e0655fe8]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

However, while advancements have been made in the development, validation, and regulation of apps, it is less clear how to disseminate appropriate interventions to patients and providers.The sheer number of apps available, each with varying functionality, complexity, impact, and cost, creates substantial barriers to the diffusion of these apps into clinical care. Furthermore, the evidence base supporting the use of even the best apps is scant, and most apps do not deliver value, especially for patients who are sick or have chronic conditions.Some apps may even be harmful.Yet even if high-quality apps are developed, the potential of apps to improve the care and wellbeing of patients can be realized only if the tools are actually used. If they are to be effective, both patients and providers need to gain value from utilizing these tools. It is also critical that they connect with other digital applications such as the electronic health record, yet most do not today.

One potential solution is to frame apps like non-digital treatment modalities, such as medications. If apps could be “prescribed” to patients through existing workflows, patients and clinicians may be more likely to use them, and patients could be steered through the maze of apps today towards ones which are most likely to be beneficial. Such a model promises better integration of apps into clinical practice, but also raises new issues around awareness, process, technical support, and payment.

In this review, we first describe the current regulatory environment in both the US and Europe around apps and mobile technology. We then discuss the importance of validation, and how to ensure apps that are used in clinical practice have been appropriately validated. We then build a framework for prescribing apps and outline the key issues that need to be addressed—along with potential solutions—to truly enable apps to become a core component of clinical care.

### State of the art of mobile health technologies use in clinical arrhythmia care [^fb3dd0c5]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Box 1: Definitions 

While no standardized definitions exist, the terms Digital health, Digital Medicine, and mHealth are often used in healthcare interchangeably. Here, we provide a framework of definitions to familiarize the reader with some accepted concepts.

Digital health—a broad term that refers to the use of information and communication technologies to enhance healthcare delivery in a more personalized and precise fashion. Digital health includes the use of both hardware and software solutions to achieve this goal through smart devices, advanced computational analysis such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), telehealth, health information technology (HIT), and data science.

mHealth—a component of digital health. It refers to using wireless mobile-based solutions and ‘smart’ internet-connected consumer devices to deliver healthcare. It can include various hardware solutions such as health monitoring sensors (PPG, ECG, and accelerometer) or software solutions such as healthcare apps.

Digital medicine—the practice of evidence-based medicine using digital health tools and providing health promotion, preventative health, diagnosis, and management of health conditions across individuals and populations. Specifically, the discerning features of digital medicine are regulatory oversight and evidence-based practice; as compared to digital health, which is a much broader term with more liberal parameters and includes lifestyle and fitness products, which do not require stringent regulatory oversight.

### Agile research to complement agile development: a proposal for an mHealth research lifecycle [^7c1466cf]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The ongoing expansion of mobile health (mHealth) technology is both an enabler and a consequence of a nascent era of healthcare, one in which patient-centered care, precision medicine, and equitable access form the health system’s prime directives. Given that one-third of individuals in the United States who use technology to manage their health report using a health app,, and that global mHealth and digital health revenues are projected to exceed $500B by 2025,the scale-up of mHealth into an interoperable, standards-based, and commercially viable ecosystem appears overdue. However, the evidence base for mHealth technologies is relatively sparse. Pilot studies of hundreds of applications have yielded little evidence to guide the implementation and scale-up of mHealth technologies, and the industry as a whole has not yet established the standards, technological infrastructure, or comprehensive regulatory frameworks that will be required to realize the ultimate potential of mHealth.

These issues are compounded by the rapid pace of change in mobile technology and the multi-faceted nature of new mobile health apps and interventions, which may be significantly more complex than the SMS-based interventions on which mHealth research has been primarily based in the past.We believe that an important step to addressing these problems lies in establishing agile research methods that complement the agile development methodologies used to create modern digital health applications. Agile methods emphasize ongoing and iterative development based on continuous feedback. We describe an mHealth research model that mirrors the traditional approach to pharmaceutical or clinical intervention research in its attention to safety and efficacy, while also accommodating the rapid and iterative development and evaluation required to produce effective, evidence-based, and sustainable digital products. We believe this approach will offer guidance to individuals considering different strategies for regulating digital products and to individual and system-level decision-makers regarding widespread product adoption. This approach could improve the quality and safety of digital health solutions by facilitating ongoing evaluation, an element of particular relevance for academic developers seeking to simultaneously create and evaluate digital products. Such an approach may also promote industry-academic partnerships to combine development with more rigorous product evaluation.

### Using digital technologies to diagnose in the home: recommendations from a Delphi panel [^d43a0832]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Open questions also remain to how federal and state regulators should confront digital diagnostics. While Delphi participants did not reject FDA’s current approach to regulation, they recognized that more was needed in some key areas. The recommendations broadly supported FDA’s continued enforcement of regulatory controls on digital diagnostics it reviews, along with clinical and analytical validation that uses representative (demographic) data. Moreover, several recommendations also embraced FDA’s current approach, driven by its statutory authority, that exempts certain types of products categories from FDA regulation (12-15). What separates these “general wellness products” from devices seems clear on paper but can often be a difficult line for FDA to police. The recommendations generally supported some flexibility in FDA’s approach, and also suggested manufactures develop a uniform consumer-friendly disclosure to help inform those using the product (13, 16-17). There are existing proposals relating to off-label uses of drugs, nutrition labels for AI, and health appsthat could be adapted by FDA or private industry to effectuate these recommendations.

### Digital therapeutic device for urinary incontinence: a randomized controlled trial [^4d819031]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence (UI) affects as many as 50% of women across their lifespans.Prevalence estimates rise with each decade of life, and symptom severity and related quality of life tend to worsen over time. – Pelvic floor muscle training represents first-line conservative treatment for UI, including stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urgency UI, and mixed UI subtypes. Though level I evidence supports the application of pelvic floor muscle training to improve and resolve UI symptoms,uptake and adherence to training programs remain suboptimal, with multiple individual and institutional barriers to care. – These include limited patient knowledge about how to perform pelvic floor muscle training and limited access to care owing to a deficit of skilled professionals (ie, physical therapists, continence nurse specialists).

In the absence of supervised care, women may embark on an unsupervised pelvic floor muscle training regimen, often with limited efficacy.Digital health technologies have attempted to facilitate adherence to pelvic floor muscle training for this population, and early data suggest there is a role for mobile applications (apps) in the treatment of female UI.Digital therapeutics represent a specialized niche within digital health as evidence-based, regulated, prescription products that incorporate digital systems, such as smartphone apps, to manage or treat a specific health condition.Early feasibility studies using a motion-based digital therapeutic device to guide at-home pelvic floor muscle training provided limited efficacy data, because they were not adequately powered to show a difference between the device and home pelvic floor muscle training. The device is composed of a small, flexible vaginal insert that takes the shape of the vagina when placed, and using accelerometers, reflects the motion of the vagina when pelvic floor muscles are contracted. Data are wirelessly communicated to the users' smartphone app, and adherence to the exercise program is transmitted for cloud-based storage (Fig. 1).

The current study is a larger, adequately powered, randomized controlled trial using this same device. The primary aim was to compare the efficacy of pelvic floor muscle training by using this digital therapeutic device with a home training program in reducing the severity of stress-predominant or stress-predominant mixed UI symptoms and incontinent episodes. Secondary aims were to assess health-related quality of life, adherence to pelvic floor muscle training, and other non-UI pelvic floor symptoms, as well as to examine safety.

### Characteristics and challenges of the clinical pipeline of digital therapeutics [^c6c01b78]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Digital therapeutics (DTx), defined by the Digital Therapeutics Alliance as “evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs to prevent, manage, or treat a medical disorder or disease”, have emerged as a new therapeutic modality for the prevention, management, or treatment of chronic, behavior-modifiable disease. Akin to biopharmaceuticals and medical devices, DTx undergo review and are cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are either available over-the-counter or prescribed by physicians. As of this writing, the FDA has cleared or approved multiple DTx on the basis of superiority trial data, such as Welldoc’s BlueStar for the management of Type II diabetes in 2010 and Pear Therapeutics’ reSET for the treatment of substance use disorder in 2017. For the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA has relaxed regulatory requirements to increase access to digital health products for remote monitoringand the management of psychiatric conditions, leading to the temporary commercialization of additional DTx under development. Although under consideration, the European Medicines Agency has not yet designed a regulatory pathway for evaluation and commercialization of DTx.

DTx companies have attracted significant venture financing to compete with traditional biotechnology companies developing drugs for similar indications. Pear Therapeutics, a company developing DTx for substance and opioid use disorder, has raised $139 million and Akili Interactive, a company developing DTx for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder, has raised $119 million. Yet, a predictable regulatory model to ensure patient safety and the patient, provider, and payer appetite for these therapies remain uncertain.

DTx companies currently target chronic, behavior-modifiable conditions, including Type II diabetes, substance use disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and major depressive disorder. Many of these indications are currently treated with an evidence-based behavioral or psychological mode of management; DTx package these otherwise in-person services into a digital product. For example, reSET serves as a monotherapy to treat patients with alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, or stimulant use disorder by delivering virtual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) through a smartphone or tablet. DTx can also act as combination therapy with biopharmaceuticals; for example, reSET-0 provides digital CBT as an adjunct therapy to buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder.

### Advancing digital health: FDA innovation during COVID-19 [^b08e4926]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Digital health products have played an important role in the COVID-19 response, from supporting the remote monitoring of patients to enabling continuity in data collection for clinical trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a number of temporary policies to support digital health innovation during the pandemic, such as guidance documents to expand the use of digital therapeutics for psychiatric disorders and medical devices for remote patient monitoring. In this article, we contextualize these policies to the agency’s existing regulatory framework for digital health, outline key considerations for patients and health care providers, and identify implications for the future of digital health innovation.

### Digital technologies for cognitive assessment to accelerate drug development in Alzheimer's disease [^8dae84f5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

For many neurological and psychiatric diseases, novel therapeutics have been elusive for decades. By focusing on attention interference in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we provide a future vision on how emerging mobile, computer, and device-based cognitive tools are converting classically noisy, subjective, data-poor clinical endpoints associated with neuropsychiatric disease assessment into a richer, scalable, and objective set of measurements. Incorporation of such endpoints into clinical drug trials holds promise for more quickly and efficiently developing new medicines.

### An umbrella review of effectiveness and efficacy trials for app-based health interventions [^b09a08aa]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To further increase the systematic and evidence-based evaluation of mhealth app interventions, more comprehensive and consistent reporting of app functionalities and selection of outcome measures is needed. For example, application developers and researchers could follow international guidelines such as the WHO’s mHealth evidence reporting and assessment checklist. This checklist could be a useful tool in further standardizing reporting as it captures different essential domains from intervention delivery to replicability. Furthermore, future research could follow our comprehensive search strategy to map other parts (e.g. with regards to population base or study design) of the existing evidence base for effectiveness of mobile phone applications. Additionally, it might be an interesting next step to pool effect estimates across systematic reviews after deduplicating the pool of underlying individual studies. Additional extractions and syntheses of results from pooled stratified/subgroup analyses may further elucidate factors which drive app effectiveness.

To maximize efficacy and minimize harms of mhealth apps, the social determinants of successful app-based health interventions should be analyzed. In fact, previous effectiveness reviews did not investigate if different population subgroups (e.g. different age groups, genders, socio-economic status) benefit equally and equitably from app-based health interventions. Individuals who lack technological or digital literacy might engage less with or benefit less from such health interventionspotentially aggravating existing inequities.

In spite of the remaining open questions outlined above, given their potential effectiveness in improving health behaviors and health outcomes, fostering diffusion of mhealth apps into health care systems to support patients in getting actively involved in their own disease management process, bridge geographical barriers in healthcare and relieve detrimental consequences of medical personnel shortages might be worthwhile.

### Regulatory considerations to keep pace with innovation in digital health products [^d9bf2583]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated interest in digital health, with an unprecedented rise in investment in and use of digital tools as medical devices to diagnose, treat, and manage a wide array of medical conditions. Looking to fill the need for access to care beyond the capacity of video visits, asynchronous telehealth and largely self-help patient-driven digital solutions are moving from consumer novelties towards regulated therapeutic products. Behavioral health has become an inadvertent leader given the mounting burden of mental illness, insufficient access to care, and the relative ease of offering mental health care services via remote sensors and screens. The rapid uptake of such digital tools points to an area ripe with opportunity to improve and complement existing health care services and reach historically underserved populations. But to fully realize the benefits of novel digital offerings, concomitant innovation in regulatory pathways is necessary.

The FDA currently approves and regulates digital treatments that meet the definition of software as a medical device (SaMD). The International Medical Device Regulators Forum defines SaMD as “software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device”. Applications of SaMDs include diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and prevention of disease. In the United States, SaMD products are primarily regulated through the traditional approaches used to approve lower-risk medical devices, including the de novo and 510(k) pathways. The de novo process is typically used for novel low-risk medical devices (e.g. Class I and II) and requires “reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use.” If sponsors can show substantial equivalence to one or more already marketed devices (i.e. a “predicate device”), they can submit a 510(k) application, which does not require additional safety or efficacy data. The agency may also exercise “enforcement discretion” for certain devices deemed to pose a low risk to patients or designed to help patients manage their disease without providing specific treatment or treatment. Other products are not regulated by the FDA, such as the vast majority of consumer medical apps, as these products are intended to help individuals maintain general fitness, health, or wellness, and do not meet the definition of a medical device.

### Developing and adopting safe and effective digital biomarkers to improve patient outcomes [^902a4c0a]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers are physiologic, pathologic, or anatomic characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to therapeutic interventions. Recent advances in the development of mobile digitally connected technologies have led to the emergence of a new class of biomarkers measured across multiple layers of hardware and software. Quantified in ones and zeros, these "digital" biomarkers can support continuous measurements outside the physical confines of the clinical environment. The modular software-hardware combination of these products has created new opportunities for patient care and biomedical research, enabling remote monitoring and decentralized clinical trial designs. However, a systematic approach to assessing the quality and utility of digital biomarkers to ensure an appropriate balance between their safety and effectiveness is needed. This paper outlines key considerations for the development and evaluation of digital biomarkers, examining their role in clinical research and routine patient care.

### Digital therapeutic based randomized investigation to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and residual hyperglycemia on stable medical therapy: rationale, design, and baseline characteristics of the BRIGHT trial [^259807fc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Research Perspective

Presently, over 19 million Americans with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are being treated with oral medications or injectables, such as insulin, and often a combination of both.Despite the increased use of medications and introduction of new pharmacological treatments, glycemic control at a population level is not improving.There is therefore potentially great value in behavioral interventions that can effectively complement drug therapy. Real‐world data have revealed that around half of patients treated with glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists experience treatment interruptions attributable to side effects and affordability within 2 years.Moreover, there is a rebound effect following treatment withdrawal of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists including the regain of weight loss, as well as the loss of cardiometabolic benefits such as blood pressure, CRP (C‐reactive protein), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).A sustainable behavioral change may offer an opportunity to maintain improvements from medical therapy over the long term. Although lifestyle behavioral interventions have shown benefits in the treatment of diabetes,and are recommended in current guidelines,,adoption remains challenging.Access to cognitive behavioral therapy, which has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control, is limited by access to trained behavioral therapists and the limitations of scheduled visits.

Digital platforms that deliver behavioral interventions via smartphone have the potential to increase access because they are inherently scalable and can be used outside of traditional brick‐and‐mortar constraints.A recent randomized clinical trial including 668 patients with T2D compared the efficacy of the digital therapeutic AspyreRx (formerly BT‐001) versus a control app on top of standard of care management in a time frame of 180 days.Compared with the control app, AspyreRx reduced HbA1c from baseline to day 90 by 0.39% (95% CI, −0.57 to −0.20); weight, blood pressure, and lipid profile were also improved with no treatment group difference in adverse event rates. Moreover, the fasting glucose levels decreased over time in patients randomized to AspyreRx.The results were consistent at day 180 with HbA1c delta from baseline of 0.4% in AspyreRx participants and a mean difference between groups of 0.3% (P =0.010).On the basis of this trial, AspyreRx was authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration in July 2023 as the first prescription digital therapeutic for the treatment of T2D.

### Harnessing digital technology to predict, diagnose, monitor, and develop treatments for brain disorders [^2c284aa3]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In June 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders hosted a workshop that brought together a wide range of experts and stakeholders who are working to examine and take advantage of the promise of digital technologies. Participants came from different sectors (academia, government funders and regulators, industry, and nonprofit) and different disciplines (including neurology, psychiatry, mental health intervention research, biostatistics, computer science, engineering, and law), and they focused on different conditions (neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, neurodevelopmental, and substance use) and different technologies and platforms (smartphones, wearables, social media, and environmental sensors). The workshop was an opportunity to take stock of the landscape and work together to discuss how to address both scientific problems and practical challenges, so that the potential of digital technologies could be translated into meaningful contributions toward the health of individuals and society.

Workshop presentations and discussions focused on four key challenges in this domain: transforming data into insight; navigating regulatory pathways in a rapidly-evolving field; designing user-centered tools; and building partnerships in a complex ecosystem. This article provides a high-level view of the many issues, opportunities, and challenges discussed by individual workshop participants. Additional details and attributions of comments to specific participants are available in Harnessing Mobile Devices for Nervous System Disorders—Proceedings of a Workshop.

### Navigating the complexities of mobile medical app development from idea to launch, a guide for clinicians and biomedical researchers [^a9254223]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

With today's pace of rapid technological advancement, many patient issues in modern medicine are increasingly solvable by mobile app solutions, which also have the potential to transform how clinical research is conducted. However, many critical challenges in the app development process impede bringing these translational technologies to patients, caused in large part by the lack of knowledge among clinicians and biomedical researchers of "what it takes" to design, develop, and maintain a successful medical app. Indeed, problems requiring mobile app solutions are often nuanced, requiring more than just clinical expertise, and issues such as the cost and effort required to develop and maintain a well-designed, sustainable, and scalable mobile app are frequently underestimated. To bridge this skill set gap, we established an academic unit of designers, software engineers, and scientists that leverage human-centered design methodologies and multi-disciplinary collaboration to develop clinically viable smartphone apps. In this report, we discuss major misconceptions clinicians and biomedical researchers often hold regarding medical app development, the steps we took to establish this unit to address these issues and the best practices and lessons learned from successfully ideating, developing, and launching medical apps. Overall, this report will serve as a blueprint for clinicians and biomedical researchers looking to better benefit their patients or colleagues via medical mobile apps.

### Wearable devices in clinical trials: hype and hypothesis [^6d678e2b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

WHAT THERAPEUTIC AREAS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE AND WHY?

In theory, wearables can be used broadly across therapeutic areas for deep phenotyping, detection and interpretation of adverse events, assessment of quality of life, and measurement of efficacy. Wearable and digital approaches could provide signal detection for conditions such as depression by measuring increases in sleep or decrease in activity, signs associated with depression. For example, wearables were recently suggested to be helpful in the detection of early signs of Lyme disease. 7 Any therapeutic intervention that may impact quality of life could benefit from measurement of movement or in some cases where a patient diary is required. One example is a collaboration between PatientsLikeMe and Biogen to better characterize multiple sclerosis patients, 40 where activity and mobility are clearly tied to quality of life. Some therapeutic areas may not require use of a wearable, but rather simple mobile phone applications such as Apple's ResearchKit.

### Beyond validation: getting health apps into clinical practice [^90202a1e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Digital formularies

Traditional formularies are lists of drug products that enable a provider organization, pharmacy, or payer to distinguish between preferred or non-preferred drugs based on several factors including cost and clinical value.In some settings, formularies dictate what medications are available to be prescribed; in other settings, formularies are used to get lower prices—for example, preference for a particular proton-pump inhibitor based on negotiation. Given the sheer number of available apps, a formulary for health apps—a “digital formulary”—could be an important mechanism for enabling apps to disseminate into clinical care, and would be valuable for the entire spectrum of apps—monitoring, diagnosis, therapeutics, etc. Express Scripts, a large US-based pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), recently announced a digital health formulary.CVS Health also recently announced a product that would enable its PBM customers to manage third-party health products.Outside the US, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service has launched an “Apps Library,” which is a curated list of health apps, with pricing information, for patients and providers to search for apps which may benefit them.

Digital formularies serve multiple purposes. First, they provide a short list of available apps, and providers could search these formularies and know what was available for a specific diagnosis or purpose—far more manageable than sifting through 300,000-plus apps in an app store. Second, from a safety perspective, a digital formulary could utilize a higher bar for listing an app than the app store, and could for example include apps which have received regulatory approval, or apps with clear evidence supporting their use. Third, digital formularies could enable streamlined coverage and pricing workflow, like traditional medication formularies. Fourth, digital formularies could provide a mechanism for patients and providers to know which apps would be supported by the provider organization and might for instance interoperate with the EHR they use. Organizations could even offer online, telephone, or in-person support for listed apps.

### Sustainable anticoagulation for climate resilient care [^62b4e126]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

This Viewpoint issues a multidisciplinary call to embed sustainability into anticoagulation care, aligning clinical excellence with climate responsibility. Anticoagulation management-including drug manufacturing, laboratory diagnostics, therapeutic monitoring, and long-term follow-up-contributes substantially to health-care-associated carbon emissions. We propose a systems-level decarbonisation strategy, anchored in life cycle assessment methodology, to quantify emissions across anticoagulation care and identify high-impact intervention points. Core strategies include reducing unnecessary laboratory testing, greening laboratory operations through recyclable consumables and energy-efficient infrastructure, transitioning to lower-carbon anticoagulants, and promoting antithrombotic stewardship to reduce dosing errors and drug waste. Digital health technologies, such as telemedicine, artificial intelligence, and mobile apps, are positioned as enablers of low-emission, patient-centred care. Circular economy principles and carbon-informed procurement are integrated into the therapeutic pathway, supported by policy levers that incentivise sustainable practices. Finally, we call for inclusive engagement of low-income and middle-income country stakeholders to ensure equitable, scalable, and context-appropriate implementation of climate-resilient thrombosis care.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^5dd4a4c8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

That is because the current ill-care model relies on lone data points collected during a medical appointment, often at three month-intervals, or even further apart. Everything one with chronic disease experiences outside those half-hour interactions—specific symptoms, lifestyle choices—are down to them to identify, remember, record and correctly (and honestly) disclose to the physician during the consultation, and for the health care professional (HCP) to correspondingly interpret and respond to. This means important data often go missing, precise evolution of certain conditions is lost and problems are identified too late. Communication with the doctor focuses on data-gathering at the expense of discussion of options. Data to develop a care plan is sparse. Adherence to the plan—which often requires the patient to make disagreeable decisions—is completely up to them.

Digital therapeutics use technology like data analytics and artificial intelligence and an understanding of behavioral psychology to provide an alternative. They can collect health data in real time, all the time, via wearable devices and applications, and communicate it, pre-analyzed, to health care practitioners and patients, providing them with an infinitely more complete understanding of the patient’s condition and habits to inform care plans. They enable patients to maintain frequent contact with HCPs, to keep them motivated and help them to take specific action when required. Both parties come to appointments with reliable information and can use the consultation to develop a care plan together, which in turn is more likely to be adhered to, with the HCP aware of progress and able to take action to motivate or change as necessary. The potential impact on health and quality of life for chronic disease sufferers is huge.

And that’s before we get on to the potential impact at the system level. Chronic disease is a huge drain on the world’s health systems coffers, which are under even greater pressure. This is particularly the case in Latin America, which suffered from increasing demand, constrained healthcare budgets, fragmentation of the healthcare system and inefficient use of resources even before Covid-19 struck. Chronic disease accounts for US$500 billion of healthcare expenditure per year in Latin America alone. Digital therapeutics help patients make wise, data-driven choices to better manage their illness, and thus help them to avoid extremely costly emergency treatment or hospitalization. Thus their potential is huge: not just to reduce the human costs of chronic disease, but also to make a dent in the enormous economic costs that it represents.

### Multinational landscape of health app policy: toward regulatory consensus on digital health [^eba19681]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Due to its enormous capacity for benefit, harm, and cost, health care is among the most tightly regulated industries in the world. But with the rise of smartphones, an explosion of direct-to-consumer mobile health applications has challenged the role of centralized gatekeepers. As interest in health apps continue to climb, national regulatory bodies have turned their attention toward strategies to protect consumers from apps that mine and sell health data, recommend unsafe practices, or simply do not work as advertised. To characterize the current state and outlook of these efforts, Essén and colleagues map the nascent landscape of national health app policies and raise several considerations for cross-border collaboration. Strategies to increase transparency, organize app marketplaces, and monitor existing apps are needed to ensure that the global wave of new digital health tools fulfills its promise to improve health at scale.

### The FDA's role in the development of medical mobile applications [^20b483a1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

The use of mobile apps is revolutionizing health-care delivery and has the potential to transform health care by allowing doctors to diagnose patients with potentially life-threatening conditions outside traditional health-care settings, as well as helping consumers manage their own health and wellness and gain access to useful information when and where they need it.

### Mobile app validation: a digital health scorecard approach [^9b821624]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are key limitations of the framework and results described. The oncology setting and the resulting focus areas do not reflect the entire range of mobile health apps available. Thus, this study does not represent a comprehensive assessment of all oncologic use cases, settings, and needs. In addition, the end-user requirements reflected the priorities from a sample of oncology conditions and were collected from a small group of patients and providers—other stakeholders and larger, more diverse groups were not represented. In the setting where the end-user perspective from the appropriate clinical and solution specific context is characterized by real-world data, this information could serve as a more representative substitute for the design groups. Thus, assessing both more conditions (and apps) and a larger, more diverse patient population would allow more generalizable conclusions. However, the narrower approach in this study allowed an assessment of the unique needs and use cases for the apps available for evaluation. Another limitation was the inability to discriminate quality using the cost domain. This challenge may continue to persist in the general evaluation of mobile apps where price, set up, and maintenance costs are generally low or non-existent. However, other areas of health technology are unlikely to have this same degree of homogeneity, and direct integration of mobile apps into broader care delivery solutions may introduce more discriminatory capabilities in the cost domain.

There is considerable variability in how the health technology evaluation approach herein could be executed and adapted to other technologies and applications. For example, we chose criteria based on standard, best clinical practice and made subjective decisions regarding the thoroughness of evaluation (i.e. number and type of evaluation criteria). The approach we chose represented a balance between efficiency and comprehensiveness. Financial, human, and time resources will also impact the criteria used. As a result, in different stakeholder contexts, the range and depth of evaluation could vary. We recommend establishing consensus-based tiers of evaluation for each domain to maintain consistency and transparency. A minimum set of criteria may also be useful to ensure the validity of the assessment.

Regardless, making these criteria transparent and widely available will be key to achieving consensus and driving higher standards for mobile health app development.

### What is digital health? [^bca2fadf]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

The broad scope of digital health includes categories such as mobile health, health information technology, wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine, and personalized medicine. From mobile medical apps and software that support the clinical decisions doctors make every day to artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital technology has been driving a revolution in health care. Digital health tools have the vast potential to improve our ability to accurately diagnose and treat disease and to enhance the delivery of health care for the individual. On this page:
- What are the benefits of digital health technologies.
- The FDA’s focus in digital health
- Who regulates mobile health apps. What Are the Benefits of Digital Health Technologies. Digital tools are giving providers a more holistic view of patient health through access to data and giving patients more control over their health.

Digital health offers real opportunities to improve medical outcomes and enhance efficiency. These technologies can empower consumers to make better-informed decisions about their own health and provide new options for facilitating prevention, early diagnosis of life-threatening diseases, and management of chronic conditions outside of traditional health care settings. Providers and other stakeholders are using digital health technologies in their efforts to:
- Reduce inefficiencies,
- Improve access,
- Reduce costs,
- Increase quality, and
- Make medicine more personalized for patients. Patients and consumers can use digital health technologies to better manage and track their health and wellness-related activities. The use of technologies, such as smart phones, social networks, and internet applications, is not only changing the way we communicate, but also providing innovative ways for us to monitor our health and well-being and giving us greater access to information.

Together, these advancements are leading to a convergence of people, information, technology, and connectivity to improve health care and health outcomes. As another important step in promoting the advancement of digital health technology, CDRH has established the Digital Health Center of Excellence which seeks to empower digital health stakeholders to advance health care.

### Digital therapeutics and the need for regulation: how to develop products that are innovative, patient-centric and safe [^8c299887]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Digital therapeutics are defined as therapeutic interventions that are driven by high quality software programs to prevent, manage or treat a medical disorder. These products provide great potential to improve patient outcomes, particularly for chronic disease sufferers, including people with Diabetes.

Main Text

As yet, regulatory pathways for these products are rather unclear across all jurisdictions, although somewhat more progress has been made in the US and UK. Since digital therapeutics use cutting-edge technology and a logic of continuous innovation, regulation used for medical devices may not be completely appropriate. However, these products could present risks to patients if not developed and used appropriately. In the article, we consider the importance of a regulation framework and the role of self-regulation by developers as a way of ensuring patient safety while promoting innovation. We particularly emphasize the inclusion of doctors and other medical professionals in the design of the products, not only as a way of ensuring safe and effective applications, but also to encourage their take-up by patients, who tend to have high levels of trust for their HCPs.

Conclusion

Developers of digital therapeutics have the duty to create products that are safe, ethical and effective, without waiting for government regulation. Further, by self-regulating, following principles such as those provided by the Digital Therapeutics Alliance, they can develop products that serve patients better, while continuing to innovate.

### A systematic review of consumers' and healthcare professionals' trust in digital healthcare [^363ccd2e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

It appears that people have increased trust when human interaction prevails or adds to AI-interventions, reinforcing our finding that trust is influenced by interpersonal factors. The positive influence of interpersonal trust on the quality of life and health-promoting behaviours such as medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, or online information seeking has been reported previously. Our review provides a more comprehensive rendering of trust and its’ associated and predictive factors and describes the effect of trust on the acceptance, use, adoption, and usefulness of digital health.

Trust in health providers can have a positive effect on consumers’ adoption of digital healthcare. More specifically, consumers’ trust in healthcare providers may be extended or transferred to the digital healthcare service endorsed by health providers. In this sense, a rise in healthcare provider trust would thereby also promote consumers’ trust in digital healthcare, making it the logical target for trust-builder interventions, particularly in the digital healthcare spheres of electronic medical platforms and mobile health. Clinical and service implementation guidelines to support the prescription of digital healthcare modalities and education opportunities are essential to assist healthcare professionals in this emerging practice –. In this context, we emphasise the role of medical devices regulatory bodies, such as the European Union’s Medical Device Regulation (MDR), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for example, in establishing safety, efficacy, and quality standards for digital healthcare. By broadening their scope to encompass other digital health modalities not currently considered medical devices (e.g. health and wellbeing mobile apps), these regulatory bodies could help to promote, build, and sustain trust in the digital health ecosystem.

### Digital technologies for cognitive assessment to accelerate drug development in Alzheimer's disease [^62aa1ac1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Given the explosion of interest in cognitive training, and the emergence of very large datasets that will quantitatively establish human variation across cognitive domains, the time is ripe for incorporation of novel clinical asset technologies into experimental drug trials. The future vision is one where classically slow, subjective, and data‐poor assessments of cognition are replaced by fast, objective, and data‐rich digital assessments that can be unequivocally linked to functional improvement by reference to large datasets. Achievement of this future state will require validation of emerging digital technologies through appropriate design and conduct of statistically robust clinical studies, with comparison against validated cognitive assessments and biomarkers.

In a world where the majority of the population carries a mobile digital device, where our behavioral status, cognitive capacity, and clinical function are ubiquitously and continuously tracked by the digital footprint we leave behind, the prospect for transformative efficiency and accuracy in testing novel therapeutics in neurodegenerative disease may rest in the devices we each carry in our pockets.

### Regulating digital health technologies with transparency: the case for dynamic and multi-stakeholder evaluation [^40405707]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The measure of success for any approach to medical app regulation is patient safety. A self-certification program engages policy makers, developers, and patients and clinicians in a learning system that transparently offers as much information as it collects. Such a mutually beneficial interchange prompts the design and build of mobile health apps that meet and respond to real needs. Self-certification sets a standard for transparency that holds developers accountable and incentivizes them to provide accurate information and protect user data. Self-certification also empowers patients and clinicians to play an active role in shaping the future of digital health and ensuring their needs guide the next generation of safe, effective, engaging, and clinically impactful apps.

### Mobile app validation: a digital health scorecard approach [^cf05fbc6]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

While digital health solutions continue to grow in number and in complexity, the ability for stakeholders in healthcare to easily discern quality lags far behind. This challenge is in part due to the lack of a transparent and standardized approach to validation. Evaluation of mobile health applications (apps) is further burdened by low barriers to development and direct-to-user marketing, leading to a crowded and confusing landscape. In this context, we investigated the pragmatic application of a previously described framework for digital health validation, the Digital Health Scorecard, in a cohort of 22 popular mobile health oncology apps. The apps evaluated using this framework performed poorly, scoring 49.4% across all evaluation criteria as a group. Performance across component domains varied considerably with cost scoring highest at 100%, usability at 56.7%, technical at 37.3%, and clinical at 15.9%. satisfaction of prospectively determined end-user requirements derived from patient, family, and clinician consensus scored 37.2%. While cost outperformed consistently and usability was adequate, the results also suggested that apps suffered from significant technical limitations, were of limited clinical value, and generally did not do what end users wanted. These large gaps further support the need for transparent and standardized evaluation to help all stakeholders in healthcare improve the quality of mobile health.

### Quality and benefits of the erectile dysfunction information on websites, social-media, and applications [^54625f67]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is defined as the persistent inability to obtain and maintain an erection that enables satisfactory sexual intercourse. ED prevalence vary across age groups, affecting approximately 1-9% of men under 40, 2-9% of those aged 40-59, and increasing to 20-40% for those aged 60-69. However, it remains a frequently untreated or insufficiently treated condition. Especially due to the feeling of discomfort and guilt, patients often avoid consulting their physicians; in this context, digital innovation could potentially play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of ED. This narrative review depicts the ongoing status of digital innovations in ED focusing on websites, social media platforms and mobile health applications (MHA). We examined Google, social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok), and the recently developed MHA apps on Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Websites provide readily available but sometimes difficult to understand information, while social media is easy to understand and act on. MHA apps are the most complete and trustworthy tool for self-care management. In conclusion, digital innovations are a continuously growing source of information and therapeutic tools.

### Digitizing clinical trials [^aa974b13]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Digital health data collection

Following recruitment of participants for a clinical trial, data must be collected as part of the trial process. Digital data in clinical trials can take many forms, ranging from clinical and demographic data, sensed physiological and activity data, patient reported outcomes and images collected via a smart phone or tablet, electronic medical record data from a vendor API, and biological samples drawn at home or in a local lab. Aside from the biological samples, examples of digital health data collection are described in this section.

Digital monitoring and biomarkers

The term digital biomarker typically refers specifically to objective measures of physiologic, pathologic, anatomic, behavioral, social or activity characteristics, and patient self-report that can be acquired using digital technology and “evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathologic processes, or biological responses to therapeutic interventions”,. While many digital biomarkers are still being validated, over time they may provide in-depth information regarding physiological processes central to informing diagnostics, dosing titration and as endpoints for clinical trials. Examples include wearable sweat sensing for glucose and lactate, as well as electrolytes, cardiogenic chest wall vibrations to assess clinical status of patients with heart failure, or structural health markers for knee joint injury obtained through a brace.

Digital technologies can also be leveraged to enable the collection of data that could not be obtained previously. For example, Zhan et al. required subjects to perform five cognitive tasks on a smartphone application, then merged the task data to form a validated mobile Parkinson’s disease score. Brogioli and colleagues validated wearable sensors to generate a neurological classification in spinal cord injury. Recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved digital approaches to detect rhythm abnormalities, such as atrial fibrillation, through sensors in the Apple Watch, including electrodes for electrocardiography and optical sensors for photoplethysmography,.

### Efficacy of a mobile app-based intervention for young adults with anxiety disorders: a randomized clinical trial [^15fed20b]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of a comprehensive, scalable, self-guided mobile CBT intervention for young adults with anxiety, which did not differ significantly by incentive condition. The Maya app includes design features, an engaging user interface, and broad coverage of CBT techniques that address the limitations of existing digital mental health apps. In the context of a mental health crisis in young adults and numerous barriers to traditional mental health services, digital interventions represent a promising step toward wider dissemination of high-quality, evidence-based interventions. Such interventions have the potential to help with shortages of mental health professionals and long wait times and to address geographic and socioeconomic disparities in access to care. Treatment programs that incorporate apps may be a viable strategy to address the persistent lack of access to adequate mental health carethat exists even in resource-rich settings.

### Digital health, digital medicine, and digital therapeutics in cardiology: current evidence and future perspective in Japan [^eb19df2b]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Ten years passed since Japan set out the Action Plan of Growth Strategy that declared the initiatives of digitalization for medicine, nursing care, and healthcare to achieve the world's most advanced medical care. The initiatives formed the foundation of the Japanese national strategy and have been continuously refined, resulting in the current environment of digital health and digital medicine. Digital health-related terminologies are organized, such as "digital health," "digital medicine," and "digital therapeutics" (DTx), as well as several common digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mobile health (mHealth). DTx is included in mHealth and is a novel disease treatment option. Also, this article thoroughly describes DTx in Japan and compares it with those in the US and Germany, the leading countries in digital health-related policies, regulations, and their development status. In Japan, two of three DTx applications that have been approved and reimbursed by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare are explained in detail in relation to cardiovascular medicine. When added to a standard smoking cessation program, the DTx system for nicotine dependence significantly improved the continuous abstinence rate. Moreover, the DTx for hypertension together with the guideline-based hypertension management was effective in patients aged 65 years or younger who were diagnosed with essential hypertension without antihypertensive agents, and it was also found to be cost-effective. DTx in cardiovascular medicine, with consideration on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, could be widely used not only through basic experiments and clinical studies but also through social implementation.

### The first software as medical device of evidence-based hypertension digital therapeutics for clinical practice [^ffa28886]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2021, the open-label randomized HERB-Digital Hypertension 1 (HERB-DH1) trial showed for the first time that hypertension digital therapeutics (a hypertension treatment app) successfully reduced blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension. Patients in the digital therapeutics group who used the app and home BP monitoring (HBPM) showed significant and persistent decreases in office, home and ambulatory BP values compared with the control group (who were under physician management using HBPM and lifestyle modifications). The results of the pivotal study led to the first global approval of this app for the treatment of hypertension in Japan in 2022, including medical insurance reimbursement. As a result, this hypertension app is expected to become widely used in the clinical management of all stages of hypertension. The most important remaining research issues include the identification of patients likely to respond to this therapeutic approach and the development of clinical efficacy indices. In addition, guidelines for the appropriate use of hypertension apps in the treatment of hypertension are needed. Next steps include the development and research of digital tools to facilitate the behavioral modifications required to prevent hypertension.

### Digital health-enabled genomics: opportunities and challenges [^c64ac2c4]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Digital health solutions, with apps, virtual care, and electronic medical records, are gaining momentum across all medical disciplines, and their adoption has been accelerated, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal wearables, sensors, and mobile technologies are increasingly being used to identify health risks and assist in diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of health and disease. Genomics is a vanguard of digital healthcare as we witness a convergence of the fields of genomic and digital medicine. Spurred by the acute need to increase health literacy, empower patients' preference-sensitive decisions, or integrate vast amounts of complex genomic data into the clinical workflow, there has been an emergence of digital support tools in genomics-enabled care. We present three use cases that demonstrate the application of these converging technologies: digital genomics decision support tools, conversational chatbots to scale the genetic counseling process, and the digital delivery of comprehensive genetic services. These digital solutions are important to facilitate patient-centered care delivery, improve patient outcomes, and increase healthcare efficiencies in genomic medicine. Yet the development of these innovative digital genomic technologies also reveals strategic challenges that need to be addressed before genomic digital health can be broadly adopted. Alongside key evidentiary gaps in clinical and cost-effectiveness, there is a paucity of clinical guidelines, policy, and regulatory frameworks that incorporate digital health. We propose a research agenda, guided by learning healthcare systems, to realize the vision of digital health-enabled genomics to ensure its sustainable and equitable deployment in clinical care.
