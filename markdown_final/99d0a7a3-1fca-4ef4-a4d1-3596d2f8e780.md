## Question

Can xanthomas indicate an underlying serious health condition

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether xanthomas can indicate an underlying serious health condition. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what xanthomas are pathophysiologically and whether they typically reflect systemic lipid disorders. Then, I should verify which xanthoma morphologies map to specific high-risk metabolic states. Next, I will check the evidence quantifying cardiovascular and other serious risks in patients with xanthomas. After that, I need to consider normolipemic xanthomas that herald hematologic or hepatic disease. I will also review rare monogenic conditions where xanthomas signal neurologic or early atherosclerotic risk. Finally, I should synthesize a practical clinical approach and confirm whether early recognition changes outcomes, making sure to correct any misconceptions along the way based on the data at hand.

> Let me first confirm definitions and mechanisms. Xanthomas are localized dermal, subcutaneous, or tendinous deposits of lipid-laden foamy macrophages that arise when circulating lipoproteins extravasate and are taken up by tissue histiocytes, most often reflecting an underlying disorder of lipoprotein metabolism rather than a purely cutaneous problem.

> I need to ensure I correctly link morphology to systemic risk. Eruptive xanthomas usually signal severe hypertriglyceridemia, often in poorly controlled diabetes, and can presage or accompany acute pancreatitis; prompt recognition and triglyceride lowering are critical to prevent life-threatening complications [^11345Vy9] [^1116nJoZ] [^117L53Mx]. Tendon xanthomas classically indicate familial hypercholesterolemia and correlate with accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular disease, whereas palmar or planar xanthomas point toward type III hyperlipoproteinemia with heightened atherosclerotic risk; in cholestatic liver disease, the appearance of planar and diffuse xanthomas often reflects lipoprotein X–mediated dyslipidemia and progressive hepatobiliary pathology that improves only when cholestasis is corrected [^1129c4Vz] [^111ks4yp] [^111X1x9X] [^111Y9MZP].

> Hold on, I should verify how much vascular risk xanthomas themselves portend beyond the lipid numbers. In genetically confirmed heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the presence of tendon xanthomas is associated with roughly a threefold higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with FH patients without xanthomas, and registry data show higher standardized mortality from coronary heart disease among xanthomatous FH even during treatment, underscoring that xanthomas identify a particularly high-risk phenotype warranting aggressive lipid lowering and family cascade screening [^116a4Jrk] [^115JCh3T] [^111Y6gye].

> Next, I should review whether xanthomas can occur with normal lipid profiles and still indicate something serious. Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthomas can herald monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, or related hematologic disorders, with proposed immune complex–lipoprotein interactions driving foam cell formation; in such cases, treating the paraproteinemia can improve the cutaneous disease, so failing to evaluate for a monoclonal process risks missing a malignancy or premalignant condition [^114KgoKi] [^113wFqc1]. I will also note that xanthoma disseminatum and other non-Langerhans histiocytoses may present with xanthomatous lesions and systemic involvement, and lipid levels can be normal or elevated, which means I need to check both hematologic and metabolic evaluations when the morphology is atypical or widespread [^115Rd29N].

> Let me consider rare monogenic conditions in which xanthomas flag organ-threatening disease. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis presents with tendon xanthomas, juvenile cataracts, and progressive neurologic dysfunction due to cholestanol accumulation; early diagnosis and chenodeoxycholic acid therapy can stabilize or halt neurologic decline, whereas delayed recognition leads to irreversible disability and even premature cardiovascular disease in some cases [^114uAxL3] [^1156fKcC] [^111mx4tV]. Sitosterolemia causes tendon and tuberous xanthomas, arthritis, hematologic abnormalities, and premature atherosclerosis from plant sterol accumulation; dietary restriction and targeted therapy can prevent fatal cardiac events if recognized early, so I need to ensure plant sterol testing when the distribution or age of onset is atypical for common dyslipidemias [^11346nMi] [^112jSsdU].

> I should confirm important secondary causes that transform xanthomas into red flags for reversible systemic disease. Severe hypothyroidism can drive extreme hyperlipidemia with eruptive or tuberous xanthomas that resolve with thyroid hormone replacement; similarly, medications and endocrine disorders can secondarily worsen lipid profiles such that the skin becomes the first clue to an iatrogenic or endocrine cause that is correctable [^11688xTb] [^111mwmAv]. Recognizing these links changes management from purely dermatologic to targeted endocrine or pharmacologic intervention, which directly mitigates serious downstream risks like pancreatitis and atherosclerotic events [^111mwmAv] [^117L53Mx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I often hear that xanthelasma palpebrarum is just cosmetic and not necessarily linked to cardiovascular disease; I should double-check that. On review, a systematic review and meta-analysis shows patients with xanthelasma have higher total cholesterol, higher LDL, and increased carotid intima-media thickness versus controls, supporting an association with atherosclerosis and reinforcing the need to screen for dyslipidemia and vascular risk rather than dismissing these lesions [^114zospc].

> But wait, about lipoprotein X in cholestasis, I initially thought LpX was purely refluxed from bile into blood; let me verify the current understanding. More recent evidence suggests hepatocellular generation and secretion of LpX drive this dyslipidemia, and the resultant diffuse xanthomas typically improve only when the cholestasis is treated definitively, sometimes requiring liver transplantation rather than conventional lipid-lowering alone [^111X1x9X] [^111Y9MZP].

> I will now examine how recognition of xanthomas should change my clinical workflow. I need to obtain a focused history, family pedigree, and a fasting or appropriately timed lipid panel, rule out secondary causes, and strongly consider FH when tendon xanthomas are present with high LDL-C, prompting cascade screening per guidelines; if I see palmar planar changes I should evaluate for type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and if lesions are diffuse and the patient is cholestatic I should assess for LpX and underlying hepatobiliary disease; when plane xanthomas are normolipemic, I should screen for a monoclonal gammopathy and related hematologic disorders; in children or young adults with tendon or tuberous lesions, I should consider CTX or sitosterolemia with targeted biochemical or genetic testing, because timely, disease-specific therapy alters prognosis [^111Y6gye] [^114GY9Hx] [^111mwmAv] [^113wFqc1] [^1156fKcC] [^11346nMi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without considering outcomes; I should verify whether early recognition actually improves morbidity and mortality. Case series and practice guidance emphasize that identifying eruptive xanthomas expedites triglyceride reduction and prevents pancreatitis, recognizing tendon xanthomas accelerates aggressive LDL lowering and family screening to avert premature coronary events, and detecting normolipemic plane xanthomas can unmask treatable paraproteinemia or occult malignancy, all translating to meaningful reductions in serious adverse events when addressed promptly [^11345Vy9] [^117L53Mx] [^111Y6gye] [^113wFqc1].

> Putting it all together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, xanthomas can indicate an underlying serious health condition because they frequently reflect high-risk dyslipidemias linked to acute pancreatitis and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, they can herald cholestatic liver disease with LpX dyslipidemia, they may unmask monoclonal gammopathies or hematologic malignancies even when lipids are normal, and in rare monogenic disorders like cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis or sitosterolemia they are early clues to progressive neurologic or cardiovascular morbidity that is mitigable with targeted therapy if recognized early [^111mwmAv] [^116a4Jrk] [^111X1x9X] [^113wFqc1] [^1156fKcC] [^11346nMi].

---

Yes, xanthomas can indicate **serious underlying conditions**, most often **familial hypercholesterolemia** [^1129c4Vz] and other genetic dyslipidemias that markedly increase cardiovascular risk [^111Y6gye]. They also signal **severe hypertriglyceridemia** with risk of acute pancreatitis [^11345Vy9] and may be the first clue to secondary causes such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, cholestatic liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome [^111mwmAv]. Plane or diffuse xanthomas, especially with normal lipids [^113wFqc1], may precede **hematologic malignancies** or monoclonal gammopathies [^114KgoKi]. Early recognition should prompt **urgent evaluation and treatment** to prevent cardiovascular events, pancreatitis, or progression of systemic disease [^114GY9Hx].

## Clinical significance of xanthomas

Xanthomas are **strongly associated with disorders of lipid metabolism** [^117GjkYn], including:

- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: A genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels, leading to premature cardiovascular disease [^1129c4Vz]. Tendon xanthomas are a hallmark of FH [^114GY9Hx] and indicate a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events [^116qHzxB].

- **Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia)**: Characterized by elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, associated with tuberous and palmar xanthomas, and increased risk of atherosclerosis [^1155Pniz].

- **Familial hypertriglyceridemia**: Associated with eruptive xanthomas and increased risk of acute pancreatitis [^117L53Mx].

- **Sitosterolemia**: A rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated plant sterol levels, xanthomas, and premature cardiovascular disease [^112jSsdU] [^11346nMi].

---

## Xanthomas and cardiovascular risk

The presence of xanthomas — particularly tendon xanthomas — is strongly associated with **increased cardiovascular risk** [^116qHzxB]. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have tendon xanthomas have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than those without xanthomas [^116a4Jrk]. Xanthomas share pathophysiological mechanisms with atherosclerosis — lipid accumulation and inflammation — underscoring their significance as cardiovascular risk markers [^113GdY1e] [^115JhFbf].

---

## Xanthomas and pancreatitis risk

Eruptive xanthomas are often associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia, which markedly increases the risk of **acute pancreatitis** [^117L53Mx]. Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis can cause substantial morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated [^11345Vy9].

---

## Xanthomas and systemic diseases

Xanthomas can also be **associated with systemic diseases** beyond lipid disorders, including:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Associated with eruptive xanthomas due to severe hypertriglyceridemia [^11345Vy9] [^115ynsnV].

- **Hypothyroidism**: Can cause secondary hyperlipidemia and xanthoma formation [^111mwmAv] [^11688xTb].

- **Cholestatic liver disease**: Associated with plane xanthomas due to abnormal lipid metabolism [^111mwmAv] [^113ZxE5W].

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Can cause secondary hyperlipidemia and xanthoma formation [^111mwmAv].

- **Monoclonal gammopathies and hematologic malignancies**: Diffuse plane xanthomas can be associated with monoclonal gammopathies, multiple myeloma, and other hematologic malignancies [^114KgoKi] [^113wFqc1].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of xanthomas

The presence of xanthomas should **prompt thorough diagnostic evaluation** to identify underlying lipid or systemic diseases [^111Y6gye]. Recommended tests include:

- **Lipid profile**: Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides [^114GY9Hx].

- **Liver function tests**: To assess for cholestatic liver disease [^111X1x9X].

- **Thyroid function tests**: To evaluate for hypothyroidism [^111mwmAv].

- **Blood glucose levels**: To assess for diabetes mellitus [^1143D8iG].

- **Genetic testing**: For familial hypercholesterolemia or other genetic lipid disorders [^111Y6gye].

- **Hematologic evaluation**: For monoclonal gammopathies or hematologic malignancies in cases of diffuse plane xanthomas [^114KgoKi].

---

## Management and treatment

Management of xanthomas involves **addressing the underlying lipid disorder or systemic disease** with lipid-lowering therapy (statins, fibrates, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, and PCSK9 inhibitors) [^114GY9Hx] to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels [^111mwmAv]; dietary modification with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet; and treatment of diabetes, hypothyroidism, or liver disease [^111Y9MZP]. Surgical or laser removal may be considered for cosmetic reasons or symptomatic relief in selected cases.

---

Xanthomas are **important clinical markers** of serious underlying conditions — particularly disorders of lipid metabolism — and signal risk for cardiovascular disease [^114zospc], pancreatitis [^117L53Mx], and other systemic diseases. Early recognition and appropriate diagnostic evaluation are crucial to identify and manage the cause, thereby reducing the risk of serious complications [^111Y6gye].

### Acute pancreatitis with eruptive xanthoma [^11345Vy9]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Eruptive xanthomas are benign skin lesions caused by localized deposition of lipids in the dermis. They can present as early manifestations of systemic disorders, typically caused by elevated levels of serum triglycerides and uncontrolled diabetes. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying condition decrease morbidity and mortality. After treatment of the underlying metabolic disorders, the lesions often disappear without leaving scars.

We present a case with multiple yellowish, erythematous papules on the extremities suggestive of eruptive xanthomas, admitted to our hospital with acute pancreatitis.

### Dyslipidemia [^111mwmAv]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on dyslipidemia:

- **Definition**: Dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, and/or increased triglycerides, which contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.

- **Pathophysiology**:
	- **Primary causes**: Genetic abnormalities
	- **Secondary causes**:
		- **Health conditions**: Obesity, physical inactivity, high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets, smoking, alcohol use, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, cholestatic liver disease, nephrotic syndrome
		- **Drugs**: Corticosteroids, progestogens, androgenic steroids, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, oral estrogens, retinoic acid derivatives

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, an estimated 53% of adults have at least one lipid abnormality: 27% have elevated LDL cholesterol, 23% have decreased HDL cholesterol, and 30% have increased triglycerides.

- **Disease course**: Lipid abnormalities contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Treatment with statins is associated with a relative reduction in the risk of major adverse vascular events of 22% in men and 16% in women for every 1.0 mmol/L (38.6 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.

### Differences in characteristics and risk of cardiovascular disease in familial hypercholesterolemia patients with and without tendon xanthomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116a4Jrk]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Tendon xanthomas are characteristic of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). It is not clear whether FH patients with xanthomas have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than those without xanthomas. The clinical diagnosis of FH in patients without xanthomas requires the presence of CVD in the patient or in a first-degree relative. This may have masked the association between xanthomas and CVD in a number of studies. A diagnosis of FH based on the presence of a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene is free from this selection on CVD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we therefore compared the risk of CVD between patients heterozygous for LDLR mutation with and without xanthomas.

- **Methods and results**: We conducted a literature search with PubMed and the Web of Science up to January 14, 2009. We selected all articles examining more than 25 human heterozygous FH patients that provided information about xanthomas. Articles had to be written in a Western European language. A total of 22 articles suited for analyses. A genetic confirmation of FH was compulsory to correctly assess the risk of CVD with the presence of xanthomas. Age, male gender, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride level were associated with the presence of xanthomas (p < 0.05 for all). In patients with genetically confirmed FH, xanthomas were associated with a 3.20-fold higher risk of CVD (95% CI 2.12–4.82, p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Xanthomas are associated with a 3 times higher risk of CVD among FH patients, suggesting that xanthomas and CVD may share etiology.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia [^1129c4Vz]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2017). High credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with several clinical manifestations, including planar xanthomas, tendon xanthomas, aortic stenosis, and cerebrovascular disease. Additional conditions include xanthelasma palpebrarum, ankle pain, elevated serum cholesterol, ischemic heart disease, corneal arcus, and peripheral vascular disease. Patients may also experience hypercholesterolemia, arthralgia, tuberous xanthomas, and increased serum LDL levels.

### Cutaneous manifestations of monoclonal gammopathy [^114KgoKi]. Blood Cancer Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma is associated with monoclonal gammopathy and is characterized by xanthelasma (periorbital plane xanthoma) and diffuse plane xanthoma of the head, neck, trunk, shoulders, or extremities. Xanthomas normally occur in hyperlipidemic patients; however, in rare cases, they can occur in patients with normal lipid profiles. Normolipemic plane xanthoma can be associated with MGUS, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and Castleman disease. The skin lesions present as yellowish-orange plaques. The pathogenesis is unknown, but immune complex formation between antibodies and lipoproteins likely causes lipid accumulation in macrophages. Plane xanthoma should be differentiated from necrobiotic xanthogranuloma by their diffuse and plane patches. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma are more polymorphic, described as red-brown, violaceous, or yellowish cutaneous plaques, papules, or nodules. In patients with limited lesions, surgical resection or ablative laser therapy can be employed. Otherwise, systemic treatment with bortezomib, melphalan, and/or high-dose corticosteroids may be necessary to achieve hematologic and cutaneous remission.

Scleromyxedema, a primary dermal diffuse mucinosis, was first described by Dubruilh and Reitmann as a skin disease similar to scleroderma. Mucinoses are characterized by mucin deposits in connective tissue. The skin exhibits dense, firm, waxy, reddish, or skin-colored, dome-shaped, or flat-topped papules measuring 2–3 mm in size. It typically involves the hands, head, and upper trunk.

### Extensive papulonodular xanthoma: a diagnostic clue to homozygous familial hyperlipidaemia [^115o6HcM]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A man in his early 30s presented with multiple soft tissue swellings over the buttocks, around the knees, ankles, and dorsum of both hands since childhood. His father and paternal uncle had similar lesions, and his father had coronary artery disease. One of his sisters had a history of sudden death due to an unknown cause at 14 years. The patient and his parents had very high serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of familial hyperlipidaemia type II was made. Larger lesions were excised in stages, and histopathological evaluation revealed the lesions to be eruptive xanthoma. A cardiac assessment revealed no significant abnormality. Lipid-lowering agents and low-dose aspirin were started, and the patient was advised to undergo regular cardiology and endocrine evaluations. This case emphasizes its rare presentation and the importance of early diagnosis and management to prevent any untoward future incidents.

### Comparison of the risk of fatal coronary heart disease in treated xanthomatous and non-xanthomatous heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: a prospective registry study [^115JCh3T]. Atherosclerosis (2003). Low credibility.

A clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is often made in the absence of tendon xanthomata (TX), which are not usually present before the fourth decade of life. The prognosis of treated non-xanthomatous (TX-) FH is uncertain, and the objective of this study was to compare mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with treated TX+ (definite) and TX- (possible) heterozygous FH.

- **Methods**: A diagnosis of definite or possible FH was based on raised cholesterol levels (> 7.5 mmol/l) and a family history of premature CHD or hypercholesterolaemia. Patients were recruited from 21 outpatient lipid clinics in the UK from 1980 to 1998. The cohort of 1569 patients with TX+ FH was followed for 12,754 person-years and the cohort of 1302 patients with TX- FH for 10,238 person-years. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated from the ratio of the number of deaths observed to the number expected in the general population of England as well as Wales (SMR = 100 for reference population).

- **Findings and discussion**: CHD accounted for 64 (63%) of the 102 deaths in the TX+ cohort and 38 (57%) of the 67 deaths in the TX- cohort, with the SMR for a fatal coronary event being, respectively, 294 (95% confidence interval 228, 380, P < 0.00001) and 205 (95% CI 145, 282, P = 0.0001). The similarly elevated CHD mortality risk suggests that, in adulthood, both groups of patients should be treated equally aggressively with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).

### Xanthomas: Clinical and pathophysiological relations [^117GjkYn]. Biomedical Papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia (2014). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, xanthomas can be attributed to acquired hypercholesterolemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, familial hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, xanthoma disseminatum, xanthoma diabeticorum, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, glycogenosis type 1A, and tuberous xanthomas.

### The triad of pruritus, xanthomas, and cholestasis: Two cases and a brief review of the literature [^113h3pYJ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

When encountered in children, xanthomas are most commonly associated with a group of disorders known as familial hyperlipidemias. Aside from cosmetic concerns, these xanthomas are typically asymptomatic. However, when generalized pruritus is a prominent associated symptom, clinicians should consider a different set of diagnoses that includes cholestasis of the liver. In this article, we present two illustrative cases of children with cholestatic disease, pruritus, and xanthomas, and discuss other disorders that may include this triad.

### Xanthoma of rib: A case report and review of the literature [^113ZzbJ9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Xanthomatous lesions of the skin, blood vessels, abdominal viscera, and reticuloendothelial organs occur commonly as a complication of hyperlipidemic states. Mainly, they appear in male and obese patients where lipids form deposits in soft tissue. Usually, these lesions are found in hyperlipidemia and familial hyperlipoproteinemia, but only a few cases have been reported in its absence.

However, bone involvement is notoriously rare. Generally, the most frequent localizations are the diaphysis of long bones, especially the tibia. Nevertheless, the skull may also be involved, including the mastoid air cells, mandibular bone, and temporal or frontal bone, which may cause cerebellar compression. The axial skeleton is not spared either, as a xanthoma case of the sacrum and calcaneus has been described in the literature.

### Omega-3-induced xanthoma in a child: A case report [^116ffHT6]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Xanthomas predominantly consist of foam cells, which are macrophages engorged with oxidized LDL particles extravasated from blood vessels. The patient's total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly high. The xanthomas were consistent with lipid-laden macrophage infiltration, with a clinical presentation of nodular and plaque-like skin lesions on the elbows, knees, popliteal fossae, and palms.

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are known for their triglyceride-lowering effects and cardiovascular benefits. However, DHA can paradoxically raise LDL-C levels, with studies showing a significant increase of 7.23 mg/dL, while EPA has a milder effect. In this case, excessive omega-3 intake likely overwhelmed the child's ability to maintain lipid balance, leading to elevated serum LDL-C and xanthoma formation. According to guidelines, for children aged 4–8 years, the recommended daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids is 900 mg/day, with emphasis on DHA and EPA. The dosage increases to 1200 mg/day in boys aged 9–13 years. In this case, the child had been consuming 3 or more capsules daily, amounting to 3000–4000 mg, which far exceeded the recommended pediatric dosage.

The primary differential diagnoses for xanthomas in this child included FH, type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia, and drug-induced hypercholesterolemia. FH, a genetic disorder, presents with elevated LDL-C and early-onset xanthomas. However, the normalization of lipid levels after stopping omega-3 supplementation strongly ruled out FH and type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia.

### Normolipemic papuloeruptive xanthomatosis in a child [^115PMtZn]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Normolipemic papuloeruptive xanthomatosis is a very rare skin disorder. We report a case of a child with yellowish papular eruptions on the face that rapidly merged into confluent plaques. Serum lipid profiles showed normolipemia. A diagnosis of normolipemic papuloeruptive xanthomatosis with no associated systemic disorders was made. The skin lesions involuted spontaneously during follow-up.

### Xanthoma striatum palmare and biliary tract atresia: An unusual association [^112BxixU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Cutaneous xanthomas develop as a result of lipid deposition in the dermis and may be a manifestation of various systemic diseases. The morphology and anatomic location of xanthomas are often a clue to the underlying cause. Xanthoma striatum palmare (XSP) is classically associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and is rarely observed in hepatic disorders. We present a case of a 2-year-old child diagnosed with XSP and biliary tract atresia.

### Omega-3-induced xanthoma in a child: A case report [^111a7tyc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are distinct dermatological signs of lipid metabolism abnormalities, marked by localized lipid deposits in the skin, tendons, and connective tissues, often associated with hyperlipidemia. While commonly linked to inherited lipid disorders like familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), they can also result from dietary or drug-induced lipid disturbances. This case highlights a rare instance of pediatric xanthoma caused by excessive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, a scarcely documented association.

Omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are essential nutrients primarily obtained through diet or supplementation. While generally beneficial for cardiovascular health due to their triglyceride-lowering effects, certain formulations can paradoxically raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The impact on lipid metabolism is dose-dependent, with excessive intake potentially disrupting lipid balance. This effect is more pronounced in pediatric patients due to their distinct metabolic pathways and dosage requirements.

We describe the case of a 7-year-old boy with asymptomatic, slowly progressing bilateral xanthomas of the elbows, knees, popliteal fossae, and palmar creases. By detailing the clinical presentation, diagnostic process, and treatment outcomes, this report aims to contribute to the growing body of evidence on pediatric xanthomas and provide insights into the safe use of omega-3 fatty acid supplements in children.

### Serum lipids and risk of atherosclerosis in xanthelasma palpebrarum: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zospc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The association between dyslipidemia and xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP) remains controversial, and no definite evidence has indicated atherosclerosis risk in patients with XP.

- **Objective**: The present study was a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate the association of serum lipid profiles and risk of atherosclerotic diseases with XP.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched for the eligible comparative studies published before April 15, 2019, in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library. A random-effects model was used to calculate the standard mean difference with a 95% confidence interval for each pooled estimate.

- **Results**: The qualitative analyses included 15 case-control studies with 854 patients with XP. Compared with the controls, the patients with XP had significantly higher serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, significantly higher apolipoprotein B levels, relatively lower apolipoprotein A1 levels, and the carotid intima-media thickness was significantly higher.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with XP had significantly higher serum levels of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins and bore a significantly higher risk of atherosclerosis than the controls. Careful monitoring and targeted intervention for prevention of cardiovascular diseases is essential for these patients.

### Impact of clinical signs and genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia on the prevalence of coronary artery disease in patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia [^114a9HkH]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The impact of positive clinical signs, such as xanthoma and/or family history, and positive familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) mutation status on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), beyond what is predicted by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level alone, has not been fully determined. We assessed whether positive clinical signs and a genetic FH diagnosis affected CAD risk among subjects with significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels (≥ 180 mg/dL, or ≥ 140 mg/dL in subjects). Our findings indicated that individuals with positive FH indicators had 11-fold higher odds of developing CAD (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 4.4–30.2; P = 1.1×10⁻⁵) after adjusting for known risk factors including LDL cholesterol.

### Xanthoma disseminatum with extensive Koebnerization associated with familial hypertriglyceridemia [^115Rd29N]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Plasma lipid levels should be evaluated in all patients with xanthoma disseminatum, including their family members. We also suggest including xanthoma disseminatum in the differential diagnosis of dermatoses exhibiting the Köebner phenomenon.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and therapy [^114uAxL3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

In this report, we review the clinical, biochemical, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic aspects of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We stress the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we describe our experience in treating patients with chenodeoxycholic acid, an essential drug for this disorder that is no longer available.

### Xanthomas: Clinical and pathophysiological relations [^1155Pniz]. Biomedical Papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia (2014). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, tendon xanthomas can be caused by pseudoxanthomatous diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, primary biliary cholangitis, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, familial hypercholesterolemia, familial defective apo B-100, familial isolated vitamin E deficiency, sitosterolemia, LDL receptor deficiency, and apoprotein E deficiency.

### Unmasking of childhood hypothyroidism by disseminated xanthomas [^11688xTb]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperlipidemia is a common laboratory finding in children with nephrotic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. However, clinical signs of hyperlipidemia are extremely rare in childhood. We report on an 11-year-old girl who presented with a disseminated yellow papulomatous rash on the lower limbs and yellow skin creases on the palms of her hands. Blood tests yielded an opaque serum with a triglyceride concentration of 820 mg/dL and cholesterol of 1050 mg/dL.

A skin biopsy of one of the papules confirmed the diagnosis of xanthomas. Additional examinations revealed clinical (weight gain, diminished growth rate) and biochemical primary hypothyroidism (free T4: 0.4 ng/L [normal 8–22 ng/L]; thyroid-stimulating hormone: > 200 mU/L) as a consequence of Hashimoto thyroiditis (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin: 4400 U/mL and > 2000 U/mL, respectively; normal < 60 U/mL). The patient was started on L-thyroxine, which led to a gradual decline of cholesterol and triglycerides to normal concentrations and a complete remission from the xanthomatous rash.

For the first time, this case depicts disseminated xanthomas of the skin as the presenting complaint of severe hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and xanthoma.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: A complex interplay between a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition [^111PwsTh]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disease characterized by abnormal bile acid synthesis. It often presents with systemic and neurological manifestations; however, atypical presentations can lead to significant diagnostic challenges. This case report highlights the diagnostic complexities and management considerations in a patient with an uncommon presentation of CTX.

- **Methods**: We present a patient with a 25-year history of spastic paraparesis, initially suggestive of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), ultimately diagnosed with CTX associated with a novel CYP27A1 variant of uncertain significance (VUS).

- **Results**: A 53-year-old Greek woman presented with a 25-year history of slowly progressive spastic paraparesis. Initial investigations were largely unremarkable, leading to a presumptive diagnosis of a hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP)-like syndrome. After 5 years of slow disease progression, the patient developed right ankle swelling. MRI revealed significant enlargement of the Achilles tendon, suggestive of xanthoma infiltration. Subsequent genetic testing identified a homozygous variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the CYP27A1 gene. Biochemical analyses revealed elevated cholestanol levels and cholestanepentol glucuronide in urine, confirming the diagnosis of CTX. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid stabilized her condition over 3 years, but advanced disease limited efficacy in improving disability.

- **Conclusion**: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with CTX, stemming from its complex clinical presentations and genetic variability.

### Type iii hyperlipoproteinemia with xanthomas and multiple myeloma [^117314n5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Type III hyperlipoproteinemia usually results from an inherited defect in the composition of apolipoprotein E and is associated with atherosclerosis. An acquired form of the type III phenotype may rarely be associated with myeloma and immunoglobulin-lipoprotein complexes.

- **Observation**: We present the case of a 72-year-old man with a history of well-controlled, unclassified hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, without evidence of atherosclerotic disease. He subsequently developed refractory dyslipidemia, palmar crease, and tuberous xanthomas. Type III hyperlipoproteinemia was confirmed, and nonclassic defective apolipoprotein E. Common secondary causes of hyperlipidemia were ruled out. A workup for malignancy revealed monoclonal IgA gammopathy. Immunostaining confirmed IgA antibodies complexed to the patient's very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction, causing gross impairment of VLDL metabolism. Conventional therapy for type III hyperlipoproteinemia was attempted but ineffective. Thus, chemotherapy was initiated for his myeloma, with subsequent lowering of his IgA, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and improvement of his xanthomas.

- **Conclusion**: There are several unusual features to this case. Planar xanthomas can be associated with myelomas, but usually in the setting of normal lipids. Type III hyperlipoproteinemias are not usually refractory to standard therapy and are only rarely associated with IgA myeloma. IgA antibodies complexed to the patient's VLDL caused gross impairment of VLDL metabolism. The patient's apolipoprotein E genotype (heter…

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis — the spectrum of imaging findings [^1133PTcQ]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), also known as Van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein disease, is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of lipid metabolism. At the time of writing, there are fewer than 300 cases reported worldwide. We present a case of a 30-year-old male who presented with mental retardation and swelling of the ankles, showcasing a spectrum of CTX imaging findings. Imaging studies were performed, including plain X-ray, ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of both the brain and ankles. These pointed towards the diagnosis of CTX with the entire spectrum of findings, which was confirmed with biopsy and laboratory findings. CTX is a potentially treatable condition with replacement therapy; hence, early diagnosis before neurological deterioration is important. This is aided by the imaging findings, which are conclusive for the diagnosis of CTX.

### Coronary heart disease in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis [^111mx4tV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of death in developed countries. Most cases are due to a cluster of classical risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia. However, some patients develop severe and premature arteriosclerosis despite the absence of common risk factors.

Here, we present the clinical, analytical, and molecular features of a 36-year-old man who died from advanced ischemic heart disease as a result of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), a rare condition characterized by the elevation of cholestanol in plasma and most tissues, where neurological impairment is the hallmark of this disease. We discuss the relevance of heart disease and the mechanisms leading to accelerated arteriosclerosis in CTX.

### Xanthoma of rib: A case report and review of the literature [^112Vy8qh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are well-circumscribed benign proliferative lesions seen mainly in soft tissues. They are usually found in conditions such as hyperlipidemia and familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Histologically, xanthomas are characterized by macrophage-like mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and abundant foam cells. Bone involvement is notably rare, with rib localization being extremely uncommon.

- **Case presentation**: A 55-year-old man underwent a chest X-ray and a subsequent chest Computed Tomography scan, which revealed a rib lesion. The lesion was surgically removed, leading to a diagnosis of rib xanthoma. The patient was found to have an unknown condition of hyperlipidemia.

- **Conclusion**: Rib xanthoma can be discovered incidentally and may aid in identifying an unrecognized condition of hyperlipidemia.

### Xanthomatous nevus: A potential new entity [^116vNikV]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are non-neoplastic, localized lipid deposits within the dermis and subcutis. They can present as papules, plaques, or nodules. Different clinical variants include eruptive, tuberous, tendinous, papular, plane, and verruciform xanthomas. They can occur at any age and may be idiopathic or indicate an underlying disorder of lipoprotein metabolism. The association between a xanthoma and congenital melanocytic nevus (CMN) has never been reported. Here, we present the first case and hypothesize on its etiology.

### Numerous intertriginous xanthomas in infant: A diagnostic clue for sitosterolemia [^11346nMi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Sitosterolemia is a very rare autosomal recessive lipoprotein metabolic disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of the two adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter genes, ABCG5 and ABCG8. It is clinically characterized by xanthomas and atherosclerosis, arthritis, fever, hemolysis, and macrothrombocytopenia, even in early childhood. We described a 16-month-old girl who had numerous yellowish-brown intertriginous xanthomas along the skin creases on the extremities with severe hypercholesterolemia and elevated plant sterol levels. Histopathologically, the xanthoma showed an aggregation of foam cells in the dermis with a zone of mucin deposits in the dermal papilla. Electron microscopy revealed numerous membrane-bound lipid droplets and multivesicular lipid bodies in the foam cells, a round cell containing lipid droplets in the basal cell layer, and abundant mucin deposits just beneath the basal lamina. The diagnosis of sitosterolemia was confirmed by DNA sequencing, showing compound heterozygosity for previously reported missense mutations in exon 9 of ABCG5. Infants presenting with multiple xanthomas should be investigated for sitosterolemia if there is no family history of dyslipidemia.

### Hypertriglyceridemia in statin-treated US adults: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [^1143D8iG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). High credibility.

The disease hypertriglyceridemia can be associated with numerous conditions and factors, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and genetic predispositions. It can manifest through symptoms such as xanthomas, increased serum triglycerides, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, and an increased serum osmolal gap. Other associated conditions include corneal arcus, alcohol consumption, pregnancy, memory impairment, xanthelasma palpebrarum, and dementia. Factors like lack of exercise, certain medications, and diabetes mellitus are also linked to hypertriglyceridemia.

### Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma in a 9-year-old boy [^113xawxg]. Pediatric dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Normolipemic plane xanthoma typically occurs in adults. Here, we report an atypical case involving a 9-year-old boy who developed disseminated, flat, yellow-brown plaques measuring up to 2 to 3 cm without any accompanying complaints. Histology revealed the characteristic features of xanthoma, including CD68+ foam cells and Touton giant cells. No systemic involvement or lipid disorders were detected. Regular follow-up is critical for these patients, as normolipemic plane xanthoma often precedes myeloproliferative disorders such as leukemia, paraproteinemia, or lymphoma.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia with tuberous and tendinous xanthomas: case report and mutation analysis [^111PxTHW]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are important clinical manifestations of disordered lipid metabolism, which are mostly found in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), an inherited disorder predominantly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR). Tuberous and tendinous xanthomas with broad distribution and large size are rare; however, they may indicate the severity of FH and tend to be found in homozygous FH. In this study, we investigated the clinical and genetic aspects of a young patient with FH presenting with multiple large masses in various locations. The lesions on the elbows and buttocks were locally excised and subsequently confirmed by biopsy to be xanthomas. Genetic analysis further confirmed that the patient was compound heterozygous for two mutations in both alleles of the LDLR gene. This rare case of compound heterozygous FH presenting with multiple large and widely distributed xanthomas provides a better understanding of FH and xanthomas.

### Two siblings with tuberous xanthomas: case report [^115ANNuz]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Tuberous xanthomas, a variety within the broad category of xanthomas, result from abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism, often familial in nature. These nodular swellings typically arise on the extensor surfaces, such as the elbows and knees. A concerning aspect associated with them is uncontrolled hyperlipidaemia, especially in young individuals. Here, we present two young brothers exhibiting such rare clinical signs alongside other manifestations of hyperlipidaemia. This case highlights that a thorough head-to-toe examination, combined with appropriate investigations, can significantly aid in diagnosis and management.

### Xanthomas heralding pediatric coronary artery disease [^116xwxRY]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Familial hypercholesterolemia is a form of genetic or primary dyslipidemia, affecting 0.2% of the population. Children with familial hypercholesterolemia are prone to early atherosclerosis, which leads to a greater risk of coronary events. The presence of xanthomas should prompt a thorough evaluation for an underlying lipid abnormality because early detection and aggressive treatment are key. We report a case of a pediatric patient with xanthomas misdiagnosed as keloids who presented with premature coronary artery disease.

### Xanthoma of rib: a case report and review of the literature [^115xWoSt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are well-circumscribed benign proliferative lesions seen mainly in soft tissues. They are usually found in hyperlipidemia and familial hyperlipoproteinemia. Histologically, xanthomas are characterized by macrophage-like mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and abundant foam cells. Bone involvement is notoriously rare, and rib localization is extremely rare.

- **Case presentation**: A 55-year-old man underwent a chest X-ray and a subsequent chest computed tomography scan showing a rib lesion. The lesion was surgically removed, and a diagnosis of rib xanthoma was made. The patient presented an unknown condition of hyperlipidemia.

- **Conclusion**: Rib xanthoma can be discovered accidentally and can be helpful in identifying an unrecognized condition of hyperlipidemia.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with primary biliary cholangitis and lipoprotein X [^111X1x9X]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein X is an atypical lipoprotein detected at increased levels in the serum of patients with severe cholestatic disease. The accumulation of lipoprotein X was previously considered to be due to the reflux of biliary lipoproteins into the systemic circulation. However, recent evidence suggests that lipoprotein X is generated in hepatocytes and secreted directly into the blood. Lipoprotein X has a unique composition of apoproteins, including ApoA1, ApoE, and ApoC, which allows it to carry large quantities of phospholipids and free cholesterol in almost equal parts. As a result, lipid profiles in patients with advanced cholestasis show striking elevations in total cholesterol, high triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein levels. The patients are, therefore, susceptible to developing diffuse xanthomas. Indeed, an in vitro study in which lipoprotein X was incubated with human monocyte-derived macrophages demonstrated that lipoprotein X is directly responsible for foam-cell formation.

As was seen in our patient, the clinical presentation of xanthomas is similar to what would be expected in type II and type III hyperlipidemia, with xanthelasma, tendinous xanthomas, xanthomas in the intertriginous areas, and xanthoma striatum palmare. Though limited case reports have described similar patterns of cutaneous xanthomas in patients with lipoprotein X, none have reported a patient with such diffuse and simultaneous involvement of multiple xanthoma subtypes.

Overall, the pathogenesis of lipoprotein X-mediated dyslipidemia and xanthoma formation was clear.

### Tendon xanthomas in familial hypercholesterolemia are associated with cardiovascular risk independently of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutation [^116qHzxB]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2005). Low credibility.

To investigate the significance of tendon xanthomas (TX) in heterozygous subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (hFH), a study was conducted involving 951 men and women with a genetic diagnosis of hFH. Of these, 278 (29.2%) presented TX. The frequency of TX increased with age, from 6.9% in subjects aged 20 to 30 years, to 38.3% at 51 to 60 years old, with a decrease in those older than 60 years.

Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were higher in TX+ individuals compared to TX- individuals (439.0 ± 78.5 mg/dL and 363.1 ± 76.5 mg/dL versus 400.6 ± 73.4 and 323.3 ± 71.0, respectively; P = 0.001). Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower in TX+ than in TX- subjects (50.4 ± 15.0 mg/dL versus 53.1 ± 14.8 mg/dL; P = 0.005). There were no differences between groups in Lp(a), apolipoprotein E genotype, and type of LDL receptor gene mutation.

A total of 102 TX+ subjects reported premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) (36.7%) compared to 93 TX- subjects (13.8%) (P = 0.001). The relative odds for premature CVD were higher in women (4.49 versus 2.26) and increased in hFH subjects younger than 51 years to 3.60 (95% CI, 1.703 to 7.608) in men and to 17.1 (95% CI, 2.697 to 108.920) in women. In a multivariate analysis, age, male sex, LDL cholesterol, and hypertension were significantly positively associated with TX, whereas body mass index was negatively associated with TX.

The findings suggest that TX are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and higher CVD incidence, indicating that their detection necessitates more aggressive lipid-lowering interventions.

### Inflammasome activation aggravates cutaneous xanthomatosis and atherosclerosis in ACAT1 (acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1) deficiency in bone marrow [^115JhFbf]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2018). Low credibility.

ACAT1 (acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 1) esterifies cellular free cholesterol, converting macrophages into cholesteryl ester-laden foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions and cutaneous xanthoma. Paradoxically, the loss of ACAT1 in bone marrow causes the aggravation of atherosclerosis and the development of severe cutaneous xanthoma in hyperlipidemic mice. Recently, it has been reported that cholesterol crystals activate NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR [leucine-rich repeats], and PYD [pyrin domain] domain-containing protein 3) inflammasomes, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis.

The present study aimed to clarify the role of NLRP3 inflammasomes in the worsening of atherosclerosis and cutaneous xanthoma induced by ACAT1 deficiency.

- **Approach and results**: Ldlr-null mice were transplanted with bone marrow from WT (wild type) mice and mice lacking ACAT1, NLRP3, or both. After the four types of mice were fed high-cholesterol diets, we compared their atherosclerosis and skin lesions. The mice transplanted with Acat1-null bone marrow developed severe cutaneous xanthoma. These lesions were filled with numerous macrophages and cholesterol clefts, with markedly increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and increased atherosclerosis. The loss of NLRP3 completely reversed the cutaneous xanthoma, whereas it improved the atherosclerosis only partially. Acat1-null peritoneal macrophages showed enhanced expression of CHOP (C/EBP [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein] homologous protein) and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), but no evidence of inflammasome activation.

### Xanthoma of bone: first sign of hyperlipidemia type IIB: a case report [^114AsKAe]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2003). Low credibility.

A xanthoma was diagnosed in a 56-year-old man, located in the ulna and not accompanied by the traditional cutaneous and tendinous manifestations (xanthoma and xanthelasma). It involved a late onset of alterations in lipid values. The lesion exhibited slow but constant growth, leading to internal calcifications. Hyperlipidemia Type IIB was identified 15 years after the xanthoma was first detected through radiographs. Therefore, in this patient, the xanthoma of bone was the first sign of dyslipidemia.

### Normolipemic plane xanthoma associated with adenocarcinoma and severe itch [^11287UQK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Normolipemic plane xanthomas are yellow-red-colored flat patches or plaques with barely palpable borders, usually involving the eyelids, the lateral sides of the neck, the upper aspect of the trunk, or the flexural folds under normolipemic conditions. Histologically, the lesions are characterized by an infiltrate consisting of foamy macrophages in the papillary and mid-dermis with a distinct perivascular localization. Plane xanthoma has been associated with monoclonal gammopathy, cryoglobulinemia, and myeloproliferative disorders.

We present a patient in whom plane xanthoma developed on the upper aspect of the back, which was accompanied by severe itch in the affected area. These symptoms started one month after resection of an adenocarcinoma of the rectum that was complicated by abdominal abscesses and, currently, by ongoing inflammatory bowel disease. A hypothetical pathophysiologic scheme of events leading to xanthoma formation in this patient is presented.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with lipoprotein X hyperlipidemia [^115N3A2F]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

At a follow-up 6 months after the initial presentation with dermatology, the xanthomas had progressed extensively. They now involved the eyelids, the upper portion of the chest, the upper extremities, including antecubital fossae, and the abdomen, including abdominal striae. The patient exhibited scleral icterus and had pink-brown, subtly yellow papules and nodules on the bilateral upper and lower eyelids, with the largest nodule located on the medial aspect of the right lower eyelid. Similar papules and nodules appeared on the upper portion of the chest, anterior aspect of the shoulders, antecubital fossae, extensor elbow surfaces of the bilateral upper extremities, and the bilateral lower portion of the abdomen.

- **Cutaneous xanthomas**:
	- Observed on the patient's right upper extremity (A), left antecubital fossa (B), abdomen (C), eyelids (D), and chest (E).

At this point, the patient's total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein had increased to 2011 mg/dL and 1938 mg/dL, respectively, despite treatment with the maximal tolerated oral dose of cholesterol-lowering medication (12 g of cholestyramine daily). She then began plasmapheresis every two weeks, which markedly decreased her total cholesterol level to 196 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein level to 178 mg/dL over two months of treatment. Recently, she underwent a liver transplant for her PSC, which resolved her LpX-mediated hyperlipidemia and significantly improved her cutaneous xanthomas.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with lipoprotein X hyperlipidemia [^113ZxE5W]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Cutaneous xanthomas are characterized by benign lipid deposits in the dermis. Clinical variants include eruptive xanthomas, tendinous xanthomas, tuberous xanthomas, plane xanthomas, and verruciform xanthomas. Xanthomas can be idiopathic but typically occur in association with inherited or acquired dyslipidemias. Although cutaneous xanthomas, particularly xanthelasma, are common lesions seen by dermatologists, patients rarely present with diffuse xanthomas.

Lipoprotein X (LpX) is an abnormal structurally distinct lipoprotein indicative of cholestasis and is seen in liver diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). LpX formation is a nonfamilial cause of hyperlipidemia and, while the pathophysiology and epidemiology of LpX-induced hyperlipidemia have not been fully elucidated, therapy relies on treatment of the underlying cholestatic disease. Here, we report a case of diffuse xanthomas presenting in a patient with LpX hyperlipidemia.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia is underdiagnosed and undertreated in the general population: Guidance for clinicians to prevent coronary heart disease: Consensus statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society [^111Y6gye]. European Heart Journal (2013). High credibility.

- **Whom to screen: How do we recognize index cases?** Probands (index cases) should be identified according to the following criteria: plasma total cholesterol ≥ 8 mmol/L (≥ 310 mg/dL) in an adult or adult family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for country), premature CHD in the subject or family member(s), tendon xanthomas in the subject or family member(s), and sudden premature cardiac death in a family member.

For child probands, criteria #(ii)–(iv) are identical to those of adults, but criterion #(i) should be a plasma total cholesterol ≥ 6 mmol/L (≥ 230 mg/dL) in a child or child family member(s) (or > 95th percentile by age and gender for country). The highest likelihood of detecting FH is in those with very high LDL cholesterol levels, tendon xanthomas, and/or premature CHD in a family member.

Drawing a family pedigree is essential to evaluate the likelihood of FH. In cases of probable or definite FH, cascade screening using LDL cholesterol measurement in the family should be conducted, and the subject referred for genetic testing if available, with subsequent cascade testing in the family if a causative mutation is found. Initial family members to be tested are biological first-degree relatives, namely parents, siblings, and children. Biological second-degree relatives, including grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings, should also be considered. 'Premature CHD' signifies CHD before age 55 in males and before age 60 in female first-degree relatives, while in second-degree relatives, the corresponding age criteria apply.

### Eruptive xanthomas: Importance of recognition to reduce delay of effective triglyceride reduction [^117L53Mx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Eruptive xanthomas are localized lipid deposits in the dermis and an important early clue to severe hypertriglyceridemia. These small erythematous or yellow papules that localize to the extensor surfaces of extremities, buttocks, and the back are often overlooked during routine visits due to poor familiarity and limited skin examinations. We present three cases of patients with eruptive xanthomas and severe hypertriglyceridemia who underwent skin biopsies and waited weeks to years before receiving effective treatment.

To minimize the delay between presentation and effective management, we suggest the following approaches:

- **Comprehensive skin examination**: Perform thorough skin examinations to ensure early recognition.
- **Association awareness**: Be mindful of the association between metabolic syndrome or diabetes and severe hypertriglyceridemia.
- **Evaluation of the Four D's of secondary hypertriglyceridemia**: Assess Diet/Lifestyle, Drugs/Medications, and Diseases/Disorders of metabolism.
- **Initiation of effective treatment**: Initiate treatment promptly after recognition. This includes beginning with a minimal fat diet and appropriate pharmacological intervention to control triglycerides as outlined in recent guidelines.

### Papular xanthomas and erosive arthritis in a 3 year old girl, is this a new MRH variant [^112XzPgt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of xanthomas and arthritis is short but includes familial hypercholesterolemia type II and sitosterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia type II is a common, autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the LDL receptor gene that may present with xanthomatous lesions and oligoarthritis. Sitosterolemia is a rare, autosomal recessive lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated plasma plant sterol levels. It is clinically characterized by tuberous skin and tendon xanthomatous lesions, arthritis, and premature vascular disease. Our patient had normal lipid levels and sterol screening, which ruled out these diagnoses.

Other disorders like Von Gierke glycogen storage disease and Farber's disease can present with xanthomas and joint complaints. The lack of systemic involvement and progressive course did not support these diagnoses in our patient. The lack of osteochondrodystrophy, ocular findings, and family history in our patient excluded familial histiocytic dermatoarthritis and dermochondrocorneal dystrophy as possible diagnoses. Xanthoma disseminatum, also part of the non-Langerhans histiocytic disorder spectrum, typically occurs in teenagers and young adults. The skin lesions are described as yellow to brown growths forming plaques and nodules that can present anywhere on the skin but most commonly in flexural areas of the extremities, the eyelids, and mucosae; visceral involvement has been described. Case reports of skeletal involvement presenting with limb pain caused by bone infiltration of xanthomas exist, but no cases of joint involvement have been reported.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis associated with immune thrombocytopenia [^111rycqq]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. CTX is characterized by childhood-onset cataract, adolescent to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurological dysfunction, including dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, and seizures. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar tendon, and the neck tendons.

The biochemical abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration, and decreased chenodeoxycholic acid. Long-term treatment of individuals with CTX using chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) normalizes bile acid synthesis, normalizes plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of cholestanol, and improves neurophysiological findings. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, alone or in combination with CDCA, are also effective in decreasing cholestanol concentration and improving clinical signs; however, they may induce muscle symptoms.

### Nodular excision for painful localized Achilles tendon xanthomas in type II hyperlipoproteinemia: a case report [^112Q4Weq]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Achilles tendon xanthomas are often associated with type II hyperlipoproteinemia, where low-density lipoprotein derived from the circulation accumulates in the tendons. Sometimes coronary artery disease can jeopardize the life of the patient if the condition is neglected. We describe the case of bilateral painful Achilles tendon xanthomas in a heterozygous type II hyperlipoproteinemia family. Her symptoms were not alleviated despite anti-inflammatory medication and eccentric exercise for 6 months. She was treated with nodular excision of the xanthomas bilaterally and then with postoperative statins to avoid recurrence.

### Eruptive xanthoma in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis [^1116nJoZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Undifferentiated dermatologic complaints are often encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's exposures, risk factors, and comorbidities may help guide the evaluation, the accurate diagnosis of dermatologic findings is critical for allowing rapid identification and treatment of disease.

- **Case**: In this vignette, we discuss a case of eruptive xanthoma in a 33-year-old male with diabetic ketoacidosis and pancreatitis.

- **Discussion**: Dermatologic complaints pose a unique challenge to the emergency physician. Many dermatologic findings are benign; however, some may represent underlying serious disease, even in young, otherwise healthy-appearing patients. Eruptive xanthomas are cutaneous lesions often indicating severe hypertriglyceridemia and uncontrolled diabetes. Likely presentations and risk factors for eruptive xanthomas will be discussed, as well as emergency department (ED) evaluation and management.

### Pathogenesis and treatment of xanthomatosis associated with monoclonal gammopathy [^113wFqc1]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are a common manifestation of lipid metabolism disorders. They include hyperlipemic xanthoma, normolipemic xanthoma, and a related condition, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma (NXG). All three forms can be associated with monoclonal immunoglobulin (MIg). In an attempt to improve diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of this association, we retrospectively analyzed a personal series of 24 patients (2 hyperlipemic xanthoma, 11 normolipemic xanthoma, and 11 NXG) and 230 well-documented reports from the literature.

With the exception of the nodules and plaques featured in NXG, the clinical presentation of xanthomatous lesions usually resembled that seen in common hyperlipidemic forms and could not be used to suspect MIg-associated xanthomas. Extracutaneous sites were not rare. The MIg was an IgG in 80% of cases. Myeloma was diagnosed in 35% of cases. Hypocomplementemia with low C4 fraction was present in 80% of studied patients. Low C1 inhibitor serum levels were found in 53%. Cryoglobulinemia was detected in 27%. These abnormalities suggest immune complex formation because of interactions between the MIg and lipoproteins and argue in favor of a causal link between MIg and xanthomas. Monoclonal gammopathy therapy could thus be an option. Indeed, among the patients who received chemotherapy, hematologic remission was accompanied by improvement in xanthoma lesions in several cases.

### Diffuse normolipemic plane xanthoma with underlying photosensitive dermatoses [^111E4Xf2]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Diffuse plane xanthomatosis is a normolipemic non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Clinically, the patient presents as asymptomatic yellowish plaques involving the eyelids, neck, upper trunk, and flexures. Usually, there is an associated hematological or lymphoproliferative malignancy which may precede or follow dermatological manifestations by many years. Rarely, inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic eczema, photosensitive dermatosis, erythroderma, previous scars, and lymphedema have been found to be associated with these xanthomas. We are reporting a 46-year-old male patient with a history of photosensitivity for the last 15 years who subsequently developed diffuse plane normolipemic xanthomas.

### Practical approach to the diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophies: an updated guide in the genomic era [^111rZL3X]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis caused by mutation of the cytochrome P450 gene CYP27A1, resulting in the production of defective sterol 27-hydroxylase. Consequently, CTX is associated with high levels of cholestanol in plasma and its accumulation in tissue. This gives rise to hallmark clinical manifestations of chronic diarrhoea, bilateral cataracts, tendon xanthomas or tendon thickening, and neurological dysfunction.

Typical neurological manifestations can include intellectual disability, autism, behavioural and psychiatric problems, dementia, ataxia, and epilepsy. MRI studies show cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, extensive white matter lesions of the spinal cord, and bilateral T2/FLAIR hyperintensity of the dentate nuclei and surrounding white matter.

Cholestanol concentrations are increased in plasma, brain, xanthomas, and bile. Increased quantities of bile alcohols are useful as a secondary diagnostic test. CSF levels of cholestanol, cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A1, and albumin are increased.

Treatment is with chenodeoxycholic acid (a cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor), which is effective in improving biochemical findings, and in those without advanced disease, may improve or stabilize neurological features.

Autosomal recessive mutations in the MTHFR gene cause a spectrum of symptoms, with onset ranging from childhood to adulthood. Biochemically, there are elevated plasma homocysteine, homocystinuria, and low methionine levels.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with lipoprotein X hyperlipidemia [^113CFGDq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: We report a rare case of diffuse xanthomas presenting in a patient with LpX-mediated hyperlipidemia. LpX as a cause of cutaneous xanthomas has been rarely reported. Both LpX-induced hypercholesteremia and isolated LpX increase lipid accumulation in human monocyte and human monocyte-derived macrophage experiments, respectively. LpX hyperlipidemia, secondary to PSC, was likely the cause of our patient's diffuse xanthomas.

Limited descriptions of cutaneous xanthomas in the setting of LpX exist in the literature. Generally, the xanthomas reported have had similar morphologies to those of our patient but have been distributed less diffusely. Three of the six reported patients with cutaneous xanthomas and LpX hyperlipidemia had primary biliary cholangitis, whereas two had PSC. All six reported cases were women, with ages ranging from 28 to 51 years. In the only other well-documented case of diffuse xanthomas secondary to LpX we have identified, the patient experienced resolution of pruritus and notable improvement of xanthomas five months after liver transplant. Of the three patients treated with plasmapheresis to manage their LpX-related lipid abnormalities, all experienced improvement or complete regression of their xanthomas.

Although cases of xanthomas secondary to LpX hyperlipidemia are rare in general, we identified only one other case reporting such diffuse distribution. Moreover, the present case is highly distinct in the involvement.

### Epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) [^1156fKcC]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis caused by mutations in the cytochrome P450 CYP27A1 gene, resulting in the production of a defective sterol 27-hydroxylase enzyme. CTX is associated with abnormally high levels of cholestanol in the blood and the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in the brain, tendon xanthomas, and bile.

Hallmark clinical manifestations of CTX include chronic diarrhea, bilateral cataracts, tendon xanthomas, and neurologic dysfunction. Although CTX is a rare disorder, it is thought to be underdiagnosed due to nonspecific presenting signs and symptoms, which significantly overlap with other more common conditions. There is marked variability in signs and symptoms, severity, and age of onset between patients.

The disease course is progressive and potentially debilitating or fatal, particularly concerning neurologic presentations such as intellectual disability, autism, behavioral and psychiatric problems, and dementia, among others. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; chenodiol) is the standard of care. CDCA can help restore normal sterol, bile acid, bile alcohol, and cholestanol levels, and it appears to be generally effective in preventing adverse clinical manifestations of the disease from occurring or progressing if administered early enough.

Improved screening and awareness of the condition may help facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.

### The various clinical spectra of juvenile xanthogranuloma: Imaging for two case reports and review of the literature [^115VcQuv]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Cutaneous juvenile xanthogranuloma is a common 'histiocytic' disorder, but a detailed review of the literature reveals only a small number of cases of systemic juvenile xanthogranulomatosis in the neonatal period and less than 15 cases of spinal JXG. Although cutaneous JXG is generally regarded as a self-limited condition, systemic JXG may be associated with significant morbidity and occasional deaths, so aggressive medical care is necessary. To illustrate this point, we report on two affected children, both born within one year in Austria, who were confirmed to have JXG.

The originality of our observation is the clinically atypical and completely different presentation of this rare disease by the multi-lesional and multisystemic nature of its pathology. Moreover, it illustrates the difficulty of classifying this disorder, because the clinical and radiological presentation is nonspecific. Therefore, correlation with histopathology is mandatory and the gold standard for diagnosis of JXG.

- **Clinical spectrum**: In the first patient, we describe cutaneous JXG, which follows a benign course and gradual regression of the lesion without treatment. The diagnosis was established quickly, although the skin lesions were not typical of JXG. The typical presentation is a solitary erythematous or yellowish, well-circumscribed skin papule on the head, neck, or trunk. Our patient presented with blueberry-muffin spots. Excision biopsy of the lesions was performed and established the JXG diagnosis. The absence of the typical yellowish color was due to the.

### Xanthoma of rib: a case report and review of the literature [^117GNGC7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Based on the mode of onset and the contextual state of hyperlipidemia, it is possible to classify bone xanthoma as follows:

- **Xanthomatous variant**: Xanthomatous changes in advanced stages of skeletal benign or malignant pre-existing lesions.
- **Secondary xanthoma**: Forms in the skeletal system of type-2 and type-3 hyperlipidemic patients.
- **Primary xanthoma**: Occurs with normal lipid metabolism.

This classification may be helpful to allow for diagnosis and treatment. Xanthoma of the rib is an exceptional localization and has been previously described in nine other cases, frequently associated with thoracic trauma.

- **Historical cases summary**: Bertoni et al. identified 21 cases of bone xanthoma between 1919 and 1988. Three cases of rib xanthoma were present, associated with soft tissue xanthomas and pain in the rib cage. Lee et al. reported the case of a 64-year-old man without a history of chest trauma and hypercholesterolemia but with chest pain. Three additional cases were reported by McDermott et al. Blanco et al. documented a rib xanthoma secondary to thoracic trauma, where the remodeling fibrous component was more prevalent than the lipid component. Recently, Chon et al. reported a case of a patient with rib xanthoma presenting with chest pain and mucocutaneous lesions without hyperlipidemia. This lesion was subjected to thoracoscopic rib resection due to a strong primary suspicion of osteochondroma.

We have reported a case of rib xanthoma.

### Eruptive xanthomas masquerading as molluscum contagiosum [^115ynsnV]. Pediatrics (2014). High credibility.

Eruptive xanthomas are cutaneous manifestations of hyperlipidemias in which lipids accumulate in large foam cells within the skin. These typically present as crops of 1- to 4-mm yellow-orange papules and are often associated with extreme hypertriglyceridemia. We describe a 12-year-old boy with autism who was mistakenly thought to have widespread molluscum contagiosum for a year before dermatologic consultation was obtained. Recognition of eruptive xanthomas led to the discovery of massive hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglycerides 6853 mg/dL) and diabetes mellitus. Through medical intervention, including insulin and fenofibrate therapy, along with dietary modification and weight loss, the xanthomas cleared during the subsequent months, and his serum triglyceride levels nearly normalized.

### Primary xanthoma of the mandible: A case report [^116BoVBM]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Xanthomas are common cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions that occur due to altered metabolic or endocrinal function. They are found on the skin and around tendon sheaths in individuals with dyslipidemias. In extremely rare cases, they can present as isolated intrabony lesions in otherwise healthy individuals. The isolated intrabony lesions are referred to as primary xanthomas. This report describes a case of an incidentally found primary xanthoma, its management, and follow-up in an otherwise healthy patient.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: A complex interplay between a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition [^116Jq614]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), stemming from its relative rarity and significant clinical heterogeneity. The patient's 25‐year course illustrates the propensity of CTX to mimic other neurodegenerative disorders like HSP and PLS. The absence of classic features at presentation, including cataracts, tendon xanthomas, chronic diarrhoea, and ataxia, often delays diagnosis and commencement of disease‐modifying agents. The initial negative gene panel testing, which did not include CYP27A1, further contributed to diagnostic delay in this case. This emphasizes the importance of comprehensive differential diagnoses and stepwise exclusion of treatable metabolic conditions like CTX with biomarker testing in the absence of targeted gene panels or exome sequencing.

This case also illustrates the challenges in interpreting variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which are common in rare diseases like CTX, where limited genotype–phenotype correlations can lead to ambiguity in predicting pathogenicity. The laboratory classification of the CYP27A1 variant as a VUS, in the absence of further supporting evidence, highlights this complexity. Resolving VUS relies on reconciling clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, and applying standardized variant classification criteria like the ACMG guidelines. The emergence of xanthomatosis proved pivotal in prompting re‐evaluation of the diagnosis and the classification of the CYP27A1 VUS as pathogenic when combined with disease‐specific biochemical findings, including substantially elevated serum and…

### Plane xanthoma [^112Tr9dt]. JAAD case reports (2025). Low credibility.

Yellow plaques on the face and chest are observed. Histopathology reveals pale cells throughout the dermis, as shown in figure A at 40× magnification and figure B at 200× magnification. B also shows a diffuse collection of pale cells and many lipid-laden foamy histiocytes. (H&E, hematoxylin and eosin).

- **Question**: What is the most likely etiology for this patient's plane xanthomas?
	- A. AIH and PBC overlap syndrome
	- B. Familial hypercholesteremia
	- C. Familial hypertriglyceridemia
	- D. Multiple myeloma
	- E. Systemic lupus erythematosus

- **Answer discussion**: The correct answer is (A) AIH and PBC overlap syndrome. The formation of xanthomas due to secondary hyperlipidemia in conditions such as PBC has been extensively described, with xanthomas reported to occur in almost 6% of patients with PBC. Plane xanthomas associated with PBC often begin on the hands and feet and can become generalized. It is hypothesized that the formation of plane xanthomas of cholestasis is due to the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol, specifically lipoprotein X, leading to significant dyslipidemia and skin findings.

	- Resolution of plane xanthomas typically requires treatment of the underlying cholestasis. Medical management of dyslipidemia is first-line but rarely resolves xanthomas; thus, liver transplantation may be necessary for restoring biliary drainage, lipid-level stability, and subsequent xanthoma improvement. In addition to surgical excision, cosmetic therapies such as chemical peels or lasers are temporizing measures. They do not address the underlying cholestasis, and the lesions may recur.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: A report of 3 cases [^111DAwHF]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disease affecting bile acid synthesis. Mutations in the CYP27A1 gene result in a faulty sterol 27-hydroxylase, leading to disturbances in lipid metabolism, with the accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in the form of xanthomas throughout the central nervous system, eyes, and tendons. The incidence is as high as 5 per 100,000 individuals of European ancestry, with approximately 300 reported cases worldwide. While individuals often develop signs and symptoms early in life, most are diagnosed during the fourth decade when their disease has progressed to an advanced state. We report 3 cases of CTX with similar clinical symptoms to emphasize the importance of early detection.

### Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: heterogeneity of clinical phenotype with evidence of previously undescribed ophthalmological findings [^115sgHLh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disease involving lipid metabolism. The classical phenotype is characterized by neurological dysfunction, tendon xanthomas, and juvenile cataracts. Other ophthalmological findings have occasionally been reported. To gain more insight into the type and frequency of ophthalmological alterations in this multisystem metabolic disorder, we examined 13 CTX patients. Besides cataracts, found in all cases, the second most frequent ocular abnormality was paleness of the optic disk, which was found in six patients and was probably previously underestimated. Signs of premature retinal senescence were also observed. We discuss the possible relation between these ocular manifestations and the metabolic defect.

This phenomenon has not been previously reported in HIV-infected children. The case illustrates the difficulty in managing an emerging complication: extreme hyperlipidemia in children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. This is due to limited pediatric experience with lipid-lowering agents and the likely need for lifelong treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [^117REBWk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

FH is clinically diagnosed based on a weighted combination of physical findings, personal or family history of hypercholesterolemia, early-onset ASCVD, and the concentration of circulating LDL-C. Extensor tendon xanthomas, typically found in Achilles, subpatellar, and hand extensor tendons, with extremely elevated LDL-C levels are considered specific for FH. Severe extensor tendon xanthomas have histological features resembling foam cell formation and lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. Hence, there is a modest correlation between the extent of tendon xanthomas and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis. However, as previously noted in children and young adults, a family history of CAD and elevated LDL-C levels are often the only findings. The fasting LDL-C concentration is incorporated in all diagnostic criteria and has been the backbone of FH diagnosis; however, nonfasting lipid testing may be used for initial screening. Blood sampling for the diagnosis of FH should preferably be avoided during acute illnesses, or while taking medications known to increase LDL-C, such as cyclosporine, amiodarone, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorthalidone. Chronic illnesses that elevate LDL-C, such as hypothyroidism and liver or renal impairment, should be ruled out.

Although the diagnosis of FH can be made on the basis of clinical features, genetic testing may offer additional insight regarding cardiac risk and diagnosis. Recent data from 7 case-control studies…

### Case report — papular xanthoma in a 10-year-old female with abnormal lipid profile [^116c5kw2]. Pediatric Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Papular xanthoma is a rare normolipemic xanthomatous skin disease that primarily occurs in adults. While this rare disorder has been documented in children, all but one reported in the literature had a normal lipid profile. We report a 10-year-old girl with multiple papule xanthomas on her face, which was associated with an abnormal lipid profile. To our knowledge, this is only the second reported case of papular xanthoma in the pediatric population with an abnormal lipid profile.

### Diffuse xanthomas in a patient with primary biliary cholangitis and lipoprotein X [^111Y9MZP]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

The management of xanthomas in patients with lipoprotein X rests on addressing the underlying cause of cholestasis. Lipid-lowering agents can be used, but often with limited success. Therapeutic plasma exchange is the treatment of choice in patients who develop complications of hyperviscosity syndrome but leads only to partial xanthoma regression. For xanthelasma, destructive methods, such as 70% trichloroacetic acid chemical peels and carbon dioxide laser therapy, have been described, though the effects are temporary as long as dyslipidemia persists. As in our patient, a liver transplant is often the only means to restore biliary drainage and lipid homeostasis and thereby improve the xanthomas.

In summary, we present a rare case of cutaneous xanthomas arising secondary to lipoprotein X in a patient with PBC. Our case demonstrates the diverse morphologies of xanthomas that can be observed in patients with lipoprotein X and brings attention to an underappreciated pathway, which should be considered in our approach to treating cutaneous xanthomas. Indeed, in our patient, the presence of the xanthomas was what first prompted diagnostic testing and led to her diagnosis of PBC. The consideration of this pathophysiology adds to our knowledge of the assessment of the cutaneous manifestations of this systemic disease.

### Tuberous xanthomas in sitosterolemia [^112jSsdU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Sitosterolemia is an autosomal recessive lipid disorder in which plasma plant sterol levels are extremely elevated, and cholesterol levels are often elevated but may be normal. Clinically, sitosterolemia is characterized by xanthomas, premature vascular disease, and arthritis. Adolescent boys and girls with sitosterolemia are susceptible to fatal cardiac events. Dermatologists may have a vital role in diagnosing this rare but serious condition because early detection and treatment are important in preventing the associated atherosclerotic heart disease. We present a 7-year-old girl with sitosterolemia and tuberous xanthomas.

### The risk of tendon xanthomas in familial hypercholesterolaemia is influenced by variation in genes of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway and the low-density lipoprotein oxidation pathway [^113GdY1e]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The presence of tendon xanthomas is a marker of high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Therefore, xanthomas and atherosclerosis may result from the same pathophysiological mechanisms. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation are pathophysiological pathways of atherosclerosis, and it is well established that genetic variation in these pathways influences CVD risk. We therefore determined whether genetic variation in these pathways is also associated with the occurrence of tendon xanthomas in FH patients.

- **Methods and results**: Four genetic variants in each pathway were genotyped in 1,208 FH patients. We constructed a gene-load score for both pathways. The odds of xanthomas increased with the number of risk alleles in the RCT pathway (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.08–1.36, P(trend) = 0.0014). Similarly, higher numbers of risk alleles in the LDL oxidation pathway were associated with the presence of xanthomas (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.41, P(trend) = 0.0015).

- **Conclusion**: The presence of tendon xanthomas in FH patients is associated with genetic variation in the RCT and LDL oxidation pathways. These results support the hypothesis that xanthomas and atherosclerosis share pathophysiological mechanisms.
