## Question

My patient's right pupil is now larger than the left pupil. She is asymptomatic. What do I do?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do about a patient with new-onset anisocoria where the right pupil is larger than the left, and the patient is asymptomatic. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is physiologic anisocoria versus pathologic. Then, I should verify the key history elements that separate benign from dangerous causes. Next, I will examine the pupils systematically in different lighting and test reactivity. After that, I need to check for associated neuro-ophthalmic signs that would change urgency. Finally, I will outline when to order imaging, when to use pharmacologic testing, and when reassurance and follow-up are appropriate, with clear thresholds and timelines anchored to guidelines and studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of the magnitude of anisocoria. A difference less than 1 mm is commonly physiologic and often benign, whereas a difference greater than 1 mm raises concern for pathologic causes such as Horner syndrome, Adie tonic pupil, or third nerve palsy, especially if new or accompanied by other signs, so I should measure the exact difference and document it carefully in both bright and dim light [^9c8977e5] [^3a1efd31].

> Wait, let me verify the lighting effect because physiologic anisocoria tends to vary with illumination. Studies using standardized lighting show that many healthy individuals exhibit small anisocoria in some lighting conditions, but consistent anisocoria across photopic and scotopic settings is less likely to be physiologic, so I should reassess in dim and bright light to see if the asymmetry persists or fluctuates before labeling it pathologic [^48936e31] [^1f5b2789].

> I need to check the history next, and I should not jump to conclusions before I ask about trauma, recent eye surgery, contact lens wear, and especially pharmacologic exposures. Anticholinergic exposures such as scopolamine patches, ipratropium nebulization, or even plant toxins can cause unilateral mydriasis, and patients may not recall exposure unless prompted, so I should probe carefully and consider a pharmacologic cause if the story fits, which would avoid unnecessary neuroimaging [^23f156dd] [^f1f45de0] [^0e4a82b2].

> Hold on, I should verify the examination sequence. I will now examine pupil shape, size in bright and dim light, direct and consensual light reactions, the swinging flashlight test for a relative afferent pupillary defect, and the near response, while also checking for ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or other cranial nerve signs. A fixed, dilated pupil with poor reactivity is concerning for pharmacologic blockade or compressive third nerve palsy, whereas a pupil that reacts poorly to light but constricts to near with slow redilation suggests a tonic pupil, and miosis with ptosis suggests Horner syndrome [^3a1efd31] [^a43c0128] [^4e387aa6].

> Let me consider the differential and how each would present. Physiologic anisocoria is typically less than 1 mm, symmetric in shape, and reactive. Pharmacologic mydriasis produces a fixed, dilated pupil with preserved extraocular movements. Horner syndrome shows miosis with ptosis and sometimes anhidrosis. Adie tonic pupil shows light-near dissociation with segmental palsy and slow redilation. Third nerve palsy presents with ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, and if the pupil is involved, compressive etiologies like posterior communicating artery aneurysm must be excluded urgently [^9c8977e5] [^c4eb3789] [^a43c0128] [^4e387aa6].

> I should double-check the urgency thresholds. If the anisocoria is greater than 1 mm, new, or accompanied by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, pain, headache, or other neurologic signs, I need to escalate to urgent neuroimaging because compressive third nerve palsy from aneurysm or mass effect must be excluded. CTA or MRA of the head and neck is appropriate, and if noninvasive studies are negative but suspicion remains high, catheter angiography may be needed [^a1803168] [^6c03f058].

> But wait, what if the pupil is fixed and dilated and I suspect pharmacologic blockade. In that case, I should confirm with a 1% pilocarpine test. Failure to constrict supports anticholinergic blockade, whereas constriction supports neurogenic causes like third nerve palsy or Adie pupil, and this can prevent unnecessary imaging when the history and exam align with pharmacologic mydriasis [^c4eb3789] [^f1f45de0].

> If Horner syndrome is suspected, I need to ensure I do not miss a dangerous cause. I should confirm with apraclonidine 0.5% to 1% when feasible, recognizing that denervation supersensitivity can emerge within 48 to 72 hours in some cases, and if Horner syndrome is confirmed, I should image the brain, neck, and chest to localize the lesion and exclude carotid dissection, apex lung tumor, or other serious pathology, tailoring imaging to the clinical context and onset [^5fe78cc0] [^6b0638de].

> Let me reconsider the scenario of a purely asymptomatic, isolated anisocoria less than 1 mm with normal reactivity and no other signs. In that case, physiologic anisocoria is most likely, and I should reassure the patient, document measurements in different lighting, and arrange routine follow-up rather than immediate imaging, while educating the patient to return urgently if new symptoms develop such as ptosis, diplopia, headache, or vision changes [^9c8977e5] [^3a1efd31].

> I should confirm that I have addressed red flags that would change management today. Sudden onset, pain, headache, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, diplopia, or anisocoria greater than 1 mm with abnormal reactivity warrant urgent evaluation and imaging, whereas small, stable, reactive asymmetry without other signs supports observation and outpatient follow-up, and I need to ensure the patient understands these warning features and has a clear return plan [^a1803168] [^3a1efd31].

For a patient with new-onset anisocoria and the right pupil larger than the left, but no other symptoms, the priority is to **exclude serious causes** and confirm benign etiologies. Start with a focused history and exam to check for trauma, medications, or neurologic signs [^a7f94337]. If the pupil is reactive and there are no other deficits, **physiologic anisocoria is likely** and no immediate workup is needed; reassure and arrange routine follow-up [^48936e31]. If the pupil is fixed or there are other signs, **order urgent neuroimaging** (MRI/MRA or CTA) to exclude third nerve palsy or aneurysm [^a1803168]. Only pursue pharmacologic testing (e.g. apraclonidine for Horner's, dilute pilocarpine for Adie's) if the diagnosis remains unclear after the initial evaluation [^5fe78cc0] [^a43c0128].

---

## Step 1: focused history

Ask about:

- **Onset and duration**: sudden vs gradual; recent trauma or surgery [^a7f94337].
- **Medications**: anticholinergics, decongestants, antidepressants, or accidental exposure (e.g. scopolamine patch, ipratropium) [^23f156dd] [^f1f45de0].
- **Systemic symptoms**: headache, diplopia, ptosis, weakness, vision loss, or pain [^e424fde0].
- **Ocular history**: contact lenses, eye drops, or prior eye surgery [^8059a49c].

---

## Step 2: targeted ophthalmic and neurologic examination

Assess the following:

| **Attribute** | **Findings and implications** |
|-|-|
| Pupil size and shape | - Measure in bright and dim light <br/> - Physiologic anisocoria is typically ≤ 1 mm, round, and reactive [^9c8977e5] [^48936e31] |
| Pupil reactivity | - Direct and consensual responses <br/> - Fixed, dilated pupil suggests pharmacologic blockade or third nerve palsy [^c4eb3789] [^4e387aa6] |
| Extraocular movements | - Diplopia or ophthalmoplegia suggests third nerve palsy [^4e387aa6] |
| Ptosis | - Suggests Horner's syndrome or third nerve palsy [^e424fde0] |
| Visual acuity and fields | - Deficits suggest optic pathway or compressive lesions [^a0dc7dae] |
| Slit-lamp exam | - Look for iris trauma, inflammation, or adhesions [^notfound] |

---

## Step 3: differentiate benign from pathologic anisocoria

Benign causes include **physiologic anisocoria** (≤ 1 mm, reactive, no other signs) [^48936e31], **pharmacologic mydriasis** (fixed, dilated, history of exposure) [^c4eb3789], and **Adie's tonic pupil** (dilated, reacts poorly to light, constricts to near, with slow redilation) [^a43c0128]. Pathologic causes include **third nerve palsy** (dilated, fixed pupil with ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, often from aneurysm or compression) [^4e387aa6], **Horner's syndrome** (miosis with ptosis and anhidrosis) [^6b0638de], and **traumatic iris injury** (history of trauma, irregular pupil) [^3a1efd31].

---

## Step 4: management based on findings

### Benign anisocoria

If physiologic or pharmacologic, **reassure and observe**; no immediate workup is needed. Arrange routine follow-up and advise the patient to return for new symptoms (ptosis, diplopia, headache, vision changes) [^notfound].

---

### Suspected pathologic anisocoria

- **Third nerve palsy (pupil-involved)**: urgent MRI/MRA or CTA to exclude aneurysm or compressive lesion; neurosurgical/ophthalmology consult [^a1803168].
- **Horner's syndrome**: apraclonidine testing; if positive, image the brain, neck, and chest (CTA/MRA or MRI) to localize the lesion [^5fe78cc0] [^6b0638de].
- **Adie's pupil**: confirm with dilute pilocarpine (0.1–0.125%); if constricts, diagnosis is confirmed; routine follow-up is appropriate [^a43c0128].

---

## Step 5: patient education and follow-up

Explain the likely diagnosis, red flags, and when to seek urgent care. Schedule follow-up to **confirm stability** and reassess if symptoms evolve [^f1b14811].

---

## Summary algorithm

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Focused history (onset, trauma, meds, systemic symptoms) |
| 2 | Targeted exam (pupils, motility, ptosis, acuity, slit-lamp) |
| 3 | Classify as benign vs pathologic |
| 4 | Benign: reassure, observe, routine follow-up |
| 5 | Pathologic: urgent imaging and specialty referral |

---

New-onset anisocoria without other symptoms is often benign, but a **structured history and exam** are essential to exclude serious disease. Reserve urgent imaging for fixed pupils, neurologic deficits, or Horner's features; otherwise, observe and reassure.

### Approach to anisocoria in the emergency department [^a7f94337]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Anisocoria describes asymmetric pupillary diameter, which can result from traumatic, pharmacologic, inflammatory, or ischemic effects on the eye. In many cases, anisocoria represents a normal physiologic variant. Morbidity associated with anisocoria is directly related to the inciting cause and can vary from benign to life-threatening. A thorough understanding by emergency physicians of normal ocular neuroanatomy, and of common causes of pathologic anisocoria, including medication-induced anisocoria, can facilitate appropriate resource utilization and timely subspecialty consultation, and can help prevent irreversible ocular injury and patient morbidity. We describe a patient who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of blurry vision with anisocoria.

Outcome and follow-up

The patient's vision has now improved to 6/19 in the left eye. The left eye pressure was 17 mmHg after cataract surgery. Unfortunately, pupil size did not change after reduction of IOP. The left eye IOP has continued to be within normal limits on Cosopt and Lumigan. Visual acuity has improved to 6/9.5. There is a possibility that the patient had shallow angles prehospitalisation and therefore had a predisposition to angle closure glaucoma. Unfortunately, the patient has no previous ophthalmic record to confirm this.

### Virtual consultation for red eye [^d743d995]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Fig 4
A patient with a new onset of a right painful red eye with diplopia. Proptosis, restricted eye movement and anisocoria (right pupil is larger than the left pupil) was detected on a live video consultation (video 1). Visual acuity was checked by a family member using an app. An inter-eye acuity difference supported a diagnosis of right optic neuropathy. The patient was urgently referred for further management.

Eyeball palpation — If there is no history of trauma to the eye, ask the patient to palpate the affected eyeball. Tenderness may suggest scleritis or acute angle-closure glaucoma. "Eyeball hardness" could be a sign of raised intraocular pressure, which warrants an urgent assessment by an ophthalmologist. However, this sign is very subjective and needs to be interpreted with caution.

Visual symptoms, including acute monocular visual loss, papilledema, visual field deficits, anisocoria, limitations of eye movements, and nystagmus, can be the presenting feature of a wide range of important neurologic diseases. It is important for primary care clinicians to be to be able to direct appropriate initial diagnostic assessment, treatment, and referral for further evaluation of these conditions.

### Unilateral mydriasis without ophthalmoplegia – a sign of neurovascular compression? Case report [^b0e3b5be]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to demonstrate the use of neuroimaging studies in vascular compression of the oculomotor nerve.

Clinical Presentation

A 24-year-old woman was noted by her dentist to have anisocoria, with the left pupil being larger than the right. After detailed ophthalmologic and neurological examination, we proceeded to perform neuroimaging. T2-weighted images (2 mm) and constructive interference in steady-state (0.3 mm) images were utilized.

Intervention

Magnetic resonance imaging showed that duplicated left superior cerebellar artery, a prominent posterior communicating artery, and a posterior cerebral artery combined to compress the superomedial portion of the left oculomotor nerve.

Conclusion

With continued improvements in neuroimaging, we think that more cases of isolated cranial neuropathies previously labeled as "idiopathic" will be shown to result from vascular compression.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^23f156dd]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A unilaterally fixed mydriasis, also known as a 'blown pupil', is considered an ominous sign concerning for intracranial pathology. Causes of anisocoria can range from benign to immediately life-threatening. When a patient presents with anisocoria, the concern for a fatal diagnosis leads the clinician to obtain numerous tests, many of which may be unnecessary. The authors present a case of a healthy woman in her 30s who presented with an acute unilateral mydriasis likely secondary to inadvertent contact with a scopolamine patch. On examination, she had no other neurological deficits. Further investigation did not reveal any abnormality. In the event of a patient with an isolated mydriasis in an otherwise healthy and conversant patient with no other neurological deficits, it is essential to rule out other causes before pursuing aggressive and unnecessary testing and treatment.

Pupil examination — "Both pupils should be equal, round, and equally reactive when light is directed toward either eye". "Asymmetric responses to light may indicate visual system dysfunction". Anisocoria thresholds are specified: "Asymmetry of pupil shape or difference in diameter greater than 1 mm can often be attributable to an ocular injury or disease or to a neurologic disorder", whereas "Differences in pupil size less than 1 mm can occur normally and are generally benign unless associated with ptosis or an ocular motility deficit".

Differential diagnosis

Evaluation of a unilateral mydriasis can be a diagnostic challenge and is considered a neurological emergency. Differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accident, oculomotor nerve palsy, Adie tonic pupil, previous trauma/eye surgery, cerebral aneurysm, multiple sclerosis, topical/systemic drug-induced mydriasis or exposure to plant toxins. Through the patient's history, physical examination and thorough investigation, these diagnoses were excluded as they would present with other neurological symptoms.

### Anisocoria after direct light stimulus is associated with poor outcomes following acute brain injury [^c4dbef36]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Assessing pupil size and reactivity is the standard of care in neurocritically ill patients. Anisocoria observed in critically ill patients often prompts further investigation and treatment. This study explores anisocoria at rest and after light stimulus determined using quantitative pupillometry as a predictor of discharge modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores.

Methods

This analysis includes data from an international registry and includes patients with paired (left and right eye) quantitative pupillometry readings linked to discharge mRS scores. Anisocoria was defined as the absolute difference in pupil size using three common cut points (> 0.5 mm, > 1 mm, and > 2 mm). Nonparametric models were constructed to explore patient outcome using three predictors: the presence of anisocoria at rest (in ambient light); the presence of anisocoria after light stimulus; and persistent anisocoria (present both at rest and after light). The primary outcome was discharge mRS score associated with the presence of anisocoria at rest versus after light stimulus using the three commonly defined cut points.

Results

This analysis included 152,905 paired observations from 6,654 patients with a mean age of 57.0 (standard deviation 17.9) years, and a median hospital stay of 5 (interquartile range 3–12) days. The mean admission Glasgow Coma Scale score was 12.7 (standard deviation 3.5), and the median discharge mRS score was 2 (interquartile range 0–4). The ranges for absolute differences in pupil diameters were 0–5.76 mm at rest and 0–6.84 mm after light. Using an anisocoria cut point of > 0.5 mm, patients with anisocoria after light had worse median mRS scores (2 [interquartile range 0–4]) than patients with anisocoria at rest (1 [interquartile range 0–3]; P < .0001). Patients with persistent anisocoria had worse median mRS scores (3 [interquartile range 1–4]) than those without persistent anisocoria (1 [interquartile range 0–3]; P < .0001). Similar findings were observed using a cut point for anisocoria of > 1 mm and > 2 mm.

Conclusions

Anisocoria after light is a new biomarker that portends worse outcome than anisocoria at rest. After further validation, anisocoria after light should be considered for inclusion as a reported and trended assessment value.

### Clinical reasoning: acute monocular vision loss in a patient with ipsilateral extracranial chronic internal carotid artery occlusion [^805442d3]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a middle-aged man who presented with acute painless monocular vision loss. His medical history was remarkable for chronic total occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) and a recent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on the contralateral ICA. In a stepwise multidisciplinary approach assessment, we review the differential diagnosis of acute vision loss and investigate how the patient's intracranial and extracranial hemodynamic reorganization after chronic ICA occlusion may affect the clinical reasoning. Early complications of CEA and the differential diagnosis of new-onset anisocoria are also discussed.

### Not your everyday anisocoria: angel's trumpet ocular toxicity [^0e4a82b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old boy was brought to the emergency department by his parents with new-onset anisocoria. He complained of blurry vision and of his left pupil being larger than the right. His visual acuity was normal and examination revealed a painless left mydriasis. A thorough history and targeted examination yielded the diagnosis of pharmacologic mydriasis caused by ocular exposure to Angel's Trumpet (Datura suaveolens), a plant containing toxic alkaloids with anti-cholinergic properties. The patient and his family were spared expensive and time-consuming tests (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) or further referral. His symptoms resolved spontaneously in 3 days.

### Neuro-ophthalmology in emergency medicine [^e424fde0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the eye, the orbit, and the central connections is key to understanding neuro-ophthalmologic emergencies. Anisocoria is an important sign that requires a systematic approach to avoid misdiagnosis of serious conditions, including carotid dissection (miosis) and aneurysmal third nerve palsy (mydriasis). Ptosis may be a sign of either Horner syndrome or third nerve palsy. An explanation should be pursued for diplopia since the differential diagnosis ranges from the trivial to life-threatening causes.

### Anisocoria in an intubated patient with COVID-19 [^1b27eee3]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a 2-week history of cough, fever and progressive shortness of breath. He had a background of hypothyroidism, hypertension and benign prostate hypertrophy. His initial imaging and swab test confirmed COVID-19. The patient was placed on a trial of continuous positive airway pressure to support his deteriorating oxygen saturation. However, after a week of supportive therapy, he was transferred to the ICU and was supported with mechanical ventilation and proning. The proning protocol used involves patients being proned for up to 18 hours a day (figure 1).

Figure 1
Proning protocol used in the intensive care unit.

While in ICU, the patient's recovery was impacted by a Klebsiella -positive pneumonia, and a subsequent CT scan showed multiple pulmonary emboli. This was treated with low molecular weight heparin. During the second week in ICU, the patient's critical care team identified anisocoria. They reported a left relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) with no new neurology or squint on gross assessment. There was no significant ocular history prior to this, and the patient's ICU team booked a CT scan of the head and accompanying venogram, which did not highlight any notable pathology and ruled out venous sinus thrombosis.

An ophthalmology review was requested: on bedside examination the patient appeared orthophoric and a ptosis assessment was difficult to assess as the patient was in a sedated state. Pupillary inspection revealed a notable anisocoria; the left pupil was measured at 6 mm and was fixed with no change in light or dark/dim lighting (figure 2). The right pupil was 3 mm in light and 4 mm in dark assessment. Assessment of the left pupillary reflex identified no direct or consensual response and an RAPD. The right pupillary reflex identified a normal direct response, no consensual response and no RAPD. A full ophthalmological examination revealed a normal anterior segment without any signs of inflammation. There was an early cataract in both eyes. There was no inflammation in the vitreous, with normal optic nerve heads, retina and macula. Digital palpation was normal. iCare intraocular pressure (IOP) readings for the right eye were 18 mmHg and in the left eye 22 mmHg, although this was difficult to record accurately due to patient positioning. As IOP readings were relatively normal, we did not think IOP could be a cause of the anisocoria.

### A well-appearing infant with a sudden anisocoria [^fbd12378]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentationA 10-month-old boy was admitted to the emergency department due to a sudden onset of left unilateral mydriasis (figure 1). His medical history was unremarkable. A minor head trauma 2days before was reported, without alarming signs or symptoms. His mother was putting him to sleep, after coming back from work, when she noticed a different pupil size and promptly went to the ED with her husband. The parents denied any use of medications, including nebulised therapy or direct contact with plants. The child was well appearing and his vital signs were within the standard age limits. His extraocular motility was normal as well as the rest of his neurological and physical examination. Parents' behaviour was somehow remarkable. Even though the child was not suffering, the mother seemed very worried while the father was nervous and aggressive, repeatedly asking for a discharge.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^e07a2bbb]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In the era of modern medicine, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), has made ground-breaking advances in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. In the suspicion of stroke, time is of the essence for tPA administration, because it is most effective within 3–4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms. However, administration of tPA to ineligible patients can lead to catastrophic consequences, such as increased risk of haemorrhage. Due to the time constraints, healthcare providers may have stroke high on the differential, making it easier to overlook other diagnoses that can mimic a stroke. Therefore, it is essential to form a differential that contains all possible etiologies that may contribute to a presentation that mimics a stroke.

The scopolamine patch, a commonly used medication in the hospital, has been noted to cause mydriasis in patients and healthcare workers. Accidental ocular contamination secondary to scopolamine has been documented in various case reports. This patient's symptoms at first appeared worrisome for a stroke which ultimately led to numerous tests and imaging. However, by the end of her hospital stay, it was a detailed history that guided the management of the patient, which ultimately saved the patient from potentially harmful therapy (i.e. tPA).

### Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with aberrant eyelid movements and pupillary spasms: a case report [^f582fb78]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We report a case of congenital oculomotor nerve palsy presenting with aberrant eyelid movements and an involuntary pupillary reaction.

Case Presentation

A 24-year-old woman presented with mild anisocoria with no significant medical history. Her ocular history included a history of strabismus and levator muscle surgery. Examination revealed exotropia, hypotropia, and ocular motility impairment, consistent with right oculomotor nerve palsy. Pupillary examination revealed mild anisocoria with the right pupil being unreactive to dim light, followed by involuntary pupillary spasms unassociated with eye position. Twitch-like movements of the upper eyelid were also observed during the spasm phase. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of the extraocular muscles, particularly the medial rectus. No intracranial lesions were found and blood tests excluded conditions such as thyroid eye disease. Based on these findings, congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with aberrant regeneration was diagnosed. The patient remained asymptomatic and was managed conservatively. Six months later, no complications due to pupillary spasms or restriction of ocular motility were observed.

Conclusions

This case highlights an unusual pupillary response in congenital oculomotor nerve palsy characterized by involuntary pupillary spasms accompanied by upper eyelid twitching, which has not been previously reported. The prognosis was likely favorable for asymptomatic patients without associated underlying causes.

### Neurologist versus machine: is the pupillometer better than the naked eye in detecting pupillary reactivity [^4493c849]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A 62-year-old man with severe traumatic brain injury developed postsurgical anisocoria in which there was a discrepancy between pupillometer and manual testing.

Methods

Case report.

Results

The patient's larger pupil was read as unreactive by the pupillometer but constricted 1 mm over 7–9 s of continuous light stimulation.

Conclusions

While pupillometry assessment is a valuable adjunct to the manual pupillary assessment, this case demonstrates that nonreactive pupils read on the pupillometer should be confirmed with the manual examination because it can miss very slowly reacting pupils.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^9bb1ec32]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Examination — 3rd nerve palsy assessment specifies that a comprehensive eye examination should be performed paying particular attention to the sensorimotor examination, evidence of ptosis and anisocoria, and pupillary responses in bright and dim illumination. It should also include a fundus examination to evaluate for the presence of papilledema or optic atrophy. Evaluation of the 3rd nerve palsy depends on the presumed location of the lesion and is based on other accompanying neurologic findings, and isolated 3rd nerve palsy, however, is what most clinicians encounter. The important characteristics are whether the pupil is involved and the extent of the motility disorder and ptosis; a classic pupil-sparing 3rd nerve palsy has normal pupillary function, complete ptosis, and complete (related) motility dysfunction, and in this situation, the etiology is almost always secondary to microvascular.

### Anisocoria in an intubated patient with COVID-19 [^e2faaad7]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

As COVID-19 is known to be prothrombotic, our first differential diagnosis was a cavernous sinus thrombosis. This was disproved after CT venogram. Both the ophthalmology team and the neurology team then thought that a thrombotic or ischaemic event could have happened specifically in the midbrain (as this is where the pupil reflex nuclei are found). Microhaemorrhages on the MRI of the head did provide evidence towards this diagnosis, although the absence of disc swelling made a diagnosis of ischaemic optic neuropathy more difficult.

However, after the patient was stepped down from ICU, IOP measurements were high and the angle was partially closed in the left eye. Therefore, our final diagnosis was subacute closed angle glaucoma.

After reviewing the patient's medication in ICU, none was known to cause an increase in IOP or acute angle closure glaucoma.

An Adie's tonic pupil is also an important differential for anisocoria. An Adie's pupil occurs due to parasympathetic denervation of the ciliary ganglion. There are reports of Adie's pupils occurring in patients with COVID-19. It is therefore important to test anisocoria with diluted pilocarpine and examine if there is light-near dissociation to exclude an acute Adie's pupil.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^48936e31]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anisocoria is defined as an inequality in pupil size, and its presence in the absence of ocular and neurologic pathology is known as physiologic anisocoria. Generally, a small difference in pupil diameter in both dim and bright illumination, with normal light response, no dilation lag, and no ptosis, does not warrant concern. The characteristics of normal physiologic anisocoria have been studied previously in attempts to assist eye care professionals in separating benign from pathologic findings.–Historically, pupil gauges and flashlights were used to measure the pupil, but these devices were limited to static estimations of pupil size in shifting light conditions. Over the years, new devices have been developed to help offset these limitations, significantly improving the repeatability of pupil measurement and diagnostic accuracy in the clinic. There is, however, a lack of consensus on the threshold of anisocoria that is considered clinically significant. There is also no consensus on whether anisocoria that disappears under varied lighting conditions is considered physiologic or random pupillary noise. Meyer used a "perceptible" difference in pupil size as a threshold for anisocoria and was among the first to record the prevalence of physiologic anisocoria in a healthy population. Loewenfeld later used a criterion of > 0.4 mm difference in pupil diameter as a threshold for physiologic anisocoria in a healthy population and found the prevalence to be about 20%. Lam was among the first to record the prevalence of physiologic anisocora under varying lighting conditions. He noted that 41% of his subjects exhibited anisocoria > 0.4 mm in at least 1 light setting, while only 3% exhibited anisocoria in every setting.

### Anisocoria and poor pupil reactivity by quantitative pupillometry in patients with intracranial pathology [^dc608e6d]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the prevalence and associated risk factors of new onset anisocoria (new pupil size difference of at least 1mm) and its subtypes: new onset anisocoria accompanied by abnormal and normal pupil reactivities in patients with acute neurologic injuries.

Design

We tested the association of patients who experienced new onset anisocoria subtypes with degree of midline shift using linear regression. We further explored differences between quantitative pupil characteristics associated with first-time new onset anisocoria and nonnew onset anisocoria at preceding observations using mixed effects logistic regression, adjusting for possible confounders.

Setting

All quantitative pupil observations were collected at two neuro-ICUs by nursing staff as standard of care.

Patients

We conducted a retrospective two-center study of adult patients with intracranial pathology in the ICU with at least a 24-hour stay and three or more quantitative pupil measurements between 2016 and 2018.

Measurements and Main Results

We studied 221 patients (mean age 58, 41% women). Sixty-three percent experienced new onset anisocoria. New onset anisocoria accompanied by objective evidence of abnormal pupil reactivity occurring at any point during hospitalization was significantly associated with maximum midline shift (β = 2.27 per mm; p = 0.01). The occurrence of new onset anisocoria accompanied by objective evidence of normal pupil reactivity was inversely associated with death (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16–0.71; p = 0.01) in adjusted analyses. Subclinical continuous pupil size difference distinguished first-time new onset anisocoria from nonnew onset anisocoria in up to four preceding pupil observations (or up to 8hr prior). Minimum pupil reactivity between eyes also distinguished new onset anisocoria accompanied by objective evidence of abnormal pupil reactivity from new onset anisocoria accompanied by objective evidence of normal pupil reactivity prior to first-time new onset anisocoria occurrence.

Conclusions

New onset anisocoria occurs in over 60% of patients with neurologic emergencies. Pupil reactivity may be an important distinguishing characteristic of clinically relevant new onset anisocoria phenotypes. New onset anisocoria accompanied by objective evidence of abnormal pupil reactivity was associated with midline shift, and new onset anisocoria accompanied by objective evidence of normal pupil reactivity had an inverse relationship with death. Distinct quantitative pupil characteristics precede new onset anisocoria occurrence and may allow for earlier prediction of neurologic decline. Further work is needed to determine whether quantitative pupillometry sensitively/specifically predicts clinically relevant anisocoria, enabling possible earlier treatments.

### Reversible mydriasis of sudden onset: think before you act [^16e746d3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The presence of abrupt anisocoria in clinical examination usually leads to the performance of urgent neuroimaging studies to exclude intracranial hemorrhage, although unilateral mydriasis might be the result of other benign etiologies.

Case Report

In this work, we report an illustrative case of a patient presenting with sudden-onset anisocoria while receiving ipratropium bromide nebulization in the emergency department to treat acute asthma. No other abnormalities were found on neurological examination and the computed tomography scan was normal. As a muscarinic antagonist, ipratropium bromide can produce mydriasis if accidentally instilled on one eye, thus leading to the suspicion of pharmacologic mydriasis. The pupils became isocoric after the discontinuation of the drug. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? A careful neurological examination and the history of treatment with mydriatic drugs might avoid unnecessary tests and radiation exposure.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^3652015a]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

Following thorough workup, including neurology and ophthalmology consult, the patient was discharged from the emergency department and given appropriate follow-up with both the neurologist and ophthalmologist. The patient's mydriasis and blurry vision improved within 2 days of onset of the symptoms without any need for medical intervention. It has been reported that mydriasis caused by scopolamine or hyoscine normally resolves spontaneously within 24–72 hours. However, its effects can last anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^e247e8db]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

When the cut-off for anisocoria was lowered to ≥ 0.2 mm, every subject in the smaller subset exhibited anisocoria in at least 1 setting, demonstrating that this threshold is either too stringent to be clinically useful or might be too low for the accuracy of the VIP-200 pupillometer.

When the cut-off for anisocoria was raised to ≥ 0.6 mm, the prevalence of anisocoria became more consistent across all light conditions, with ~20% of subjects exhibiting anisocoria in each condition. This is closer to the prevalence observed by previous studies using a lower threshold of ≥ 0.4 mm. This could be explained by differences in pupillometer accuracy or ambient light levels. Prior investigations into the appropriate threshold of anisocoria have yielded similarly variable results when the threshold was shifted to 0.2 or 0.6 mm. It is important to note that most studies to date on the prevalence of physiologic anisocoria have had varying sample sizes ranging from 50 to 1,300 subjects, and this could be contributing to the varying study results despite strict protocols. There is a lack of extensive research into physiologic anisocoria in a large population and this has limited our ability to clearly define a limit of physiologic anisocoria. Using a higher cut-off of ≥ 0.6 mm effectively reduces the number of healthy individuals who exhibit anisocoria in every light setting to zero, and may reduce error due to physiologic variation and improve comparison of studies. We recognize, however, that this cut-off is likely subject to significant variation based on a number of factors as explained below.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^f5ecf797]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A healthy 30-year-old female nurse who presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of blurry vision in the right eye. She was noted to have right unilateral mydriasis without any other neurological deficits. The patient had no significant medical history, denied any history of trauma or use of any new medications, aside from her chronic oral contraceptive use. The patient denied any smoking or alcohol consumption. Her family history was unremarkable.

For fear of a stroke in such a young healthy patient, a Code Neuro was immediately called. Clinically relevant differential diagnoses to rule out in this type of presentation included cerebrovascular accident, carotid artery dissection, cerebral aneurysm, multiple sclerosis and drug-induced mydriasis. CT of the head without contrast, CT angiogram of the head and MRI of brain were all obtained and negative for any abnormalities. Ophthalmology was consulted. Patient's consensual response of the left eye was preserved, however, the right eye remained non-reactive to light and dilated at 5.5 mm. However, in a dim/dark room, patient's left eye dilated from 2.7 to 3.1 mm, and the right eye pupil remained unchanged. Extraocular muscles were intact; funduscopic examination was normal and visual acuity was 20/25 in both the right and left eyes. After multiple tests and several interviews, the patient recalled having contact with a patient in the hospital with a scopolamine patch. She insisted that she washed her hand immediately after this activity and did not recall touching the patch. However, despite not having direct contact with the scopolamine patch, the patient could have contacted contaminated bedding and rubbed her eye. Within 2 days of the onset of symptoms, patient's mydriasis improved and no longer complained of blurry vision.

This unique presentation of pharmacologically induced mydriasis emphasises the importance of obtaining a thorough and detailed history to evade expensive, unnecessary testing and misdiagnosis, and highlights the importance of recognising this rare side effect of a commonly used medication. The suspicion for a pharmacological cause should especially be heightened for patients who work in healthcare.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^4991f736]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study are in agreement with the previously reported prevalence of physiologic anisocoria under photopic settings. Also, as reported previously, the prevalence of anisocoria increases under dim illumination levels, with anisocoria being 1.5 times greater at scotopic light levels compared with the photopic light levels. This may be in part due to an imbalance in resting sympathetic tone, or due to unequal fibrous iris stroma that increases resistance as the eye dilates, causing larger differences in pupil diameter under dim illumination levels.

We also demonstrated that by using a cut-off of ≥ 0.4 mm, almost three-quarters of the subjects exhibited anisocoria in at least 1 illumination setting, while a mere 7.8% exhibited anisocoria across all lighting conditions. This phenomenon was reported previously by Ettinger et al and Lam et al and indicates that anisocoria is not consistent across various lighting conditions. In addition, 9 subjects exhibited anisocoria ≥ 1 mm, and this difference was only present in 1 or 2 light conditions per patient. These subjects did not exhibit anisocoria in the range close to 1 mm in other lighting conditions. It would be highly unusual for subjects with true anisocoria > 1 mm to not exhibit anisocoria at other lighting levels, leading us to believe that these measurements are either user or device error. In these patients, the inconsistency of marked anisocoria may lead to an unwarranted and extensive neurological workup in the clinic, and clinicians should be particularly aware of this possibility.

### Pharmacologic anisocoria due to nebulized ipratropium bromide: a diagnostic challenge [^f1f45de0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Anisocoria may be physiological or seen in fatal conditions, such as intracranial hemorrhage. Newly developing anisocoria may cause confusion and diagnostic difficulty in the emergency department (ED). A 35-year-old female was admitted to the ED with an asthma attack and dyspnea. On examination, the patient was observed to have bilateral rhonchi and was treated with nebulized albuterol (salbutamol) and ipratropium bromide. After the treatment, the dyspnea improved, and mydriasis developed in the left eye (left pupil diameter 9 mm, right 4 mm). An examination revealed that the left pupil was dilated and unreactive to light, but there was no neurological finding. Afterwards, the patient reported that, during the treatment, some aerosol had leaked from the left side of the mask and may have come into contact with her left eye. Given this information, a pilocarpine test was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with pharmacologic anisocoria. The pupil returned to normal within 24 h. Ipratropium bromide is a drug frequently used in patients presenting to the ED with dyspnea. During treatment, nebulized ipratropium may leak from the edge of the facial mask into the ipsilateral eye and may cause mydriasis. A pilocarpine test can be used to differentiate pharmacological anisocoria from other causes, such as third nerve palsy and Adie's pupil. Through the awareness of emergency physicians and the use of the pilocarpine test, a diagnosis can be made without engaging in time-consuming and costly analyses. In addition, this complication can be prevented using masks that better fit the face, as well as protective goggles or eye patches, during treatment.

### Unilateral mydriasis due to hemorrhoidal ointment [^e5c5ead1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The finding of a unilaterally dilatated pupil in a patient who is otherwise alert and unimpaired can pose an interesting diagnostic problem. Algorithms have outlined the approach to evaluating anisocoria, but do not stress the importance of toxic exposures.

Case Report

A patient with a history of depression and chronic headaches was referred to the emergency department from an ophthalmologist's clinic with the findings of asymmetrically dilatated pupils and blurred vision. Detailed history revealed that for several weeks before the onset of symptoms, the patient applied to her eyelids hemorrhoidal ointment that contained an active ingredient known to produce mydriasis.

Conclusion

In the absence of neurologic deficits, clinical history should search for a toxic or pharmacologic etiology of abnormal mydriasis. A detailed physical examination and bedside diagnostic maneuvers can help distinguish benign causes of an abnormally dilatated pupil from more serious causes relating to central nervous system lesions, potentially sparing the patient from unnecessary neuroimaging.

### Anisocoria in an intubated patient with COVID-19 [^8cd7c0e8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The effects of COVID-19 on the eye are still widely unknown. We describe a case of a patient who was intubated and proned in the intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19 and developed unilateral anisocoria. CT venogram excluded a cavernous sinus thrombosis. MRI of the head showed microhaemorrhages in the midbrain where the pupil reflex nuclei are located. After the patient was stepped down from ICU, intraocular pressure (IOP) was found to be raised in that eye. A diagnosis of subacute closed angle glaucoma was made. It is important for clinicians to rule out thrombotic causes in patients who develop acute anisocoria. It is also crucial to measure IOP in patients who develop ophthalmic pathology and have been proned for extended periods.

### Pupil sparing oculomotor nerve palsy with concomitant horner syndrome as a presentation of mantle cell lymphoma relapse [^0494e3dc]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A woman in her 70s, with a background of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), presented with headache and diplopia. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed a combination of Horner syndrome and ipsilateral pupil sparing oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP). Cerebrospinal fluid immunophenotyping demonstrated CD5 positive clonal B lymphocytes, consistent with neurological involvement by MCL. Imaging of the brain and orbits was normal, but a cervical mass was seen along the course of the sympathetic chain accounting for the Horner syndrome. She was treated with intrathecal chemotherapy with improvement in symptoms and resolution of ophthalmoplegia but was left with residual anisocoria and mild ptosis. This presentation (concomitant Horner and ipsilateral ONP) is rare and typically localises to the ipsilateral cavernous sinus, which appeared radiologically normal in this case.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^310d7ab8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, health care providers using digital pupillometers should be aware of the prevalence of physiologic anisocoria in a healthy population. In this study, we complement the current database describing the prevalence of physiologic anisocoria in healthy participants under photopic, mesopic, and scotopic conditions. Based on our data, physiologic anisocoria is more prevalent under varied lighting conditions, and clinicians and researchers may benefit from capturing pupil measurements in standardized light conditions. Furthermore, using a cut-off for anisocoria of ≥ 0.6 mm, and insisting on its presence under all lighting conditions, decreases the prevalence of anisocoria in healthy individuals. However, the protocol and device differences between studies greatly limit our ability to set a standard threshold to define physiological anisocoria. Future studies using standardized protocols and larger sample size are needed to establish a more robust cut-off for physiologic anisocoria.

### Adult Horner's syndrome: a combined clinical, pharmacological, and imaging algorithm [^6b0638de]. Eye (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Horner's syndrome (HS) can be difficult, as patients rarely present with the classic triad of ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis. Frequently, there are no associated symptoms to help determine or localise the underlying pathology. The onset of anisocoria may also be uncertain, with many cases referred after incidental discovery on routine optometric assessment. Although the textbooks discuss the use of cocaine, apraclonidine, and hydroxyamphetamine to diagnose and localise HS, in addition to reported false positive and negative results, these pharmacological agents are rarely available during acute assessment or in general ophthalmic departments. Typically, a week is required between using cocaine or apraclonidine for diagnosis and localisation of HS with hydroxyamphetamine, leaving the clinician with the decision of which investigations to request and with what urgency. Modern imaging modalities have advanced significantly and become more readily available since many of the established management algorithms were written. We thus propose a practical and safe combined clinical and radiological diagnostic protocol for HS that can be applied in most clinical settings.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^a1513558]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

There is also no consensus on the threshold of physiologic anisocoria above which investigation into underlying pathology is warranted. Gross et al have reported that anisocoria under 1 mm can be considered physiologic and warrants no further workup. Suh et al reported that children with Horner syndrome had an average pupillary difference of > 1.3 mm, while only 3% of healthy children without Horner syndrome had > 1.3 mm pupillary difference. Given the variation in thresholds and lighting conditions used, it is not surprising that there is a wide range of reported prevalence of physiologic anisocoria in the literature.,

The rise of digital infrared pupillometers has allowed providers to obtain more accurate, repeatable measurements of physiologic anisocoria with controlled illumination. These devices use advanced software and infrared videography to account for pupillary noise and vertex distance variance. They also use controlled lighting to produce consistent and precise illumination. There have been several studies reporting the prevalence of physiologic anisocoria using these newer devices, yet these studies lack procedural standardization and utilize inconsistent luminance levels.,

This lack of standardization in the measurement of anisocoria, particularly the luminance levels of the examination room, prevents comparison of previous studies and compromises the accuracy of anisocoria as a clinical diagnostic test.

This study seeks to evaluate the measurement of anisocoria in a group of subjects with healthy eyes using a standardized protocol in scotopic, mesopic, and photopic lighting conditions. An additional goal is to study the prevalence of anisocoria with varying cut-offs to allow for cross comparison.

### Tonic pupil caused by adenoid cystic carcinoma versus postradiation changes to the ciliary ganglion [^31868aac]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Investigations

A complete neuro-ophthalmic examination was performed for her new symptoms. Physical examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/15–2 oculus dexter (OD) and 20/15–1 oculus sinister (OS). She accurately identified 6/6 AO-HRR colour plates OU and had unremarkable Amsler grid testing. Her pupil exam revealed anisocoria: left mydriasis with greater asymmetry in a brightly lit room. There was brisk constriction to light OD and imperceptible reaction to light OS (figure 1A), with OS constriction to near greater than OD (figure 1B) and tonic redilation OS on refixation at a distance. Thirty minutes after 0.125% pilocarpine in both eyes, her right pupil was no different and the left had constricted to be the smaller pupil, thus confirming the diagnosis of a left tonic pupil (figure 1C). To exclude a concomitant Horner syndrome on either side, apraclonidine 0.5% was applied to both eyes on another visit, and the anisocoria did not change. Slit-lamp examination revealed sectoral palsies of her left pupil sphincter.

Figure 1
Anisocoria with brisk constriction to light OD and imperceptible reaction to light OS (A), with OS constriction to near greater than OD (B). 0.125% pilocarpine test demonstrates 3.75 mm OD and 3.25 mm OS, confirming the diagnosis of a left tonic pupil (C). OD, oculus dexter; OS, oculus sinister.

Motility testing revealed 35 prism diopters of esotropia in primary gaze, > 50 in left gaze, 7 in right gaze, 14 in upgaze and 9 in downgaze with no vertical deviation. Intraocular pressure was 14 OU, and a dilated fundus examination was unremarkable.

Trigeminal sensation to light touch, pain and temperature were intact and symmetric in V1, V2 and V3. There were no signs of cranial nerve III or VII aberrant regeneration. Knee and ankle reflexes were 2+ bilaterally. Humphrey 24–2 visual field testing was unremarkable.

His usual frequency of headaches was nearly daily for the past year which came in waves of headaches lasting 10–20 min for a total duration of 2–3 h, with symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, bilateral eyelid swelling and sweating.

During physical examination, his BP was 119/67 mmHg, his HR was 64 bpm and regular. He remained apyrexial throughout admission. He was found to have a right partial ptosis with anisocoria. The right conjunctiva was injected. His right pupil was 2 mm and left pupil was 3 mm, and there was a slight elevation of his right lower eyelid with delayed pupillary dilatation in dim light (Fig. 3). He had binocular diplopia without ophthalmoplegia at bilateral lateral gaze without any nystagmus. There was no skew deviation of the eyes. He was dysarthric. He had decreased motor power of MRC grade 4 out of 5 involving the entire right upper and lower limbs. There was a right-sided facial droop; with a loss of sensation over the right side of the face, the entire upper and lower limbs to modalities of pinprick, temperature and fine touch. The tongue was central with equal movement of the uvulae. His tone was decreased over the right upper and lower limbs. There was no pronator drift and the Babinski's reflexes were plantar bilaterally.

The patient was placed back on aspirin and clopidogrel as his CYP2C19 genome tests showed that he was a normal metabolizer of clopidogrel. An urgent CT angiography (CTA) from the arch of the aorta to the Circle of Willis did not reveal any dissections, aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, nor findings consistent with temporal arteritis (Fig. 4). No cranial infarction nor intracranial haemorrhage was seen at that time. He had persistent neurological deficits after the CT angiogram. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with neither evidence of acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, nor arrhythmias. His serum sodium, potassium and white blood cell counts were all within normal limits. A serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate was not performed as there was no symptoms of jaw claudication nor polymyalgia rheumatica; the patient's blood haemoglobin was 13.2 g/dL.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^3a1efd31]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric eye evaluations — pupillary examination: The pupils should be assessed for size, symmetry, and shape; for their direct and consensual responses to light; and for presence of a relative afferent defect, recognizing that pupillary evaluation in infants and children may be difficult due to hippus, poorly maintained fixation, and/or rapid changes in accommodative status. Anisocoria greater than 1 millimeter may indicate a pathological process, such as Horner syndrome, Adie tonic pupil, or a pupil-involving third-cranial-nerve palsy, and irregular pupils may indicate the presence of traumatic sphincter damage, iritis, or a congenital abnormality. A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) of 0.3 or more log units (i.e., easily visible) is not typically seen in amblyopia, a subtle RAPD may be seen with dense amblyopia, and the presence of a large RAPD should suggest optic nerve damage, compressive optic neuropathy or other etiologies of visual impairment.

### Ophthalmology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic [^8cd0458d]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Neuro-ophthalmology service

The neuro-ophthalmology service adopted a protocol mandating that all consultations begin with a remote telephone-based interview. The utility of telemedicine has been established in neuro-ophthalmology for many years. Neuro-ophthalmology is particularly amenable to telemedicine because a detailed history can often lead to a diagnosis. For example, a recent study demonstrated that an experienced neuro-ophthalmologist could correctly diagnose 88% of new cases based on the history alone.

Beyond the patient's history, many aspects of the physical examination can be performed through simple photographs and video that patients can obtain using their smartphones. Anisocoria can be assessed by asking the patient to photograph their eyes in dim and bright light. Videos can allow assessment of strabismus and nystagmus.

In some cases, the above assessment will clearly indicate that the immediate course of action should be referral to the nearest emergency department. Sometimes, it will be apparent that the clinical circumstances are not urgent, allowing for the neuro-ophthalmology examination to be deferred. In some circumstances, it may become apparent that the indication for a neuro-ophthalmology assessment was not even justified (eg, monocular diplopia).

When the steps described above leave clinical ambiguity, a direct patient–physician encounter may still not be immediately necessary. Specialised tests can be performed, which the neuro-ophthalmologist can assess remotely. These include automated visual fields, OCT and neuroimaging. Digital fundus photography has allowed for neuro-ophthalmologists to telemedically diagnose both optic disc oedemaand optic atrophy.OCT is becoming an increasingly accessible imaging alternative for the optic disc and has even been shown to be more sensitive than direct ophthalmoscopy in the diagnosis of optic disc abnormalities.

### Eye on children: acute work-up for pediatric Horner's syndrome. case presentation and review of the literature [^7adb528b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ptosis and anisocoria in a child may be subtle indications of occult pathology, and making the observation acutely in the emergency department (ED) is important in guiding patient management and treatment. Emergency physicians must evaluate patients to exclude serious or life-threatening emergencies and ensure correct disposition of patients. Horner syndrome in children may be considered congenital or acquired and may be from benign or malignant causes. When an isolated, acquired Horner syndrome is suspected in a pediatric patient, physical examination of the neck and abdomen for masses, as well as spot urine catecholamines, vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid, and varying degrees of imaging are recommended as part of the initial evaluation. These evaluations may be performed in the ED or may require hospitalization, depending on the suspected anatomical localization and diagnostic considerations.

Case Report

A 21-month-old, normally developed girl presented to the University Hospital ED with a 2-h history of right-sided eyelid drooping in the setting of a febrile illness. An eventual diagnosis of Horner syndrome from cervical lymph node compression was made on the basis of history, examination, and imaging findings. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? ED evaluations of pediatric patients differ from adults. Evaluation and work-up of Horner syndrome in children can be challenging and can require varying degrees of assessment and evaluation, depending on the diagnostic considerations. This article will address the common pathologies responsible for isolated pediatric Horner syndrome and the recommended ED evaluation.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^e71f516c]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Provider and setting — Diagnosis and management of strabismus occurring after other ocular surgery require the training and clinical judgment of an experienced ophthalmologist. Communication, as possible, should be established with the surgeon who is performing the original surgical procedure that is associated with the development or exacerbation of strabismus. Working under the supervision of an ophthalmologist, orthoptists can be an asset in the examination, diagnosis, and nonsurgical management, and optometrists and opticians may add additional support in the management of aniseikonia, or contact lens fitting, as appropriate.

### Advantages, limitations, and diagnostic accuracy of photoscreeners in early detection of amblyopia: a review [^a9517f8a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

This device will not record data until the image is properly focused, and provide visual clues to assist in image-capturing process. Images can be obtained rapidly with multiple readings in three different meridians in just 2 seconds, and the device shows one of the several messages: "all measurements within range", "complete eye exam recommended", "pupils too small", "pupils not found", "out of range", or "continue attempting to obtain a reading".

The instrument uses the operator cutoff values to make a referral proposal in significant refractive error, anisometropia, anisocoria, or if the pupillary centers are discordant, indicating strabismus. The device is also designed to detect ptosis (the pupil is not fully visible to the camera, leaving it unable to record properly, generating a referral report). It has the potential to detect media opacity, but this should be validated with further research. The report can be printed and includes a diagrammatic representation of the eyes showing an estimation of the refractive error, and a graphic presentation of refractive or alignment issues of concern in the child. There are two software versions (v1.1.51 and v2.0.16) for the same devicewith different accuracy indexes for each referral criterion (Table 2).

### Pupillary dilation lag is intermittently present in patients with a stable oculosympathetic defect (horner syndrome) [^e1d2e150]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To examine the repeatability of detecting pupillary dilation lag in patients with Horner syndrome.

Design

Retrospective interventional study.

Setting

Single referral institution.

Patient Population

Fifteen patients with unilateral Horner syndrome and 16 subjects with physiologic anisocoria. Intervention procedure: Each subject underwent four pupillometric recordings in darkness. The asymmetry of pupillodilation between the two eyes was calculated as the change in anisocoria between five seconds and 15 seconds in darkness. Pupillary dilation lag was considered present if the asymmetry measured ≥ 0.4 mm.

Main Outcome Measure

Asymmetry of pupillodilation over four determinations.

Results

All subjects demonstrated fluctuations in the calculated asymmetry of pupillodilation. Eight patients (53%) with Horner syndrome demonstrated dilation lag on the first determination; 13 patients (87%) eventually demonstrated it during four determinations.

Conclusions

Pupillary dilation lag is intermittently present in most patients with Horner syndrome. Repeated observations improve the detection rate of dilation lag, a confirmatory sign of an oculosympathetic deficit. Its absence does not rule out Horner syndrome.

Traumatic Brain Injury

Pupillary light reactivity is a well-described prognostic variable in the setting of severe head injury. The literature is full of evidence demonstrating that alterations of the pupillary light reflex, pupil size, and/or anisocoria are correlated with outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI). In fact, neurosurgeons triage patients to surgical evacuation of mass lesions or conservative therapy according to the pupillary status. It has also been shown that patients who undergo prompt treatment after a new pupil abnormality, whether it be medical or surgical, have a better outcome.

In patients with acute traumatic epidural hematoma and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 8, anisocoria was present in 67% of patients and reducing the surgery interval to < 90 min was associated with a better outcome. TBI patients with a GCS = 3 and fixed, dilated pupils had no chance of survival, whereas patients with a GCS = 3 with pupils that were not fixed or dilated had an excellent survival rate. Intracranial hypertension is associated with decreased NPi, and patients with elevated ICP had an improvement in NPi values after treatment with osmotic therapy. Therefore, pupillometry has the potential as a noninvasive tool to assess the efficacy of osmotic therapy.

Stevens et al. performed a prospective observational study on 40 patients with TBI requiring invasive ICP monitoring and showed a weak relationship between ICP events and a preceding NPi event. The strength of this trend appeared to diminish post-decompressive surgery. Jahns et al. assessed 54 patients with severe TBI with abnormal lesions on head computed tomography (CT) imaging who underwent parenchymal ICP monitoring and repeated NPi assessment through four consecutive measurements over intervals of 6 h prior to sustained elevated ICP > 20 mmHg and found that episodes of elevated ICP correlated with a concomitant decrease in NPi. Sustained abnormal NPi was in turn associated with a more complicated ICP course and worse outcome.

Vassilieva et al. assessed the feasibility of automated pupillometry for the detection of command following in patients with altered consciousness. They enrolled 20 healthy volunteers and 48 patients with a wide range of neurological disorders who were asked to engage in mental arithmetic. Fourteen of 20 (70%) healthy volunteers and 17 of 43 (39.5%) neurological patients fulfilled pre-specified criteria for command following by showing pupillary dilations during 4 or 5 arithmetic tasks.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^1f5b2789]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Anisocoria was defined as ≥ 0.4 mm difference in mean pupil diameter as described in previous studies. Prevalence of anisocoria under varying light conditions is summarized in Table 1. In the larger group under photopic conditions, 23.8% (n = 30) exhibited anisocoria. In the smaller subset of individuals measured under 4 lighting conditions, anisocoria was present in 27.4% (n = 14) in photopic, 43.1% (n = 22) in scotopic, 43.1% (n = 22) in low mesopic, and 47.1% (n = 24) in high mesopic conditions. In this subset, 72.5% (n = 37) of the subjects exhibited anisocoria in at least 1 illumination setting, and 7.8% (n = 4) had anisocoria in all illumination settings. Nine subjects had anisocoria ≥ 1 mm, but each subject only exhibited this difference in 1 or 2 light conditions. The range of observed anisocoria was 0–1.55 mm.

Leukocoria, meaning "white pupil", describes the clinical finding of a white pupillary reflex on examination. It may be discovered through an asymmetric red reflex using direct ophthalmoscopy, or it may be seen incidentally on flash photography. It results from an abnormality of the eyeball that interferes with the normal reflective process. We report a case of a 3-year-old boy who presents with leukocoria found to be caused by a retinoblastoma and discuss the differential diagnosis of this uncommon presentation to the pediatric emergency department.

### Adie's tonic pupil presenting with unilateral photophobia successfully treated with dilute pilocarpine [^a43c0128]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 40-year-old healthy man presented with a 4-month history of photophobia, blurred vision and a right dilated pupil. Examination revealed a right pupil that was not reactive to light but constricted strongly to a near target and slowly redilated when he looked back in the distance. Pharmacological testing with dilute pilocarpine 0.1% resulted in constriction of the right pupil but no change in the left pupil. This also resulted in resolution of his photophobia and blurry vision. Neurological examination was otherwise normal, and a diagnosis of Adie's tonic pupil was made. The main differential diagnosis to consider for a large pupil is a third nerve palsy, pharmacological mydriasis, tonic pupil and local iris processes, such as iris sphincter tears from trauma. Knowledge of the key features of these conditions can avoid wasted resources from unnecessary testing. Dilute pilocarpine 0.1% three times a day can be considered as a pharmacological therapy for symptomatic relief.

### Physiologic anisocoria under various lighting conditions [^de2de6a7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the measurement of anisocoria in a group of ocular healthy subjects using a standardized protocol in scotopic, mesopic, and photopic lighting conditions, and determine the optimal threshold of difference in pupil diameter in determining physiologic anisocoria.

Methods

Right and left pupil diameters of 126 ocular healthy subjects with a mean age 30.5 ± 7.8 years (40 males and 86 females) were measured sequentially under photopic conditions using a monocular infrared pupillometer. A sub-group of 51 individuals had right and left pupil measurements performed under three additional lighting conditions, allowing for a 2-minute recovery between measurements. A white light emitting diode (LED) in the eyecup of the pupillometer produced three controlled light settings: scotopic (0 lux), low mesopic (0.3 lux), and high mesopic (3 lux). The criterion for anisocoria was defined as ≥ 0.4 mm difference in pupil diameter between the eyes.

Results

In the 126 subjects tested, 23.8% (n = 30) exhibited anisocoria in photopic conditions. In the sub-group measured under three additional light settings, 43.1% (n = 22) exhibited anisocoria in scotopic conditions, 43.1% (n = 22) in low mesopic conditions, and 47.1% (n = 24) in high mesopic conditions. Approximately 73% of subjects exhibited anisocoria in at least one light setting, while only approximately 8% had anisocoria in every light setting. When the criterion for anisocoria was shifted to ≥ 0.2 mm or ≥ 0.6 mm, the prevalence of anisocoria shifted significantly. Using a higher cutoff of ≥ 0.6 mm effectively reduced the number of healthy individuals who exhibit anisocoria in every light setting to almost zero.

Conclusion

Based on our data, anisocoria is more prevalent under varied lighting conditions. To ensure the anisocoria is due to physiologic reasons, one should ensure that it is present under all lighting conditions to avoid excessive false positives.

### Anisocoria secondary to inadvertent contact with scopolamine patch [^c4eb3789]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological anisocoria can be distinguished from neurogenic pupillary dilation using the 1% pilocarpine test in both eyes. In the absence of trauma to the eye, if the dilated pupil fails to constrict within 30 min, is proof of pharmacological blockage of the iris muscle. Neurogenic dilation of the pupil due to oculomotor nerve palsy, for example, does not directly affect the cholinergic receptor of the sphincter pupillae, and will constrict if pilocarpine is instilled into the affected eye. Other causes of decreased response to pilocarpine would include trauma or increased intraocular pressure.

There are several case reports of inadvertent pharmacological mydriasis due to scopolamine (hyoscine). Many of these cases, an MRI or CT scan were obtained to investigate the cause of the anisocoria, however in only one case, imaging was cancelled as the patient recalled coming into contact with a scopolamine patch. A similar case report discussed a 46-year-old female nurse who worked in a stroke ward who also presented with sudden onset unilateral mydriasis. With further history, she recalled applying a hyoscine (scopolamine) patch to a patient in the morning. Another case report revealed a 42-year-old male with progressive blurred vision who had initially denied any topical eye medications, but later remembered that he used atropine 1% which believed were lubricant eye drops. Glassner and Skiendzielewski, also described inadvertent ocular contamination of scopolamine patches in air medical personnel. A 28-year-old male with blurry vision and unilateral mydriasis had been wearing a scopolamine patch to prevent motion sickness but inadvertently caused contamination to his eye. Aside from scopolamine, there have also been cases of inadvertent contact with anticholinergic agents that also lead to anisocoria. Examples include ipratropium use in critically ill patients and deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^4e387aa6]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Oculomotor palsy — disease definition and clinical features — is also known as a 3rd nerve palsy and is the second most common cranial neuropathy; patients usually present with diplopia from misalignment that has both a horizontal and vertical component and sometimes with difficulty reading secondary to accommodative deficiency, and the presentation is an incomitant deviation with ptosis and extraocular muscle paresis that typically leaves the eye abducted, infraducted, and incyclotorted due to preserved lateral rectus and superior oblique function; the pupil may or may not be involved, which should be noted to help direct evaluation, and aberrant re-innervation is more common with prior trauma or a compressive lesion but can also occur with other etiologies.

### Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with aberrant eyelid movements and pupillary spasms: a case report [^030ff6d0]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Pupillary abnormalities associated with oculomotor nerve palsy are usually observed as anisocoria, with a larger pupil on the affected side, which is commonly observed in patients with acquired oculomotor nerve palsy. Pupillary involvement is more frequently associated with compressive lesions, whereas it is relatively uncommon in ischemic etiologies. Compressive lesions, such as neoplasms and aneurysms, are highly suspected because of the anatomical characteristics of the pupil fibers which reside in the most superficial and dorsomedial portions of the oculomotor nerve within the subarachnoid space. Therefore, when acquired oculomotor nerve palsy with pupillary involvement is observed, careful clinical evaluation and appropriate imaging can identify the definitive cause in most cases.

Regardless of whether the condition is congenital or acquired, aberrant regeneration following the recovery of the oculomotor nerve palsy has been reported to cause pupillary abnormalities, presenting in various forms, such as miosis, mydriasis, or cyclic spasm. Czarnecki and Thompson studied the pupils of 14 patients with aberrant reinnervation of the oculomotor nerve and observed abnormal pupillary unrest with asynchronous random contractions of the iris sphincter, which is considered as fiber-sprouting collateral branches that reaches additional muscles of the oculomotor group other than those originally innervated. Hamed reported two cases of congenital oculomotor nerve palsy with dilated fixed pupils that became miotic during growth. They concluded that pupillary miosis is a result of aberrant reinnervation, which appears to be much more frequent after congenital rather than acquired pupillary involvement in oculomotor palsy. In addition, Tian et al. reported oculomotor nerve paresis with cyclic spasm, which is a rare congenital condition that is usually not associated with tumors.

### Evaluation of the visual system by the primary care provider following concussion [^0676d75f]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Pupils — Pupillary assessment involves eliciting direct and consensual responses to light on both sides, checking for an afferent pupillary defect, and examining the response to accommodation. The swinging light test is used to evaluate for an afferent pupillary defect: have the patient fixate on an object at least 10 feet away and shine a bright light on one eye from slightly below, then swing the light between eyes; a normal response is that the pupil maintains a similar size, and dilation of one pupil indicates an afferent pupillary defect. The response to accommodation is assessed by alternately looking between the same 10-foot target and a second target 6 inches from the face while illuminating both pupils from below.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^a1803168]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — 3rd nerve palsy evaluation states that it is recommended to proceed either with neuroimaging including MR imaging with gadolinium and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA), and that pupil-involving 3rd nerve palsy is more concerning with a compressive lesion requiring urgent exclusion, especially an aneurysm involving the posterior communicating artery. Neuroimaging, including MRA or CTA, is recommended, and if there is a high suspicion for aneurysm despite a normal MRA or CTA, then a catheter angiogram should be considered after brain MR imaging with and without contrast and specific attention to the 3rd nerve. In some instances of vasculopathic 3rd nerve palsy, the pupil may be involved, although mildly; if neuroimaging is normal, the next step would be serologic testing for infectious diseases (such as syphilis and Lyme) with consideration given to lumbar puncture that would include glucose, protein, cell count, and cytology and culture, recognizing that tumors, trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, viral illnesses including COVID-19, demyelinating disease, and leptomeningeal disorders are in the differential.

### Reliability of standard pupillometry practice in neurocritical care: an observational, double-blinded study [^026b158a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In critical care units, pupil examination is an important clinical parameter for patient monitoring. Current practice is to use a penlight to observe the pupillary light reflex. The result seems to be a subjective measurement, with low precision and reproducibility. Several quantitative pupillometer devices are now available, although their use is primarily restricted to the research setting. To assess whether adoption of these technologies would benefit the clinic, we compared automated quantitative pupillometry with the standard clinical pupillary examination currently used for brain-injured patients.

Methods

In order to determine inter-observer agreement of the device, we performed repetitive measurements in 200 healthy volunteers ranging in age from 21 to 58 years, providing a total of 400 paired (alternative right eye, left eye) measurements under a wide variety of ambient light condition with NeuroLight Algiscan pupillometer. During another period, we conducted a prospective, observational, double-blinded study in two neurocritical care units. Patients admitted to these units after an acute brain injury were included. Initially, nursing staff measured pupil size, anisocoria and pupillary light reflex. A blinded physician subsequently performed measurement using an automated pupillometer.

Results

In 200 healthy volunteers, intra-class correlation coefficient for maximum resting pupil size was 0.95 (IC: 0.93–0.97) and for minimum pupil size after light stimulation 0.87 (0.83–0.89). We found only 3-pupil asymmetry (≥ 1 mm) in these volunteers (1.5% of the population) with a clear pupil asymmetry during clinical inspection. The mean pupil light reactivity was 40 ± 7%. In 59 patients, 406 pupillary measurements were prospectively performed. Concordance between measurements for pupil size collected using the pupillometer, versus subjective assessment, was poor (Spearmen's rho = 0.75, IC: 0.70–0.79; P < 0.001). Nursing staff failed to diagnose half of the cases (15/30) of anisocoria detected using the pupillometer device. A global rate of discordance of 18% (72/406) was found between the two techniques when assessing the pupillary light reflex. For measurements with small pupils (diameters < 2 mm) the error rate was 39% (24/61).

Conclusion

Standard practice in pupillary monitoring yields inaccurate data. Automated quantitative pupillometry is a more reliable method with which to collect pupillary measurements at the bedside.

### Atypical Horner's syndrome: frequency, features and aetiology in a paediatric population [^876a7cf8]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Paediatric Horner's syndrome (HS) may present atypically with incomplete or intermittent clinical features, yet could represent sinister pathology including neuroblastoma. We aim to report the frequency and features with which atypical HS presents in our population (Northern Ireland) and to propose an investigation algorithm to aid diagnosis in these challenging cases.

Subjects/Methods

Retrospective chart review of all paediatric anisocoria and HS cases presenting to Belfast, Northern Ireland, between 2012 and 2018, identified through searching our paediatric ophthalmology database.

Results

Sixty-one eligible cases of anisocoria or HS were analysed. Ten cases of HS were identified, four (40%) of which presented atypically with incomplete or intermittent features. Two of these four atypical cases were secondary to neuroblastoma. Overall incidence of paediatric HS in Northern Ireland during the study period was at least 2.54 per 100,000.

Conclusions

Paediatric HS may present atypically in a significant number of cases. Accordingly, clinicians should consider HS in children with a history of anisocoria or ptosis and have a low threshold for use of pharmacological tests to aid diagnosis.

### Congenital horner and scimitar syndrome in a newborn: a previously unreported combination [^a70182d0]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Here we report a case of a term newborn presenting with left palpebral ptosis, anisocoria and heterochromia as well as cleft palate and heart murmur. Congenital Horner syndrome was suspected and a thoracoabdominal CT scan was performed to rule out neuroblastoma. This revealed an anomalous drainage of right pulmonary veins to a collector that drains to the inferior vena cava, leading to the diagnosis of Scimitar syndrome. Echocardiogram showed an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, enlarged right chambers and a dilated coronary sinus due to a persistent left superior vena cava. The combination of Horner and Scimitar syndrome has never been described before. This case should encourage clinicians to use a multidisciplinary approach in order to guarantee an adequate diagnosis and management.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^cfbf0b35]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Pupillary reactivity and pupillometry — The pupillary light response is an important element of the neurologic exam because it provides useful diagnostic and prognostic information, and new pupillary asymmetry can indicate compression of the brainstem with impending uncal herniation, triggering the need for further evaluation and intervention; a unilateral unreactive pupil is consistent with an ipsilateral mass lesion, while bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils portend a poor overall prognosis for functional recovery. In older adults, evaluation of the pupillary response may be confounded by preexisting chronic ophthalmic diseases, and although quantitative pupillometry may be of limited value in postsurgical pupils after cataract surgery, this does not influence pupillary light reflex parameters measured by automated pupillometry; in these patients, a medical history is essential to correctly interpret findings. Both the inter‑rater and intra‑rater reliability of the standard clinical determination of pupillary size and reactivity are relatively poor, whereas quantitative pupillometers provide increased reliability and consistency; the quantitative pupillometer is a small handheld device that uses both visible and infrared light to measure a pupil, capture its response to a light stimulus, and quantify the pupil's characteristics, with outputs including starting diameter (mm), ending diameter (mm), % change, latency (s), average constriction velocity (mm/s), and average dilation velocity (mm/s). In pediatric patients, developmental changes in myelination during infancy can alter the normal latency observed, potentially limiting the application of a priori thresholds. Clinical experience shows that quantitative pupillometry can facilitate a more accurate clinical assessment by providing an objective and reliable assessment of pupillary reactivity; pupillary changes may be detected before a provider's clinical assessment, quantitative pupillometry can assess reactivity even when opioids and other drugs result in small pupils, and the pupillometry output can be directly entered into the patient's electronic medical record.

### Contemplating the necessity of surgical treatment for posterior lenticonus: a case report [^37535189]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

The patient is a 13-year-old female who, five years ago, experienced impaired vision without any accompanying symptoms such as eye pain, redness, photophobia, tears, or other discomfort. Her medical history revealed no previous incidents of trauma, and there was no known hereditary visual impairment in the family. The results of other systemic tests conducted were normal and unremarkable. During the ophthalmic examination, the patient exhibited a visual acuity of 20/40 in the right eye and 20/32 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was within the normal range, and no strabismus was observed, with normal eye movement. The anterior segment examination under slit-lamp revealed normal findings. Subsequently, 1% tropicamide eye drops were used to dilate the pupils. The right lens displayed normal findings, while the left lens appeared normal in size with a well-circumscribed, oval-shaped vesicular alteration above the temporoparietal center of the posterior capsule, accompanied by a feather-like opacity in the nearby posterior subcapsular cortex (Fig. 1). Other lens were transparent, with a normal form and position of the suspensory ligament.

Fundus exam appeared normal. However, the fundus image appeared distorted when posterior lenticonus lens changes were visible (Fig. 2). -UBM, the temporal crystal of the left eye exhibited an abnormally strong echo (Fig. 3 A), while the vitreous cavity showed large, fixed hyperechoic masses seen through ocular B-scan (Fig. 3 B). Cystic hyperreflection was visible behind the left eye lens according to AS-OCT (Fig. 4). The patient currently suffers from posterior lenticonus in the left eye, as well as ametropia and anisometropia in both eyes. The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS, with a refractive status of -1.25/−2.25 × 5 OD and + 4.75/−4.50 × 165 OS. The patient is undergoing temporary conservative therapy with eyewear and regular monitoring, as she currently has good vision correction with no other discernible symptoms.

### Primary angle-closure disease preferred practice pattern ® [^d08bf8f7]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Other components of the initial evaluation — although a dilated examination may not be advisable for patients with ITC, an attempt should be made to optimally evaluate the fundus and optic nerve head clinically by using the direct ophthalmoscope or the slit-lamp biomicroscope with an indirect lens (e.g., 78- or 90-diopter lens), the central portion of the gonioscopy lens, or by imaging the retina and optic nerve with photography using a nonmydriatic camera through an undilated pupil. In many cases, it may also be possible to obtain OCT imaging of the optic nerve through an undilated pupil to ascertain and document the status of the optic nerve. For patients with suspected PACD, pupil dilation should be done with caution, and as appropriate, these patients should be warned about signs and symptoms until an iridotomy has been performed, since dilation can precipitate AACC. However, if dilation is deemed essential (e.g., for suspected retinal pathology), cautious dilation can be performed.

### Urgent surgical intervention in pediatric patients with Chiari malformation type I. report of two cases [^3e19938c]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with Chiari malformation Type I (CM-I) most commonly present with chronic symptoms. A search of the current medical literature revealed scant information regarding acute presentations of CM-I in either pediatric or adult patients. The authors report on two children who presented with rapidly worsening neurological symptoms attributable to a previously undiagnosed CM-I. One patient became profoundly hypopneic with dysphagia and right hemiparesis over a less than 48-hour period. The second patient presented with a few days of worsening right hemiparesis, gait disturbance, and anisocoria. In addition to a CM-I, magnetic resonance imaging in the second patient revealed a holocord syrinx. Following urgent posterior fossa decompression, both patients rapidly improved in the 24 hours immediately following surgery and continued to improve in the subsequent weeks. Few reports detail acute symptoms due to CM-I and those that do exist almost exclusively involve adult patients. Although seemingly rare, the clinician should consider CM-I in the differential diagnosis in pediatric patients presenting with acute brainstem or long tract signs.

Considering alternate cut-offs for physiologic anisocoria

When anisocoria was defined as ≥ 0.2 mm, the prevalence of anisocoria in the large group under photopic conditions was 51.6% (n = 65). In the subset of 51 individuals, the prevalence of anisocoria was 72.5% (n = 37) in scotopic, 70.6% (n = 36) in low mesopic, 76.5% (n = 39) in high mesopic, and 54.9% (n = 28) in photopic conditions. Every subject in this subset had ≥ 0.2 mm of anisocoria in at least 1 illumination condition, while 16 subjects (31.4%) had anisocoria in all conditions. Table 2 summarizes how adjusting the cut-off affects the prevalence of subjects exhibiting anisocoria under all light conditions.

When anisocoria was defined as ≥ 0.6 mm, the prevalence of anisocoria under photopic conditions was 14.3% (n = 18). In the subset of 51 individuals, the prevalence was 19.6% (n = 10) in scotopic, 15.7% (n = 8) in low mesopic, 21.6% (n = 11) in high mesopic, and 19.6% (n = 10) in photopic conditions. Approximately half (47%, n = 24) of subjects in this subset had ≥ 0.6 mm of anisocoria in at least 1 illumination condition, while only 1 subject (1.9%) had anisocoria in all conditions.

### Pediatric eye evaluations preferred practice pattern [^843d21ae]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric Eye Evaluations PPP — guidance notes state that the values were generated by consensus and are based solely on professional experience and clinical impressions, that the exact values are unknown and may differ among age groups, and that they are presented as general guidelines that should be tailored to the individual child; specific guidelines for older children are not provided because refractive correction is determined by the severity of the refractive error, visual acuity, and visual symptoms. The footnote further specifies that the values represent the minimum difference in refractive error between eyes that would prompt refractive correction in the absence of other abnormalities, and that thresholds for correction of anisometropia should be lower if the child has strabismus or amblyopia.

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^6c03f058]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Diagnosis

SAH should be considered in all patients presenting with sudden-onset severe headaches. Among other presenting features, seizures are observed in approximately 6% of patients. Focal neurological deficits are usually associated with an intraparenchymal haematoma or the location of an aneurysm, e.g. an oculomotor nerve palsy with pupillary dysfunction is associated with enlargement or rupture of the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Among patients presenting with an acute nontraumatic headache that has reached maximal intensity within one hour and intact neurology, the Ottawa rules are very sensitive for identifying an SAH but with low specificity. A non-contrast CT scan of the head (CTH), usually modern third-generation CTH, is 100% specific and highly sensitive for aSAH if scanned in the first 6 h of headache onset, the sensitivity decreases to 97% in the first 72 h and further decreases by 50% in 5 days. If CTH performed ≥ 6 h after the ictus is equivocal or negative, a lumbar puncture performed within 6–12 h of symptom onset typically shows xanthochromia. Unlike CT, xanthochromia is present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in all patients up to 2 weeks post ictus; false positive results can occur from a traumatic lumbar puncture.

For handling aSAH, computed tomographic and digital subtraction angiography play significant roles. CTA, as a less invasive and readily accessible option, is the first investigation to consider. Apart from identifying aneurysms, it also aids in planning the repair. However, in inconclusive CTA results, Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), the gold standard in angiography, is recommended. Furthermore, stereotactic angiography with 3-dimensional rotational capabilities proves valuable for detecting aSAH aneurysms, except when previously diagnosed by a noninvasive angiogram. It contributes to treatment planning and assessing an aneurysm's suitability for endovascular coiling or surgery. DSA has the added benefit of offering an endovascular treatment and minimal complication rates of 1%. Importantly, studies comparing CTA and DSA indicate strong agreement, suggesting they both provide high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing vasospasm.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an alternative to CTA or DSA for aneurysm detection, especially in patients allergic to iodine. MRA does not expose the patients to radiation, and the time-of-flight sequence does not require contrast. MRA is not very sensitive when done early after symptom onset due to high oxygen concentration in CSF. Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) is 95% sensitive for aneurysms > 3 mm; the main disadvantages are availability, cost, and acquisition time.

### Eyes and stroke: the visual aspects of cerebrovascular disease [^530dd394]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Ocular dysmotility

A high number of patients who had a stroke develop ocular dysmotility or alignment impairment, presenting as diplopia, INO, one-and-a-half syndrome, as palsies/paresis including gaze, saccadic or smooth pursuit. One retrospective study reviewed 220 records of patients with stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI) to determine the oculomotor impairment rate and concluded strabismus and cranial nerve III palsy had the highest rate of occurrence.

Oculomotor nerve injury is characterised by ptosis, gaze palsy, and mydriasis due to denervation to the levator palpebrae superioris, ciliary body, pupillary constrictors, superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique extraocular muscles. Patients with stroke who have a oculomotor palsy often have other neurological findings such as hemiparesis or cerebellar dysfunction. An isolated oculomotor nerve palsy often implies a different mechanism, such as compression or diabetic microvascular injury. When an oculomotor nerve palsy is caused by damage involving the corticospinal tract prior to decussation of fibres in the medulla oblongata, the resultant combination of ipsilateral third nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis is known as Weber's Syndrome, which localises to infarction in the midbrain. A different mechanism of oculomotor palsy, which is vascular but compressive, is aneurysm of the posterior communicating (PComm) artery. An expanding aneurysm in the PComm produces compression to the oculomotor nerve. Because the pupil fibres are external to the ocular motor fibres, compression results in anisocoria with a mydriatic (enlarged) pupil either prior to or concomitant to diplopia and ophthalmoparesis. This is the so-called 'rule of the pupil'. In contrast, microvascular third nerve palsy, which affects the innermost motor fibres preferentially prior to the pupil fibres, should not cause a 'blown pupil' or result in significant anisocoria out of proportion to the motor deficits.

### The eye examination in the evaluation of child abuse – 2023 [^6a979f38]. AAO (2023). High credibility.

AHT consultation timing and nondilated assessment strategies are specified. Because findings such as RH may be transient, it is desirable that the ophthalmologic consultation take place within 24 hours of the patient's presentation for medical care but certainly within 72 hours; when pharmacologic pupillary dilation is believed to be undesirable, timely ophthalmologic consultation is still helpful, and an attempt to view the retina and optic nerve through direct ophthalmoscopy, small pupil indirect ophthalmoscopic techniques, sequential pharmacologic dilation, and/or fast-acting mydriatics (eg, phenylephrine 2.5%) can still yield important information; additionally, pediatricians who suspect a diagnosis of AHT should make a prompt referral to an ophthalmologist, who should be available for prompt evaluation of the patient because important safety and medical issues are dependent on determining an appropriate diagnosis.

### Apraclonidine for the pharmacologic confirmation of acute horner syndrome [^5fe78cc0]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Apraclonidine is the most widely used pharmacologic agent to confirm Horner syndrome. It is a strong α-2 and a weak α-1 adrenergic agonist and reversal of anisocoria is considered a positive test. The utility of apraclonidine in acute Horner syndrome remains controversial as the exact timing for denervation sensitivity to develop remains unknown. The goal of this study was to describe the use of apraclonidine in the diagnosis of acute Horner syndrome in patients with an unequivocal onset within 7 days. We identified 3 patients who were referred to ophthalmology/neuro-ophthalmology service and had reversal of anisocoria within 7 days. Two cases of second-order Horner syndrome after cardiac surgery and a case of a third-order Horner syndrome from a carotid cavernous sinus fistula resulted in reversal of anisocoria 72 h, 48 h, and 5 days after onset. Photographic documentation was provided for all cases. Our results suggest that apraclonidine has utility in the acute period and positive results can be seen as early as 48 h after onset. Apraclonidine should therefore still be considered to confirm the presence of acute Horner syndrome before extensive neuroimaging is performed.

### Clinical reasoning: an 83-year-old female patient with a pupil-involving oculomotor nerve palsy [^5acc00c5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

We report a case of an 83-year-old female patient who presented with binocular diplopia associated with left periorbital pain. She was diagnosed with a left pupil-involving third nerve palsy initially believed to be either microvascular or aneurysmal. However, negative vascular neuroimaging and further serologic workup suggested the possibility of neurosyphilis. Her clinical course was significant for persistent periorbital pain and a new seventh nerve palsy, despite syphilis treatment, prompting repeat neuroimaging and lumbar puncture. This case highlights the importance of the clinical history, imaging, CSF studies, and repeated workup in distinguishing between infectious and noninfectious causes of cranial neuropathies.

### Unilateral fixed dilation of the pupil as a false-localizing sign with intracranial hemorrhage: case report and literature review [^7024670d]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Although other focal signs may prove "false localizing", it is a neurosurgical axiom that unilateral fixed dilation of the pupil occurs ipsilateral to a supratentorial mass.

Clinical Presentation

A 25-year-old man collapsed with a dense right hemiplegia and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6 (eye opening, 1; motor, 4; verbal, 1) after rupture of a left middle cerebral artery aneurysm associated with an intrasylvian hematoma. Initially, both pupils had remained equal-sized and reactive: however, within hours, the right (contralateral) pupil became fixed and dilated (i.e., false localizing). For some time, the left (ipsilateral) pupil remained small and reactive; at emergency craniotomy, this also became fixed and equally dilated.

Intervention

After evacuation of the clot and wrapping of the aneurysm, both pupils rapidly became equal-sized and reactive. Twenty-four hours later, concurrent with massive left hemispheric swelling and a midline shift, the left (ipsilateral) pupil became unilaterally fixed and dilated (i.e., false localizing). Eventually, the right (contralateral) pupil also became fixed and dilated, concurrent with cardiovascular collapse. Death occurred within 10 hours.

Conclusion

Unilateral fixed dilation of the pupil in patients with hemispheric mass lesions may be false localizing. Furthermore, disparate "herniating mechanisms" can arise despite mass effect emanating from the same side. Because such mechanisms cannot be witnessed, their nature remains speculative. An extensive review is contained in this article.

### The red reflex [^8019a21b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Eliciting the red reflex is a useful clinical test that can be easily performed in the pediatric emergency room. A direct ophthalmoscope is the only tool needed to perform this test. The test is non-invasive, making it a quick screening tool for even the most apprehensive child. A normal red reflex can rule out intraocular pathology; an abnormal reflex can indicate need for urgent ophthalmologic referral. The differential diagnoses for an absent (or black) reflex; an abnormally sized, shaped or positioned reflex; leukocoria; as well as a non-homogenous reflex are listed.

### An algorithm for the assessment of facial asymmetry in children with focus on etiology and treatment [^cfc8ead9]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Facial asymmetry is a common referral indication for craniofacial teams but has a wide range of causes. Prompt identification of etiology is critical to treatment, as medical and surgical interventions vary depending on the cause of asymmetry in each patient.

Solution

A standardized diagnostic algorithm.

What We Did That Is New

We developed an algorithm to assist in the diagnostic evaluation of facial asymmetry with a focus on next steps for medically actionable causes.

### Clinical and imaging characteristics, care pathways, and outcomes of traumatic epidural hematomas: a collaborative European neuroTrauma effectiveness research in traumatic brain injury study [^b2b82b35]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The BTF recommendation for nonoperative management was also followed, except for a few early surgeries, mostly targeting non-EDH lesions or EDHs extending into the temporal region. Concomitant ASDHs and/or IPHs were previously identified, as a surgical indication in patients with EDH, postulating a decreased intracranial compliance, additional to their independent pathologic effects. Consequently, EDHs that may otherwise be well-tolerated require more aggressive management and have worse prognosis. In multivariable analyses, larger concomitant ASDH volume was associated with increased likelihood of any early hematoma evacuation and decreased likelihood of early targeted EDH evacuation. Temporal EDH location was also previously recognized as a potential surgical indication,- and had a strong, albeit nonsignificant, association with early targeted EDH evacuation in multivariable analysis.

Despite BTF recommendations for emergency surgery, comatose participants with anisocoria received highly varied acute management. This subgroup, along with the subset of participants for whom no specific BTF recommendations exist (ie, small EDHs and some degree of clinical impairment), might have driven the observed practice variation. Insufficient case-mix adjustment of site effects is possible, despite large R²s of fixed-effects models. The observed variation enables further comparative effectiveness studies, particularly to identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from emerging minimally invasive techniques.

Limitations

CENTER-TBI did not explicitly capture potential lesion prioritizations during surgical decision-making. Moreover, the sample size might be insufficient to definitively assess volume thresholds for surgery in patients with heterogeneous hematomas. We do not claim definitive answers regarding conditional surgical decision-making, let alone their impact on patient outcomes, which was beyond the scope of this work. Without further analysis of outcomes, no conclusions can be drawn based on this work on the effectiveness of acute interventions or the BTF guideline recommendations. Modeling surgical decision-making beyond the acute phase was limited by the lack of detailed information on follow-up scans. Our results, derived from a relatively homogenous White European patient population, treated in neurotrauma referral centers, might have limited generalizability. Treatment-limiting decisions in patients with extremely poor prognosis and patient, family, and/or caregiver management preferences were neither excluded from the analyses nor separately analyzed. Our EDH cohort represents a convenience sample within CENTER-TBI, without prior EDH-specific power calculations. Nonetheless, this study represents one of the largest reported EDH cohorts to date.

### Tonic pupil caused by adenoid cystic carcinoma versus postradiation changes to the ciliary ganglion [^bd70624f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Learning points

A truly isolated tonic pupil is usually a benign finding. The dilated pupil will be more evident in a bright room, reacts poorly to light but briskly to accommodation. The patient must also be evaluated for an oculomotor nerve palsy. In isolated cases with reduced tendon reflexes, this is Adie syndrome.
Patients with a tonic pupil should be assessed for history or signs that might suggest other lesions in the orbit or brain. Here, the history of malignancy and abducens palsy both mandated imaging for a structural cause in the area of the ciliary ganglion.
Separating diffuse tumour infiltration from radiation effects can be difficult with MRI, and when a tissue biopsy is not safe, serial imaging can be important to watch for tumour growth and spread.
