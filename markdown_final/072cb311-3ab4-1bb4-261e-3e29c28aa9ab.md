## Question

A 32-year-old woman presents with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and iron deficiency anemia. She has been on a strict gluten-free diet for the past 6 months after reading about celiac disease online, and reports significant improvement in her symptoms. She was never tested for celiac disease prior to starting the gluten-free diet. Her current celiac serology (IgA anti-tTG and IgG anti-DGP) is negative, and total IgA is normal. Duodenal biopsy shows mild villous blunting (Marsh 2). You are considering how to further evaluate her for celiac disease.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next diagnostic step regarding HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing in this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next diagnostic step regarding HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing in a 32-year-old woman with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, and a 6-month self-initiated gluten-free diet, who now has negative celiac serology and Marsh 2 histology, and how to interpret the results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic dilemma created by a gluten-free diet started before testing. Then, I should verify which guideline scenarios specifically endorse HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing. Next, I will consider the test's performance characteristics and how to interpret positive versus negative results. After that, I should outline the downstream implications, including whether a gluten challenge is needed. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and rationale anchored to high-credibility guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem: she started a gluten-free diet before any diagnostic evaluation, which lowers the sensitivity of both serology and histology, creating a diagnostic uncertainty that cannot be resolved by repeating serology while she remains on a GFD. This is exactly the scenario where HLA testing has a defined role to help rule in or rule out celiac disease when standard tests are confounded by diet, and I need to ensure I cite the right guidance for this situation [^ce787f57] [^89fc61c6].

> Next, I should review which guidelines explicitly address this. The AGA Clinical Practice Update recommends considering HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing to rule out celiac disease in patients with negative serology and histologic changes, in those without serologic confirmation at diagnosis, and in those already on a GFD before testing, which fits this case precisely. Similarly, the ESsCD guideline advises obtaining HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing in patients already on a GFD before testing and in those with discrepant serology and histology, which again matches this presentation. Hold on, I should verify that these are high-credibility sources; yes, both are contemporary, expert updates from major societies [^e90093e6] [^89fc61c6] [^d02aba08].

> I will now examine the test's characteristics so I don't overstate what HLA can do. HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are necessary but not sufficient for celiac disease; their greatest clinical value is a high negative predictive value, meaning that if both DQ2 and DQ8 are absent, celiac disease is essentially excluded and alternative diagnoses should be pursued. Conversely, a positive result supports genetic susceptibility but does not confirm disease, so I need to be careful not to equate positivity with diagnosis without corroborating evidence [^d244daf0] [^2759b843] [^e97dcf8b].

> Let me think about how to interpret results in this context. If HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are negative, I can confidently exclude celiac disease and redirect the workup to other causes of diarrhea, weight loss, and iron deficiency, such as IBD, microscopic colitis, malabsorption, or malignancy. If HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are positive, celiac disease remains possible, but I should confirm with a supervised gluten challenge and repeat serology and biopsy rather than assuming the diagnosis, because diet-related false negatives are common and a structured gluten reintroduction restores diagnostic accuracy [^e90093e6] [^ce787f57] [^6a949d4b].

> Wait, let me verify the practical next steps if HLA is positive. The AGA advises returning the patient to a gluten-containing diet, typically about 3 slices of wheat bread daily for 1 to 3 months, before repeating tTG-IgA and proceeding to duodenal biopsy if serology becomes positive or if symptoms recur, which aligns with ESsCD guidance to perform a gluten challenge when serology is negative but HLA is positive. I should confirm that this approach balances diagnostic yield with patient tolerance, and yes, guidelines emphasize individualized timing and symptom monitoring during the challenge [^ce787f57] [^6a949d4b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about biopsy thresholds. I initially thought Marsh 2 alone might suffice to diagnose celiac disease, but I should double-check that. Marsh 2 reflects intraepithelial lymphocytosis with crypt hyperplasia and is suggestive but not specific for celiac disease; diagnosis still requires integration of serology, histology, and, when needed, HLA and response to gluten withdrawal, so I should not overcall Marsh 2 in isolation, especially with negative serology on a GFD [^2ba9d5d8] [^e4444951].

> Let me synthesize the recommendation. The most appropriate next step is to order HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing now, because she is already on a gluten-free diet with negative serology and only mild histologic changes, and guidelines endorse HLA in this exact scenario to leverage its high negative predictive value. If HLA is negative, celiac disease is excluded and alternative diagnoses should be prioritized. If HLA is positive, proceed with a supervised gluten challenge and then repeat serology with biopsy as indicated to confirm or refute celiac disease, which is the most efficient, evidence-based pathway here [^e90093e6] [^89fc61c6] [^ce787f57].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **order HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing** to assess genetic susceptibility, because the patient is already on a gluten-free diet, which confounds serology and histology [^e90093e6] [^89fc61c6]. If HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are negative, celiac disease is effectively excluded and alternative diagnoses should be pursued [^d244daf0] [^2759b843]. If positive, a **supervised gluten challenge** with repeat serology and biopsy is recommended to confirm celiac disease [^ce787f57] [^6a949d4b]. HLA testing is the key next step here because it retains high negative predictive value even on a gluten-free diet and guides whether further gluten challenge is warranted [^e90093e6] [^d244daf0].

---

## Role of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing in celiac disease diagnosis

HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 are the **primary genetic markers** for celiac disease, present in over 95% of patients; their absence has a negative predictive value near 99%, making a negative result highly useful to exclude celiac disease [^d244daf0] [^2759b843]. However, these alleles are common in the general population (~30–40%), so a positive result is not diagnostic and must be interpreted in clinical context [^d244daf0] [^b98f5e93].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD) provide clear recommendations on **when to use HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing**:

- **AGA 2019**: Consider HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing to rule out celiac disease in patients with negative serology and histologic changes, in those without serologic confirmation at diagnosis, or in those with a historic diagnosis, especially when a gluten-free diet was initiated before testing [^e90093e6] [^111daf50].

- **ESsCD 2019**: Obtain HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing in patients already following a gluten-free diet before testing, in those with discrepant serology and histology, or in those with Marsh 1–2 histology and negative serology [^89fc61c6] [^d02aba08].

---

## Clinical scenario analysis

In this patient, several factors complicate the diagnosis:

- **Self-initiated gluten-free diet**: Serologic tests (tTG-IgA, DGP-IgG) and histology can be falsely negative or attenuated if the patient is already on a gluten-free diet [^ce787f57] [^e90093e6].

- **Negative serology with mild histologic changes**: Marsh 2 histology (mild villous blunting) with negative serology is nonspecific and can be seen in other conditions or even in normal individuals [^2ba9d5d8].

- **Clinical suspicion remains high**: Chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and iron deficiency anemia are classic features of celiac disease, warranting further evaluation [^d240434d].

Given these complexities, **HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing is the most appropriate next step** to assess genetic susceptibility and guide further diagnostic steps [^e90093e6] [^89fc61c6].

---

## Interpretation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 results

The interpretation of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 results is **straightforward**:

| **Hla-dq2/dq8 result** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended next step** |
|-|-|-|
| Negative | Celiac disease is highly unlikely (NPV ~99%) | Pursue alternative diagnoses (e.g. IBD, microscopic colitis, lactose intolerance, SIBO) [^d244daf0] [^2759b843] |
| Positive | Genetic susceptibility confirmed, but not diagnostic | Proceed with a supervised gluten challenge and repeat serology/biopsy to confirm celiac disease [^ce787f57] [^6a949d4b] |

---

## Clinical implications of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing

HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing in this context has **several clinical implications**:

- **Exclusion of celiac disease**: A negative result effectively excludes celiac disease, preventing unnecessary further testing and guiding alternative diagnoses [^d244daf0] [^2759b843].

- **Confirmation of genetic susceptibility**: A positive result supports the possibility of celiac disease but necessitates further confirmatory testing, typically via a gluten challenge and repeat serology/biopsy [^ce787f57] [^6a949d4b].

- **Guidance for dietary management**: If celiac disease is confirmed, a strict lifelong gluten-free diet is recommended; if excluded, the patient can resume a normal diet and pursue other diagnoses [^3e619b1a] [^d240434d].

---

## Alternative diagnostic approaches

If HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing is inconclusive or unavailable, **alternative approaches** include:

- **Gluten challenge**: Supervised reintroduction of gluten (e.g. 3 slices of wheat bread daily for 1–3 months) followed by repeat serology and biopsy [^ce787f57] [^6a949d4b].

- **Advanced serologic testing**: Consider IgA/IgG anti-EMA or newer assays, recognizing limitations in patients already on a gluten-free diet [^notfound].

- **Empiric dietary trial**: Careful monitoring of symptoms and nutritional status if gluten is reintroduced, though this approach carries risks and should be individualized [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's clinical presentation, negative serology, mild histologic changes, and prior initiation of a gluten-free diet, **HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing is the most appropriate next diagnostic step**. A negative result will effectively exclude celiac disease, while a positive result will support further confirmatory testing with a supervised gluten challenge and repeat serology/biopsy. This approach aligns with current guidelines and ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

Celiac disease is a remarkable and common immune-mediated disorder determined by both the presence of characteristic HLA alleles (DQ2 and DQ8) and one of the best characterized environmental factors (gliadin) for any common autoimmune disease. The discovery of transglutaminase autoantibodies and the development of assays for these antibodies has allowed the identification of a large number of asymptomatic individuals with autoimmunity and intestinal biopsy evidence of celiac lesions. Further understanding of the sequelae of asymptomatic celiac disease, and the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, are likely to alter fundamentally both genetic screening for celiac disease and its therapy.

### A clinician's guide to celiac disease HLA genetics [^d244daf0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease is a common inflammatory disease triggered by dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The strongest and best-characterized genetic susceptibilities in celiac disease are class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes known as HLA-DQ2 and DQ8. HLA genetic testing is available through a number of commercial and academic laboratories and is used in the evaluation of celiac disease and to identify at-risk family members. Importantly, HLA genetic testing has a high negative predictive value for celiac disease, but a low positive predictive value. Therefore, for a practicing clinician, it is important to understand when to order HLA genetic testing, what test to order, and how to interpret the result. This review provides a practical primer on HLA genetics in celiac disease.

### Prevalence of haplotype DQ2 / DQ8 and celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes [^5fdecac6]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

In conclusions, it should be stated that patients with T1D are at greater risk of developing other autoimmune diseases. CD is one of the most common autoimmune diseases associated with T1D. Delaying the diagnosis of CD may adversely affect the course of diabetes. Therefore, it is reasonable to perform systematic screenings for the most common comorbid autoimmune diseases, including CD. In questionable cases of CD with discrepant serology and histopathology results, HLA testing may be a useful tool identify the individuals who are at-risk of developing CD and those without genetic predisposition to develop CD. The prevalence of HLA DQ2.5 and the HLA DQ2.5 / HLA DQ8 configuration is higher in patients with T1D, and CD compared to children with T1D alone (p = 0.0220 and p = 0.0045, respectively). The combination of HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 most significantly increases the risk of developing CD. Furthermore, it may be used as a screening test for first-degree relatives of CD or T1D patients, as the incidence of CD among them is higher. HLA DQ2/DQ8 positive individuals would require regular clinical and serological monitoring. Moreover, HLA typing may be considered in genetic counseling to determine the risk of disease. Unfortunately, due to shared genetic predisposition, the group of patients with T1D who will not need routine systematic immunological testing for CD is small. In the remaining cases — in which the HLA DQ2 / DQ8 result is positive — they will require further regular monitoring for the presence of antibodies, especially since most cases are asymptomatic. Therefore, routine HLA typing tests in patients with T1D seems to be unprofitable. However, this requires detailed analyzations based on clinical trials on large groups of patients.

Best Practice Advice 9 states, "Determination of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has a limited role in the diagnosis of CD. Its value is largely related to its negative predictive value to rule out CD in patients who are seronegative in the face of histologic changes, in patients who do not have serologic confirmation at the time of diagnosis, and in those patients with a historic diagnosis of CD; especially as very young children before the introduction of celiac-specific serology".

### High rates of variation in HLA-DQ2 / DQ8 testing for coeliac disease: results from an RCPAQAP pilot program [^c5af6aaa]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

Coeliac disease(CD) is a highly prevalent, gluten-dependent, autoimmune enteropathy. While the diagnosis is based on serological and histological criteria, genotyping of the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) DQ2 and DQ8 has been shown to have substantial clinical utility, especially in excluding the diagnosis in patients who do not carry either antigen. As a result, HLA genotyping is now being performed by more laboratories and has recently become one of the most frequently requested genetic tests in Australia. To date, there has been little scrutiny on the accuracy and reporting of results by laboratories new to HLA typing. In response to clinician feedback that identified potentially clinically significant discrepancies in HLA typing results, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs (RCPAQAP) undertook a pilot study to assess laboratory performance in the detection of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and their associated HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 alleles.

Methods

DNA was extracted from 5 patients and sent to 10 laboratories for external quality assurance (EQA) testing. Laboratories were assessed for reporting in genotyping, interpretation and methodology.

Results

Our findings showed that at least 80% of laboratories underperform with respect to recommended guidelines for HLA typing and reporting for CD, with 40% of laboratories failing to provide any clinical interpretation or full genotyping data. This suboptimal level of reporting may lead to ambiguities for downstream clinical interpretation that may compromise patient management.

Conclusions

These findings highlight the importance of adherence to standardised guidelines for optimal performance and reporting of HLA results and substantiate the need for EQA and proficiency testing for laboratories providing this service.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British society of gastroenterology [^4d485b7e]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Role of HLA in the diagnosis of CD

CD is associated with specific HLA types in virtually all populations in which this has been tested, and is associated with the carriage of the gene pairs that encode DQ2.5 and DQ8. The diagnostic value of HLA genotyping in patients who may have CD revolves around its high negative predictive value, meaning that patients who lack the appropriate HLA genotype pairs described above are very unlikely to have CD. However, the positive predictive value of the HLA genotyping for CD susceptibility is very low as a large proportion of individuals without CD carry either HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 (the prevalence of DQ2 in the general population varies between 0% and 40% while that of DQ8 varies between 0% and 20% between countries). In family screening, DQ2-positive or DQ8-positive relatives (especially siblings) are at a higher risk of CD, with one study suggesting that DQ2 positivity was associated with a 16-fold increased risk of CD among first-degree relatives.

Specific use of HLA typing

HLA genotyping may be used in patients with suspected CD but who fail to respond to a GFD. A negative test in this circumstance would indicate that patients are highly unlikely to have CD (< 1% of patients with CD are negative for DQ2 and DQ8) and thus the clinician can direct diagnostic efforts elsewhere. HLA typing may similarly be used in patients who are self-treated on a GFD and never had appropriate testing for CD before changing their diet. HLA typing may have an adjunctive role to identifying individuals who are not genetically at risk of CD and in whom further evaluation for CD is not necessary, saving a large number of repeated tests for CD in patients who would otherwise have to undergo testing because they have symptoms and a first-degree relative with CD.

Recommendations

HLA typing should be used to rule out CD. A positive DQ2.5 or DQ8 can never confirm the diagnosis. (Grade B)
HLA typing should be used in individuals who are self-treated on a GFD and never had appropriate testing for CD before changing their diet. (Grade B)
HLA typing can be used to rule out CD, and minimise future testing, in high-risk individuals with CD, for example, first-degree relatives. (Grade B)

### Prevalence of haplotype DQ2 / DQ8 and celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes [^35996bae]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD) coexist very often. Identification of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 can confirm the genetic predisposition to CD. Negative result of this test allows to exclude CD with a high probability. It was suggested that in individuals with higher risk of CD, including T1D patients, the implementation of genetic testing should reduce the number of patients requiring systematic immunological screening. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of different haplotypes predisposing to CD in children and adolescents with previously diagnosed T1D. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 166 T1D children (91 girls) in whom HLA DQ2/DQ8 alleles were tested. In 9.6% CD was also diagnosed. Results: In 12.7% both HLA DQ2/DQ8 were negative. In 87.3% patients HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 was positive, including 27.7% patients with both haplotypes DQ2.5 and DQ8 positive. In all CD patients the disease predisposing alleles were positive, while none of the HLA DQ2/DQ8 negative children were diagnosed with CD. Conclusions: The prevalence of HLA DQ2.5 and the HLA DQ2.5 / HLA DQ8 configuration is higher in patients with T1D, and CD compared to children with T1D alone. The combination of HLA DQ2 and HLA DQ8 most significantly increases the risk of developing CD. The group of HLA DQ2/DQ8 negative patients with improbable CD diagnosis, is relatively small. Most of T1D patients HLA DQ2/DQ8 positive need further regular antibody assessment. In patients with T1D, who are at high risk of developing CD, genetic testing may be considered to select those who require further systematic serological evaluation. Due to its retrospective nature, the study was not registered in the database of clinical trials and the Clinical trial registration number is not available.

Best Practice Advice 1 — confirmation of initial celiac disease diagnosis states that in patients suspected to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings; if the prior diagnostic workup was equivocal or discrepant, testing for the celiac disease–associated HLA haplotypes DQ2 or DQ8 can be considered, and seronegative celiac disease can occur with the diagnosis established by a clinical and histologic response to the gluten-free diet in patients with consistent pathology and compatible HLA haplotypes.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^c658375f]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that is induced by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. It has a prevalence of approximately 1% in many populations worldwide. New diagnoses have increased substantially, owing to increased awareness, better diagnostic tools, and probable real increases in incidence. The breadth of recognized clinical presentations continues to expand, making the disorder highly relevant to all physicians. Newer diagnostic tools, including serologic tests for antibodies against tissue transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide, greatly facilitate diagnosis. Tests for celiac-permissive HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules are useful in defined clinical situations. Celiac disease is diagnosed by histopathologic examination of duodenal biopsy specimens. However, according to recent controversial guidelines, a diagnosis can be made without a biopsy in certain circumstances, especially in children. Symptoms, mortality, and risk for malignancy each can be reduced by adherence to a gluten-free diet. This treatment is a challenge, however, because the diet is expensive, socially isolating, and not always effective in controlling symptoms or intestinal damage. Hence, there is increasing interest in developing nondietary therapies.

HLA genetics in suspected seronegative celiac disease (CeD) — testing and interpretation: in cases of suspected seronegative CeD, genetic testing should be performed to determine whether the patient carries an HLA genotype (DQ2 or DQ8) that is compatible with developing CeD, and it is well described that up to 30% of the population can carry 1 or both of these genes, and yet only 2%–3% will develop CeD; HLA testing is most helpful for patients if results are negative, as this excludes seronegative CeD, and in patients who have initiated a GFD with severe symptoms a negative result for HLA DQ2 and DQ8 would confirm that CeD is not present; clinicians should carefully evaluate for HLA DQ2.5 (DQA1✱0501, DQB1✱0201), HLA DQ8 (DQA1✱03, DQB1✱0302), HLA DQ2.2 (DQA1✱0201, DQB1✱0202) and HLA DQ7.5 (DQA1✱05, DQB1✱0301) and review whether half heterodimers are present, and it is prudent that specialists review all alleles tested because laboratories might not report all possible CeD-associated alleles.

### Celiac disease risk stratification based on HLA-DQ heterodimer (HLA-DQA1 ~ DQB1) typing in a large cohort of adults with suspected celiac disease [^e727081b]. Human Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Backgrounds

Patients with celiac disease (CeD) carry the major histocompatibility complex class II, HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype; the absence of these haplotypes excludes a diagnosis of CeD. While the most common and highest risk HLA haplotypes in CeD have been established, the risk profiles of the less common and equivocal HLA haplotypes need further refinement. The aim of this study was to use a large national patient cohort to further stratify the risk gradient of HLA-DQ haplotypes.

Methods

The study cohort included 24,339 adult patients with suspected CeD and immunoglobulin (Ig)A sufficiency (total IgA ≥ 70 mg/dL) whose samples were assessed at Mayo Clinic Laboratories for HLA-DQ genotyping, total IgA, and tissue transglutaminase (tTG)-IgA. Data from a subset of the patients who had duodenal biopsies were analyzed to determine the risk gradient of CeD. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the risk gradient and to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for being positive to CeD serology according to different HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 heterodimers.

Results

Of the 24,339 patients, 55% (n = 13,456) expressed HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 heterodimers. Compared with patients who had non-permissive HLA-DQ heterodimers, patients who had HLA-DQ2 homozygosity (HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5, HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.2, or HLA-DQ2.2/DQ2.2) showed increased odds for tTG-IgA positivity (OR = 96.9; 95% CI, 58.3–147.9). Interestingly, the odds for patients who were compound heterozygous for HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 were similar to those for HLA-DQ2.5 heterozygotes. However, a single HLA-DQ2.2 haplotype (without HLA-DQ8, DQ2.2 heterozygous) was not associated with tTG-IgA positivity. These findings were confirmed in a subset of patients (n = 738) who had duodenal biopsies performed in addition to CeD serologic testing.

Discussion

This large national reference laboratory cohort study demonstrated that HLA-DQ2.2 heterozygous is not associated with positive tTG-IgA serology, suggesting the reclassification of this haplotype as non-permissive for CeD.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease-changing utility of serology and histologic measures: expert review [^d6558aa9]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Celiac disease genetics — HLA-DQ2/DQ8 utility: CD is strongly influenced by genetic factors with most dependence residing in HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8; a gene dose effect is present in which HLA-DQ2.5 in a homozygous pattern makes CD likely, whereas heterozygous HLA-DQ2.2 makes CD unlikely. The absence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has primarily been used to exclude the disease with a high negative predictive value; however, in clinical practice determination of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 is of no additional diagnostic value in cases with a high level of serum TG2-IgA antibodies.

### The frequency of HLA-DQ7 in patients at risk of coeliac disease: a haplotype to be reckoned with for screening? [^6c6c02f9]. Human Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 carriers are genetically predisposed to develop coeliac disease (CD). Testing negative for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 has a high negative predictive value. Full HLA-DQ genotyping as well as tests only typing for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are therefore used for screening at-risk populations. However, HLA-DQ7 positive and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative CD patients have been described in various populations. In this study we examine the relevance for HLA-DQ7 typing in a large at-risk CD population. The HLA-DQ status of all paediatric and adult patients at-risk of CD that were typed in a tertiary medical centre laboratory between 2012 and 2016 (n = 3983) was obtained. HLA-DQ7 (HLA-DQB1✱03:01) positive and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative patients were selected. We gathered information on serology, histology and dietary status, and CD diagnosis. In total, 489/3983 patients were HLA-DQ7-positive and HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative, and after exclusion (missing data on diet or serology/histology), 325 were included. Only one adult patient was diagnosed with CD, based on a duodenal biopsy and a clinical response to a gluten-free diet. Homozygosity was observed in 14.8%. Based on the current cohort additional typing of HLA-DQ7 does not seem relevant for screening at-risk populations for CD in the Netherlands. It should be considered in patients with a high suspicion of CD.

Regarding specific circumstances for celiac disease, more specifically with respect to pediatric and adolescent patients, evaluation, ESsCD 2019 guidelines recommend to consider diagnosing CD without duodenal biopsy in symptomatic pediatric patients with high anti-tissue transglutaminase levels (> 10 times the ULN) and endomysial antibodies in the presence of HLA-DQ2/DQ8. Confirm the diagnosis by an antibody decline and preferably a clinical response to a gluten-free diet.

### Celiac disease diagnosis: simple rules are better than complicated algorithms [^2924c844]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is the only treatable autoimmune disease, provided that a correct diagnosis is achieved and a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet is implemented. The current diagnostic algorithm for celiac disease includes initial screening serological tests, followed by a confirmatory small intestinal biopsy showing the autoimmune insult typical of celiac disease. The biopsy, considered the diagnostic gold standard, has been recently questioned as a reliable and conclusive test for every case. Indeed, the wide variability of celiac disease-related findings suggests that it is difficult to conceptualize the diagnostic process into rigid algorithms that do not always cover the clinical complexity of this disease. Instead we find clinically useful the shifting to a quantitative approach that can be defined as the "4 out of 5" rule: the diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed if at least 4 of the following 5 criteria are satisfied: typical symptoms of celiac disease; positivity of serum celiac disease immunoglobulin, A class autoantibodies at high titer; human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or DQ8 genotypes; celiac enteropathy at the small bowel biopsy; and response to the gluten-free diet.

### Celiac disease: ten things that every gastroenterologist should Know [^c73efba3]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

There are 10 things that all gastroenterologists should know about celiac disease (CD). (1) The immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase is the single best serologic test to use for the detection of CD. (2) CD can be recognized endoscopically, and water immersion enhances villi detection, although a normal endoscopic appearance does not preclude the diagnosis. (3) It is recommended that 4 biopsies be taken from the second part of the duodenum and 2 bulb biopsies be taken at the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions to maximize the sensitivity for histologic confirmation of CD. (4) Consider serologic testing of first-degree relatives, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, Down's, Turner's, and Williams' syndromes, as well as those with premature osteoporosis, iron deficiency, abnormal liver biochemistries, and other manifestations of CD. (5) Patients already on a prolonged gluten-free diet (GFD) should be tested for the presence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8, thereby avoiding the need for further evaluation of CD in non-allelic carriers. (6) The basic treatment of CD is a strict, lifelong GFD, enabled by an expert dietitian. (7) Newly diagnosed adults with CD should be assessed for micronutrient deficiencies (iron, B12, folate, zinc, copper), fat soluble vitamin deficiencies (vitamin D), and bone densitometry. (8) All patients diagnosed with CD should have clinical follow-up to ensure response and adherence to a GFD. (9) In those with persistent or relapsing symptoms, the robustness of the original diagnosis should be reviewed, gluten exposure sought, and a systematic evaluation for alternative and associated diseases performed. (10) Evaluate those with refractory disease for malignant transformation.

### HLA-DQ genotyping combined with serological markers for the diagnosis of celiac disease: is intestinal biopsy still mandatory? [^0afd600b]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 allelic genotyping combined with serologic testing for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CD).

Patients and Methods

One hundred seventy children, who underwent jejunal biopsy for digestive symptoms or malnutrition, were tested for HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and serologic markers (tTG and/or anti-endomysial antibodies). Children were classified in 2 groups, according to jejunal histology: group 1, when partial or total villous atrophy was associated with an increased intraepithelial lymphocytosis suggesting CD, and group 2, when these histological criteria were absent.

Results

Eight children were excluded from the study because their intestinal histology was not informative; 82 children were classified in group 1 and 80 in group 2. Eighty-one of 82 children in group 1 were positive for HLA and serologic testing. The other child had negative HLA and serologic testing but marked villous atrophy, and further investigation showed an allergic disease. Among the 80 children in group 2, 53 were negative for both HLA and serologic testing, 22 were positive for HLA but negative for serologic testing, 2 were negative for HLA and positive for serologic testing, and 3 patients were positive for both HLA and serologic testing. The last 3 children were shown to have an autoimmune background and had probably a latent form of CD. The association of HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and serologic markers had a sensitivity of 98.8%, a specificity of 96.2%, a positive likelihood ratio of 26.3, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.013.

Conclusions

The association of positive HLA-DQ2/DQ8 and serologic testing has a high predictive value for CD. We suggest that symptomatic children with high titers of immunoglobulin (Ig)A tTG could be diagnosed as patients with CD without performing jejunal biopsy. In other children, HLA-DQ2/DQ8 could be useful to exclude the diagnosis of CD if negative. In cases of low IgA tTG titers or in patients with IgA deficiency, intestinal biopsy remains mandatory.

### A novel serogenetic approach determines the community prevalence of celiac disease and informs improved diagnostic pathways [^d41f3420]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It is not uncommon for patients suspected of having celiac disease (CD) to be reluctant to undergo definitive testing by small bowel biopsy. By contrast, an online community survey of randomly selected Australians indicated that 28% of adults monitor their dietary gluten intake, with 4% avoiding it altogether, 5% strictly controlling intake, and a further 18% loosely controlling consumption (Coeliac Australia, personal communication). Despite the current popularity of gluten-free food, it is unclear what proportion of the community with CD is diagnosed or remains unrecognized.

Over the past 20 years or more, widely implemented expert guidelines have recommended that diagnosis of CD should be based on small bowel histology showing villous atrophy and confirmed by symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and/or intestinal histology showing improvement with exclusion of dietary gluten. However, several developments have challenged this definition. Recently the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Working Group on Coeliac Disease Diagnosis proposed that CD should be redefined as 'an immune-mediated systemic disorder elicited by gluten and related prolamines in genetically susceptible individuals, characterized by the presence of a variable combination of gluten-dependent clinical manifestations, CD-specific antibodies, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes, and enteropathy'. The ESPGHAN Working Group also concluded CD is frequently difficult to recognize 'because of the variation in presentation and intensity of symptoms and signs, and many cases may actually occur without symptoms'. Consequently, a new approach to the diagnosis of CD has recently been published, in which for the first time, HLA-DQ genotyping was included as the initial step in testing for CD in patients who are considered at risk of CD, but do not have the typical symptoms. In many countries with sophisticated healthcare such as the USA and most of Europe, by far the majority of patients with CD in the community remain undiagnosed and do not present to their physicians with the so-called 'typical' digestive symptoms. However, patients presenting in primary care and in many sub-specialty clinics frequently have symptoms and co-morbidities that raise the possibility of CD, or might have adopted a gluten-free diet without prior assessment for CD. Even if physicians were more aware of the diverse clinical presentations of CD and the availability of new serological and genetic tests, it is not yet clear how to efficiently and cost-effectively assess the possibility of CD in patients without typical gastrointestinal symptoms.

### HLA-DQ genetics in children with celiac disease: a meta-analysis suggesting a two-step genetic screening procedure starting with HLA-DQ β chains [^9450da29]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

BackgroundSpecific HLA-DQ genes have been recognized as necessary - but not sufficient - factors for the occurrence of Celiac Disease (CD). Through a meta-analysis, evaluating the distribution of CD-related HLA genotypes in children, we aimed at providing insights for a potential widened screening strategy. MethodsAfter a systematic search on the association between class II HLA genes and CD in children, 46 publications were obtained and assessed for eligibility. A total of 13 eligible studies were submitted to data extraction and analysis (10 case-control studies and 3 cohort studies). Case-control studies collectively enrolled 740 CD patients and 943 controls. ResultsIn the population-stratified analysis, the following alleles conferred a significantly increased risk for CD: HLA-DQB1✱02 (odds ratio [OR] = 10.28) and HLA-DQB1✱03:02 (OR = 2.24). By drafting a risk gradient to develop CD according to HLA genetic background, the highest risk is confirmed to exist for DQ2/DQ2 homozygous subjects, regardless of the ethnicities (OR = 5.4). Actually, the genotype DQ2/β2 showed basically the same risk (OR = 5.3). Indeed, no differences have been found in CD risk between DQ2/β2 and DQ2/DQ2, as well as between DQ8/β2 and DQ2/DQ8, and between β2/DQX and DQ2/X. ConclusionThe HLA-DQB1✱02:01 allele is present in more than 90% CD children. In the perspective of a widened pediatric population screening for CD, a double-step process might be suggested: HLA-DQB1✱02:01 might be investigated first and, only if this result is positive, children might be candidate for a prospective serologic screening, as a second step.

### Prevalence of haplotype DQ2 / DQ8 and celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes [^b384c711]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Only about 1% of people with CD do not have HLA DQ2 or DQ8, therefore it is believed that the absence of HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8 antigens virtually excludes the diagnosis of CD. In HLA DQ2/DQ8-negative CD patients, false negative results should be excluded, which may result from insufficiently detailed examination aimed at identifying less frequent alleles predisposing to CD. If the results of genetic tests (HLA DQ2/DQ8- negative) do not correlate with the results of histopathological tests of the duodenal biopsies (positive for CD), it indicates the necessity of re-evaluation of the pathologist at the reference center in order to verify the result and exclude the initially false positive result. All our patients with a dual diagnosis show the presence of HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 alleles. In the already cited study by Hansen et al. in one patient (out of thirty-three subjects) with a histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis of CD, none of the predisposing alleles were found. Most studies indicate that patients with CD without genetic markers, however, meet the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. It is assumed that in these patients atrophy of intestinal villi is rather associated with factors other than gluten toxicity, e.g. recurrent diarrhea, and the initial diagnosis was incorrect. It should be noted that none of our patients had the classic symptoms of CD, while the symptoms reported by the parents were constipation, recurrent "unexplained" hypoglycemia episodes and deterioration in glycemic control. Our observations are consistent with reports in the literature-the authors of the current ESPGHAN guidelines for the diagnosis of CD point out that the occurrence of constipation in the course of CD is reported almost as often as diarrhea. According to the APC classification (age at diagnosis, presentation, complications) the typical symptoms of celiac disease include chronic diarrhea, malnutrition or malabsorption, failure to thrive and short stature, therefore constipation and poor glycemic control were not considered to be symptoms of classic celiac disease. It is important to point out that the classical CD classification is being questioned nowadays. A review by Caio et al. shows that symptoms considered 'classic' occurred only in approximately 27% of patients with CD. The authors proposed therefore the following classification: gastrointestinal, extraintestinal, subclinical, potential, seronegative, non-responsive, and refractory, however the symptoms may coexist. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that currently there is no single division of celiac disease, therefore constipation, as well as deterioration of metabolic control in concomitant T1D, may be considered non-classical symptoms of CD. Metabolic control and anthropometric parameters were comparable in children with a dual diagnosis of T1D and CD to the group of children with T1D only.

### European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition guidelines for the diagnosis of coeliac disease [^6d8d5a68]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Diagnostic criteria for coeliac disease (CD) from the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) were published in 1990. Since then, the autoantigen in CD, tissue transglutaminase, has been identified; the perception of CD has changed from that of a rather uncommon enteropathy to a common multiorgan disease strongly dependent on the haplotypes human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8; and CD-specific antibody tests have improved.

Methods

A panel of 17 experts defined CD and developed new diagnostic criteria based on the Delphi process. Two groups of patients were defined with different diagnostic approaches to diagnose CD: children with symptoms suggestive of CD (group 1) and asymptomatic children at increased risk for CD (group 2). The 2004 National Institutes of Health/Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality report and a systematic literature search on antibody tests for CD in paediatric patients covering the years 2004 to 2009 was the basis for the evidence-based recommendations on CD-specific antibody testing.

Results

In group 1, the diagnosis of CD is based on symptoms, positive serology, and histology that is consistent with CD. If immunoglobulin A anti-tissue transglutaminase type 2 antibody titers are high (> 10 times the upper limit of normal), then the option is to diagnose CD without duodenal biopsies by applying a strict protocol with further laboratory tests. In group 2, the diagnosis of CD is based on positive serology and histology. HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 testing is valuable because CD is unlikely if both haplotypes are negative.

Conclusions

The aim of the new guidelines was to achieve a high diagnostic accuracy and to reduce the burden for patients and their families. The performance of these guidelines in clinical practice should be evaluated prospectively.

### Human leukocyte antigen DQ2.2 and celiac disease [^90150878]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with celiac disease (CD) lacking both human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2.5 in cis (DQA1✱05:01, DQB1✱02:01) or trans (DQA1✱05:05, DQB1✱02:02) configuration and HLA-DQ8 (DQA1✱03:01, DQB1✱03:02) are considered to be rare. Therefore, absence of these genotypes is commonly used to exclude the diagnosis of CD. To investigate whether this approach is justified, the HLA-distribution in 155 children with CD was studied. A total of 139 (89.7%) patients carried HLA-DQ2.5. Of the remaining patients, 7 (4.5%) carried HLA-DQ8. Interestingly, the 9 (5.8%) patients lacking HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 carried HLA-DQA1✱02:01 and -DQB1✱02:02 (HLA-DQ2.2). Therefore, HLA-DQ2.2 should be included as an important HLA-type related to CD.

### Screening for celiac disease in 1st degree relatives: a 10-year follow-up study [^cf651532]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

HLA typing for DQ2/DQ8 alleles has been suggested as a second step in previously serologically negative FDRs to limit the number of subjects for serologic follow-up, since HLA typing is an efficient tool to discriminate individuals who will regularly require clinical and serological control. The negative predictive value of HLA typing is high due to the fact that gluten intolerance rarely occurs in the absence of HLA-predisposing alleles. Although several PCR kits for HLA sampling are currently available at a relatively lower cost, their use is not yet covered by the Brazilian Unified National Health System, and this fact drastically reduces its practicality in extensive screening programs in our country.

Studies on prevalence of CD among FDRs of celiac patients have shown significant variability, probably secondary to differences on methods of diagnosis (biopsy vs. serologic testing) and country of study. A systematic review performed by Dubé et al. disclosed an estimated prevalence of CD in FDRs undergoing intestinal biopsy of 16%. On the other hand, considering that CD is a dynamic process and the risk of developing the disease is spread over time, it is expected that FDRs will show not only an increased prevalence but also an increased incidence of the disorder. Several studies have focused on this topic and it has been estimated that between 1.6 and 6.6% of previously serologically negative FDRs, may seroconvert within a range of 0.5 to 20 years resulting in an annual incidence ranging from 0.3 to 1.7.

### A novel serogenetic approach determines the community prevalence of celiac disease and informs improved diagnostic pathways [^fdb6157d]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community prevalence of celiac disease HLA-DQ susceptibility genotypes

In the female and male cohorts recruited from the community, 55.9% and 55.7% of genotyped subjects, respectively, were genetically susceptible to CD because they were positive for HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2. The proportions of the genotyped women and men positive for HLA-DQ2.5 were virtually identical: 24.3% versus 24.7%, respectively. Subjects negative for HLA-DQ2.5 but positive for HLA-DQ8 accounted for 15.7% of women and 16.1% of men; and subjects who were negative for both HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 but positive for HLA-DQ2.2 represented 16.0% of women and 15.0% of men. Accordingly, the RR for HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2 in patients with CD compared with community subjects was 1.80 (95% CI 1.71 to 1.90) for women and 1.82 (95% CI 1.71 193) for men (Table 1).

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease-changing utility of serology and histologic measures: expert review [^02d20e43]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Celiac disease diagnostic pathway — biopsy avoidance in symptomatic children and at-risk patients is outlined as a "Suggested biopsy-avoiding diagnostic pathway for coeliac disease". For symptomatic patients with high serologic titers, "If the antibody titer is above ×10 upper limit of normal in a symptomatic patient, the guidelines give the option to perform further tests (TG2-IgA, EMA, and HLA-DQ2/DQ8) in a second blood sample", and "If they are all confirmative, the child may be diagnosed with CD provided symptoms subside after the institution of a GFD", which "may reduce the need of EGD by 30% to 50%". The flow includes branches such as "TG2-IgA > 10xULN, IgA normal" and "Biopsy: Histology positive (Marsh ≥ 2)", while for asymptomatic or at-risk children, "A positive anti-TG2 result should lead to biopsies and histological analysis for diagnosis", and "Potential coeliac disease suggests further follow-up". When diagnosis is sought after self-initiated diet change, "we suggest that the patient goes back on a normal diet with 3 slices of wheat bread daily for 1 to 3 months followed by TG2-IgA determination".

### HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genetic markers and clinical presentation in celiac disease [^72ea672c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with celiac disease are diagnosed at any age and can exhibit a wide range of clinical manifestations. The reasons for this are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genetic markers and clinical features of celiac disease.

Methods

A total of 133 patients with celiac disease were tested for the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes. Their corresponding allele and haplotype frequency distributions were estimated from the phenotypes found. The results were correlated with data from the clinical records.

Results

The DQ2 molecule was found in 93% of the patients, and DQ2 or DQ8 was found in 98%. The DQA1✱0201-DQB1✱0202 haplotype showed strong linkage disequilibrium. DQ2 homozygosis was significantly associated with female sex, earlier age at diagnosis, and shorter delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Double-dose DQB1✱02 (01–02) allele was more frequent in patients with the classic presentation of the disease.

Conclusions

The genetic markers investigated may prove useful for diagnosing and managing celiac disease. With some clinical variables, correlations not previously described were found. These correlations have a moderate strength and, therefore, must be confirmed by other studies.

### A comprehensive review of celiac disease / gluten-sensitive enteropathies [^b98f5e93]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease is a complex immune-mediated gluten-sensitive enteropathy with protean clinical manifestations. It is manifest in genetically predisposed individuals who ingest gluten in varying amounts. In broad terms, it is thought to affect 1% of the population in the USA. More specifically, the prevalence increases drastically from 1:133 in patients not-at-risk, to 1:56 in symptomatic patients, to 1:39 in patients with a second-degree relative with the diagnosis, and to 1:22 in patients with a first-degree relative with the diagnosis. It may be associated with several immune-mediated phenomena, autoimmune diseases, and complicated by vitamin and other trace element deficiencies, bone disease, and malignancy. Our understanding of celiac disease has evolved rapidly over the past two decades. This has led to several lines of enquiry on the condition and potential treatment options. More recently, several entities including gluten intolerance, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, and seronegative celiac disease have been described. These conditions are distinct from allergies or intolerance to wheat or wheat products. There are challenges in defining some of these entities since a large number of patients self-report these conditions. The absence of confirmatory diagnostic tests poses an added dilemma in distinguishing these entities. The differences in spectrum of symptoms and highlights of the variability between the pediatric and adult populations have been studied in some detail. The role of screening for celiac disease is examined in both the general population and "at risk" populations. Diagnostic strategies including the best available serologic testing, utility of HLA haplotypes DQ2 and DQ8 which are seen in over 90% of patients with celiac disease as compared with approximately 40% of the general population, and endoscopic evaluation are also reviewed. Comprehensive nutritional management after diagnosis is key to sustained health in patients with celiac disease. Simple algorithms for care based on a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach are proposed. Refractory and non-responsive celiac diseases in the setting of a gluten-free diet are examined as are novel non-dietary therapies. Finally, the association of other disease states including psychiatric illness, infertility, lymphoproliferative malignancy, and mortality is explored with special attention paid to autoimmune and atopic disease.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^e4444951]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The gold standard for CD diagnosis is represented by the combination of mucosal changes detected by duodenal biopsy and by positivity of serological tests (anti-tTG antibodies, anti-endomysium antibodies (EmA), and deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies). Despite the progress made in serology, no antibody test currently available provides a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (Table 3), thus requiring intestinal biopsy as a key adjunct for establishing a correct diagnosis. Pediatric patients with high titers (over 10 times the cut-off) of anti-tTG antibodies, detectable EmA, HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positivity, and signs/symptoms suggestive of CD may skip duodenal biopsy as recommended by recent guidelines by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Although a large multicenter European study showed diagnostic accuracy of ESPGHAN criteria in identifying CD in children, it should be pointed out that these criteria are not followed worldwide. In fact, in some countries such as the USA, ESPGHAN criteria are not recommended because of the poor reproducibility of the anti-tTG assays. Both advantages and disadvantages exist to biopsy for children with suspected celiac disease; however, most pediatric cases, especially those with low to medium anti-tTG2 titers, require histopathological assessment to confirm celiac disease diagnosis. In a recent study, Fuchs et al. showed that the combination of anti-tTG (over 10 times the cut-off), EmA, and HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8 positivity (triple criteria) had a good accuracy across the range of pre-test probabilities in detecting adult patients with CD. Nonetheless, duodenal biopsy still represents a pillar in the diagnosis of adult patients with suspected CD.

Regarding specific circumstances for celiac disease, more specifically with respect to patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity, ESsCD 2019 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining serologic and HLA-DQ testing (to rule out CD if negative) and perform small bowel histology (while the patient is on a gluten-containing diet) to differentiate between CD and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.

### Influence of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 on severity in celiac disease [^73fda713]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

HLA-DQB1✱02 homozygosity was shown to be more common in patients with complicated rather than uncomplicated celiac disease (CD).

Goals

To study HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 profile in adult patients with different forms of CD, including patients with complicated and potential CD, the most affected and the most preserved histologic end of the pathologic celiac spectrum.

Study

HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 molecular typing was performed in 218 adult CD patients (169 with uncomplicated CD, 27 with complicated CD, and 22 with potential CD) and 224 healthy stem cell donors. HLA-DQA1 and DQB1 gene polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primers and/or reverse polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotides techniques.

Results

As expected, the frequency of HLA-DQB1✱02 allele, DQB1✱02 homozygosity, and DQB1✱0302 gene were statistically different in the 4 groups. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with potential CD have a higher frequency of both HLA-DQB1✱0302 and HLA-DQB1✱0603 alleles and a reduced frequency of DQB1✱02 homozygosity compared with patients with uncomplicated and complicated CD.

Conclusions

The increased frequency of DQB1✱0302 and the reduced frequency of DQB1✱02 homozygosity in potential CD is consistent with the idea that different clinical/pathologic evolutions might be related to different immunogeneses. This could be clinically relevant in the future.

### HLA-DQ2 and-DQ8 genotype frequency in Syrian celiac disease children: HLA-DQ relative risks evaluation [^61b9cf89]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The highest HLA-DQB relative risk for CD development was found in patients carriers DQ2.5/DQ8 genotype (1/10), while, the patients carriers of DQ2.5/DQ2.5 or DQ2.5/DQ2.2 genotype had a relative risk about 1/12.5 and 1/20 respectively (Table 2).

Based on the Marsh Score, forty-two of 49 CD patients with biopsy result were classified into Marsh I, Marsh II and Marsh III as indicated in Table 3.

The frequency of the patients with mild form of CD (Marsh I) carrying DQ2 allele was 9.5%, whereas, the frequency was 23.8% for the patients with Marsh II having DQ2. While, 26 patients from 42 (52.4%) were classified into Marsh III, 22 out of them carrying DQ2 allele, all this results indicated the involvement of DQ2 allele in the severity of mucosal damage (Table 3).

Seropositive with normal histology — patients with positive celiac antibodies and normal histology represent potential celiac disease; HLA typing may be helpful and if negative for both the HLA DQ2 and DQ8 risk alleles, CD is highly unlikely; when biopsy remains nondiagnostic but CD is probable, it may be necessary to resort to a gluten challenge with repeat biopsy at some time in the future, and those with potential CD who are asymptomatic and choose not to exclude gluten should be studied with repeat testing if symptoms later develop.

### Celiac disease diagnosis: simple rules are better than complicated algorithms [^c2e6da36]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for celiac disease (four out of five rule)" for celiac disease and chronic diarrhea.

The diagnostic criteria for celiac disease, often referred to as the "four out of five rule", is a clinical tool designed to aid in the accurate diagnosis of this autoimmune disorder. The criteria are based on five key components: typical symptoms of celiac disease such as chronic diarrhea, growth faltering or weight loss, and iron-deficiency anemia; positive serum celiac disease-specific IgA class antibodies at high titer; presence of HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 genotypes; celiac enteropathy on small intestinal biopsy; and response to a gluten-free diet.

The diagnosis of celiac disease is confirmed if four out of these five criteria are met. Specifically, the conditions for diagnosis include the presence of typical symptoms, positive serum antibodies, HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 genotypes, and celiac enteropathy on biopsy, along with a response to a gluten-free diet. Alternatively, the diagnosis can be confirmed in the absence of positive serum antibodies if the other four criteria are met.

The criteria also allow for the identification of different forms of celiac disease. Seronegative celiac disease can be diagnosed in the absence of positive serum antibodies if the patient exhibits typical symptoms, has the relevant genotypes, shows celiac enteropathy on biopsy, and responds to a gluten-free diet. Non-classic celiac disease can be diagnosed in the absence of typical symptoms if the other four criteria are met. Non-responsive celiac disease is diagnosed if all criteria except response to a gluten-free diet are met, while potential celiac disease is diagnosed if all criteria except celiac enteropathy on biopsy are met.

The diagnostic criteria for celiac disease provide a comprehensive framework for the diagnosis and classification of this condition, facilitating accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

The process examines potential celiac disease in a patient using a set of established criteria. These criteria, selected from predefined options, include:

- Typical symptoms like chronic diarrhea, growth faltering or weight loss, and iron-deficiency anemia
- Presence of specific IgA antibodies at high levels
- Having HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 genotypes
- Evidence of celiac enteropathy on a small intestinal biopsy
- Positive response to a gluten-free diet

The evaluation uses combinations of these criteria according to the "four out of five rule" to interpret whether celiac disease is present. Each unique combination of selected criteria informs a specific diagnosis:

- **CD diagnosed**: When all five criteria are satisfied or if the selection includes criteria related to symptoms, antibodies, biopsy, and response to diet.
- **Seronegative CD**: Detected when signs, gene markers, biopsy result, and dietary response are present, despite no antibody indication.
- **Non-classic CD**: Identified with antibodies, gene markers, biopsy results, and dietary response, without the typical symptoms.
- **Non-responsive CD**: When typical symptoms, antibodies, gene markers, and biopsy outcomes are observed, but dietary response isn't considered.
- **Potential CD**: Suggested when symptoms, antibodies, gene markers, and dietary response demonstrate possible celiac predisposition, without biopsy confirmation.

A summary of diagnostic rules is:

| **Combination** | **Result** |
|-|-|
| All criteria (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) or 1, 2, 3, 5 | CD diagnosed |
| 1, 3, 4, 5 | Seronegative CD |
| 2, 3, 4, 5 | Non-classic CD |
| 1, 2, 3, 4 | Non-responsive CD |
| 1, 2, 3, 5 | Potential CD |

This method determines the patient's celiac disease status by aligning the selected criteria with these specific categories, thereby deducing the appropriate diagnosis or whether criteria are unmet.

European guidelines — nonbiopsy diagnosis of celiac disease could be considered in some circumstances, with an option to forego a duodenal biopsy in children with classic symptoms of CD when tTG-IgA > 10 times the ULN, a positive EMA-IgA is present on a separate blood sample, and the presences of HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8 haplotype are met.

### A novel serogenetic approach determines the community prevalence of celiac disease and informs improved diagnostic pathways [^d82b673a]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Changing perspectives on the natural history of celiac disease (CD), new serology and genetic tests, and amended histological criteria for diagnosis cast doubt on past prevalence estimates for CD. We set out to establish a more accurate prevalence estimate for CD using a novel serogenetic approach.

Methods

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genotype was determined in 356 patients with 'biopsy-confirmed' CD, and in two age-stratified, randomly selected community cohorts of 1,390 women and 1,158 men. Sera were screened for CD-specific serology.

Results

Only five 'biopsy-confirmed' patients with CD did not possess the susceptibility alleles HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2, and four of these were misdiagnoses. HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2 was present in 56% of all women and men in the community cohorts. Transglutaminase (TG)-2 IgA and composite TG2/deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) IgA/IgG were abnormal in 4.6% and 5.6%, respectively, of the community women and 6.9% and 6.9%, respectively, of the community men, but in the screen-positive group, only 71% and 75%, respectively, of women and 65% and 63%, respectively, of men possessed HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2. Medical review was possible for 41% of seropositive women and 50% of seropositive men, and led to biopsy-confirmed CD in 10 women (0.7%) and 6 men (0.5%), but based on relative risk for HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2 in all TG2 IgA or TG2/DGP IgA/IgG screen-positive subjects, CD affected 1.3% or 1.9%, respectively, of females and 1.3% or 1.2%, respectively, of men. Serogenetic data from these community cohorts indicated that testing screen positives for HLA-DQ, or carrying out HLA-DQ and further serology, could have reduced unnecessary gastroscopies due to false-positive serology by at least 40% and by over 70%, respectively.

Conclusions

Screening with TG2 IgA serology and requiring biopsy confirmation caused the community prevalence of CD to be substantially underestimated. Testing for HLA-DQ genes and confirmatory serology could reduce the numbers of unnecessary gastroscopies.

### HLA-DQ typing in the diagnosis of celiac disease [^0bd19f31]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

More than 95% of celiac patients share the major histocompatibility complex II class human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 or DQ8 haplotype; patients negative for both types are unlikely to suffer from celiac disease. Our aim was to investigate whether HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 typing is helpful when diagnosis is uncertain because of the absence of unequivocal small bowel villous atrophy.

Methods

HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 typing was carried out in 59 patients evincing nondiagnostic small bowel mucosal lesion or positive celiac serology, and in 17 patients maintaining a gluten-free diet without biopsy-proven celiac disease. HLA findings were compared to small bowel mucosal morphology; intraepithelial lymphocytes; and serum endomysial (EmA), reticulin, tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and gliadin antibodies.

Results

Of the 59 patients evincing only minor small bowel mucosal changes or positive celiac disease serology, 22 (37%) were negative for DQ2 and DQ8. All EmA-positive patients had celiac-type HLA, but antireticulin antibody, anti-tTg, and antigliadin antibody were also present in HLA-DQ2- and -DQ8-negative individuals. Eleven of 17 patients (65%) observing a gluten-free diet before small bowel biopsy did not share celiac-type HLA. None of the 17 had apparent villous atrophy. Serum EmA and anti-tTG were negative in all. HLA-DQ typing is less expensive than follow-up biopsy in the exclusion of celiac disease.

Conclusions

HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 determination is useful in exclusion, probably lifelong, of celiac disease in individuals with an equivocal small bowel histological finding. The low specificity of this test must, however, be borne in mind.

### Genetic background of celiac disease and its clinical implications [^5e646738]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is a complex genetic disorder with multiple contributing genes. Linkage studies have identified several genomic regions that probably contain CD susceptibility genes. The most important genetic factors identified are HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, which are necessary but not sufficient to predispose to CD. The associations found in non-HLA genomewide linkage and association studies are much weaker. This might be because a large number of non-HLA genes contributes to the pathogenesis of CD. Hence, the contribution of a single predisposing non-HLA gene might be quite modest. Practically all CD patients carry HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, while the absence of these molecules has a negative predictive value for CD close to 100%. Genetic risk profiles for CD would be helpful in clinical practice for predicting disease susceptibility and progression.

### HLA-DQ and risk gradient for celiac disease [^2c914bd7]. Human Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is a rare example of multifactorial disorder in which a genetic test is of great clinical relevance, as the disease rarely develops in the absence of specific HLA alleles. We typed DR-DQ genes in 437 Italian children with celiac disease, 834 first-degree relatives, and 551 controls. Of patients, 91% carried DQ2 and/or DQ8 heterodimers, 6% only had beta2 chain, 2% was alpha5 positive, and four were DQ2/DQ8/beta2/alpha5 negative. Only the presence of alpha5 resulted negatively associated to disease (p = 2 × 10⁻⁴), whereas we confirmed the effect of the beta half of DQ2 dimer on CD predisposition (p = 4 × 10⁻¹²). Considering 1:100 disease prevalence, we obtained a risk gradient ranging from 1:7 for DQ2 and DQ8 individuals down to 1:2518 for subjects lacking all predisposing factors. The DQB1✱02 and DQB1✱0302 concurrence (p = 9 × 10⁻⁴), besides the DQB1✱02/✱02 homozygosity, had an additional role in disease genetic determination. The CD prevalence rose to 17.6% in sisters, 10.8% in brothers, and 3.4% in parents. In the three groups, the subjects carrying high-risk HLA molecules were 57%, 71%, and 58%; among them, 29%, 15%, and 6% respectively had CD. Those siblings and parents with no susceptible factors were not affected. These findings indicate the impact of the HLA test for CD in clinical practice.

### Improving coeliac disease risk prediction by testing non-HLA variants additional to HLA variants [^332068a6]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

From a clinical perspective, there are several at-risk groups of individuals who will require periodic serological screening for CD throughout their lifetime. It has been argued, although not universally recommended, that HLA testing could be done first to identify carriers of HLA-DQ2 and/or DQ8 and then to perform repeated serological testing only in those individuals in the future (although the risk of developing CD is not equal for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 carriers). From a cost perspective, this might be an efficient strategy as genotyping is relatively cheap and only needs to be done once, whereas serological testing is more expensive and needs to be repeated frequently. Excluding individuals who do not carry the genetic risk for developing CD from serological testing would reduce the cost and burden of repeated invasive testing. The age at which serological screening in an at-risk child should begin, how frequently to test, and when to perform intestinal biopsy are all issues that are still under discussion. The added value of non-HLA genetic factors is that they may allow us to stratify the population better into those in need of repeated serology screening, as HLA testing alone would still include some 30% of the population. Using only the presence or absence of HLA as a screening tool to help in the diagnosis of CD has a positive predictive value of 94%, but a sensitivity of 35%. However, by using our model, which combines different HLA risk variants with non-HLA risk variants, to classify individuals into a high-risk group decreases the positive predictive value to 57%, but increases the sensitivity to 63%. Thus, including non-HLA risk factors suggests that we can reclassify 14.6% of the population into more accurate risk categories, which might help to make a better selection of those who need closer follow-up and repetitive antibody testing.

### Prevalence of haplotype DQ2 / DQ8 and celiac disease in children with type 1 diabetes [^5531b50f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

The study included children and adolescents with T1D, patients of the Department of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, Wroclaw, Poland — which is the only center in Lower Silesia that provides care for pediatric patients with T1D. After informed consent for the genetic testing was obtained from legal guardians of all patients and all patients that are > 16 years of age, according to the Polish law, 3–5 mL of whole venous blood were collected from patients. The HLA-DQ2DQ8 determination was performed in a laboratory experienced in performing such tests. The research was conducted with the EUROArray HLA-DQ2/DQ8 test, which is used to determine the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB2 alleles using special PCR primers (Table 1). This method allows you to resign from agarose gel electrophoresis, so there is no need for subjective evaluation of the test result. Samples were taken together with other routinely performed laboratory tests. Serological screening for CD is performed at the T1D diagnosis and annually in every patient.

Table 1
Analyzed alleles predisposing to celiac disease

Subsequently, genetic testing was discontinued in all children with T1D, as preliminary analysis showed that waiving the annual serological screening for CD is only possible in 12% of patients, therefore genetic testing in each patient did not appear to be economically profitable.

In our Center routine serological screening for CD is performed in every patient at the T1D diagnosis and then annually.

CD was diagnosed according to ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines. The diagnosis was based on the detection of elevated titers of specific antibodies: anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 antibodies (TGA-IgA) and anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA-IgA), determination of HLA DQ2 and DQ8 and esophagogastroduodenoscopy with histopathological duodenal biopsy.

### HLA-DQ2 and-DQ8 genotype frequency in Syrian celiac disease children: HLA-DQ relative risks evaluation [^91ee7794]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder with a strong genetic predisposition and dietary gluten as an environmental trigger. This disease causes inflammation in the small intestinal mucosa. The developing villus atrophy can impede the absorption of nutrients.

Several ways to diagnosis celiac disease using anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) test, anti-endomysium (EMA) auto-antibodies and small bowel biopsy. This disease is widespread in most Mediterranean countries, and it estimated that about more than 5 million patients will be affected in the next 10 years in the Mediterranean region. The only effective therapy is gluten-free diet for life-long, which leads to complete remission of all clinical signs. Celia disease characterized by an interaction of a certain genes, gluten, and environmental influences. The majority of patients with CD carrying the HLA class II genes: HLA-DQ2.5 (DQA1✱05-DQB1✱02) and HLA-DQ8 (DQA1✱03-DQB1✱0302). Strong association was observed between HLA-DQ2.5 and predisposition to CD, explained by its affinity to binding gluten proteins. While, HLA-DQ2.2 contributes less to the risk of CD. Moreover, the risk of CD is shown to be higher in individuals homozygous for the HLA-DQ2.5 or HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.2 genotypes compared with those homozygous for HLA-DQ2.2 or heterozygous for HLA-DQ2.5 or DQ2.2.

HLA genotyping can be used as an efficient adjunct in the CD diagnostic as already confirmed by the New ESPGHAN guidelines for the diagnosis of CD.

In Syria, previous reports indicated that Syrian population has high prevalence of the CD (1/62) in healthy blood donors, but no published study about the link of HLA-DQ alleles and Syrian celiac patients; so, we aim to study the distribution of the CD genes: DQ2 and DQ8 in 49 children patients (age from 1 to 18 years old) in comparable with 58 control samples of the same ages.

### Diagnosis and classification of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity [^3e6c6a80]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is a complex disorder, the development of which is controlled by a combination of genetic (HLA alleles) and environmental (gluten ingestion) factors. New diagnostic guidelines developed by ESPGHAN emphasize the crucial role of serological tests in the diagnostic process of symptomatic subjects, and of the detection of HLA DQ2/DQ8 alleles in defining a diagnosis in asymptomatic subjects belonging to at-risk groups. The serological diagnosis of CD is based on the detection of class IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysial antibodies. In patients with IgA deficiency, anti-tTG or anti-deamidated gliadin peptide antibody assays of the IgG class are used. When anti-tTG antibody levels are very high, antibody specificity is absolute and CD can be diagnosed without performing a duodenum biopsy. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a gluten reaction in which both allergic and autoimmune mechanisms have been ruled out. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of symptoms similar to those of celiac or allergic patients; negative allergological tests and absence of anti-tTG and EMA antibodies; normal duodenal histology; evidence of disappearance of the symptoms with a gluten-free diet; relapse of the symptoms when gluten is reintroduced.

### European society paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition guidelines for diagnosing coeliac disease 2020 [^c334ec3c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The ESPGHAN 2012 coeliac disease (CD) diagnostic guidelines aimed to guide physicians in accurately diagnosing CD and permit omission of duodenal biopsies in selected cases. Here, an updated and expanded evidence-based guideline is presented.

Methods

Literature databases and other sources of information were searched for studies that could inform on 10 formulated questions on symptoms, serology, HLA genetics, and histopathology. Eligible articles were assessed using QUADAS2. GRADE provided a basis for statements and recommendations.

Results

Various symptoms are suggested for case finding, with limited contribution to diagnostic accuracy. If CD is suspected, measurement of total serum IgA and IgA-antibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TGA-IgA) is superior to other combinations. We recommend against deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP-IgG/IgA) for initial testing. Only if total IgA is low/undetectable, an IgG-based test is indicated. Patients with positive results should be referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist/specialist. If TGA-IgA is ≥ 10 times the upper limit of normal (10× ULN) and the family agrees, the no-biopsy diagnosis may be applied, provided endomysial antibodies (EMA-IgA) will test positive in a second blood sample. HLA DQ2-/DQ8 determination and symptoms are not obligatory criteria. In children with positive TGA-IgA < 10× ULN at least 4 biopsies from the distal duodenum and at least 1 from the bulb should be taken. Discordant results between TGA-IgA and histopathology may require re-evaluation of biopsies. Patients with no/mild histological changes (Marsh 0/I) but confirmed autoimmunity (TGA-IgA/EMA-IgA+) should be followed closely.

Conclusions

CD diagnosis can be accurately established with or without duodenal biopsies if given recommendations are followed.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British society of gastroenterology [^2e9abfbf]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We recommend testing for CD in those with suggested symptoms or syndromes, especially if they have a first-degree relative with CD. There is not yet sufficient evidence to support indiscriminate general population screening. Specific serology such as IgA-TG2 and IgG-DGP with or without a strategy for determination of total IgA level should be the preferred serologic strategy for detection of CD. Ideally a combination of serology and biopsies done on a gluten-containing diet will then provide the most robust diagnosis of CD. Additional testing may be necessary for those with less than clear-cut results.

We recommend a duodenal biopsy before the diagnosis of CD. This contrasts with the recent ESPGHAN recommendations where a duodenal biopsy is optional in symptomatic paediatric patients in whom the IgA-TG2 level exceeds 10 times the upper limit of normal, EMA antibodies are positive on a separately taken blood sample and HLA typing is positive for DQ2 or DQ8.CD has been linked to a large number of symptoms (table 1 in the ESPGHAN review on paediatric CD lists 16 such symptoms and signs with additional symptoms in the text). There is a risk that all symptoms, independent of their origin, may be taken as a sign of CD when the sensitivity and specificity of even gastrointestinal symptoms are moderate in CD. Other reasons to require a small intestinal biopsy prior to diagnosis is that not all commercial IgA-TG2 kits are of high quality, and that alternative diagnoses may be more common, and sometimes serious, in adults with suspected CD. Finally, an initial biopsy is important for the follow-up of patients, especially those whose condition is non-responsive to a GFD.

### A novel serogenetic approach determines the community prevalence of celiac disease and informs improved diagnostic pathways [^af7ec7c6]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Results

HLA-DQ status and biopsy-confirmed CD

We first determined the prevalence of HLA-DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2 in local members of the celiac support group who responded to an invitation for volunteers with 'biopsy-proven' CD. Of 356 patients with a diagnosis of CD confirmed by small bowel histology, HLA-DQ2.5 was present in 325 patients (91.3%), HLA-DQ8 but not HLA-DQ2.5 was found in 19 (5.3%), and DQ2.2 but not HLA-DQ2.5 or HLA-DQ8 was present in 7 (2.0%) (Table 1); only 5 patients (1.4%) lacked HLA-DQ2.5, HLA-DQ8 and HLA-DQ2.2. Clinical review led to CD being excluded in four of these 'gene-negative' cases because the small bowel histology remained normal after prolonged gluten challenge, and in two cases because the intestinal histology and further investigations led to a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or common variable immunodeficiency. One gene-negative case declined clinical re-evaluation. Hence, at least 99.7% of local patients with histology-confirmed CD possessed HLA-DQ2.5, HLA-DQ8, or HLA-DQ2.2.

### Recent developments in celiac disease [^bc8e5ae5]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is a common disorder associated with a substantially increased standardized mortality ratio if it is left untreated or if the diagnosis is delayed. Diagnostic sensitivity of serologic testing is improved by the addition of IgG-based testing to standard IgA-based serologic testing for endomysial or transglutaminase autoantibodies. The role of intestinal permeability testing as an additional tool for screening and for monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet is discussed. The importance of diagnosing celiac disease in two clinical situations is considered: first, before immune-stimulating therapy with interferon for viral hepatitis is begun and second, in pregnancy when not only maternal but also paternal celiac disease may affect fetal outcome. The strong genetic component of the etiology of celiac disease is illustrated by a monozygotic twin concordance of nearly 90%, with susceptibility conveyed by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes DQ2 or DQ8 and one or more non-HLA genes. Progress toward identifying these genes from large linkage and association studies is reviewed.

### HLA-DQ2 and-DQ8 genotype frequency in Syrian celiac disease children: HLA-DQ relative risks evaluation [^4f8ed8a0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients and controls

Forty nine CD patients (35 males and 14 females; mean age, 9.5 years; range (1–18) and fifty eight healthy controls (30 males and 28 females; mean age, 29 years; range, (18–40) with no history of CD, cancer or autoimmune diseases and were negative for CD serological screening, were selected from the blood transfusion center of Damascus University in Syria. All patients had positive tTGA and/or EMA antibodies and histology according to Rostami Marsh classification.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. If participant was a minor, parental consent was taken.

HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping

Peripheral blood was drawn on BD Vacutainer plus Blood Collection tubes K2 EDTA 18.0 mg (BD Biosciences, USA). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells using the salting-out method. HLA-DQB1 genotype was performed by sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (SSP-PCR) method using published primers and for HLA-DQA1 genotype.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22, SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). Odds ratios was applied to establish statistical significance with 95% confidence (P value ≤ 0.05). Relative risk of developing disease for specific genotypes were calculated as (% of allele in patients / % of allele in controls) x probability to be affected in general population.

### Is HLA-DQ typing useful in screening for celiac disease among arabs with type 1 diabetes? A case-control study [^2e3596ed]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The data on the usefulness of DQ-typing in screening for celiac disease (CD) among type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients came from the West. We conducted this study among T1D patients to: (1) determine the frequency of DQ-genotypes, (2) assess the risk associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genotypes, and (3) identify the cost-effective screening strategy.

Methods

HLA-DQ genotyping was performed on 67 T1D patients with CD (cases) (mean age 15 years) and 224 T1D patients without CD (controls) (mean age 18.29 years) (2021–2023). The entry criterion for the control group was duration of T1D ≥ 5 years and negative annual celiac serology assay.

Results

On comparison of the cases versus controls, T1D patients carrying homozygous DQ2.5 genotype (30% vs. 13.8%) or DR3-DQ2.5 haplotype (81.3% vs. 65.7%) showed significantly "higher risk" (odds ratio [OR] = 2.64, p = 0.002; OR = 2.3, p = 0.008, respectively) to develop CD. Only 4% do not harbor any of the CD-at risk genotypes (DQ2.5, DQ8, or DQ2.2) and none developed CD. Heterozygous DQ8 was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing CD with OR of 0.123 (1.5% in cases vs. 10.3% in controls, p = 0.022).

Conclusion

Only 4% of Saudi patients with T1D carry DQ-genotypes at no risk to develop CD, which supports the European guidelines that recommend celiac serology test as the most cost-effective screening method. We identified the risk gradient associated with DQ-genotypes to develop CD in our population which could help in counseling patients for the risk to develop CD and planning follow-up serology tests.

### Gluten-dependent enteropathy and atypical human leukocyte antigen alleles [^abaa3373]. Human Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

The risk for developing celiac disease is associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II human leukocyte antigen DQ2 and DQ8. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 127 consecutive cases of adult-onset celiac disease evaluated at a single United States center to determine the distribution of the associated human leukocyte antigen DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. The median patient age of diagnosis was 41 (range, 16–81) years. Ninety-five adults underwent human leukocyte antigen DQ typing. Eighty patients were DQ2 positive, 24 were DQ8 positive, and 11 were DQ2 and DQ8 positive. Four patients carried the uncommon, low-risk haplotype DQ2.2 (DQA1✱02 and DQB1✱02) without DQA1✱05. Two patients did not carry human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8. All of the patients with atypical human leukocyte antigen DQ responded to a gluten-free diet. Although the majority of patients carry the human leukocyte antigen DQ2 or DQ8, gluten-dependent enteropathy periodically presents in adults with low-risk alleles.

### Influence of HLA on clinical and analytical features of pediatric celiac disease [^7c50e541]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Next, we considered the association between clinical and analytical features with the HLA-DQ status.

A family history of CD was observed in 22 (4.8%) of our patients. Their HLA-DQ distribution is shown in Table 2.

Table 2
HLA-DQ distribution in our patients with a family history of celiac disease

Comparison between these HLA-DQ frequencies and the ones observed in the remaining patients showed a nearly significant result: p = 0.067. Specifically, HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 homozygosity were notoriously increased in the group of patients with CD relatives: 27.3% vs. 10.9% (p = 0.03) and 4.5% vs. 0.2% (p = 0.093), respectively, although a significant result was only achieved when considering HLA-DQ2.5. These results led us to perform subsequent analyses after stratifying by family history of CD.

No significant changes across HLA-DQ genotypes were observed between sexes. Next, we analyzed the influence of HLA-DQ on age at onset. In the group with non-CD family history, we observed a significantly later disease onset in HLA-DQ8 carriers (including HLA-DQ8/DQ8 and HLA-DQ8/DQ2.5 subjects) when compared to non-HLA-DQ8 carriers: mean age 4.43 ± 0.66 years vs. 2.54 ± 0.11 years, respectively (p < 0.001). In patients with family history of CD, we could not evaluate this issue since HLA-DQ8 was only observed in one patient.

Finally, we studied the possible influence of the double HLA-DQB1✱02 gene dosage (in HLA-DQ2.5 carriers) on clinical presentation, serology and histological severity (Table 3).

### Diagnosis and management of celiac disease… [^d240434d]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye that affects approximately 1% of the US population. The hallmark of celiac disease is injury to the small bowel mucosa that causes villous atrophy and results in malabsorption of micronutrients, fat-soluble vitamins, iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid. Common signs and symptoms of celiac disease include diarrhea, abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, and constipation. Celiac disease is also associated with extraintestinal manifestations such as fatigue, weight loss, dermatitis herpetiformis, iron deficiency, and osteoporosis. 1 This JAMA Clinical Guidelines Synopsis focuses on the 2023 American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update on diagnosis and management of celiac disease.

### Influence of HLA on clinical and analytical features of pediatric celiac disease [^ba67103c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The current use of HLA genotyping in clinical practice relies on its high negative predictive value. It is recommended to test HLA in patients with an uncertain diagnosis, as those with negative CD-specific antibodies and/or mild histological changes in small intestine. Based on the associations here found between double dose HLA-DQ2.5 and some clinical and analytical parameters, most probably high risk HLA-DQ genotypes will not be present in those subjects, which should be considered by physicians. Our study also suggests that patients with a family history of CD need a special consideration, since HLA-DQ status show slight variations.

HLA-DQ genotypic frequencies differ slightly between CD patients depending on their family history of CD. In patients lacking CD first-degree relatives, carriage of HLA-DQ2.5 with double dose of HLA-DQB1✱02 seems to be associated with classical clinical presentation and more severe histological damage.

### Limited utilization of serologic testing in patients undergoing duodenal biopsy for celiac disease [^5d9af19f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Celiac disease is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1% in various populations. The disease is caused by an autoimmune response to gluten which leads to progressive villous atrophy in the small bowel, resulting in malabsorption. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can be relatively nonspecific, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Systemic complications are common, and can include iron deficiency anemia and fatigue. Accurate recognition and diagnosis of celiac disease is important because implementation of a gluten-free diet can ameliorate many symptoms. If left untreated, celiac disease is associated with increased mortality in adult life from a range of causes, including autoimmune diseases and malignancy.

For patients with an appropriate clinical history, diagnostic tools for the workup of celiac disease can be divided into three categories; serologic assays to measure celiac-associated autoantibodies, genetic assays to identify HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8, and duodenal biopsy to document the presence of villous atrophy. Although many groups have published guidelines on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease and the role of testing in this process, surveys have found that there can be significant variation in adherence to these guidelines in different practice settings. While the exact steps of the algorithms can vary slightly depending upon the specific population being tested, most approaches recommend using serologic assays either prior to duodenal biopsy or concurrently with biopsy in cases with a strong clinical suspicion.

The most commonly-used serologic assays measure autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG), deamidated gliadin (dGDN), and endomysial tissue (EMA). Antibodies against native gliadin are losing popularity because of inferior performance when compared to the newer dGDN assays. Although most assays measure IgA antibodies against these targets, IgG versions are also available for use in patients with IgA deficiency, a disorder commonly associated with celiac disease. The diagnostic characteristics of celiac serology tests have been well-described in many populations, and in general show analytical performance sufficient for use as a screening test. tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA assays have shown the best diagnostic performance in most studies, with pooled sensitivities of 89–90% and specificities of 98–99% in a recent systematic review of the literature. Recent studies have suggested that the use of serologic testing prior to endoscopy could potentially reduce the need for intestinal biopsy to diagnose celiac disease.

### Contribution of HLA-DQ2 / DQ8 haplotypes in type one diabetes patients with / without celiac disease [^b2d66912]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Based on lack of data on the distribution of the related alleles in the T1D population in Iranian population, we assessed the frequency of HLA DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes in patients with T1D with/without CD compared to healthy population.

Materials and Methods

70 patients with T1D without celiac disease, 60 T1D cases with CD were compared to 150 healthy individuals during 2016. Ten mililiter Gheparinized blood samples were collected, genomic DNA was extracted and alleles were genotyped by Real-time PCR using SYBR Green as a low-resolution method.

Results

HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 genotypes was presented in 51% and 23% of T1D patients without CD respectively. Twenty one percent of those patients carried both alleles and 5% were negative for both alleles. T1D patients with CD had much higher DQ2 frequency (72%) and lower DQ8 (11.6%), than T1D patients without CD and controls, 14% carried both alleles and 3% were negative for both. The frequencies of DQ2 and DQ8 alleles in Iranian healthy population were 19 and 5% respectively.

Conclusion

According to the same genetic background for CD and T1D we suggest that HLA-typing can be a very useful screening tool for CD in patients with type one diabetes.

### Celiac disease: diagnosis and management [^3e619b1a]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. It is triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a storage protein in wheat, rye, and barley, which are staples in many American diets. Celiac disease is characterized by chronic inflammation of the small intestinal mucosa, which leads to atrophy of the small intestinal villi and subsequent malabsorption. The condition may develop at any age. Intestinal manifestations include diarrhea and weight loss. Common extraintestinal manifestations include iron deficiency anemia, decreased bone mineral density, and neuropathy. Most cases of celiac disease are diagnosed in persons with extraintestinal manifestations. The presence of dermatitis herpetiformis is pathognomonic for celiac disease. Diagnosis is supported by a positive tissue transglutaminase serologic test but, in general, should be confirmed by a small bowel biopsy showing the characteristic histology associated with celiac disease. The presence of human leukocyte antigen alleles DQ2, DQ8, or both is essential for the development of celiac disease, and can be a useful genetic test in select instances. Treatment of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. Dietary education should focus on identifying hidden sources of gluten, planning balanced meals, reading labels, food shopping, dining out, and dining during travel. About 5% of patients with celiac disease are refractory to a gluten-free diet. These patients should be referred to a gastroenterologist for reconsideration of the diagnosis or for aggressive treatment of refractory celiac disease, which may involve corticosteroids and immunomodulators.

### Screening for celiac disease in 1st degree relatives: a 10-year follow-up study [^ca440e4a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Although it is known that first degree relatives of celiac patients have an increased risk for celiac disease few studies are available on its incidence. We investigated the incidence of serologic conversion and of new cases of celiac disease among first degree relatives with negative results at a first screening.

Methods

From a total of 634 first degree relatives of 186 biopsy-proven celiac disease patients diagnosed between October 2000 and October 2010, 450 subjects agreed to participate in the study (Group I), and underwent serologic screening. Between January 2010 and October 2012, out of the initial group of 450, 205 previously sero-negative subjects consented to participate in a second stage of the study and undergo new serologic testing (Group II). All serologically positive individuals of both groups (I and II) were genotyped for celiac disease-predisposing alleles (HLA-DQ2/DQ8).

Results

19 subjects (4.2%) out of the 450 subjects of Group I disclosed positive serologic results, presence of DQ2 and/or DQ8 alleles and celiac disease-compatible mucosal abnormalities. The 205 previously negative first degree relatives from Group II that underwent new serologic testing disclosed eight sero-converted subjects. Mucosal abnormalities in five of these patients confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease. During the 10-year period of the study the incidence of sero-conversion was 8/205 and the incidence of biopsy-proven celiac disease cases was 5/205.

Conclusions

Our data are coincident with other works on this subject and confirm once again that relatives of celiac patients, especially first degree relatives are at high risk of developing celiac disease. In view of the relatively low incidence further studies are needed to try to establish a useful and cost-effective algorithm for follow-up of relatives of celiac patients.

### Transition from childhood to adulthood in coeliac disease: the prague consensus report [^8f28759a]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

The potential contribution of genetics in ruling out CD in suspect or insufficiently diagnosed cases is important. CD is strongly associated with the HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotypes. While HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 occurs in > 99% of people with CD, it is found in ∼30% of the general population, and therefore, a positive genetic test does not confirm a CD diagnosis.

Statement: In adolescents and young adults, biopsy to reconfirm a childhood diagnosis of CD may be considered when the 10-fold positive tissue transglutaminase antibody result has not been confirmed by positive EMA in a second serology at the time of diagnosis or when the ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria have not been met in a child without duodenal biopsies. Biopsies may also be relevant when the adolescent has ceased a GFD because he or she doubts the diagnosis; the patient or the physician requires documentation of healing; and the presence of symptoms suggests active CD. (C)

Recommendation: We recommend that in adolescents and young adults, routine small intestinal biopsy is not required to reconfirm a childhood diagnosis of CD when the diagnosis has been made according to ESPGHAN or NASPGHAN criteria.

Statement: HLA testing can be used to rule out CD in unclear cases. (B)

Recommendation: We recommend testing for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 genotypes in unclear cases.

The gluten challenge

A gluten challenge after transfer to adult care is normally not needed if diagnostic criteria have been followed, including children diagnosed younger than 2 years of age. A gluten challenge is indicated when the primary diagnosis of CD was not performed according to standards and guidelines. A second circumstance when a gluten challenge is applicable is when the patient requests proof of the diagnosis, even though the initial diagnosis was performed according to the current standards.

There are no well-established rules in a gluten challenge. The clinical tolerability and the time to relapse vary between patients, but traditionally a 3 months' challenge with moderate to high amounts of gluten has been advocated, keeping in mind that an enteropathy may occur after an extended period of time. Before gluten challenge, serology for CD-specific autoantibodies should be performed (duodenal biopsies should preferentially be obtained as well). An increase in CD-specific serum autoantibodies follows histological change. Therefore, if the patient remains asymptomatic, the biopsies should be performed when serology is positive.

Results

Epidemiological characteristics

Of the 200 DM1 patients initially evaluated in our study, 87 (43.5%) were female and 113 (56.5%) were male. The median age of our study population was 41 years (range: 18–83).

One hundred ninety patients (95%) were either HLA DQ2 or DQ8 positive. The HLA distribution is shown in Fig. 1. Nineteen patients (9.5%) were positive for at least one of the three antibodies that were tested in our study. All of the patients with positive antibodies were HLA DQ2 or DQ8 positive. The 190 DM1 patients who were HLA DQ2 or DQ8 positive were invited to complete a gastrointestinal study for CD detection. One hundred thirty-six patients finally accepted.

### An update on celiac disease histopathology and the road ahead [^2ba9d5d8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Celiac disease (CD) is a common immune-mediated disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals (carriers of HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes) on consumption of wheat (gluten). It is characterized by inflammation of the small-intestinal mucosa and myriad gastrointestinal and systemic manifestations. Celiac disease is common in the general population (prevalence, 0.5%-1%). Currently, small-bowel biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing CD. However, the role of serologic testing in the diagnosis of CD has evolved, from being a supportive test to supplanting intestinal biopsies in certain patient populations.

Objective

To summarize key aspects of histopathologic assessment, discuss the benefit of standardized pathology reports, impact of the site and number of small-bowel biopsy samples on diagnosis, and recommendations regarding serologic testing.

Data Sources

Literature review of publications on CD and experience with histopathologic review of biopsies at the Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York.

Conclusions

Intraepithelial lymphocytosis in the context of villous atrophy is considered a characteristic histologic finding of CD; however, it is a rather nonspecific finding. A growing list of publications has also indicated that the detection of intraepithelial lymphocytosis in the absence of villous atrophy has rather low specificity for CD. Therefore, communication between pathologists and gastroenterologists is paramount, as is knowledge regarding the pertinent clinical and laboratory data, in distinguishing between CD and other disorders with similar histopathologic and clinical manifestations.

### HLA-DQ and susceptibility to celiac disease: evidence for gender differences and parent-of-origin effects [^d202d4a8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Celiac disease (CD) is twice as frequent among female than male. Despite the large number of reports on the DQ2/DQ8 association, no systematic studies have investigated a possible different role of the HLA genes in the two genders. We performed case-control and family-based analyses of DR-DQ variants in a pediatric CD cohort with the aim of comparing female to male associations and to investigate the paternal/maternal inheritance of the disease-predisposing haplotypes.

Methods

A total of 281 female and 156 male pediatric celiac patients, 292 nuclear families, and 551 controls were genotyped for HLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 loci. Odds ratio, parental origin of the disease-associated haplotypes, and transmission ratio distortion were evaluated in-between male and female cases.

Results

DQ2/DQ8 were more frequent in female than in male patients (94% F, 85% M; P = 1.6 × 10⁻³) with a 99.1% and 90.5% calculated negative predictive value of the HLA test, respectively. Surprisingly, the majority of the 39 DQ2/DQ8 negative cases were male. The analysis of the DQ2 haplotype origin showed that 61% of female patients and 42% of male patients carried a paternal combination (P = 0.02). The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) proved the major distortion in the DR3-DQ2 transmission from fathers to daughters.

Conclusions

CD is confirmed to be more prevalent in female than in male (F:M = 1.8) but, in DQ2/DQ8 negative patients, we found an unexpected male excess (F:M = 0.7). Moreover, only the inheritance of a paternal DQ2 haplotype led to a daughters predominance. These data show a role of HLA genes on the disease sex bias and suggest a possible different effect of parent-specific epigenetic modifications in the two genders.

### Prudence is necessary in the application of the new ESPGHAN criteria for celiac disease omitting duodenal biopsy: a case report [^275e8700]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

New guidelines for celiac disease (CD) diagnosis from the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) propose the option to omit the duodenal biopsy in the diagnosis of CD. For this option, all four of the following criteria have to apply in children and adolescents: signs and symptoms suggestive of CD, anti-transglutaminase type 2 antibody (anti-TG2) levels more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, positive confirmation tests of anti-endomysium-IgA antibodies (EMA), and at-risk HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8. Here, we report the case of a female patient, 2 years old, with chronic diarrhea that started after an acute viral gastroenteritis. The patient had anti-TG2 levels of more than 10 times the upper limit of normal, positivity for EMA, antigliadin IgA, and IgG (AGA-IgA, AGA-IgG, respectively), and the at-risk HLA-DRB1✱0301, DQB1✱0201/DRB1✱10, DQB1✱0501 genotype, thus fulfilling all criteria for the diagnosis of CD. Although the diarrhea disappeared after about 5 weeks, anti-TG2, EMA, and AGA-IgG remained positive. Therefore, a duodenal biopsy was performed and evidenced a normal mucosa (Marsh 0). After about 18 months, the antibody titer for AGA-IgG, anti-TG2, and EMA became negative. The patient was all the time on a normal, gluten-containing diet. This clinical case represents an exception to the new ESPGHAN guidelines for CD diagnosis. During 5 weeks, the new ESPGHAN criteria were all fulfilled, allowing to propose for this patient the diagnosis of CD without performing a duodenal biopsy. Therefore, a prudent approach is suggested when the pediatric gastroenterologist makes a diagnosis of CD without duodenal biopsy.

### HLA-DQ2 and-DQ8 genotype frequency in Syrian celiac disease children: HLA-DQ relative risks evaluation [^62163575]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disease in Syria which manifesting with inflammation of the small intestine and with various extra intestinal symptoms. The disease is associated with human HLA-DQ genes encoding HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 proteins.

Methods

In this study, 49 children patients of CD and 58 healthy control samples were genotyped for HLA-DQ genes using SSP-PCR technique. Relative risks for different genotypes were also evaluated.

Results

The DQB1✱0201 allele was the most common in the patients (77.6%) followed by DQB1✱0302 allele (10.2%). The highest HLA-DQB risk for CD development was found in patients carriers a DQ2.5/DQ8 genotype (1/10), followed by the patients carriers DQ2.5/DQ2.5 (1/12).

Conclusion

The significant differences in the frequency of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 in Syrian patients in compared with controls and relative risks predicted demonstrated the importance role of these alleles in the development of CD in Syrian children patients.

### Celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity? An approach to clinical differential diagnosis [^8e989749]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Differentiating between celiac disease (CD) and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is important for appropriate management but is often challenging.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed records from 238 patients who presented for the evaluation of symptoms responsive to gluten restriction without prior diagnosis or exclusion of CD. Demographics, presenting symptoms, serologic, genetic, and histologic data, nutrient deficiencies, personal history of autoimmune diseases, and family history of CD were recorded. NCGS was defined as symptoms responsive to a gluten-free diet (GFD) in the setting of negative celiac serology and duodenal biopsies while on a gluten-containing diet or negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2/DQ8 testing.

Results

Of the 238 study subjects, 101 had CD, 125 had NCGS, 9 had non-celiac enteropathy, and 3 had indeterminate diagnosis. CD subjects presented with symptoms of malabsorption 67.3% of the time compared with 24.8% of the NCGS subjects (P < 0.0001). In addition, CD subjects were significantly more likely to have a family history of CD (P = 0.004), personal history of autoimmune diseases (P = 0.002), or nutrient deficiencies (P < 0.0001). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosis of CD of a > 2× upper limit of normal IgA trans-glutaminase antibody (tTG) or IgA/IgG deaminated gliadan peptide antibody (DGP) with clinical response to GFD was 130 (confidence interval (CI): 18.5–918.3). The positive likelihood ratio of the combination of gluten-responsive symptoms and negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP on a regular diet for NCGS was 9.6 (CI: 5.5–16.9). When individuals with negative IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP also lacked symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss, diarrhea, and nutrient deficiencies) and CD risk factors (personal history of autoimmune diseases and family history of CD), the positive likelihood ratio for NCGS increased to 80.9.

Conclusions

On the basis of our findings, we have developed a diagnostic algorithm to differentiate CD from NCGS. Subjects with negative celiac serologies (IgA tTG or IgA/IgG DGP) on a regular diet are unlikely to have CD. Those with negative serology who also lack clinical evidence of malabsorption and CD risk factors are highly likely to have NCGS and may not require further testing. Those with equivocal serology should undergo HLA typing to determine the need for biopsy.

### Immunology in celiac disease [^e97dcf8b]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disease that is tightly associated with human leukocytes antigen DQ2 and DQ8, such that the absence of DQ2 and/or DQ8 will definitively rule out a diagnosis of CeD. DQ2 and DQ8 drive which gliadin peptides will be immunogenic, and the risk for developing CeD is dependent upon the suballeles of DQ2 and DQ8. The key immune cells in the pathogenesis of CeD are T cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), B cells (APCs as well), and epithelial cells. The roles of γδ T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils have been the focus of recent publications.

### Improving coeliac disease risk prediction by testing non-HLA variants additional to HLA variants [^ca1707be]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Screening studies have revealed increased occurrence in some countries, with a prevalence ranging from 0.3% to 3%, always with the majority of cases being previously undiagnosed. Age at onset ranges from infancy to late adulthood, and clinical presentation can be highly variable, from impaired growth, diarrhoea and abdominal pain to presentations such as iron-deficiency, anaemia and decreased bone density. Family members of CD patients and those with another immune-mediated disease are at higher risk of developing CD. As symptoms of CD can be subtle or insidious, current recommendations are to screen such at-risk groups with periodic serological testing. The serological antibodies used as markers for CD have a relatively high sensitivity and specificity, and in most cases a small bowel biopsy revealing enteropathy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of villous atrophy.

The importance of genetic testing was highlighted in the revised guidelines for the diagnosis of CD recently proposed by the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. They recommend typing for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 in symptomatic children with high clinical suspicion of CD, but without confirmatory biopsy, to add strength to the diagnosis, as well as to those with an uncertain diagnosis of CD or to those belonging to risk groups, to exclude further testing for CD. These HLA heterodimers are known to be the major genetic risk factors for CD and have a negative predictive value of almost 100%, but the positive predictive value is poor, as approximately 40% of the population carry one or both of these alleles. In the past few years, two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and one fine-mapping project have identified up to 57 non-HLA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that contribute to CD susceptibility. To date, approximately 54% of the genetics of CD can be explained by HLA plus the 57 non-HLA SNP compared to 40% by HLA alone. In 2009, we published a genetic risk model for CD using HLA and the 10 non-HLA risk variants resulting from the first GWAS. We showed that by using this model, the identification of individuals at high risk of developing CD could be markedly improved. Now, with many more associated loci known for CD, our aim was to test if the genetic risk model could be improved by adding the new variants, assess how well it transfers to other cohorts, and evaluate how well it can be used in clinical practice.

### Extra-intestinal manifestations of celiac disease in children: their prevalence and association with human leukocyte antigens and pathological and laboratory evaluations [^35ce1763]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) plays a role in CD pathogenesis. HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 haplotypes have been suggested as the main genetic risk factors since the development of CD is very rare without one of them. Approximately 40% of individuals carry one or both of these HLAs, but only a fraction of them will go on to develop CD. Moreover, negative associations between HLA DQ5 and DQ6 and CD were reported in a previous study, while in another investigation, HLA DQ7 found to be an additive or independent CD risk haplotype further than DQ2 and DQ8. HLA risk has been associated to various CD-related features, such as age at onset, clinical outcomes, antibody levels, and grade of histological lesion.

Although several EIMs in CD are well recognized, their true prevalence is not known, nor whether the existence of such symptoms influences the severity of histological damage or other CD characteristics at the time of diagnosis. The vast majority of CD patients are still either undiagnosed or have a long delay before diagnosis. Better knowledge of EIM will improve diagnostic efficacy and avoid unnecessary hardship for patients, as well as potentially severe complications associated with undiagnosed/untreated CD. We aimed to study the prevalence of EIM and their association with HLA typing, and pathological and laboratory indices in children with CD.

### Diagnosis of celiac disease and applicability of ESPGHAN guidelines in mediterranean countries: a real life prospective study [^07493d6b]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Even though CD can be reliably diagnosed following the latest ESPGHAN and BSPGHAN guidelines, as not all diagnostic procedures required by the new guidelines are available in all countries, our results may suggest to further simplify the new ESPGHAN guidelines. As a matter of fact, it is not useful nor necessary to perform an expensive determination, such as HLA, as in all patients with tTG higher than 10 x ULN who had HLA heterodimer determined it was compatible with CD. Moreover EMA, which is not easily performed in all countries, does not add diagnostic accuracy to tTG, as suggested by the cases in which both tests were performed and tTG was > 10 x ULN. In 3 cases of our study, in whom EMA were negative, histology showed a picture that allowed us to make the diagnosis of CD. Rather than determining EMA, in the presence of such a high titre tTG, it is better to repeat a second test for tTG according also to what is suggested by the Joint BSPGHAN and Coeliac UK guidelines for diagnosis and management of CD in children. In a commentary regarding applicability of the new ESPGHAN guidelines for diagnosing celiac disease in children from resource limited countries, it has been suggested that positive HLA-DQ2/DQ8 serotype and EMA are necessary in order to apply the ESPGHAN guidelines for serological diagnosis of CD, and that CD should not be diagnosed on the basis of a single high tTG-titre. Our study comprising many countries with limited resources suggests that both HLA and EMA may be omitted and CD may be diagnosed on the basis of repeated high tTG titres. Altogether, the diagnosis would have been correctly made according to the new criteria in 85 out 88 patients with tTG > 10 x ULN who underwent tTG and EMA determination, together with intestinal biopsy. In 3 patients (3.41%), the diagnosis of PCD would have been missed in absence of the biopsy.

### Narrative review: celiac disease: understanding a complex autoimmune disorder [^ebe28add]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disorder that has genetic, environmental, and immunologic components. It is characterized by an immune response to ingested wheat gluten and related proteins of rye and barley that leads to inflammation, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia in the intestine. The disease is closely associated with genes that code for human leukocyte antigens DQ2 and DQ8. Transglutaminase 2 appears to be an important component of the disease, both as a deamidating enzyme that can enhance the immunostimulatory effect of gluten and as a target autoantigen in the immune response. Sensitive and specific serologic tests, including those for anti-transglutaminase antibody, are facilitating fast and noninvasive screening for celiac disease. Thus, they are contributing to a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of the disease and its association with other disorders. Celiac disease is associated with increased rates of anemia, osteoporosis, cancer, neurologic deficits, and additional autoimmune disorders. A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of safe and effective treatment of celiac disease, although its effect on some of the extraintestinal manifestations of the disease remains to be determined.

### HLA-DQ2 and-DQ8 genotype frequency in Syrian celiac disease children: HLA-DQ relative risks evaluation [^be27cefe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Results

In this study, forty nine definite CD patients (25 males and 24 females) and 58 controls of Syrian origin were genotyped for HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 genes. The allele and genotype frequencies of DQ2 and DQ8 genes in CD were compared with the controls. The frequency of the DQB1✱02:01 allele was very significantly increased in patients compared with the controls (77.6% vs. 58.6%; p value: 0.00). The frequency of the DQB1✱03:02 allele was also elevated in patients versus controls, but uncorrected P value was borderline significant (10.2% vs. 8.6%; p value: 0.09), Table 1).

Genotype analysis of DQ2 and DQ8 genes shows that the 24 of 49 patients carrying DQ2.5 in homozygous genotype with high frequency 49%, whereas, this genotype was found in 6 controls (10.3%). The frequency of the DQ2.5/DQ2.2 or DQ2.5/DQ8 were increased in patients versus controls (10.2% vs. 3.4%), (10.2% vs. 1.7%) respectively. More genotype analysis demonstrated that 30.6% of patients carried another DQ genotypes, while 84.5% of controls had these genotypes (Table 2).

### Influence of HLA on clinical and analytical features of pediatric celiac disease [^2ac5fce3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The binding properties to gluten-derived peptides and the capacity to elicit an immunological response depends on the specific HLA-DQ molecules present in each individual, existing also a dosage effect. HLA-DQ2.5 can bind the largest repertoire of immunodominant gluten peptides and presents the highest ability to form stable complexes. Thus, individuals carrying the HLA-DQ2.5 heterodimer show the highest risk to develop CD, especially when bearing two HLA-DQB1✱02 alleles (double dose). The risk decreases in individuals with HLA-DQ8 or only the HLA-DQB1✱02 allele (HLA-DQ2.2 receptor), and is lowest in presence of only HLA-DQA1✱05 (HLA-DQ7.5 receptor). Considering these differences, we hypothesized that HLA-DQ receptors could have a role on the clinical outcome and/or the serological and histological alterations present in each patient. However, little information exists regarding this issue, with some papers relating HLA genetics with some clinical and analytical characteristics but not others.

In a previous work, we studied the different CD risk conferred by HLA-DQ genotypes. At this time, we have performed a retrospective observational study to analyze the possible influence of HLA-DQ genotypes on the clinical, analytical and histological manifestations at the onset of CD.

### Accuracy in diagnosis of celiac disease without biopsies in Clinical practice [^8b9767a2]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The guidelines of the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition allow for diagnosis of celiac disease without biopsies in children with symptoms and levels of immunoglobulin A against tissue-transglutaminase (TGA-IgA) 10-fold or more the upper limit of normal (ULN), confirmed by detection of endomysium antibodies (EMA) and positivity for HLA-DQ2/DQ8. We performed a large, international prospective study to validate this approach.

Methods

We collected data from consecutive pediatric patients (18 years or younger) on a gluten-containing diet who tested positive for TGA-IgA from November 2011 through May 2014, seen at 33 pediatric gastroenterology units in 21 countries. Local centers recorded symptoms; measurements of total IgA, TGA, and EMA; and histopathology findings from duodenal biopsies. Children were considered to have malabsorption if they had chronic diarrhea, weight loss (or insufficient gain), growth failure, or anemia. We directly compared central findings from 16 antibody tests (8 for TGA-IgA, 1 for TGA-IgG, 6 for IgG against deamidated gliadin peptides, and 1 for EMA, from 5 different manufacturers), 2 HLA-DQ2/DQ8 tests from 2 manufacturers, and histopathology findings from the reference pathologist. Final diagnoses were based on local and central results. If all local and central results were concordant for celiac disease, cases were classified as proven celiac disease. Patients with only a low level of TGA-IgA (threefold or less the ULN) but no other results indicating celiac disease were classified as no celiac disease. Central histo-morphometry analyses were performed on all other biopsies and cases were carefully reviewed in a blinded manner. Inconclusive cases were regarded as not having celiac disease for calculation of diagnostic accuracy. The primary aim was to determine whether the nonbiopsy approach identifies children with celiac disease with a positive predictive value (PPV) above 99% in clinical practice. Secondary aims included comparing performance of different serological tests and to determine whether the suggested criteria can be simplified.

Results

Of 803 children recruited for the study, 96 were excluded due to incomplete data, low level of IgA, or poor-quality biopsies. In the remaining 707 children (65.1% girls; median age, 6.2 years), 645 were diagnosed with celiac disease, 46 were found not to have celiac disease, and 16 had inconclusive results. Findings from local laboratories of TGA-IgA 10-fold or more the ULN, a positive result from the test for EMA, and any symptom identified children with celiac disease (n = 399) with a PPV of 99.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 98.61–99.99); the PPV was 100.00 (95% CI, 98.68–100.00) when only malabsorption symptoms were used instead of any symptom (n = 278). Inclusion of HLA analyses did not increase accuracy. Findings from central laboratories differed greatly for patients with lower levels of antibodies, but when levels of TGA-IgA were 10-fold or more the ULN, PPVs ranged from 99.63 (95% CI, 98.67–99.96) to 100.00 (95% CI, 99.23–100.00).

Conclusions

Children can be accurately diagnosed with celiac disease without biopsy analysis. Diagnosis based on level of TGA-IgA 10-fold or more the ULN, a positive result from the EMA tests in a second blood sample, and the presence of at least 1 symptom could avoid risks and costs of endoscopy for more than half the children with celiac disease worldwide. HLA analysis is not required for accurate diagnosis. Clinical Trial Registration no: DRKS00003555.

### Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification [^b7d395f0]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Specific and sensitive serological tests are available as an initial test for CD. Measurement of IgA antibodies to tTG (anti-tTG) is recommended for initial testing for CD, while IgA anti-EMA is considered as a confirmatory test. More recently, deamidated gliadin peptides (DGP) antibodies (especially of the IgG class) have been introduced with sensitivity and specificity comparable to anti-tTG and anti-EMA, but with possibly a better performance in IgA-deficient subjects and in children younger than three years. A high level of anti-tTG (and possibly anti-DGP) and anti-EMA antibodies (10 × or higher) is almost invariably associated with a typical celiac enteropathy found through biopsy of the small intestine. Individuals with CD who are IgA deficient will not have abnormally elevated levels of IgA anti-tTG or IgA anti-EMA and need to be screened with IgG-based tests. A small intestinal biopsy is an important diagnostic investigation that should be undertaken in many patients with suspected CD. The characteristic histological changes include an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) (> 25 lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes), elongation of the crypts, partial to total villous atrophy and a decreased villous:crypt ratio. Polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide typing methods are now available for the determination of alleles encoding HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. Since the HLA predisposing genotype is a necessary factor for disease development, the negative predictive value of HLA typing is very high, that is, the vast majority of subjects who are HLA-DQ2- and HLA-DQ8-negative will never develop CD.

The wide variability of CD-related findings suggests that it is difficult to conceptualize the diagnostic process into rigid algorithms that can cover the clinical complexity of this disease. For this reason, a quantitative approach that can be defined as the 'four out of five rule' was proposed recently. Using this method, the diagnosis of CD is confirmed if at least four of the following five criteria are fulfilled:

1. Typical symptoms of CD

2. Positivity of serum CD IgA class autoantibodies at high titer

3. HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 genotypes

4. Celiac enteropathy found on small bowel biopsy

5. Response to a GFD

### Celiac disease: the new proposed ESPGHAN diagnostic criteria do work well in a selected population [^80c79e70]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The need for an early and accurate diagnosis in celiac disease (CD) has focused attention on new diagnostic approaches, based on the efficiency of serological markers and the high negative predictive value of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) non-DQ2/8.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all of the patients suspected of having CD who had undergone a small bowel biopsy in our gastroenterology unit. All symptomatic children with serological marker at time of biopsy (immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase antibody, endomysial antibody, and HLA genotype) were included. The triple test (TT) was positive if immunoglobulin A-tissue transglutaminase antibody was 10 times the upper limit of normal, plus positive endomysial antibody plus human leukocyte antigen-DQ2/DQ8.

Results

A total of 150 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. One hundred sixteen were positive for the TT; 113 of 116 (97.4%) had a Marsh 2/3 histological lesion and had been considered to have CD. Thus, positive predictive value of the TT was 97.4%. The other 3 cases (2.6%) had Marsh 0/1 lesion, so we consider them to be false-positives for the TT; however, on follow-up, all 3 children developed histological damage after a gluten challenge. Finally, the positive predictive value of the TT was 100%. Thirty-four patients were negative for the TT: 22 patients are celiac, 3 are celiac but challenge gluten diet is pending, and the 9 patients left have other gastrointestinal disorder.

Conclusions

Our study supports the view that in selected children who are symptomatic and positive for the TT, CD diagnosis could be established independent of histological findings.

### HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer blood test accurately identifies patients with and without celiac disease in absence of gluten consumption [^d028d1b8]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Celiac disease is characterized by HLA-DQ2/8-restricted responses of CD4+ T cells to cereal gluten proteins. A diagnosis of celiac disease based on serologic and histologic evidence requires patients to be on gluten-containing diets. The growing number of individuals adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) without exclusion of celiac disease complicates its detection. HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers can be used to detect gluten-specific T cells in blood of patients with celiac disease, even if they are on a GFD. We investigated whether an HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay accurately identifies patients with celiac disease.

Methods

We produced HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers and added them to peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 143 HLA-DQ2.5 + subjects (62 subjects with celiac disease on a GFD, 19 subjects without celiac disease on a GFD [due to self-reported gluten sensitivity], 10 subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet, and 52 presumed healthy individuals [controls]). T cells that bound HLA-DQ-gluten tetramers were quantified by flow cytometry. Laboratory tests and flow cytometry gating analyses were performed by researchers blinded to sample type, except for samples from subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet. Test precision analyses were performed using samples from 10 subjects.

Results

For the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assay, we combined flow-cytometry variables in a multiple regression model that identified individuals with celiac disease on a GFD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89–1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The assay detected individuals with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet vs controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.95 (95% CI 0.90–1.00). Optimized cutoff values identified subjects with celiac disease on a GFD with 97% sensitivity (95% CI 0.92–1.00) and 95% specificity (95% CI 0.84–1.00) vs subjects without celiac disease on a GFD. The values identified subjects with celiac disease on a gluten-containing diet with 100% sensitivity (95% CI 1.00–1.00]) and 90% specificity (95% CI 0.83–0.98) vs controls. In an analysis of 4 controls with positive results from the HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer test, 2 had unrecognized celiac disease and the remaining 2 had T cells that proliferated in response to gluten antigen in vitro.

Conclusions

An HLA-DQ-gluten tetramer-based assays that detects gluten-reactive T cells identifies patients with and without celiac disease with a high level of accuracy, regardless of whether the individuals are on a GFD. This test would allow individuals with suspected celiac disease to avoid gluten challenge and duodenal biopsy, but requires validation in a larger study. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT02442219.
