## Question

What is the role of fine-needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of Warthins tumor?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in diagnosing Warthin tumor, including its diagnostic accuracy, limitations, and how it should influence management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why FNAC is used for parotid masses. Then, I should verify the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC specifically for Warthin tumor from high-quality evidence. Next, I will examine limitations, false positives, and false negatives, and how the Milan System affects interpretation. After that, I should consider how FNAC results should guide management, including when observation is reasonable versus when surgery is indicated. Finally, I will integrate imaging and procedural factors that optimize FNAC performance and outline a practical, risk-stratified approach to care.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Warthin tumor is a benign parotid neoplasm that typically presents in older adult males, often in the tail of the parotid, and carries a very low risk of malignant transformation, which makes accurate preoperative diagnosis valuable for avoiding unnecessary surgery in selected patients [^5f740288] [^47d54c4d].

> I will now examine the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC for Warthin tumor. Wait, let me verify the pooled estimates from the best available evidence. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 studies and 1710 cases reported pooled sensitivity of 93.7% and specificity of 97.9%, with a positive predictive value of 93.3% and a negative predictive value of 97.4%, indicating high diagnostic reliability for Warthin tumor on cytology [^34d4bb05] [^97041c57] [^a6f8307c]. Hold on, I should also cross-check with large clinical series. A multicenter series of 496 cytologically diagnosed Warthin tumors found 88.9% histologic confirmation, with 4.2% ultimately malignant, reinforcing that a cytologic diagnosis of Warthin tumor is highly predictive but not infallible [^47d54c4d]. Smaller institutional series similarly show high concordance, around 95% in one cohort, supporting the robustness of these figures [^158d2511].

> Next, I should review limitations and pitfalls. False positives do occur, and I need to ensure I quantify them correctly. In the meta-analysis, 4.7% of positive FNAC results for Warthin tumor proved malignant on histology, with adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma being the most common mimics, so a cytologic diagnosis of Warthin tumor is not an absolute guarantee of benignity [^a00472f9] [^0d4bbf1c]. False negatives are less common but can happen due to cystic degeneration, necrosis, or sampling error, and heterogeneity in sensitivity across studies reflects these issues, which is why clinical correlation remains essential [^73d58bb0] [^759cf314].

> Let me consider how FNAC results should guide management. Given the high PPV, observation is reasonable in carefully selected patients who are elderly, comorbid, or prefer to avoid surgery, provided they understand the small risk of occult malignancy and agree to surveillance. Indeed, retrospective cohorts show no malignant transformation during multi-year follow-up of cytologically diagnosed Warthin tumors managed conservatively, though selection bias must be acknowledged [^1913a2c6] [^914070ca]. But wait, what if the pretest probability of malignancy is higher or imaging is worrisome? In that scenario, surgical excision remains appropriate, and enucleation can be a minimally invasive option when imaging and cytology align with Warthin tumor in the tail of the parotid, with validated criteria supporting low recurrence and complication rates [^a5c58b61].

> I should confirm how standardized reporting improves safety. The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology provides tiered risk categories and has been shown to stratify malignancy risk effectively. In a large series, a specific diagnosis of Warthin tumor carried a 96.6% PPV, which strengthens confidence in using cytology to support observation in the right clinical context [^f660a1b3] [^7f8948d3]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with broader salivary gland FNA guidance. Contemporary reviews emphasize that FNA, when categorized by Milan, facilitates consistent communication and management decisions across institutions [^9ae29da2].

> Next, I should review procedural factors that optimize accuracy. Ultrasound guidance reduces nondiagnostic rates and improves targeting of solid components in cystic lesions, which is particularly relevant for Warthin tumors that can be cystic and heterogeneous. On-site adequacy assessment further decreases inadequate samples and repeat procedures [^c4f8a07c] [^a08323c3]. I need to ensure I also note operator dependence. Experienced cytopathologists and head and neck surgeons achieve higher diagnostic yields than clinicians without specialized training, underscoring the value of expertise in both acquisition and interpretation [^064a4f8d].

> I will now examine imaging adjuncts that refine pretest probability. Ultrasound can identify multifocal or bilateral Warthin tumors and characteristic cystic spaces, while technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy can show uptake in Warthin tumor due to oncocytic mitochondria, supporting the diagnosis when combined with cytology, though availability varies [^c6fcfe97] [^914070ca]. But wait, I should double-check the role of PET. Warthin tumors can be markedly FDG-avid and mimic malignancy, so a hot lesion on PET should not override a concordant benign cytology; instead, it should prompt careful correlation with ultrasound and FNAC to avoid overtreatment [^c0f3b426] [^c4d4f376].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. In a patient with a classic parotid tail mass in an older male smoker, if ultrasound and FNAC both support Warthin tumor, observation with interval imaging is reasonable after counseling about the approximately 4–5% risk of a false-positive cytology and the need for surveillance. If imaging is atypical, cytology is indeterminate, or the patient prefers definitive management, surgical excision or enucleation is appropriate, with extent tailored to tumor location and patient factors [^34d4bb05] [^47d54c4d] [^a5c58b61]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with guideline-level advice. Neck mass guidelines endorse FNA as the preferred initial tissue diagnosis for neck masses, including salivary lesions, and emphasize repeating FNA if results are nondiagnostic or discordant with clinical suspicion, which fits well with this risk-stratified plan [^4d6690c3] [^c4f8a07c].

> In conclusion, FNAC plays a pivotal role in Warthin tumor by providing a highly accurate, minimally invasive preoperative diagnosis that can safely enable observation in selected patients while also identifying those who warrant surgery. The key is to integrate cytology with imaging and clinical context, apply standardized Milan reporting, and ensure experienced operators to minimize false results and guide appropriate management [^34d4bb05] [^7f8948d3] [^c4f8a07c].

Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is **highly accurate** for diagnosing Warthin tumor, with pooled sensitivity of 93.7% and specificity of 97.9% [^34d4bb05] [^97041c57]. FNAC identifies the classic cytology of oncocytic epithelial cells with lymphocytes, supporting a confident preoperative diagnosis and enabling conservative management in selected patients [^a7882115] [^1913a2c6]. However, **false positives can occur** (about 4.7%), most often due to sampling error or mimicry by malignant tumors such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma, so results must be interpreted in clinical and imaging context [^a00472f9] [^0d4bbf1c]. Ultrasound guidance improves diagnostic yield and reduces nondiagnostic rates, and the Milan System helps standardize reporting and risk stratification [^c4f8a07c] [^7f8948d3]. Given the low malignancy risk of Warthin tumor, a confirmed FNAC diagnosis can justify observation in elderly or comorbid patients, with surgery reserved for symptomatic or growing lesions [^1913a2c6] [^914070ca].

## Diagnostic accuracy of FNAC for Warthin tumor

Multiple studies and meta-analyses consistently show **high diagnostic accuracy** of FNAC for Warthin tumor:

- **Sensitivity**: 93.7% (95% CI: 92.1–95.3) [^34d4bb05] [^97041c57].
- **Specificity**: 97.9% (95% CI: 97.0–98.9) [^34d4bb05] [^a6f8307c].
- **Positive predictive value (PPV)**: 93.3% (95% CI: 91.5–95.1) [^34d4bb05] [^a6f8307c].
- **Negative predictive value (NPV)**: 97.4% (95% CI: 96.4–98.4) [^34d4bb05] [^a6f8307c].

These figures indicate that FNAC is **highly reliable** for diagnosing Warthin tumor, with a low false-negative rate and a very low false-positive rate [^b09f6387].

---

## Cytological features of Warthin tumor on FNAC

FNAC of Warthin tumor typically reveals **characteristic cytological features** that facilitate accurate diagnosis:

- **Oncocytic epithelial cells**: Large polygonal cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and round, centrally placed nuclei [^a7882115].
- **Lymphoid background**: Abundant lymphocytes, often with germinal centers, reflecting the lymphoid stroma of the tumor [^a7882115].
- **Cystic debris**: Necrotic debris and cystic fluid may be present, correlating with the cystic changes seen histologically [^5f740288].

These features, particularly the combination of oncocytic epithelial cells and a lymphoid background, are **highly suggestive** of Warthin tumor and help differentiate it from other salivary gland lesions [^a7882115].

---

## Limitations and pitfalls of FNAC in Warthin tumor diagnosis

Despite its high accuracy, FNAC has **limitations and potential pitfalls**:

- **False positives**: Occur in approximately 4.7% of cases, typically due to sampling error or cytological mimicry by malignant tumors such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma [^a00472f9] [^0d4bbf1c].
- **False negatives**: Less common, but can occur due to inadequate sampling or cystic degeneration within the tumor [^73d58bb0] [^759cf314].
- **Infarction**: FNAC can rarely induce infarction or inflammatory changes in Warthin tumor, complicating subsequent histopathological evaluation [^79d77893] [^445ca86a].

These limitations underscore the importance of **correlating FNAC results with clinical and imaging findings** and, when necessary, repeating FNAC or pursuing surgical excision [^c4f8a07c].

---

## Role of imaging in conjunction with FNAC

Imaging modalities, particularly **ultrasound (US)**, play a crucial complementary role in the diagnosis of Warthin tumor:

- **Ultrasound features**: Warthin tumor typically appears as a well-circumscribed, hypoechoic mass with internal cystic spaces, often located in the tail of the parotid gland [^c6fcfe97].
- **Ultrasound-guided FNAC**: Improves diagnostic yield and reduces nondiagnostic rates by enabling targeted sampling of solid components within cystic lesions [^c4f8a07c] [^a08323c3].
- **Technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy**: Warthin tumor shows increased uptake due to oncocytic cells, aiding in differentiation from other benign lesions [^914070ca].

---

## Clinical management implications of FNAC diagnosis

A confirmed FNAC diagnosis of Warthin tumor has **significant clinical management implications**:

- **Conservative management**: Given the benign nature and low malignant potential of Warthin tumor, observation and conservative management are appropriate in elderly patients or those with comorbidities who are unwilling or unable to undergo surgery [^1913a2c6] [^914070ca].
- **Surgical excision**: Reserved for symptomatic lesions, rapidly growing tumors, or cases where malignancy cannot be excluded based on clinical and imaging findings [^47d54c4d].
- **Enucleation**: Minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as enucleation, have been validated for Warthin tumor, offering reduced morbidity and recurrence rates [^a5c58b61].

---

## Comparison with other diagnostic modalities

FNAC compares favorably with other diagnostic modalities for Warthin tumor:

| **Attribute** | **Fnac** | **Core needle biopsy (cnb)** | **Frozen section** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Accuracy | High (sensitivity 93.7%, specificity 97.9%) [^34d4bb05] | High (sensitivity 94%, specificity 98%) [^921547d9] | Moderate (accuracy 85–90%) [^notfound] |
| Invasiveness | Minimally invasive | Minimally invasive, but more invasive than FNAC | Invasive, intraoperative |
| Complications | Rare (parotitis, infarction) [^79d77893] [^445ca86a] | Rare (hematoma, infection) | Rare (facial nerve injury) |
| Diagnostic yield | High with ultrasound guidance [^c4f8a07c] | High, fewer nondiagnostic results than FNAC [^921547d9] | High for malignant lesions |

## Recent advancements and guidelines

Recent advancements include the adoption of the **Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC)**, which standardizes FNAC reporting and facilitates risk stratification and clinical decision-making [^7f8948d3] [^9ae29da2]. Guidelines recommend **ultrasound-guided FNAC** by experienced practitioners to optimize diagnostic accuracy and minimize complications [^db75ec3b] [^c4f8a07c].

---

FNAC is **highly accurate** for diagnosing Warthin tumor, with strong sensitivity and specificity. It enables confident preoperative diagnosis and supports conservative management in selected patients, but results must be interpreted in clinical and imaging context due to rare false positives. Ultrasound guidance and standardized reporting systems further improve diagnostic reliability and guide management.

### If cytology of warthin tumor is accurate, can management be conservative? [^1913a2c6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2016). Low credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study to assess the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of Warthin tumor and to evaluate the subsequent risk of conservative nonsurgical management. We reviewed the records of 75 patients (76 tumors) with a parotid mass that had been diagnosed as a Warthin tumor by FNAC. This patient population was made up of 64 men and 11 women, aged 46 to 93 years (mean: 67). Of the 76 tumors, 40 were treated with surgical excision and 36 with conservative measures. Histology of the 40 excised parotid masses revealed that 38 (95%) were indeed Warthin tumors, 1 (2.5%) was a low-grade adenocarcinoma, and 1 was benign-not otherwise specified. None of the 36 tumors underwent malignant transformation either clinically or on repeat FNAC (if performed) during a follow-up of 4 to 120 months (mean: 55.5 ± 32.2). We conclude that conservative management of Warthin tumors confidently diagnosed on FNAC may be an option for patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo surgical excision.

### Fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of salivary gland disorders in the community hospital setting… [^3500b11e]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- From 1983 to 1988, 47 patients with salivary gland disorders were assessed with fine-needle aspiration before surgery. The preoperative fine-needle diagnoses were then compared with the postoperative pathologic findings. In the same period, 63 patients from two other community hospitals who had been evaluated preoperatively with FNA were studied retrospectively. The overall sensitivity of FNA for salivary neoplasms was 80. 6%. Fine-needle aspiration was more sensitive in identifying benign tumors than malignant neoplasms and was least sensitive in identifying nonneoplastic salivary diseases. Pleomorphic adenomas were correctly identified preoperatively in 96. 2% of cases, whereas for malignant neoplasms, the diagnostic accuracy was highest for mucoepidermoid carcinoma. To demonstrate the strengths of FNA as a diagnostic tool, as well as to delineate its limitations, we present our 5-year experience.

Our FNA results are similar to those reported by the major European and American referral centers. Because our medical centers are community based, our results may more accurately reflect those seen by otolaryngologists in private practice. To date, no evidence of tumor seeding along the FNA tract has been reported. Pitts DB, Hilsinger RL, Karandy E, Ross JC, Caro JE. Fine-Needle Aspiration in the Diagnosis of Salivary Gland Disorders in the Community Hospital Setting. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 1992; 118: 479–482.

Abstract

It is important to define the accuracy of fine‐needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of Warthin tumor (WT). This systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluated the accuracy of FNAC in the diagnosis of WT in the parotid gland and WT growth rate. For determination of FNAC accuracy, 17 studies, encompassing 1710 cases, were included. Pulled random model estimates of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 93.7% (95%CI: 92.1, 95.3), 97.9% (95%CI: 97, 98.9), 93.3% (95%CI: 91.5, 95.1), and 97.4% (95%CI: 96.4, 98.4), respectively. FNAC is highly reliable for the diagnosis of WT of the parotid. The high PPV value suggests that patients with a cytological diagnosis of WT of the parotid may be assigned to active surveillance.

### Diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology in warthin tumors [^158d2511]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for Warthin tumors of the parotid gland.

Methods

All cytologic diagnoses of Warthin tumor between 1990 and 2007 were correlated with available histology. In addition, our results were compared to current literature.

Results

In 310 cases, Warthin tumor was diagnosed by FNAC. In 133 cases, (43%) both cytology and histology were available. In 127 of these 133 cases (95.5%), the diagnosis Warthin tumor was confirmed by histology. In 4 cases (3%), a benign lesion was diagnosed and 2 (1.5%) revealed a malignant lesion. On review, those cytologic diagnoses were not certain. In the literature, 11 missed malignancies (5.4%) in 202 cases were reported.

Conclusion

The diagnostic accuracy of FNAC for the diagnosis of Warthin tumor is high and the percentage of missed malignant tumors is very low. Our results imply that a cytologic diagnosis of Warthin tumor may justify conservative treatment.

TABLE 1
Summary of studies reviewed to determine fine‐needle aspiration cytology accuracy

In seven studies, the TN rate was not reported, as the publication focused on evaluation of the concordance between FNA and histopathology in the diagnosis of WT. Study data, individual diagnostic estimates and pooled estimates are summarized in Table 2. Individual and pooled estimates are also presented in a forest plot in Figures 2 and 3. The pooled sensitivity and PPV were calculated based on cases from 17 studies. The random effects model of the 17 studies showed a pooled sensitivity of 93.7% (95%CI: 92.1, 95.3) and pooled PPV of 93.3% (95%CI: 91.5, 95.2). Pooled specificity and NPV were calculated based on the 10 studies in which TN data were reported. The random effects model of these 10 studies showed a pooled specificity of 97.9% (95%CI: 97, 98.9) and a pooled NPV of 97.4% (95%CI: 96.4, 98.4). Heterogeneity assessments showed that PPV and specificity estimates were homogenous (Q = 20.2, p = 0.210, I² = 20.8 for PPV, and Q = 10.9, p = 0.282, I² = 17.4% for specificity). NPV and sensitivity estimates were found to be heterogenous (Q = 74.3, p < 0.0001, I² = 78.5% for sensitivity, and Q = 32.3, p = 0.0002, I² = 72.1% for NPV). Visual assessment of the funnel plots for each of the four FNAC estimates showed no asymmetrical distribution (Figure 4). All included studies were of high quality (Figure 5).

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy

This systemic review and meta‐analysis followed the referred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) extension for diagnostic test accuracy guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted on July 25, 2021 to identify relevant publications. The search terms used were "fine needle aspiration" OR "fine needle sampling" OR "FNA", AND "Warthin tumor" OR "adenolymphoma" OR "parotid" AND "tumor" OR "neoplasm" OR "mass" as well as "growth rate". No date restriction was applied. To expand the search, "similar articles" function in PubMed and "related articles" function in Google Scholar were used. In addition, the reference list of selected articles was screened.

2.2 Eligibility criteria

Articles that used FNAC for the diagnosis of a parotid gland lesion and histopathological assessment for a final postoperative diagnosis were included. Cases with a nondiagnostic FNAC result were not included for the assessment of FNAC accuracy. Case reports, letters, or comments to the authors, article not in English, and cases or articles that did not address WT were excluded. To calculate WT growth rate, we included articles that diagnosed WT using histopathology or cytology. WT size evaluations were based on articles reporting on CT‐ or MRI‐based tumor size evaluation at least twice with a minimum time interval of 3 months, a measured dimension, and which mention follow‐up duration. If more than two size evaluations were available, only the first and the last were included. In cases where several articles used the same database in overlapping years, only the most recent published article was included to avoid data duplication.

6 CONCLUSIONS

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta‐analysis of diagnostic accuracy of WT of the parotid gland. The study found that FNAC has high performance in the diagnosis of WT at this site. Although FP results were not common, most turned out to be malignant. The overall high PPV value suggests that selected patients with a cytological diagnosis of WT of the parotid can be assigned to active surveillance.

5 LIMITATION

This review had several limitations. Articles reviewed to determine FNA accuracy were retrospective in nature, and some had a small sample size. Another limitation was that sensitivity and NPV showed a high degree of heterogeneity. Cytodiagnosis terminology used when assessing the salivary glands has some variability between medical centers, which might have been even more pronounced in articles published before 2015, before the Milan system was developed. Given the variability in reported FN and FP malignancy rates and established by this review, it is important that physicians be familiar with the institutional rate for malignancy when FNAC fails to diagnose correctly. This is key for advising the patient and informing them adequately for decision making. FNAC results are impacted by many factors, including collection method, physician FNA training, freehand versus ultrasound‐guided technique, and pathologist versus physician performed FNA. Most of the included studies failed to adequately report on these factors.

### Fine needle aspiration of parotid tumors: diagnostic utility from a clinical perspective [^8855114c]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The utility of fine needle aspiration (FNA) for parotid tumors is limited owing to its low diagnostic accuracy. In this study, the authors sought to analyze and interpret FNA results for parotid tumors from a clinical perspective.

Materials and Methods

Parotid tumors subjected to preoperative FNA and subsequent complete excision were the subject of this study. Patient demographics, medical records, FNA findings, and final pathology of 158 consecutive cases were analyzed.

Results

The accuracy of FNA was 77.8%. The positive predictive value and likelihood ratio for malignancy were 90.0% and 52.8% (95% confidence interval, 7.02–397), respectively. The positive predictive value and likelihood ratio for benign pathology of Warthin tumor plus pleomorphic adenoma were 97.8% and 7.67% (2.03–29.0), respectively.

Conclusions

The FNA diagnosis of Warthin tumor or pleomorphic adenoma is reliable and can be safely regarded as a benign tumor. Based on the high positive predictive value and likelihood ratio, FNA of the parotid gland can offer valuable information in surgical planning and patient counseling in many centers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Warthin tumor (WT), also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum or adenolymphoma, is a benign neoplasm that arises almost exclusively in the parotid gland, which is the origin of most salivary gland tumors. It comprises 15% of all parotid tumors and is the second most frequent neoplasm in the parotid gland, after pleomorphic adenoma.WT is more common in Caucasians in the 6th and 7th decades of life, smokers, and males, although a narrowing of the gender gap has recently been observed, likely due to increased smoking among women. Several etiological factors have been suggested, including Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection, autoimmune diseases, radiation, chronic inflammation, and most importantly, cigarette smoking. In the last few years, there has been an increased trend in the diagnosis of WT in comparison to other parotid tumors; in some studies, WT was found to be more common than pleomorphic adenoma. One study showed that this trend cannot be explained by changes in smoking patterns. The same study suggested metabolic syndrome and obesity as two central risk factors. The typical clinical manifestation of WT is a painless firm swelling in the upper neck, but some cases will be asymptomatic, and others will show symptoms of facial nerve branch irritation, ear pain, tinnitus, and hearing impairment. In general, WT grows slowly, and malignant transformations are rare, occurring at a rate of less than 0.1%. The malignant transformation can arise from the epithelial or lymphoid cells of WT. Synchronous or metachronous tumors, some of which are malignant, in proximity to WT of the parotid, occur rarely. Preoperative assessment of WT with fine‐needle aspiration (FNA) cytological analysis (FNAC) typically identifies a combination of necrotic debris, lymphocytes, and oncocytic epithelial clusters.

Despite the reports of slow growth, some studies reported on cases in which WT doubled in size within 1 year. It is therefore of prime importance to identify the patients at risk of rapid WT growth. However, the literature is scarce and does not include important demographics and clinical data. Several studies evaluated the performance of FNA for the diagnosis of WT but showed considerably conflicting results. So et al. reported on 95.8% sensitivity and 97.2% positive predictive value (PPV), and Viguer et al. reported on 90.4% and 98.1%, respectively, whereas other studies demonstrated a rate of false diagnosis of about 25%–40%.,

This systematic review and meta‐analysis considered publications that include a comparison between preoperative FNAC (index test) and postsurgical histopathological diagnosis (reference test) of WT in the parotid gland. In addition, the mean growth rate of the tumor as measured by imaging modalities was calculated.

### Acute parotitis as a complication of fine-needle aspiration in warthin's tumor. A unique finding of a 3-year experience with parotid tumor aspiration [^79d77893]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective/Hypothesis

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is an accurate, cost-effective tool for the study of salivary gland lesions. Although complications are extremely rare, salivary gland FNA can lead to hemorrhage, facial nerve injury, and cellulitis at the needle puncture site. Some studies suggest that FNA can cause infarction or metaplastic transformation of benign Warthin's tumors. We review our recent experience with FNA of the parotid gland, focusing on possible complications and pitfalls.

Study Design and Setting

The medical records of all patients who underwent FNA of the parotid gland from 2000 to 2002 in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery of a major tertiary-care referral center were reviewed. Cytological results were compared to the histological diagnosis and complications were recorded.

Results

Of the 256 lesions aspirated, 99 patients (39%), were cytologically diagnosed as benign tumors, including 31 (12%) Warthin's tumors, of which 16/17 resected and confirmed histologically. Five patients with Warthin's tumor had post-FNA parotitis and were treated accordingly.

Conclusions

The combination of cystic spaces surrounded by oncocytic cells and a poor blood supply makes the tumor susceptible to infarction and inflammation. Our findings indicate that FNA is a strong and reliable tool in the investigation of the salivary glands. Nevertheless, when Warthin's tumor is clinically suspected on the basis of its location (tail of the parotid gland), cystic texture, patient sex (male) and age, one should consider parotitis as a possible complication.

### Cytologic diagnosis of parotid gland warthin tumor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^75beda2c]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 Data extraction, processing, and synthesis

The following data were extracted for each case: method of needle guidance, needle size, patient characteristics, the time (years) range of the data, FNAC diagnosis, and final histopathological diagnosis. Data regarding follow‐up duration for each lesion, imaging modality used, and initial and final size of WT were also extracted.

The following parameters were calculated: true positives (TP): FNAC and histopathological diagnosis is WT; false positive (FP): FNAC result is WT, but histopathological diagnosis is not; false negative (FN): FNAC result is a different lesion (not WT), but histopathological result is WT; true negative (TN): both FNAC and histopathology results are not WT. Our goal was to conduct meta‐analysis of individual FNAC estimates in the diagnosis of WT; for this reason, all the included studies contain cases of FP, FN, and TP and some studies also contain TN cases. Studies that lack case of FP, FN, or TP were excluded. All the false positive and false negative results were classified as malignant, benign, or normal. Cytodiagnostic or histopathologic results that were classified as "probably malignant", "suspected malignant", "suspicious for malignancy", "cannot exclude malignancy" were included in the malignant group.

2.4 Quality assessment

The included studies were assessed for quality of methodology based on the Diagnostic Accuracy Research Quality Assessment‐2 (QUADAS‐2) tool. The risk of bias was rated as "low", "high", or "unclear", corresponding to a score of "2", "1", and "0", respectively. A study awarded a cumulative score ≥ 6 was considered of high quality.

### Cytologic diagnosis of parotid gland warthin tumor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^759cf314]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluated the accuracy of FNAC in the diagnosis of WT and investigated WT growth rate. The study found FNAC to have a high specificity (97.9% [95%CI: 97, 98.9]), and PPV (93.3% [95%CI: 91.5, 95.1]), yet a variable sensitivity (93.7% [95%CI: 92.1, 95.3]) and NPV (97.4% [95%CI: 96.4, 98.4]). Although FNAC is highly specific in the diagnosis of WT, the review found that 35/732 (4.7%) positive results proved malignant is postoperative histopathology, hence, patients choosing an observational approach based on preoperative FNAC WT diagnosis should be followed up with caution. False FNAC results involving WT is a well‐known phenomenon. The falsely diagnosed FNAC cases may be the result of sampling error, when WT cysts with acellular fluid are sampled. In addition, WT oncocytes tend to undergo necrosis and to change to squamous or mucinous epithelium which may lead to diagnosis of a malignant tumor.WT necrosis can also cause cyst spillage and subsequent inflammation and reactive changes, thus challenging cytodiagnosis. Other sources of sampling errors are mixed tumors of WT and synchronous benign and malignant lesions. Both FN and FP cases may harbor malignant tumors and should raise concern of progression of malignant disease. Yet, characteristics of these cases were not available for review; thus, future research is warranted to identify the features of falsely diagnosed cases. When considering the overall high PPV, a positive diagnosis of WT by FNAC can be a reasonable option in selected cases with close follow‐up.

The cited malignant transformation rate of WT tumors diagnosed by histopathology is 0.1%. Yet, in the case of FNAC diagnosis, false results are mostly due to a sampling error. Although malignant transformation can contribute to lead to a false diagnosis, we think it has a small effect overall. Additionally, cases of malignant transformation were not included in the review, and this subject is beyond the scope of the current study.

We chose not to present data regarding WT growth rate in this review. The data obtained in appraised publications were very heterogeneous. Moreover, factors influencing growth are many and unknown, all of which may lead to imprecise results. We suggest that futures studies conduct more comprehensive, three‐dimensional size assessments of WT.

### The diagnostic value of cytology in parotid warthin's tumors: international multicenter series [^47d54c4d]. Head & Neck (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Warthin's tumor (WT) is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm with a negligible risk of malignant transformation. However, there is a risk of malignant tumors being misdiagnosed as WT on cytology and inappropriately managed conservatively.

Methods

Patients from nine centers in Italy and the United Kingdom undergoing parotid surgery for cytologically diagnosed WT were included in this multicenter retrospective series. Definitive histology was compared with preoperative cytological diagnoses. Surgical complications were recorded.

Results

A total of 496 tumors were identified. In 88.9%, the final histological diagnosis was WT. In 21 cases (4.2%) a malignant neoplasm was diagnosed, which had been incorrectly labeled as WT on cytology.

Conclusions

The risk of undiagnosed malignancy should be balanced against surgical risks when considering the management of WT. Although nonsurgical management remains an appropriate option, there may be a rationale for serial clinical or radiological evaluation if surgical excision is not performed.

### Usefulness of ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology of major salivary gland lesions [^3beba5f9]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the clinical value of ultrasound (US) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) of salivary gland lesions prior to surgery, for preoperative decision-making and long-term follow-up/outcome.

Materials & Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of 98 consecutive patients with major salivary gland lesions who were treated in a single medical from 2008 to 2017. Preoperative US and FNA was performed in all patients. Cytology results were compared with histopathological diagnoses. The correlation between preoperative US findings, cytology and histopathological diagnoses was assessed.

Results

Twenty-three specimens were histopathologically malignant, and 75 were diagnosed as benign. Three false-positive results diagnosed as malignant in cytology had a final histology of sialadenitis, pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin's tumor, respectively. In six cases, cytology yielded false-negative results. The overall accuracy of FNA in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions was 91%. Sensitivity was 70% and specificity 93%. There was no significant correlation between US features and final pathology, but larger size had some correlation with malignancy (p = 0.306). No complications were observed during or after performing FNA.

Conclusion

FNA from salivary gland lesions is safe and in many cases can help in preoperative decision making or surgical planning. Hence, the results of FNA cytology should have an integral role in clinical decision-making and management of major salivary gland lesions. False-negative results do occur and therefore should be used only as an adjunctive measure.

### Induction of parotitis by fine-needle aspiration in parotid warthin's tumor [^1a4603ac]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate parotitis caused by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in parotid Warthin tumor.

Study Design

Case series with chart review.

Setting

Hospital records were reviewed for 104 parotid tumors (103 patients) including 35 Warthin tumors, which underwent FNA within our department.

Results

Three patients with four Warthin tumors among them noticed parotid pain, swelling, and abscess formation as a consequence of acute parotitis after FNA. Examinations of the materials obtained from tumor puncture or drainage before the start of antibiotic therapy showed no bacterial association in any patient. Two of the patients with Warthin tumor underwent parotidectomy, and the surgical specimens indicated histopathological changes with necrosis, abscess, granuloma, and the infiltration of inflammatory cells including Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells.

Conclusions

It is conceivable that Warthin tumor bears the characteristics of inflammation induced by the FNA procedure without any relation to infection. Therefore, it may be better to avoid routine FNA and give priority to diagnostic imagings over FNA in the diagnosis of tumors strongly suspected as Warthin tumor.

### Surgeon-performed ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of parotid gland tumors [^8c7b2a17]. Head & Neck (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ultrasound (US) with or without fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) are readily available and can offer in office and rapid diagnosis of parotid lumps.

Methods

We analyzed 398 of patients who underwent blind FNAC or US with FNAC performed by an operating head and neck surgeon. Specificity, sensitivity, as well as accuracy were calculated for US alone, FNAC alone, and US-FNAC combined.

Results

Nondiagnostic US-guided FNAC rate was 3.1% and 7.2% for blind FNAC. With those cases removed, final accuracy for US alone in diagnosis of malignancy, pleomorphic adenoma (PA), and Warthin tumor (WT) were 90.8%, 81%, and 77.4% respectively. For US-FNAC accuracy for malignancy, PA, and WT were 92.1%, 94 0.8%, and 95.4% respectively.

Conclusion

US with FNAC is cost-effective and rapid diagnostic tool and may help surgeon to deliver more accurate informed consent to a patient.

### Risk stratification of fine-needle aspiration cytology of parotid neoplasms based on the milan system-experience from a tertiary center in Asia [^f660a1b3]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The recently described Milan system provides a unified way of categorizing salivary gland fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. We aim to use this system to stratify risk of malignancy in parotid FNAs.

Methods

In this retrospective case series, 376 FNAs were preoperatively performed for 573 parotidectomies over 14years.

Results

Risk of malignancy on FNA is as follows: nondiagnostic 14.5%, non-neoplastic 26.7%, atypia of undetermined significance 29.3%, benign neoplasm 2.7%, neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential 19.1%, suspicious for malignancy 87.5%, and malignant 100%. The specific diagnoses of pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin tumor on FNA have high positive predictive value of 97.5% and 96.6%, respectively. Multivariate regression associates smaller size of lesion with a nondiagnostic or indeterminate result. Seniority of operator is associated with a lower likelihood of a nondiagnostic result.

Conclusions

This large Asian series validates the Milan system as a valuable tool in stratifying malignancy risk of parotid FNAs.

### Management for warthin tumor of the parotid gland: surgery or observation. A 21-year retrospective study of 387 cases [^914070ca]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study investigated the characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of Warthin tumors (WTs) to explore the possibility of managing patients by observation.

Methods

We reviewed the records of 1167 patients with benign parotid tumors who were seen in our department between September 1999 and April 2021. Among them, 387 cases were WT and 668 cases were pleomorphic adenoma. We evaluated preoperative diagnoses of WT by symptoms/signs, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), imaging, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, and technetium-99m pertechnetate (Tc-99m) scintigraphy. Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analyses.

Results

Warthin tumors were treated by surgery in 238 cases and follow-up in 149 cases. The 238 patients were diagnosed as WT at the final pathology after surgery. Among them, 172 patients (72.3%) were determined as benign histological type by preoperative FNAC; in these 172 patients, 170 (71.4%) were correctly diagnosed as WT in the final pathology. Preoperative Tc-99m scintigraphy was performed in 69 patients diagnosed with WT by final pathology or FNAC, and the positive rate of Tc-99m scintigraphy in WT was 75.4%.

Conclusions

Combining FNAC and Tc-99m scintigraphy, as well as considering clinical findings, enables the diagnosis of WT in most cases. In particular, WT is more common in the elderly, grows more slowly, and is less likely to be malignant. Therefore, if WT can be diagnosed preoperatively with a high rate of correct diagnosis, it could be an accurate and effective means of managing patients through follow-up without surgery.

### Cytologic diagnosis of parotid gland warthin tumor: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8fc13cc1]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

2.5 Statistical analysis

IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0 was used for data analysis. R software and related packages were used for the meta‐analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of FNAC. Mean percent diameter change for the entire population and percent diameter change for subgroups were calculated to assess WT growth rate. Dependent variables were assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and by graphically comparing frequencies distribution to bell shape. The T test was used to compare the means of subgroups; p ‐value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Between‐study heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran Q test and the Higgins I square test, where I² > 50% indicates statistically significant heterogeneity. Random and fixed models were used for pooled estimates. Publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of the symmetry of the funnel plot.

### Role of ultrasonography in diagnosis and differentiation of pleomorphic adenomas… [^c6fcfe97]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Diagnoses were confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and/or histopathologic examination or clinical course. In 15 of 22 patients with primary pleomorphic adenoma, ultrasound was used to guide fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Final diagnoses are given in Table 1. In 2 patients with recurrent pleomorphic adenoma, we noted more lesions than were found on clinical examination; in 3 patients with Warthin tumor we visualized subclinical lesions in the same or contralateral gland, and in routine follow-up examination we detected 1 clinically silent metastasis. In 6 patients the lesions fulfilled the ultrasound criteria of a malignant tumor. Five of these cases represented true malignancies, and 1 was a hemorrhagic pleomorphic adenoma. One metastasis to the salivary gland presented on ultrasound as benign.

With the use of ultrasound, subclinical lesions may also be found. In the postoperation study by Gritzmann et al, 3 as many as 76% of clinically undetected Warthin tumors were detected by ultrasound. In the present study, we could further demonstrate clinically silent lesions in 3 patients with Warthin tumor and in 2 patients with recurrent pleomorphic adenomas. Also, the metastasis to the salivary gland was discovered during routine follow-up. Very hypoechoic echos of chondroid tissue were previously observed by Shimizu et al. 16 It is well known that, in pleomorphic adenomas, hemorrhages or cystic degeneration sometimes occur13, 17 and then anechoic spaces visible with ultrasound may appear. 5, 15 Many different studies proved that cystic anechoic areas are characteristic features of Warthin tumors. 3, 4, 16 They were reported in up to 93%4 of Warthin tumors. We observed certain difference in the shape of these anechoic spaces between pleomorphic adenomas and Warthin tumors.

In the latter, they appear most often as irregular branching and glandlike anechoic structures, and in pleomorphic adenomas they are usually small and close to oval in shape. This observation, however, demands further studies on larger numbers of pleomorphic adenomas with cystic areas.

### Epithelioid cell clusters with an extensive lymphoid background [^a7882115]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Fine-needle aspiration of salivary gland lesions can be particularly challenging for pathologists. There are numerous neoplasms that occur in this area and several cytologic variations of each specific lesion.

Objective

To present and discuss a practical pattern recognition approach to fine-needle aspiration diagnosis, which includes categorizing lesions that share a certain overall cytologic architectural pattern, followed by identifying unique cellular characteristics that are specific to a certain lesion. An extensive discussion of one cytologic common pattern of salivary gland lesions, "epithelioid cell clusters with an extensive lymphoid background", is presented. The pathologic entities that fall under this architectural pattern group are discussed, with an emphasis on neoplasms.

Data Sources

Published literature and personal experience.

Conclusions

A practical cytologic architectural pattern method can aid the pathologist in rendering a correct diagnosis when evaluating salivary gland lesions. One common pattern in salivary gland cytopathology is epithelioid cell clusters with an extensive lymphoid background. This pattern is often associated with Warthin tumor; however, other benign and malignant entities fall under this diagnostic group. Unique cytologic features separate these lesions into their respective diagnostic category.

### Imaging of salivary gland tumours [^9276f7be]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Salivary gland neoplasms account for < 3% of all tumors. Most of them are benign and parotid gland is the commonest site. As a general rule, the smaller the involved salivary gland, the higher is the possibility of the tumor being malignant. The role of imaging in assessment of salivary gland tumour is to define intra-glandular vs. extra-glandular location, detect malignant features, assess local extension and invasion, detect nodal metastases and systemic involvement. Image guided fine needle aspiration cytology provides a safe means to obtain cytological confirmation. For lesions in the superficial parotid and submandibular gland, ultrasound is an ideal tool for initial assessment. These are superficial structures accessible by high resolution ultrasound and FNAC which provides excellent resolution and tissue characterization without a radiation hazard. Nodal involvement can also be assessed. If deep tissue extension is suspected or malignancy confirmed on cytology, an MRI or CT is mandatory to evaluate tumour extent, local invasion and perineural spread. For all tumours in the sublingual gland, MRI should be performed as the risk of malignancy is high. For lesions of the deep lobe of parotid gland and the minor salivary glands, MRI and CT are the modalities of choice. Ultrasound has limited visualization of the deep lobe of parotid gland which is obscured by the mandible. Minor salivary gland lesions in the mucosa of oral cavity, pharynx and tracheo-bronchial tree, are also not accessible by conventional ultrasound. Recent study suggests that MR spectroscopy may differentiate malignant and benign salivary gland tumours as well as distinguishing Warthin's tumor from pleomorphic adenoma. However, its role in clinical practice is not well established. Similarly, the role of nuclear medicine and PET scan, in imaging of parotid masses is limited. Sialography is used to delineate the salivary ductal system and has limited role in assessment of tumour extent.

### Diagnostic challenges in fine-needle aspiration cytology of mediastinal tumors and lesions [^d2ae752f]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Context —

Mediastinal tumors/lesions are frequently encountered in daily cytopathology practice. These lesions are accessible through endoscopic/endobronchial ultrasound-guided or computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology and represent a wide range of primary and metastatic tumors. This often poses diagnostic challenges because of the complexity of the mediastinal anatomic structures. Tumors metastatic to mediastinal lymph nodes represent the most common mediastinal lesions and must be differentiated from primary lesions.

Objective —

To provide an updated review on the fine-needle aspiration cytology of mediastinal tumors/lesions, with an emphasis on diagnostic challenges. This review encompasses thymic epithelial neoplasms, mediastinal lymphoproliferative disorders, germ cell tumors, neuroendocrine tumors, soft tissue tumors, and metastatic tumors. Differential diagnoses; useful ancillary studies, including targeted immunohistochemical panels; and diagnostic pitfalls are discussed.

Data Sources —

Data were gathered from a PubMed search of peer-reviewed literature on mediastinal tumors. Data were also collected from the authors' own practices.

Conclusions —

Fine-needle aspiration cytology plays a vital role in evaluation of mediastinal lesions. Being familiar with the clinical and cytomorphologic features of these lesions, appropriately triaging the diagnostic material for ancillary testing, and correlating with radiologic findings are important in arriving at correct diagnoses and guiding management.

### The role of fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis and management of thymic neoplasia [^e5a71179]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Fine needle aspiration biopsy is commonly used to document the metastasis to the mediastinum. It is less often used to make the primary diagnosis of tumors, particularly thymic neoplasms. This is due to fear of sampling error, rarity of thymic tumors, multiplicity of lesions in the mediastinum, and inexperience on the part of the cytopathologist. We show that needle aspiration sampling of thymic tumors, both thymoma and thymic carcinoma, is an accurate method of diagnosis.

Methods and Results

In our series of 22 thymic tumors aspirated preoperatively and compared with the subsequent surgical resection, the accuracy of a diagnosis of thymoma was 100%, and the accuracy of a diagnosis of carcinoma was 100%. Difficulties were encountered when vague terminology was used, and insufficient information was conveyed. Immunohistochemical stains can be applied to cytologic material to aid in the identification of the epithelial and lymphocytic components of thymoma.

Discussion

Correlation with clinical and radiographic information is necessary, and wording of the cytology report should be as complete and clear as possible.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for penile cancer, more specifically with respect to biopsy and histopathology, ESMO/EURACAN 2024 guidelines recommend to perform percutaneous fine-needle aspiration cytology for palpable inguinal nodes and repeat the fine-needle aspiration cytology or perform an excisional biopsy in case of negative findings for clinically suspicious nodes.

### The role of fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of mediastinal lesions: a 9-year experience from coastal karnataka [^2b8cc623]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fine needle aspiration cytology has emerged as a minimally invasive, cost-effective diagnostic tool with significant utility in evaluating mediastinal lesions. However, comprehensive data on its diagnostic accuracy, efficacy, and clinical impact on managing these lesions remain limited. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic utility of fine needle aspiration cytology in mediastinal lesions, focusing on its accuracy, safety, and role in guiding therapeutic approaches. A cross-sectional retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent fine needle aspiration for mediastinal lesions at our tertiary care centre between 2015 and 2024. Demographic data, cytological findings, histopathological correlation, and ancillary studies were reviewed. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by comparing fine needle aspiration cytology findings with histopathological diagnoses. A cumulative total of 60 cases of mediastinal lesions were evaluated, of which 47 cases were considered suitable for cytological assessment. Among the 60 cases, 41 cases were identified as neoplastic (68.33%), while 6 were classified as nonneoplastic (10%) on cytology. Within the spectrum of neoplastic mediastinal lesions, lymphoma was recognised as the principal neoplastic entity, followed by thymic neoplasms and metastatic lesions. The overall diagnostic accuracy achieved through fine needle aspiration cytology in distinguishing these lesions was established at 83.8%, with diagnostic accuracy being exceptionally high in metastatic lesions. Fine needle aspiration cytology of mediastinal lesions is a highly accurate, safe, and valuable diagnostic tool that significantly influences clinical management and treatment protocols. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are warranted to validate these results and refine procedural protocols.

### Diagnostic pitfalls of infarcted warthin tumor in frozen section evaluation [^445ca86a]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Warthin tumor (WT) is the second most common benign salivary gland neoplasm and has characteristic cytologic and histologic findings. Fine-needle aspiration is a common and useful preoperative diagnostic technique, which sometimes leads to ischemic injury resulting in the infarction of these lesions. Infarcted WT may demonstrate variable gross and histologic alterations that may render the diagnosis challenging, particularly during intraoperative frozen section evaluation. In this study, we collected 11 resection specimens from 9 patients with infarcted WT. Seven patients were men and 2 were women, ranging from 49 to 85 years (mean, 69). All the patients had fine-needle aspiration before the resection. Macroscopically, the tumors were tan-white and contained soft, yellow, exudative material. The histologic findings were variable and included necrosis, ghosts of papillae, squamous metaplasia, cholesterol clefts, foamy macrophages, multinucleated giant cell reaction, necrotizing granulomas, and fibrosis. Each case predominantly demonstrated 1 or 2 of these histomorphologic features. In the permanent sections, additional sampling revealed foci of residual viable WT in 8 cases. Three cases were completely infarcted; however, they all had ghost-like papillae in which the architecture of WT was evident. Infarcted WT may present a diagnostic challenge during intraoperative frozen section evaluation. Associated morphologic alterations may preclude a definitive diagnosis of WT and may mimic malignancy. Awareness of the gross and microscopic features associated with infarcted WT is important, particularly for accurate frozen section evaluation of these salivary gland tumors.

### Validation of indications for enucleation for benign parotid gland tumors [^a5c58f61]. Head & Neck (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Enucleation has been reported as a minimally invasive surgery for Warthin's tumor (WT). However, the definite indications for enucleation have not been clarified.

Methods

Enucleation was indicated by the following findings: findings of WT, cystic fluid, or benign leukocytes by fine-needle aspiration cytology; a well-margined and homogeneous pattern on imaging; and a tumor location in the tail or preauricular area of the parotid gland. We reviewed 552 cases treated with parotid gland surgery in our hospital.

Results

A total of 108 tumors were treated with enucleation and included no malignant solid tumors or pleomorphic adenoma. Enucleation demonstrated low invasiveness and complication rates. Revision surgery for WT reappearance after enucleation was rare and showed minimal scarring, with a lower risk of facial weakness.

Conclusions

The indication criteria for enucleation were validated. Such enucleation is useful, as it is associated with minimal invasiveness, low complication rates, and safety in revision surgery.

### Performance characteristics of incisional and core needle biopsies for diagnosis in parotid gland: single-institutional experience and assessment of the value of a milan system for reporting salivary gland cytopathology-like risk stratification model [^592c178a]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Context —

Unlike parotid fine-needle aspiration biopsy, standardized reporting for core needle biopsy (CNB) and incisional biopsy (IB) is not established.

Objective —

To examine the value of risk stratification by a Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC)-like classifier for parotid CNB/IB.

Design —

Five hundred ninety-two parotid biopsy records (CNB = 356, IB = 236) were retrieved (1994–2022) along with clinicopathologic data. Diagnoses were transformed to an MSRSGC-like classifier and compared with end points including risk of malignancy.

Results —

Over time, CNB was progressively more used compared with IB. Overall malignancy call rate was 223 of 592 (37.7%). Common specific diagnoses included Warthin tumor, lymphoma subtypes, and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma for CNB and IB, in addition to pleomorphic adenoma for CNB. Descriptive diagnoses were still frequent. Nondiagnostic rates were higher in CNB (26 of 356; 7.30%) than IB (5 of 236; 2.12%; P < .001). Tissue volumes significantly influenced CNB adequacy, with minimum and optimal volumes of 4.76 mm³ (J index, receiver operating characteristic curve) and 12.92 mm³ (95th percentile of distribution), respectively. One hundred forty-four patients (112 CNBs) had follow-up resections; diagnoses were concordant for 66 of 73 adequate CNBs (90.41%). Our restructured risk grouping of MSRSGC categories performed robustly in terms of risk of malignancy (sensitivity = 85.5%, specificity = 100%, accuracy = 92.3%, area under the curve = 0.9677).

Conclusions —

Although CNB and IB are amenable to a risk stratification system, there are some differences as compared with fine-needle aspiration biopsy, particularly given the high baseline prevalence of malignancy. Specific diagnoses are often feasible and concordant with resection. CNB tissue volume can inform optimal and minimal sampling recommendations for adequacy.

### Positron emission tomography in warthin's tumor mimicking malignancy impacts the evaluation of head and neck patients [^c0f3b426]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

1) To determine SUVs and PET/CT characteristics of Warthin's tumors in patients presenting to a head and neck cancer clinic. 2) To analyze the impact of PET/CT on the clinical course of these patients.

Materials and Methods

This is a single-institution retrospective analysis of patients with proven Warthin's tumors who underwent PET/CT done at or near the time of diagnosis and presented to a head and neck cancer practice. Data were obtained from the electronic medical records of these patients and the imaging and pathology databases.

Results

Six patients with Warthin's tumor met the criteria for and form the study cohort. Three patients had bilateral tumors. The SUVs for Warthin's varied from 3.4 to 16.1 in these patients, with an average of 7.8 and these SUVs were higher for Warthin's than for the cancers. These findings on PET/CT in this group required additional workup of all patients and required FNA, surgery or SPECT-CT to confirm the diagnosis.

Conclusion

Although it is known that Warthin's tumor may be hypermetabolic on PET, this finding in the parotid or neck on PET/CT alters the evaluation and treatment of head and neck cancer patients and patients with cancers outside the head and neck by raising the concern about metastatic disease or multiple primary cancers. In other patients, PET/CT obtained for other reasons may prompt concern about incidental malignancy. This series specifically characterizes clinical features, SPECT-CT and FNA findings that can help reinforce the diagnosis of Warthin's and facilitate management.

### Utility of repeat cytological assessment of thyroid nodules initially classified as benign: clinical insights from multidisciplinary care in an Irish tertiary referral centre [^797559ce]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Nodules with benign cytology (Thy2)

Overall, 258 nodules (63%) were initially classified as Thy 2 (benign). Management of patients with a nodule initially classified as Thy 2 (benign) is outlined in Fig. 1. Twenty three patients (9%) elected, subsequently, to have surgery rather than conservative follow-up (lobectomy or thyroidectomy), principally due to local compressive symptoms (subjective or objective) or for cosmetic reasons — all were diagnosed as benign nodules. Among the remainder of this patient group, 126/235 (54%) underwent routine repeat biopsy. The rate of routine repeat biopsy increased significantly over the time course of the study; p for trend = 0.012 (Fig. 2).

Trend (dotted line) for repeat FNA after initial aspirate classified as Thy 2 (benign); p for trend = 0.012. Solid line represents the absolute percentage of aspirates, initially classified as Thy 2, which were repeated in each quarter of the study period

Nine Thy 2 nodules were classified differently following routine repeat biopsy (Fig. 1, Table 2). One patient was classified as Thy 5 (malignant) on repeat FNAB and was diagnosed with a solitary 3 cm papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) following a thyroidectomy — the entire nodule was malignant; the lesion had classical PTC morphology in some areas and in others demonstrated a Warthin-like tumour appearance. Two level VI cervical lymph nodes contained metastatic PTC - (Stage 1, pT2N1aM0). Eight were classified as Thy 3 after repeat aspiration; six underwent thyroid lobectomy and were diagnosed as benign; two declined lobectomy — they were followed with surveillance ultrasound and the nodules remained stable in size during 3 year follow up.

Table 2
Final cytological category of 126 nodules, initially classified as Thy2 (benign) after routine repeat FNAB

The majority of patients with a nodule initially classified as Thy 2, who did not have surgery or a repeat biopsy, were followed for between 4–8 years without clinical or sonographic evidence of significant nodule enlargement. Therefore, the negative predictive value (NPV) of a Thy 2 biopsy was greater than 99%; only one of 258 nodules, initially classified as benign, was subsequently found to harbor malignancy. If only biopsies which were repeated or followed by surgical resection are considered (n = 149), the NPV of an initial Thy 2 biopsy still exceeds 99%.

### Review of fine-needle aspiration cytology of salivary gland neoplasms, with emphasis on differential diagnosis [^faa82749]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

The widespread use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of salivary gland lesions in many centers is testimony to its usefulness and acceptance as a diagnostic technique. Many pertinent questions concerning a mass arising in the salivary gland can be answered by evaluation of FNA cytologic material, and these include whether the mass is truly of salivary gland origin, whether the lesion is inflammatory or neoplastic, and if neoplastic, whether benign or malignant. On diagnosis of a neoplastic salivary gland lesion, the next important issue is to correctly classify the tumor, particularly if malignant. Specific cytologic diagnoses can be achieved in the majority of cases, thus enabling the clinician and patient to make appropriate informed decisions. The cytologic evaluation of salivary gland tumors, however, is limited by the wide range and heterogeneous nature of benign and malignant tumors arising in this area, many of which share similar or show overlapping cytologic features, making the diagnosis of rare tumors problematic. In this review, the cytologic features of the major salivary gland neoplasms, the differential diagnoses, and the salient points that, if examined carefully, help achieve a specific diagnosis are discussed.

### Bilateral multifocal warthin tumours [^39dfe753]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Warthin tumour, also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum, is the second most frequent benign tumour of the parotid gland after pleomorphic adenoma. A 57-year-old man was referred to our hospital with bilateral buccal masses without pain. He presented with a 1-year history of the condition and stated that growth of the mass has accelerated during the last 6 months. Ultrasonography examination showed two heterogeneous solid masses. Axial contrast-enhanced CT image revealed bilateral heterogeneous solid masses. The masses showed enhancement after contrast administration (95 HU). Fine needle aspiration cytology was recommended for further analysis and typical benign features of Warthin tumour was obtained. Right parotid gland including the masses was resected completely. 5 weeks later superficial parotidectomy was performed to the left parotid gland. Histological examination revealed cystic tumour in the parenchyma of parotid gland, composed of prominent lymphoid stroma and large epithelial cells with oncocytic features covering it consistent with Warthin tumour.

### Fine-needle aspiration cytology of salivary gland lesions: a systematic review [^e409a846]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic review of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology on salivary gland lesions.

Materials and Methods

A review of the literature was carried out using PubMed, SCIRUS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The present study included only data correlating cytological and histological diagnoses.

Results

Of the patients, 484 received a histological diagnosis of malignant tumor; cytological diagnosis was concordant in 387 (79.95%), discordant in 97 (20.04%). A total of 1,275 patients received a histological diagnosis of benign tumor; cytological diagnosis was concordant in 1,219 (95.608%) and discordant in 56 (4.39%). In all, 154 patients received a histological diagnosis of non-neoplastic lesion; cytological diagnosis was concordant in 145 (94.156%) and discordant in 9 (5.84%).

Conclusion

FNA is a safe diagnostic tool that has a reliable sensitivity and specificity for the assessment of salivary gland pathology. FNA cytology may be useful in routine preoperative diagnostic testing.

### Salivary gland tumors: a 20 year review from a single community practice [^5ed5ae8f]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective: Salivary gland tumors are a heterogenous group of lesions with variable pathology and clinical outcomes. Most published data are derived from studies conducted at tertiary care centers. Our study analyzed the experience from a community setting to determine significant differences, if any, in pathological distribution and clinical outcomes compared to the existing literature. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of all major salivary gland tumors that presented to a large community practice over a 20 year period. Retrospective chart analysis was performed for demographics, clinical presentation, imaging, cytology, histopathology, and clinical outcome data. Results: Of 806 patients, the parotid gland was the most common site in 683 patients (84.7%), followed by submandibular in 78 (9.7%) and sublingual in 45 (5.6%). A total of 203 patients were managed conservatively with observation without definitive diagnosis or lost to follow-up. A total of 495 patients underwent surgical intervention within the community practice. Twenty-six patients underwent surgical excision at an outside hospital. Eighty-two patients were determined to have a benign diagnosis based on ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration or excisional biopsy alone. Final histopathology was benign in 505 cases (83.7%), while 98 tumors (16.3%) received a diagnosis of primary or secondary malignancy. For the parotid gland, pleomorphic adenoma (155) and Warthin's tumor (155) were the most common benign diagnoses, while mucoepidermoid carcinoma (13), adenocarcinoma (8), and acinic cell carcinoma (8) were the most common primary malignancies. Conclusions: We found a higher rate of benign tumor pathology compared to the existing literature. While the outcome data on surgical treatment of benign tumors are comparable to the existing literature, the same conclusion cannot be drawn for malignant tumors, given relatively small numbers in our series and likely disparity in the complexity of the surgical cases in tertiary care centers.

### Cytology report… [^7eb64840]. training.seer.cancer.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Cytology Report Cytology tests are different from biopsy tests because only a few cells are needed, instead of a tissue sample. Compared to doing a biopsy, getting a cytology sample is usually
- Easier to do
- Less likely to be painful
- Less likely to cause serious complications
- Less expensive. Fine Needle Aspiration Fine needle aspiration uses a very thin, hollow needle attached to a syringe to remove a small amount of fluid and very small pieces of tissue from an abnormal area. This is sometimes considered a cytology test and sometimes a type of biopsy. Cytology Tests on Body Fluids Different types of body fluids can be tested to see if they contain cancer cells. Some of the body fluids that can be tested in this way include
- Urine
- Sputum
- Spinal fluid, also known as cerebrospinal fluidor CSF.

Scrape or Brush Cytology Another way to get cytology samples is to gently scrape or brush some cells from the organ or tissue being tested. An example of a cytology test that samples cells this way is the Pap test. For this test, a small spatula and/or brush is used to remove cells from the cervix. Cytology and Bladder Cytologic examination of urinary sediment for malignant cells; fine needle aspiration of a cyst or tumor; also pleural effusion or ascites If a urine cytology is positive for malignancy that case is reportable. If a subsequent biopsy of the same urinary site is done and returns negative, do not report the case. Do not report a case based on a suspicious cytology; however, if a biopsy is done after the suspicious cytology and confirms the diagnosis, then the cytology would be the date of diagnosis.

Cytology reports are usually done for bladder washings, where an instillation of saline solution is injected into the bladder. After the solution is allowed to contact surfaces in the area for about five minutes, it is aspirated and sent for cytologic examination.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^c4f8a07c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) results and repeat sampling guidance — an adequate and negative FNA should not preclude additional diagnostic procedures when signs and symptoms are worrisome, and after either inadequate results or benign pathology, repeat FNA may be valuable and should be attempted prior to resorting to an open biopsy. Some indeterminate cytology cases may benefit from repeat aspiration, and discussion with a cytopathologist may guide the decision to repeat FNA after an indeterminate result. When repeating FNA, ultrasound guidance has been shown to increase specimen adequacy, can be useful when palpation-guided FNA is of limited diagnostic utility, can improve diagnostic yield in cystic or necrotic masses by directing biopsy to the solid component, and on-site cytopathologist evaluation, when available, can reduce the inadequacy rate.

### Ulcerative warthin tumor: a case report and review of the literature [^ff28c94b]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Warthin tumor with ulceration of the surrounding skin is extremely rare, making it difficult to differentiate from parotid cancer in the clinical setting. We report a 65-year-old man with a Warthin tumor in the right parotid gland that had ulceration of the overlying skin. The patient presented with right upper neck mass 2 years ago. Ultrasound and fine needle aspiration were done, and Warthin tumor was suspected. One year later, the mass was enlarged with ulceration of the skin. Superficial parotidectomy with fusiform excision of the skin was performed, and histopathological diagnosis revealed a Warthin tumor with inflammatory change. We proposed that this unique manifestation may have been induced by fine needle aspiration, enlargement of the tumor, and ischemic changes secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.

### Primer: cytopathology for the clinician – how to interpret the results of aspiration cytology [^0d415122]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

The practice of clinical cytopathology is characterized by the daily challenges of trying to establish pathological diagnoses on the basis of microscopic evaluation of small cellular samples, from both deep-seated and superficial anatomic sites. The diagnostic work-up of mass lesions involves a collaborative effort between clinicians and pathologists, and relies on the pathologist's ability to establish a reliable diagnosis; that is, one that convincingly explains the mass and its underlying neoplastic or non-neoplastic nature. Arriving at a conclusive pathological diagnosis is not always easy and additional ancillary tests, such as special stains, microbiologic cultures and flow cytometry, are often required. To ensure that clinicians can make appropriate management decisions, it is essential that pathologists use conventionally accepted diagnostic nomenclature and communicate effectively with their clinical colleagues. Clinicians should also ensure that the pathologist is provided with all relevant clinical information, preferably at the time of submission of the specimen. Clinicians should consult with the pathologist before the biopsy procedure, and inform them of the clinical differential diagnoses, to ensure that the proper ancillary tests are obtained for definite diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary in the head and neck: ASCO guideline [^ea000a0c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — neck mass biopsy (Recommendation 1.2) — Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of a clinically suspicious neck mass should be performed, with the evidence statement "Type of recommendation: evidence based, benefit outweighs harm; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong". Biopsy of a neck mass is necessary to establish the diagnosis of SCC prior to treatment, and FNA biopsy is most commonly performed because it is easy, safe, minimally invasive, and cost effective. However, a subset of FNAs, especially when taken from cystic nodes, will yield a nondiagnostic result or insufficient material for testing, for which core-needle biopsy may be helpful; an approach using immediate cytopathologist adequacy evaluation followed by a small core biopsy to obtain material for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing as indicated has been proposed.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^4d6690c3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) — Clinicians should perform FNA instead of open biopsy, or refer the patient to someone who can perform FNA, for patients with a neck mass deemed at increased risk for malignancy when the diagnosis of the neck mass remains uncertain. Strong recommendation based on systematic reviews with a consistent reference standard. Policy level is a strong recommendation, with aggregate evidence quality Grade A and high confidence in evidence. Benefits are a rapid, cost-effective test with high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, minimal discomfort, low risk of seeding malignancy, does not affect imaging results, and can prioritize further imaging or workup; risks and costs include discomfort, direct cost, and risk of nondiagnostic or indeterminate test results. The benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Exceptions are none and the role of patient preferences is none, though value judgments noted that some patients may prioritize open biopsy prior to attempted FNA and that some patients experience unwarranted delay prior to tissue biopsy; intentional vagueness reflects that technique, operator, and setting are at the clinician and patient's discretion.

### Salivary gland tumors… [^922b85f4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- We examined the relative accuracy of fine-needle aspiration biopsy and frozen section in the diagnosis of salivary gland tumors; FNAB completely and accurately diagnosed 35 of 40 cases, including ten of ten nonneoplastic lesions, 20 of 23 benign, and five of seven malignant tumors. No complications were encountered with this procedure. These results compare favorably with previously published reports. Twénty-one of 40 tumors diagnosed by FNAB and FS at surgery. Sixteen of 21 of these were correctly diagnosed by FNAB, and 15 of 21 by FS. Cystic lesions gave the most diagnostic difficulties both on FNAB and FS. Worldwide, FNAB has been demonstrated to be a cost-effective, accurate, and safe procedure. Furthermore, the use of FNAB allows for better preoperative management and overall treatment planning.

### Importance of cytopathologic diagnosis in early cancer diagnosis in resource-constrained countries [^0d8a8cdd]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

A Nigerian study reported that the total cost for fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) procedure and cytologic evaluation of each smear was 1,700 naira (N1,700.00 = $11 USD). The total cost for open surgical biopsy and histopathologic evaluation was 13,600 naira (N13,600 = $88 USD) per patient. It took an average of 2 days ± standard deviation 1 day to obtain FNAB results, whereas, by contrast, it took an average of 28 days ± standard deviation 7 days to obtain a histopathologic diagnosis. FNAB is cost-effective and saves time for the patients when compared with open surgical biopsy.

Cytopathology covers a broad range of diagnostic and screening tests, including the cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, sputum, urine, pleural and ascitic fluids, cerebrospinal fluid, and FNAB. The relatively new kid on the block, interventional cytopathology, combines two techniques, which are fine needle biopsy, with or without aspiration, and ultrasonographic guidance. FNAB has an important role in the diagnosis and management of cancers, not only in the initial diagnosis of patients with palpable and nonpalpable tumors facilitating the planning of appropriate treatment but also in staging — via lymph node FNAB and evaluating the response to treatment, recurrence, and monitoring of disease progression. It can often provide a definitive diagnosis, supported in the clinical context with imaging and ancillary studies. Depending on their availability, flow cytometry, IHC, molecular analysis, genetic studies, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for infections can all be performed on the FNAB material, and increase the diagnostic value of the FNAB. - The use of these ancillary tests is well established and rapidly developing in HIC, especially in the era of personalized medicine.

### Diagnosis and fine needle aspiration of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor by endoscopic ultrasound [^e5ece5cf]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

A recently established clinical entity, intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) of the pancreas embraces a spectrum of pathology ranging from benign to malignant disease. IPMT must be differentiated from other cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, as well as inflammatory cystic lesions. As the pancreas lies in close proximity to the gastric and duodenal walls, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is ideally suited for imaging the pancreas. Additionally, EUS facilitates fine needle aspiration of pancreatic cysts and/or a dilated pancreatic duct for cytologic and tumor marker analysis. This article presents a brief history of IPMT, differential diagnosis, current imaging modalities, findings of cytologic and tumor marker analysis, prognosis, and treatment strategy. Special emphasis is dedicated to the role of EUS, as well as EUS with fine needle aspiration.

### Update on salivary gland fine-needle aspiration and the milan system for reporting salivary gland cytopathology [^7f8948d3]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Context —

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a well-established procedure for the diagnosis and management of salivary gland lesions, despite challenges imposed by salivary gland tumor diversity, complexity, and cytomorphologic overlap. Until recently, the reporting of salivary gland FNA specimens was inconsistent among different institutions throughout the world, leading to diagnostic confusion among pathologists and clinicians. In 2015, an international group of pathologists initiated the development of an evidence-based tiered classification system for reporting salivary gland FNA specimens, the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC). The MSRSGC consists of 6 diagnostic categories, which incorporate the morphologic heterogeneity and overlap among various nonneoplastic, benign, and malignant lesions of the salivary glands. In addition, each MSRSGC diagnostic category is associated with a risk of malignancy and management recommendations.

Objective —

To review the current status of salivary gland FNA, core needle biopsies, ancillary studies, and the beneficial role of the MSRSGC in providing a framework for reporting salivary gland lesions and guiding clinical management.

Data Sources —

Literature review and personal institutional experience.

Conclusions —

The main goal of the MSRSGC is to improve communication between cytopathologists and treating clinicians, while also facilitating cytologic-histologic correlation, quality improvement, and research. Since its implementation, the MSRSGC has gained international acceptance as a tool to improve reporting standards and consistency in this complex diagnostic area, and it has been endorsed by the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology management guidelines for salivary gland cancer. The large amount of data from published studies using MSRSGC served as a basis for the recent update of the MSRSGC.

### Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary: a diagnostic work-up [^a08323c3]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

In the last half century, palpation-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology has been increasingly replaced with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology due to its superior diagnostic ability. Specifically, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology is better able to target smaller and less-palpable lesions, and more accurately avoid neighboring anatomical structures. A systematic review published by Conrad et al revealed that ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology produced lower non-diagnostic rates compared to palpation-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (6.7% vs. 20.7%, respectively). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology also gave rise to significantly lower rates of discordance with final surgical pathology compared to palpation-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (5.4% vs. 12.8%, respectively).

Core Needle Biopsy

Core needle biopsy is a minimally invasive technique that has been increasingly utilized in cases of non-diagnostic or inconclusive fine-needle aspiration cytology. There are concerns that core needle biopsy tracts may increase the risk of extranodal disease spread or tumor cell seeding, and bleeding, but these risks are rare and related to the anatomical location and the size of the needle used for the biopsy. The need to obtain a definitive diagnosis far outweighs these potential concerns.

In 2011, Novoa et al published a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies with a total of 1291 cervical lesions, demonstrating core needle biopsy's exceptional ability in assessing lymphadenopathies. Specifically, core needle biopsy displayed a 96% accuracy in its ability to identify malignancy in suspicious lymph nodes and provided a correct specific diagnosis in 87% of the cases. In samples histologically verified by excisional biopsy, core needle biopsy achieved greater accuracy (96% vs. 93%), specificity (99% vs. 96%), and negative predictive value (95% vs. 90%) compared to fine-needle aspiration cytology, although differences in sensitivity and positive predictive value were not statistically significant. In addition, while core needle biopsy is typically used in conjunction with ultrasonography, a study reported by Ferreira et al determined that core needle biopsy can be performed independently in an outpatient setting, with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 94%, 92%, and 100%, respectively. Despite these excellent results, ultrasonography-guided biopsy is still preferable, if available, to minimize the risk of complications.

With no benign findings, FNA indicated the need for surgery in all 34 patients (173)". Another study reported that "in a study of 91 cases, FNA findings were diagnostic of MTC in 89% of cases and indicated the need for surgery in 99% (174)". However, "in a meta-analysis of 15 publications, the accuracy of FNA in diagnosing MTC in patients with MTC nodules was less than 50%, IHC analysis of the FNA specimen and measurement of Ctn in the FNA aspirate were performed rarely (175)". Accuracy "has been reported to be markedly increased by IHC analysis of the FNA specimen and additionally by measuring Ctn levels in the FNA washout fluid (176)". Accordingly, "Therefore, FNA should be performed on thyroid nodules that are greater than 1 cm in size, depending on the ultrasound characteristics".

### Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of salivary gland lesions [^21d51063]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a well-established diagnostic approach for salivary gland lesions; however, lack of a standard system of terminology for classification of salivary gland neoplasms collected by FNA and the relatively high frequency of uncertainty of diagnosis are likely partly responsible for current confusion in the interpretation of these FNA samples.

Objective

To propose a novel classification system for reporting salivary gland FNA samples and summarize recent progress in application of molecular and immunohistochemical markers in selected salivary gland neoplasms.

Data Sources

Literature review and authors' personal practice experience.

Conclusions

The new classification system provides a more succinct, standardized interpretation of results and will ultimately assist in communication between clinicians, clinical decision making, and preoperative patient counseling. Impressive advances have been made in recent years in the understanding of molecular pathogenesis of salivary gland tumors. With the newly acquired diagnostic tools, significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy of salivary gland FNA can certainly be expected.

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^119e426a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Ancillary testing for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens in adult neck masses emphasizes optimizing specimen collection and enabling viral, immunophenotypic, and culture studies. Determination of HPV status is described as increasingly important in metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and at a minimum a portion of FNA material should be submitted in formalin or other suitable fixative for cell block to allow HPV in situ hybridization/polymerase chain reaction and/or p16 immunohistochemistry; laboratories may also coordinate liquid-based cytology molecular HPV testing with the pathology laboratory. Material for cell block can allow Epstein–Barr virus in situ hybridization in select circumstances, facilitate tumor immunophenotype characterization for other metastatic lesions to guide the search for a primary, and in possible lymphoma collection in tissue culture media such as Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium is important to allow immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry; when infection is considered, submission of some material for culture is also recommended. Consultation with a cytopathologist can help determine the best collection method based on the clinical differential diagnosis and laboratory preference.

### The evolving landscape of salivary gland tumors [^8bb31334]. CA (2023). Medium credibility.

PATHOLOGIC ANALYSIS OF THE SURGICALLY EXCISED TUMOR

A morphologic pattern-based approach, such as establishing a biphasic or monophasic population, and broadly categorizing the lesion as basaloid, oncocytoid, cystic/secretory/mucinous, or solid-nested/spindled can help focus the differential diagnosis and enable the selection of immunohistochemistry for classification(Figure 1). Challenging cases with significant morphologic or immunohistochemical overlap may require molecular studies for definitive classification. Benign salivary gland neoplasms (such as pleomorphic adenoma [PA], Warthin tumor, basal cell adenoma, and oncocytoma) are far more common, and some details are provided at the end of Table 1, but these are not the primary focus of this review.

### Warthin tumor: a potential source of diagnostic error [^fb335b3b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Warthin tumor, also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum, is a fairly common tumor. It makes up 14% to 30% of parotid tumors. There has been much interest in this tumor because of its typical and intriguing morphologic features: the association of benign-looking lymphoid and epithelial components and its frequent occurrence in the intraparotid or periparotid lymph nodes. Moreover, multifocal and/or bilateral Warthin tumors have been reported, and malignant transformation of Warthin tumor and its association with other malignancies have been documented. Warthin tumor can sometimes be confused with other pathologic lesions because of symptoms and signs that accompany the disease, so it could be treated as other pathologic lesions.

Patients and Methods

We present 3 patients. The first one had a differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, no lymph node metastasis, and a Warthin tumor of the left parotid gland. The other 2 patients presented monoclonal gammopathy and a high tracer uptake in the left parotid gland by the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography total body.

Results and Conclusions

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and histopathologic features of 3 cases where clinical presentation of a Warthin tumor lies in the possible errors in diagnosis and decision making and not least in the management of the patient.

Objective To identify clinical and ultrasonographic features that may help in predicting malignant tumors in patients with a diagnosis of follicular neoplasm on findings from fine-needle aspiration cytology because FNAC diagnosis of follicular neoplasm does not differentiate a benign tumor from a malignant tumor. Design Prospective study of 98 patients having a diagnosis of follicular neoplasm on FNAC. The combination of the 3 ultrasonographic features resulted in a sensitivity of 95. 0% and a specificity of
98. 6%. Older age, male sex, solitary nodule, and larger nodule size were not predictive for malignant neoplasms in patients with follicular neoplasm cytologic findings. The first step for the treatment of thyroid nodules is fine-needle aspiration biopsy, which is a reliable and simple diagnostic procedure.

Clinicians decide whether to perform surgery or to follow thyroid nodules according to the findings from fine-needle aspiration cytology. The routine application of this method reduced unnecessary surgery for patients with thyroid nodules. 1–3 However, FNAC is of limited value in the presence of indeterminate cytologic findings. We evaluated clinical and ultrasonographic features to predict malignant neoplasms in patients identified as having follicular neoplasm by FNAC. Fine-needle aspiration biopsies were performed using a 20- to 22-gauge needle attached to a 10- or 20-mL syringe and each nodule was aspirated at least 2 times; usually 4 smears were used. Diagnostic cytopathological examination of FNAB specimens was performed and reported by 2 experienced cytopathologists; the specimen was labeled as diagnostic if it contained a minimum of 6 groupings of thyroid epithelial cells, consisting of at least 10 cells per group.

Fine-needle aspiration, although very sensitive for the discrimination of malignant and benign nodules, has limited accuracy with follicular lesions. The cytological diagnosis of follicular neoplasm has continued to be a frustrating entity for pathologists, surgeons, and patients. The recommended treatment for follicular neoplasm is surgery, and up to 70% of these patients undergo surgery for benign disease. In this case, besides the increased costs, the patients are prone to increased risk of surgical morbidity. Moreover, in the case of a malignant lesion, the need for a completion thyroidectomy increases the risk of complications and doubles the cost.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — diagnostic verification, performance, and use are detailed. The diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can be verified by immunolocalization of calcitonin (Ctn), chromogranin, or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), by confirming lack of thyroglobulin staining, and by detecting elevated serum Ctn levels. In histological review of 34 patients with MTC, the diagnosis was correct in 28 cases, six cases were misdiagnosed, and FNA indicated the need for surgery in all 34 patients. In a study of 91 cases, FNA findings were diagnostic of MTC in 89% of cases and indicated the need for surgery in 99%. Although a meta-analysis of 15 publications reported accuracy less than 50% when immunohistochemistry (IHC) and calcitonin measurement in the FNA aspirate were rarely performed, diagnostic accuracy has been reported to be markedly increased by IHC of the FNA specimen and by measuring Ctn in the FNA washout fluid. The page states that FNA should be performed on thyroid nodules that are greater than 1 cm in size, depending on the ultrasound characteristics.

### FDG-PET / CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^c4d4f376]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Salivary glands

FDG is physiologically taken up by the salivary glands and excreted into saliva. Low to high FDG symmetrical uptake is noted in the parotid and submandibular glands (Fig. 3). Benign conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, viral infections, bacterial infections, obstructive lithiasis and radiation-induced sialadenitis can also cause increased FDG uptake in the salivary glands. Asymmetrical salivary gland uptake in the floor of the mouth can mimic focal areas of oral cavity malignancy. Asymmetrical submandibular gland uptake can be seen in patients who have undergone surgical removal of a gland with contralateral hypertrophy and in patients who have undergone unilateral radiation therapy (Fig. 4). This focal asymmetrical uptake may occasionally mimic metastatic adenopathy at level IB or II. While symmetrical diffuse uptake in the salivary glands may be physiological (Fig. 3), focal, asymmetrical uptake may also be suggestive of FDG-avid benign or malignant salivary gland tumours like Warthin tumour, pleomorphic adenoma, primary parotid lymphoma or intraparotid lymph node metastasis from skin cancer. The SUVs of most malignant parotid tumours are significantly higher than those of benign lesions. However, some benign tumours may show very high FDG uptake (typically Warthin tumours), thereby mimicking malignant disease, while a few malignant parotid gland neoplasms (typically adenoid cystic carcinomas, low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma or necrotic SCC) may have no significant FDG avidity. Also, some studies show that high-grade salivary gland malignancies are associated with higher SUVs compared with low grade malignancies. Smaller salivary gland tumours may be missed on CECT. Hence, in the presence of a focal asymmetrical FDG uptake, further evaluation with ultrasound (US)/US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (US FNAC) and/or MRI is often mandatory to reach the definitive diagnosis. Due to wide availability, low cost and high diagnostic accuracy, US is commonly used as a problem-solving modality for the evaluation of salivary gland conditions. Many authors advocate the use of US FNAC for the pre-operative evaluation of parotid masses due to its good diagnostic accuracy. One study shows that the positive predictive value of US FNAC for diagnosing parotid malignancy was 84.6% and the negative predictive value was 96.4%. Although MRI is mostly used for the precise assessment of tumour spread, it can also be used as an adjunct to differentiate between benign and malignant salivary gland tumours. Malignant salivary gland tumours are often associated with ill-defined margins, low T2 signal due to high cellularity, perineural spread most often along the facial nerve (when originating in the parotid gland), invasion of the mandible, skull base, subcutaneous fat or skin and lymph node metastases. Nevertheless, these signs may be absent in small-sized or well-differentiated malignant tumours, making differentiation from benign lesions difficult. Quantitative analysis with DWI may be of help as the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of benign tumours (1.72 × 10⁻³ mm²/s is often higher than that of malignant tumours (1.05 × 10⁻³ mm²/s (P < 0.001), with the exception of Whartin tumours, which typically show very low ADC values.

### Ultrasonography-guided core-needle biopsy of parotid gland masses [^74d558c5]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

An accurate diagnosis of a parotid gland mass is essential for adequate management. We determined the clinical efficacy of USCNB in diagnosing parotid gland masses by using cutting needles of different bores.

Methods

We reviewed records for 40 benign and 13 malignant parotid lesions. USCNB was performed by using 14-20-gauge needles (mean, 16.6 gauge) with one to five (mean, 2.43) passes and a 15-mm throw or specimen notch. Final diagnoses were established on the basis of surgicopathologic results in 31 cases, and on the basis of histopathologic analysis of biopsy specimens, clinical data, and/or imaging studies in 22, with a follow-up of 12.2–77.5 months (mean, 33.6 months).

Results

Compared with surgicopathology, USCNB had a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 97% in providing specific tissue diagnoses and in differentiating malignant from benign masses. Its positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 96%, respectively, in diagnosing malignancy. One patient (2%) had a local hematoma without sequela after surgical removal of a Warthin tumor. Core biopsy results were completely concordant with surgical findings in 30 (97%) of 31 cases.

Conclusion

USCNB is a safe and efficient diagnostic procedure with an accuracy of 97% in the pathologic diagnosis of parotid masses. It can be performed in an outpatient clinic and enables specific tissue diagnosis to obviate intraoperative frozen biopsy and unnecessary surgery. An 18-gauge needle is sufficient for accurate and specific tissue diagnosis of parotid masses.

### Pathologists at the leading edge of optimizing the tumor tissue journey for diagnostic accuracy and molecular testing [^e7ab8137]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

During tumor sampling, the physician performing the procedure aims to obtain an appropriate amount of cellular material for diagnosis and downstream testing while minimizing the risk of tumor spread, morbidity, and disruption of further procedures or treatment. Open (excisional or incisional) biopsy has been reported to have a diagnostic accuracy of 94% to 99%. However, such surgical options may be adding to the expense of obtaining a diagnostic tissue sample and carry an up to 16% risk of complications, including the development of hematoma, tumor spread, and wound-healing problems that may delay the initiation of adjuvant treatment.

Cytology sampling techniques were developed as less invasive alternatives to open biopsies and have led to the expansion of the cytopathology field. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a cost-effective and repeatable tissue sampling technique using a needle no bigger than 22 gauge and can be performed as an outpatient procedure requiring little equipment without raising any significant safety concerns related to discomfort, complications, wound healing, or tumor spread. When coupled with onsite evaluation, FNA allows the fast assessment of morphologic results even for inoperable tumors, reducing the need for invasive exploratory procedures and the use of frozen tissue sections. Nonetheless, the diagnostic accuracy of FNA is dependent on the location and size of the tumor, the expertise of the physician performing the procedure, and the quality of the sample preparation. In addition, the diagnostic interpretation skills of the pathologist evaluating the cytology sample, developed with appropriate training and dedication, are also crucial for the accurate assessment of an FNA cytology sample. Furthermore, FNA cytology may not provide enough material to allow for ancillary studies and lacks information on the architectural features of the tissue sampled. This observation has deterred some institutions from effectively adopting FNA in their diagnostic workflow.

Core needle biopsy (CNB) was developed as an alternative to FNA, using a 10- to 16-gauge needle to provide a cylindrical core of tissue, thereby allowing for the evaluation of tissue architectural features. Both CNB and FNA are easy techniques for the interventional physicians to learn and perform, and they offer a satisfactory safety profile, fast sample preparation, and fast turnaround of preliminary evaluation compared with open biopsies. However, CNB provides larger tumor tissue samples but comes with added risks of complications compared with FNA, such as bleeding, added costs, and longer turnaround time. Similar to FNA, the use and reliability of CNB are also dependent on the accessibility of the tumor. Overall, CNB has been reported to provide higher diagnostic accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity than FNA.

### The role of fine needle aspiration in the diagnosis of parotid gland tumors: correlation with preoperative computerized tomography tumor size [^a7557e82]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of parotid gland masses is still controversial, regarding its sensitivity and specificity that vary between 41% and 100% and between 86% and 100% respectively. The aim of this study was to identify the specificity and sensitivity of FNAC of parotid gland tumors in relation to the tumor size as characterized preoperatively by computer tomography. The medical files of 79 patients whom were referred to the MaxilloFacila Surgery Department, Rambam medical center, over a 10.5-year period (2000–2010) were analyzed retrospectively. The extensity of the operation was determined by the location of the tumor as presented in computed tomography (CT) radiography, and preoperative FNAC examination. The majority of the masses were located in the superficial lobe (88.52%), and only 11.48% of the patients were located in the deep lobe (8:1 ratio). FNAC results were nondiagnostic in 7 patients (8.86%), 62 patients were diagnosed as inflammatory and benign lesion in (78.48%), malignant tumors were diagnosed in 10 patients (12.65%). The sensitivity in our study was 90%, the specificity was 98%, positive predictive value was 90%, negative predictive value was 98%, and diagnostic accuracy was 88%. The positive predictive value was 90%, the negative predictive value was 98%. Analyzing the effect of the preoperative CT size upon the accuracy of the FNAC diagnosis, we found that lesion with preoperative CT size greater than 24 mm has a more accurate FNAC result (P = 0.034).

### Clinical practice guideline: evaluation of the neck mass in adults [^872826c6]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) — Open biopsy should be avoided whenever possible due to risks of nonhealing wounds, regional recurrence, and distant metastasis, and FNA can be performed at the time of initial consultation prior to additional imaging by experienced physicians. Diagnostic performance from a meta-analysis showed an overall accuracy of 93.1% (range, 73.3%-98.0%), with overall sensitivity 89.6%, specificity 96.5%, positive predictive value 96.2%, and negative predictive value 90.3%. By anatomic site, thyroid and salivary gland FNA had lower sensitivities (81.1 and 82.5%, respectively) while lymph node FNA had a higher sensitivity (92.5%). Safety data indicate aspiration of head and neck lesions is safe with only rare major complications, and the crude risk of tumor seeding after FNA was 0.00012%. There are no absolute contraindications to FNA of a neck mass; imaging is recommended prior to FNA for any suspected vascular lesion, and use of anticoagulation therapy does not result in increased risk of bleeding after neck FNA and therefore is also not considered an absolute contraindication.

DIAGNOSIS OF SALIVARY GLAND CARCINOMAS

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is commonly used in the initial evaluation of a salivary gland lesion for several reasons. First, it is a rapid and minimally invasive technique with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. On-site evaluation capabilities can provide useful information, including whether the lesion represents a primary salivary gland tumor or metastasis (in the appropriate clinical context) and whether the lesion is high-grade or low-grade, which can help with surgical planning. Second, FNAs enable the collection of sufficient material to triage for appropriate ancillary studies, including for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Finally, in patients who have unresectable disease or are recommended to proceed with primary systemic therapy, cytologic material can be used for molecular studies to identify potential targetable alterations.

The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology was established in 2018 for the standardized reporting of salivary gland cytology findings. The six-tiered system consists of nondiagnostic, nonneoplastic, atypia of undetermined significance, benign neoplasm, salivary gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, suspicious for malignancy, and malignant. Each category has an associated risk of malignancy based on aggregated data from multiple institutions, which can help guide clinicians in making management decisions (Table 2). The criteria have been reviewed elsewhere in greater detail. –

Although FNA cytology can be helpful to guide management, particularly in cases that are classified as nonneoplastic, benign neoplasm, and malignant, indeterminate lesions (classified as atypia of undetermined significance, salivary gland neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential, or suspicious for malignancy) that cannot be further resolved on ancillary testing may require surgical evaluation with intraoperative frozen consultation. The most important challenge is to determine whether the lesion is low-grade or high-grade or if it is a certain histologic type (i.e. ADCC), because this can drive the extent of surgery, most notably the decision to include or omit a neck dissection. Sampling representative areas that appear distinct within the tumor may provide insight into whether there are high-grade features, including tumor necrosis, marked nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity. Ultimately, if a lesion is encapsulated/well demarcated, then the evaluation of invasion will require submission of the entire periphery for histologic examination.

### Value of fine-needle aspiration biopsy of salivary gland lesions [^9d1e697c]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to assess the utility of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in the diagnosis and treatment planning of the lesions of the salivary gland.

Methods

Eight hundred seventy-nine aspiration biopsies of the lesion of the salivary gland over a 10-year period, from 1997 to 2006, were reviewed with special reference to its value in the clinical treatment of patients.

Results

Cytologic as well as histologic diagnoses of 382 patients were available. In these diagnoses, the sensitivity of malignancy was 83% and specificity was 99%. The positive predictive value was 98%, and the negative predictive value was 97%. The overall accuracy was 93%. The correct subtyping of the benign lesions was 97%, and the exact type-specific concordance of the malignant lesions was 71%.

Conclusion

Considerable benefit to the patient may result from the cautious use of FNAB of lesions of the salivary gland. The close co-operation between pathologist and surgeon can improve individual treatment.

- aspiration of at least 2 sites within the nodule

- prioritize nodules to be sampled according to ultrasound findings in case of multiple nodules

- sample solid or vascularized areas with FNA and submit cyst fluid for cytologic examination

- review the slides with an experienced cytopathologist

- follow-up on benign nodules

- repeat FNA in benign nodules with suspicious clinical or ultrasound findings

- sample peripheral and possibly solid areas of large-sized thyroid lesions to avoid fluid or necrotic zones.

### Value of fine-needle aspiration cytology of parotid gland masses [^60f39312]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in the diagnosis of parotid gland masses.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review of patients undergoing FNAC.

Methods

Between January 1990 and December 1998, 410 parotid glands were resected at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Berne, Inselpital (Berne, Switzerland). Included in the study were 228 cases with preoperative FNAC. In a retrospective study the results of FNAC were analyzed and compared with the corresponding histopathological diagnosis.

Results

Histological evaluation revealed 65 malignant tumors and 163 benign lesions (150 neoplasms and 13 nonneoplastic lesions). The cytological findings were nondiagnostic in 13 (5.7%), true-negative in 146 (64%), true-positive in 39 (17%), false-negative in 22 (9.8%) and false-positive in 8 (4.5%) cases in detecting malignant tumors. Nineteen of 39 (49%) malignant tumors (true-positive) and 123 of 146 (84%) benign lesions (true-negative) were classified accurately. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 86%, 64%, and 95% respectively.

Conclusions

Fine-needle aspiration cytology is a valuable adjunct to preoperative assessment of parotid masses. Preoperative recognition of malignant tumors may help prepare both the surgeon and patient for an appropriate surgical procedure.

Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy

Fine-needle aspiration cytology is preferable, since it is easier, safer, and cost effective, reserving core needle biopsy for those whose results are non-diagnostic.

Complications related to fine-needle aspiration cytology are rare and generally limited to vasovagal reactions and slight discomfort following aspiration. In 2008, Tandon et al published a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic efficacy of fine-needle aspiration cytology, involving 30 studies and 3459 aspirates. This study reported a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 89.6%, 96.5%, 93.1%, 96.2%, and 90.3%, respectively, which were similar to those identified in their 10-year institutional review of 2702 head and neck aspirates, substantiating reports of fine-needle aspiration cytology's reliability. Factors such as inadequate sampling, insufficient material, faulty interpretation, and lack of triage necessary for ancillary studies have long been known to weaken the diagnostic capacity of fine-needle aspiration cytology. However, the recent disparities in fine-needle aspiration cytology efficacy may be explained by a dwindling number of cytopathologist-performed biopsies. In a comparative study of fine-needle aspiration cytology performed by cytopathologists versus clinicians, Wu et al demonstrated that 83% of cytopathologist-performed biopsies were diagnostic compared to 24% of clinicians-performed biopsies. Ninety-four percent of cytopathologist-performed biopsies also indicated agreement with final surgical pathology in comparison to only 67% of clinicians-performed biopsies. A recent study examining the impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pathologist, versus surgeon-performed fine-needle aspiration cytology demonstrated similar results to the study reported by Wu et al. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 era, COVID-19 lockdown required more surgeon-performed than pathologist-performed biopsies, and this change resulted in a corroborating increase in the fine-needle aspiration cytology nondiagnostic rate. Overall, studies have shown that fine-needle aspiration cytology reliability is improved when conducted in tandem by specialized physicians and experienced cytopathologists.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^5291fc8d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma — management of nodules with follicular or oncocytic neoplasm cytology specifies that patients who are clinically euthyroid with a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and a hot nodule on thyroid imaging should be evaluated and treated for thyrotoxicosis as indicated even when cytology is suspicious for follicular neoplasm; those with a hypofunctional (cold or warm) nodule and with suspicious clinical and sonographic features should proceed to surgery. Those with an increased or normal TSH and cytology suspicious for follicular or oncocytic neoplasm should undergo diagnostic lobectomy unless molecular diagnostic testing predicts a low risk of malignancy; in patients with follicular or oncocytic neoplasm on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) who are selected for thyroid surgery to obtain a definitive diagnosis, total thyroidectomy is recommended for bilateral disease, unilateral disease > 4 cm (especially in individuals AMAB), invasive cancer, metastatic cancer, or if the patient prefers this approach. Molecular diagnostic testing may be useful for follicular neoplasms, and 5% to 10% of patients with papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma have tumors that aggressively invade structures in the neck or have produced distant metastases.

### Preoperative diagnosis of clear cell "sugar" tumor of the lung by computed tomography-guided fine-needle biopsy and core-needle biopsy [^86d6c90d]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Clear cell "sugar" tumor (CCST) of the lung is a very rare benign neoplasm believed to arise from epithelioid cells of perivascular differentiation. This tumor is typically diagnosed by thoracotomy. To our knowledge, only 2 case reports of CCST have been previously published: one case in which cytologic findings were subsequently confirmed histologically and ultrastructurally to be CCST, and one case of CCST diagnosed preoperatively by transbronchial core-needle biopsy. We here depict an additional case of CCST of the lung that was preoperatively diagnosed by computed tomography-guided transthoracic fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core-needle biopsy. We underscore the importance of cytologic and histologic correlation and the role of ancillary studies in differentiating this lesion from other primary or metastatic clear cell tumors of the lung.

Tumors in the parapharyngeal space are rare, and preoperative diagnosis is difficult because of anatomical and histological complexity.

Methods

To evaluate the usefulness of preoperative diagnosis, we compared the classification of tumor localization in the prestyloid and retrostyloid compartments by imaging and preoperative cytological diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration cytology with the postoperative histopathological diagnosis in 120 patients with tumors in the parapharyngeal space.

Results

Tumors were located in the prestyloid and retrostyloid compartments in 68 and 52 patients, respectively. The majority of histopathological diagnoses in the prestyloid and retrostyloid compartments were pleomorphic adenoma and schwannoma, respectively. All malignant tumors were in the prestyloid compartment. The preoperative cytological diagnostic rate for benign or malignant tumor was 95.2%, which was not inferior to that for other head and neck lesions.

Conclusion

Our results suggested that the preoperative classification of tumor localization and cytological diagnosis improved the accuracy of presumptive diagnosis.

Follicular thyroid carcinoma — pathology, diagnosis, and prognosis — is identified as cancer by follicular cell invasion of the tumor capsule and/or blood vessels, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or frozen section study cannot differentiate a minimally invasive follicular thyroid carcinoma from a follicular adenoma, so diagnosis is assigned only after analysis of permanent histologic sections showing tumor capsular invasion by follicular cells. Highly invasive follicular thyroid carcinomas are much less common and up to 80% of these cancers metastasize, causing death in about 20% of patients; mortality rates for papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas are similar in comparable age and stage, patients with either cancer can have an excellent prognosis if tumors are confined to the thyroid, are small, and are minimally invasive, but outcomes are far less favorable if disease is highly invasive or distant metastases develop.

### Liver biopsy [^2fb315d9]. Hepatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Mass lesions — most experts consider biopsy of most liver mass lesions to be a safe and effective means to provide important clinical information, and most experts prefer that the core sample rather than aspirates be obtained if a diagnosis of neoplasia is being entertained; in general, fine-needle aspiration provides cytology, which typically has less diagnostic value than an adequate core biopsy. Caveats include that biopsy of known vascular lesions should generally be avoided, US with color Doppler can help identify and avoid larger vessels, and biopsy of malignant lesions is associated with a risk of tumor spread usually along the biopsy tract, although this risk is almost certainly overstated in earlier literature.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^aa728fea]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid carcinoma — management of follicular/oncocytic neoplasm with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assessment is described: serum TSH with iodine-123 or technetium-99m scanning may identify an autonomously functioning "hot" nodule, and molecular diagnostic testing may be useful for follicular neoplasms. Patients who are clinically euthyroid with a low TSH and a hot nodule on thyroid imaging should be evaluated and treated for thyrotoxicosis as indicated even when cytology is suspicious for follicular neoplasm. Those with a hypofunctional (cold or warm) nodule and with suspicious clinical and sonographic features should proceed to surgery. For increased or normal TSH with cytology suspicious for follicular or oncocytic neoplasm, patients should undergo diagnostic lobectomy, unless molecular diagnostic testing predicts a low risk of malignancy, while in those selected for surgery with follicular or oncocytic neoplasm on FNA, total thyroidectomy is recommended for bilateral disease, unilateral disease > 4 cm (especially in individuals AMAB), invasive cancer, metastatic cancer, or if the patient prefers this approach. Notably, 5% to 10% of patients with papillary, follicular, or oncocytic carcinoma have tumors that aggressively invade structures in the neck or have produced distant metastases.
