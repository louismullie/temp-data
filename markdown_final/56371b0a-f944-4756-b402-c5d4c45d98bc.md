## Question

what is the best way to titrate buprenorphine in a patient with opioid use disorder?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best way to titrate buprenorphine in a patient with opioid use disorder, including initiation, titration, stabilization, special populations, monitoring, and documentation, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pre-initiation assessment and timing to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Then, I should verify the initial dosing strategy and whether to use standard or low-dose initiation. Next, I will examine titration targets, dose ceilings, and the fentanyl-era evidence. After that, I need to consider stabilization, maintenance, and special populations such as pregnancy, hepatic impairment, and pain. Finally, I will review monitoring, safety, and documentation, and close with a concise synthesis of the best-practice approach.

> Let me first confirm the pre-initiation assessment elements and timing thresholds. I need to check the last opioid use, type of opioid, and route to estimate when objective withdrawal will emerge. For short-acting opioids, wait at least 6–12 hours, for long-acting opioids or methadone, wait 24–72 hours, and for fentanyl, consider waiting until moderate withdrawal with COWS around 13 or higher due to its long half-life and high receptor occupancy, which increases precipitated withdrawal risk [^113JpPeS] [^116E1mQa]. Hold on, I should verify the withdrawal severity tool; COWS of 11–12 generally indicates sufficient withdrawal for safe initiation, and I should document objective signs before giving the first dose to mitigate precipitated withdrawal risk [^113JpPeS] [^114U7e9y].

> Next, I should review the initial dosing strategy. Standard initiation is 2–4 mg sublingual buprenorphine when objective withdrawal is present, with observation and redosing in 2–4 mg increments every 1–2 hours as needed, typically totaling 8–12 mg on day 1, then advancing to 16 mg by day 2 if tolerated [^116E1mQa] [^115chZXa]. Wait, let me verify the day-1 ceiling; some guidance caps day 1 at 8–12 mg, but ED high-dose protocols have safely administered higher totals with low precipitated withdrawal rates, so I should individualize based on setting, monitoring, and patient risk while acknowledging that formal evidence is observational [^116E1mQa] [^115iHPp8]. I need to ensure I also consider low-dose initiation when withdrawal is undesirable or impractical; starting with 0.5–2 mg while continuing full agonists and escalating over 3–7 days can avoid precipitated withdrawal, though evidence is limited and protocols vary by setting [^1153RLms] [^113HXtSo].

> I will now examine titration targets and dose ceilings. Let me think about the dose–response relationship; evidence supports titrating to at least 16 mg/day, with many patients benefiting from 24–32 mg/day, particularly in the fentanyl era where higher tolerance may necessitate higher buprenorphine doses for blockade and craving suppression [^113BFD1e] [^111zxCHM]. Hold on, I should verify the regulatory ceiling; the FDA label historically capped dosing at 24 mg/day, but contemporary data suggest benefits up to 32 mg/day and call for label modernization, so I should use shared decision-making to titrate to clinical effect while documenting rationale if exceeding legacy limits [^111zxCHM] [^1117G1EV]. I should double-check real-world signals; a cohort in the fentanyl era showed improved retention at 24 mg vs 16 mg, and a prospective study suggested better outcomes at 32 mg vs 24 mg, supporting higher dosing when clinically indicated [^11479HKD] [^117SSiyb].

> Let me consider stabilization and maintenance. Stabilization typically occurs within 1–3 days, aiming for 24-hour control of withdrawal and cravings with once-daily dosing. However, for co-occurring pain, split dosing every 6–8 hours may improve analgesia while maintaining withdrawal suppression, so I should tailor frequency to pain needs and response [^112AUnA7] [^1119dVP7]. I should confirm there is no recommended time limit for buprenorphine treatment; maintenance should continue as long as beneficial, with tapering considered only when the patient is stable and engaged, and if pursued, done gradually over months with close monitoring and overdose risk counseling [^1163UdGx] [^111pLDoC].

> But wait, what if the patient is using fentanyl or has high opioid tolerance. I need to ensure a higher starting and target dose is considered, with some clinicians favoring day-1 totals approaching 16–24 mg in monitored settings to rapidly achieve receptor saturation and reduce early relapse risk, recognizing that precipitated withdrawal risk is mitigated by accurate timing and observation rather than necessarily by lower starting doses alone [^116E1mQa] [^115iHPp8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; although ED high-dose protocols show low precipitated withdrawal rates, evidence is observational, so I should use clinical judgment, monitor closely, and counsel patients about symptoms to report during induction [^111d4Fvd].

> I should confirm special populations and adjustments. In pregnancy, dose adjustments are less commonly needed than with methadone, but split dosing can be used for afternoon or evening discomfort, and buprenorphine should be continued postpartum with monitoring for dose needs and sedation risk [^117Fuh3p] [^115Md473]. For hepatic impairment, I need to reduce starting and titration doses by about half in severe impairment and monitor for toxicity; no adjustment is needed for mild impairment, and moderate impairment warrants caution with monitoring [^111j22sQ]. For patients with co-occurring pain, I should consider split dosing or temporary dose increases for acute pain, and in supervised settings, adding short-acting full agonists for severe pain can be effective without discontinuing buprenorphine, though I must monitor for oversedation and respiratory depression [^1119dVP7] [^116xuWs3].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. Initially, I need frequent visits, often weekly early on, with urine drug testing to assess adherence and illicit use, and to guide dose titration. This early intensity reduces diversion risk and supports stabilization [^113BP7wK] [^114Rm3JF]. I need to check for sedation, respiratory depression, and CNS depressant co-use, counsel on naloxone, and plan for care coordination at discharge or transitions to outpatient care to sustain engagement [^113exgX4] [^111AwmLy]. If there is ongoing opioid use or persistent cravings, I should consider increasing the dose up to 32 mg/day, add psychosocial support as indicated, or discuss switching to methadone if buprenorphine is inadequate despite optimal dosing and technique [^111zxCHM] [^117KLkuj].

> I will now examine documentation and communication. I should confirm that each visit captures COWS scores, dose changes, adverse effects, and functional outcomes; for transitions, I must communicate with inpatient teams, surgeons, anesthesia, and outpatient providers to ensure continuity, and I should document the rationale if dosing exceeds legacy label limits using patient-centered goals and current evidence [^111wV5RS] [^111zxCHM]. Hold on, I should verify that patient education includes administration technique, missed-dose guidance, and overdose risk if treatment is discontinued, and that all dosing decisions are anchored in shared decision-making [^1143GYzE] [^111zxCHM].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the best-practice titration approach. Pre-initiation timing to objective withdrawal with COWS, a standard 2–4 mg start with 2–4 mg increments every 1–2 hours to 8–12 mg on day 1, escalation to 16–24 mg by day 2, and further titration to 24–32 mg as needed to suppress withdrawal and cravings, represents a clinically sound, evidence-aligned pathway, with low-dose initiation reserved for those unable to tolerate withdrawal or in special settings like the hospital [^116E1mQa] [^115chZXa] [^111zxCHM]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with contemporary guidance; VA/DoD supports individualized titration to 12–16 mg, often up to 32 mg, and ASAM supports rapid upward titration to a dose that provides 24-hour stability, which matches the fentanyl-era need for higher, quickly achieved maintenance doses [^1143GYzE] [^113BFD1e].

> Finally, I need to ensure my plan acknowledges uncertainties and the evolving evidence base. The FDA label remains more conservative than current practice and research, particularly regarding dose ceilings; I should be transparent with patients, use shared decision-making, and document clinical rationale when individualizing beyond legacy limits, while monitoring for safety and advocating for evidence-based label updates [^111zxCHM] [^1117G1EV]. Hold on, I should verify that my approach remains adaptable as new randomized data emerge, especially for fentanyl-exposed populations and novel formulations, to keep care aligned with the best available evidence [^112zxPQL].

Titration of buprenorphine for OUD should start with **2–4 mg SL** [^114XSVxP] when the patient shows objective withdrawal signs (COWS ≥ 11–12) [^113JpPeS], then increase by **2–8 mg every 2–4 hours** [^115chZXa] to suppress cravings and withdrawal, typically reaching 16–24 mg/day by day 1–2 [^notfound]. For fentanyl exposure, consider higher initial doses (up to 8–12 mg) [^111d4Fvd] and **more frequent dosing** to reduce precipitated withdrawal and improve retention [^notfound]. Use low-dose initiation (microdosing) [^1153RLms] if the patient cannot tolerate withdrawal, titrating slowly while continuing full agonists [^113vEH48]. Monitor for precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression, and adjust the dose based on clinical response, aiming for 16–32 mg/day [^111zxCHM]; doses above 24 mg/day are generally not recommended due to limited added benefit and diversion risk [^113BFD1e].

---

## Initial dosing and induction

- **Initial dose**: 2–4 mg SL when objective withdrawal signs are present (COWS ≥ 11–12) [^113JpPeS] [^113tFQ9u].
- **Timing**: Start ≥ 6–12 hours after short-acting opioids [^113JpPeS] and ≥ 24–48 hours after long-acting opioids or methadone [^113bmEaL].
- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Avoid by ensuring withdrawal before the first dose [^113tFQ9u] [^113JpPeS].

---

## Titration strategy

- **Increment**: Increase by 2–8 mg every 2–4 hours [^notfound] based on withdrawal and craving control [^114RSNTE].
- **Day 1 target**: Typically 8–16 mg total [^notfound], with many reaching 16–24 mg/day by day 1–2 [^notfound].
- **Observation**: Reassess 1–2 hours after each dose for withdrawal control and adverse effects [^115chZXa].

---

## Special considerations

### Fentanyl exposure

In fentanyl exposure, **higher initial doses** (up to 8–12 mg) [^notfound] and more frequent dosing may be needed to reduce precipitated withdrawal and improve retention [^notfound]. Evidence: ED high-dose protocols show low precipitated withdrawal and good tolerability [^116E1mQa] [^115iHPp8].

---

### Low-dose initiation (microdosing)

Use **low-dose initiation** [^111EE7TM] for patients who cannot tolerate withdrawal, starting at 0.5–2 mg/day and increasing slowly while continuing full agonists until stable on buprenorphine [^1153RLms]. Benefit: minimal withdrawal and improved adherence [^111EE7TM].

---

## Monitoring and safety

- **Clinical response**: Monitor for withdrawal control, craving suppression, and adverse effects [^1143GYzE].
- **Adverse effects**: Watch for precipitated withdrawal, sedation, and respiratory depression, especially with CNS depressants [^113exgX4].
- **Diversion risk**: Use observed dosing and frequent follow-up early in treatment [^111pLDoC].

---

## Long-term maintenance and dose adjustment

- **Maintenance dose**: Typically 16–32 mg/day, individualized to clinical response [^111zxCHM] [^114RSNTE].
- **Dose adjustments**: Modify based on cravings, withdrawal, side effects, and patient preference [^1143GYzE].
- **Upper limit**: Doses > 24 mg/day are generally not recommended due to limited added benefit and diversion risk [^113BFD1e].

## Buprenorphine titration protocol

| **Phase** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 2–4 mg SL | Once | Start when COWS ≥ 11–12 [^113JpPeS] |
| Titration | 2–8 mg increments | Every 2–4 hours | Titrate to withdrawal control [^111EE7TM] |
| Day 1 target | 8–16 mg total | Multiple doses | Adjust to clinical response [^1143GYzE] |
| Maintenance | 16–32 mg/day | Once daily | Individualize to response [^111zxCHM] |
| Fentanyl exposure | Up to 8–12 mg initial | More frequent | Reduce precipitated withdrawal [^113LmRhK] |
| Microdosing | 0.5–2 mg/day | Daily | Gradual titration with full agonists [^1153RLms] |

---

Titration of buprenorphine should be **individualized**, starting at 2–4 mg SL [^114XSVxP] and increasing by 2–8 mg every 2–4 hours to control withdrawal and cravings, typically reaching 16–24 mg/day by day 1–2 [^116E1mQa]. For fentanyl exposure, consider higher initial doses and more frequent dosing; use low-dose initiation when withdrawal cannot be tolerated [^1153RLms]. Monitor closely for adverse effects and adjust the dose to maintain 16–32 mg/day, balancing efficacy with safety and diversion risk [^111zxCHM].

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate buprenorphine in patients with OUD able to give informed consent and not having specific contraindications for this treatment.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116xuWs3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) — acute pain management in outpatient and inpatient settings: If pharmacological treatment is considered, non-opioid analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and non-opioid medications with pain modulating properties should be tried first. For patients with pain who have an active OUD but are not in treatment, methadone or buprenorphine should be considered, and the patient's OUD and pain should be stabilized and managed concurrently. For patients taking methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, temporarily increasing the dose or dosing frequency may be effective for pain. For patients taking methadone who have acute pain refractory to other treatments and require additional opioid-based analgesia, adding a short acting full agonist opioid to the regular methadone dose can be considered, with doses anticipated to be higher than in opioid-naïve individuals. Patients receiving buprenorphine who have moderate to severe acute pain refractory to other treatments may benefit from as-needed buprenorphine doses. The addition of a short-acting full agonist opioid to the patient's regular dose of buprenorphine can be effective for severe acute pain in supervised settings (e.g., hospitalization), and the dose is anticipated to be higher than typical in opioid‑naïve individuals; the committee was unable to come to consensus on whether this adjunct can be safely prescribed in ambulatory care settings.

### Buprenorphine, pain, and opioid use in patients taking high-dose long-term opioids: a randomized clinical trial [^116UfMhn]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend dose reduction or discontinuation of long-term opioid therapy when harm outweighs benefit, but strategies to help patients do so are limited.

Objective

To test optionally switching to buprenorphine as a strategy for improving pain and reducing opioids among patients prescribed high-dose, full agonist long-term opioid therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this pragmatic, multisite, 12-month randomized clinical trial with masked outcome assessment, patients treated at Veterans Affairs primary care clinics were recruited from October 2017 to March 2021, with follow-up completed June 2022. Eligible patients had moderate to severe chronic pain despite high-dose opioid therapy (≥ 70 mg/d for at least 3 months). Patients were randomized to having the option to switch to buprenorphine or not having the option to switch.

Interventions

The buprenorphine option was discussed with eligible patients as part of a larger trial of collaborative pain care interventions. Those who switched had structured follow-up to optimize dosing and address adverse effects.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was Brief Pain Inventory total score at 12 months. The main secondary outcome was opioid dose in morphine milligram equivalents at 12 months.

Results

Of 207 included participants, 185 (89.4%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 60.9 (10.2) years. A total of 104 were randomized to the buprenorphine option and 103 to the no buprenorphine option. In the buprenorphine option arm, 27 participants (26.0%) switched. Over 12 months, the mean (SD) Brief Pain Inventory score improved from 6.8 (1.5) to 6.1 (1.9; adjusted mean difference [AMD], -0.59; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.29) in the buprenorphine option arm and from 6.8 (1.6) to 6.3 (1.7; AMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.81 to 0.20) in the no option arm (between-group AMD, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.52 to 0.34). Over 12 months, mean (SD) opioid dosage decreased from 157 (75) mg/d to 94 (98) mg/d in the buprenorphine option arm (AMD, -61.0 mg/d; 95% CI, -74.1 to -47.9) and from 165 (88) mg/d to 107 (89) mg/d (AMD, -58.5 mg/d; 95% CI, -71.6 to -45.4) in the no option arm (between-group AMD, -2.5 mg/d; 95% CI, -21.1 to 16.0).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this trial, outcomes did not differ between groups; both had small improvements in pain and substantial reductions in opioid dosage, but the proportion of participants who switched to buprenorphine was low.

### Strategies for transfer from methadone to buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders and associated outcomes: a systematic review [^111bES2C]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Initial Buprenorphine Dose on First Day

The weighted mean initial buprenorphine dose on the first day was 3.3 mg. In 10 studies, the initial buprenorphine dose on the first day was fixed. In another study, the initial buprenorphine dose was administered via a transdermal patch that delivered 35 μg/h. The remaining studies allowed the initial dose on the first day to vary.,

Most studies assessed response to the initial dose of buprenorphine and administered at least 1 additional dose later on the first day if response was insufficient. However, in 6 studies –, and 1 arm of a seventh, patients received only a single first-day buprenorphine dose.

Total First-day Dose of Buprenorphine

The crude and weighted mean total buprenorphine doses on the first day were 8.6 and 7.8 mg, respectively. The lowest total first-day fixed dose was 2 mg, and the lowest possible total first-day flexible-dose was 1 mg. The highest initial fixed or flexible total daily dose on the first day was 32 mg.

### Association between dynamic dose increases of buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder and risk of relapse [^1143mNoe]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Dynamic, adaptive pharmacologic treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) has been previously recommended over static dosing to prevent relapse, and is aligned with personalized medicine. However, there has been no quantitative evidence demonstrating its advantage. Our objective was to estimate the extent to which a hypothetical intervention that increased buprenorphine dose in response to opioid use would affect risk of relapse over 24weeks of follow-up.

Design

A secondary analysis of the buprenorphine arm of an open-label randomized controlled 24-week comparative effectiveness trial, 2014–17.

Setting

Eight community addiction treatment programs in the United States.

Participants

English-speaking adults with DSM-5 OUD, recruited during inpatient admission (n = 270). Participants were mainly white (65%) and male (72%).

Intervention(S)

Participants were treated with daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX), with dose based on clinical indication, determined by the provider. We examined a hypothetical intervention of increasing dose in response to opioid use.

Measurements

Outcome was relapse to regular opioid use during the 24weeks of outpatient treatment, assessed in a survival framework. We estimated the relapse-free survival curves of participants under a hypothetical (i.e. counterfactual) intervention in which their BUP-NX dosage would be increased following their own subject-specific opioid use during the first 12weeks of treatment versus a hypothetical intervention in which dose would remain constant.

Findings

We estimated that increasing BUP-NX dose in response to recent opioid use would lower risk of relapse by 19.17 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI) = -32.17, -6.18) (additive risk)] and 32% (0.68, 95% CI = 0.49, 0.86) (relative risk). The number-needed-to-treat with this intervention to prevent a single relapse is 6.

Conclusions

In people with opioid use disorder, a hypothetical intervention that increases sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone dose in response to opioid use during the first 12weeks of treatment appears to reduce risk of relapse over 24weeks, compared with holding the dose constant after week 2.

### Low-dose buprenorphine initiation in hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder: a retrospective cohort analysis [^117VARnG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) can initiate buprenorphine without requiring a withdrawal period through a low-dose (sometimes referred to as "micro-induction") approach. Although there is growing interest in low-dose buprenorphine initiation, current evidence is limited to case reports and small case series.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with OUD seen by a hospital-based addiction medicine consult service who underwent low-dose buprenorphine initiation starting during hospital admission. We then integrated our practice-based experiences with results from the existing literature to create practice considerations.

Results

Sixty-eight individuals underwent 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations between July 2019 and July 2020. Reasons for low-dose versus standard buprenorphine initiation included co-occurring pain (91.7%), patient anxiety around the possibility of withdrawal (69.4%), history of precipitated withdrawal (9.7%), opioid withdrawal intolerance (6.9%), and other reason/not specified (18.1%). Of the 72 low-dose buprenorphine initiations, 50 (69.4%) were completed in the hospital, 9 (12.5%) transitioned to complete as an outpatient, and 13 (18.1%) were terminated early. We apply our experiences and findings from literature to recommendations for varied clinical scenarios, including acute illness, co-occurring pain, opioid withdrawal intolerance, transition from high dose methadone to buprenorphine, history of precipitated withdrawal, and rapid hospital discharge. We share a standard low-dose initiation protocol with potential modifications based on above scenarios.

Conclusions

Low-dose buprenorphine initiation offers a well-tolerated and versatile approach for hospitalized patients with OUD. We share lessons from our experiences and the literature, and provide practical considerations for providers.

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^113RkEfS]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Consensus Recommendation

Clinical best judgment should be used to individualize any conversion, but the following can be considered while noting that some downward titration may be necessary for patients on high opioid doses:

For patients taking doses below the following amounts (∼ ≤ 90 MME):

Fentanyl transdermal: ≤ 25 µg/h
Oxycodone: ≤ 60 mg/d
Hydrocodone or morphine: ≤ 90 mg/d
Hydromorphone: ≤ 16 mg/d
Oxymorphone: ≤ 45 mg/d
Tapentadol: Any dose

Discontinue after the last nighttime dose.
Consider initiating an adrenergic α 2 agonist (e.g. clonidine, lofexidine) or an immediate-release opioid (e.g. current opioid) to reduce the risk of withdrawal.
Initiate buprenorphine the following morning per the prescribing information, as either 10-µg/h transdermal buprenorphine or 150-µg buccal buprenorphine twice daily. Titrate buprenorphine as needed for pain per recommendations in the prescribing information.

In patients transitioning to buprenorphine from higher doses of opioids (∼ > 90 MME):

Fentanyl transdermal: > 25 µg/h
Oxycodone: > 60 mg/d
Hydrocodone or morphine: > 90 mg/d
Hydromorphone: > 16 mg/d
Oxymorphone: > 45 mg/d

Discontinue after the last nighttime dose.
Consider initiating an adrenergic α 2 agonist (e.g. clonidine, lofexidine) or an immediate-release opioid (e.g. current opioid) to reduce the risk of withdrawal.
Initiate buprenorphine the following morning as either 20-µg/h transdermal buprenorphine once daily or 300-µg buccal buprenorphine twice daily and follow the recommendations in the prescribing information for upward titration as needed. Note that 20 µg/h is the highest dose of transdermal buprenorphine currently available in the United States. If these doses are ineffective, consider higher doses of the buccal formulation on the basis of risk/benefit analysis.

Short-acting opioids have been suggested to prevent withdrawal during the switch to buprenorphine.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114XSVxP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to buprenorphine/naloxone, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to start buprenorphine with a dose of 2–4 mg once objective signs of withdrawal are observed. Consider increasing the dosage in increments of 2–8 mg.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: a review [^1117G1EV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

As overdose deaths from fentanyl continue to increase, optimizing use of medications for opioid use disorder has become increasingly important. Buprenorphine is a highly effective medication for reducing the risk of overdose death, but only if a patient remains in treatment. Shared decision making between prescribers and patients is important to establish a dose that meets each patient's treatment needs. However, patients frequently face a dose limit of 16 or 24 mg/d based on dosing guidelines on the Food and Drug Administration's package label.

Methods

This review discusses patient-centered goals and clinical criteria for determining dose adequacy, reviews the history of buprenorphine dose regulation in the United States, examines pharmacological and clinical research results with buprenorphine doses up to 32 mg/d, and evaluates whether diversion concerns justify maintaining a low buprenorphine dose limit.

Results

Pharmacological and clinical research results consistently demonstrate buprenorphine's dose-dependent benefits up to at least 32 mg/d, including reductions in withdrawal symptoms, craving, opioid reward, and illicit use while improving retention in care. Diverted buprenorphine is most often used to treat withdrawal symptoms and reduce illicit opioid use when legal access to it is limited.

Conclusions

In light of established research and profound harms from fentanyl, the Food and Drug Administration's current recommendations on target dose and dose limit are outdated and causing harm. An update to the buprenorphine package label with recommended dosing up to 32 mg/d and elimination of the 16 mg/d target dose would improve treatment effectiveness and save lives.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111EE7TM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

In April 2021, to expand access to buprenorphine, the Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder exempted eligible physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives from previous Controlled Substances Act certification requirements related to training, counseling and other ancillary services (i.e. psychosocial services). To prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder for up to 30 patients in an office-based setting, clinicians can forgo or choose to undertake training but must still receive a waiver from SAMHSA. Information about qualifications and the process to obtain a waiver are available from SAMHSA.

Additional recommendations have been published on initiation, use, and monitoring of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder is usually combined with naloxone in a sublingual or buccal film or tablet (e.g. Suboxone), to reduce the potential for misuse of buprenorphine when injected. Naloxone is poorly absorbed orally; however, if buprenorphine/naloxone is manipulated and injected, naloxone can trigger opioid withdrawal. In 2018, long-acting injectable formulations of buprenorphine became available. As a partial agonist, buprenorphine should generally not be initiated until there are objective signs of withdrawal, to avoid precipitating withdrawal. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described a low-dose initiation approach (sometimes referred to as microdosing) to avoid precipitating withdrawal when initiating buprenorphine, although evidence regarding this approach is limited. Low-dose buprenorphine initiation is a potential option for patients with opioid use disorder who are taking opioid medications for pain. With this dosing strategy, full agonist opioids can be continued while buprenorphine is initiated, and the patient does not need to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms. For standard (not low-dose) buprenorphine initiation, after objective signs of withdrawal are observed, buprenorphine should be initiated and titrated upward under supervision at approximately 2-hour intervals as needed to control withdrawal symptoms. Protocols for initiating buprenorphine by patients at home after an initial encounter with a clinician to establish the diagnosis of opioid use disorder and discuss medication options are in use by more experienced clinicians.

Discussion

In this large case series of ED patients with OUD treated with a high-dose pathway of buprenorphine induction, we observed no instances of buprenorphine toxicity (eg, sedation or respiratory depression), and adverse events including precipitated withdrawal were rare. Our low rate of precipitated withdrawal is consistent with other ED studies using a similar protocol but without the high-dose pathway. To date and to our knowledge, there have been no formal studies of high-dose strategies, although they are used sporadically. Our findings suggest that the high-dose induction pathway is safe, addresses withdrawal symptoms rapidly, removes barriers to short-term medication access, and extends the duration of action of buprenorphine, all of which offer substantial benefit to the individual and potentially improve follow-up. This benefit has heightened clinical importance most recently because of the limitations for prompt follow-up caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The current SL-buprenorphine induction guidance provided by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, assumes that a patient has access to a dispensed buprenorphine prescription and recommends starting at 2 to 4 mg, followed by a second dose of 2 to 4 mg after approximately 2 hours, with a maximum of 8 to 12 mg on day 1 and 16 mg on day 2. This multiday induction prolongs the time for maximum saturation of μ-opioid receptors and reduction in cravings. In the 2017 Food and Drug Administration labeling update to buprenorphine, inadequate dose escalation on initiation has been identified as a reason that patients stop receiving treatment. Patients often face substantial delays in accessing the dispensed medication after discharge. Thus, multiday induction recommendations may inadvertently prolong symptoms in patients presenting to EDs for opioid withdrawal.

The high-dose pathway allows for a consideration of patients' social determinants of health, a major issue for most ED patients with OUD. Almost one-quarter of our patients were homeless, 41.2% had co-occurring non–substance use–related psychiatric disorders, and the majority were uninsured or underinsured. Some patients (10%-18%) were unsuccessful accessing follow-up treatment immediately after discharge and required repeat dosing in the ED. Higher dosing provides the individual with a critical extended period without craving, allowing more opportunity to navigate the barriers to follow-up, where obstacles to treatment engagement are more easily addressed. Repeat ED engagement after buprenorphine initiation may also provide harm reduction as patients navigate the complex and, at times, prolonged transition from buprenorphine initiation to retention in maintenance outpatient addiction treatment.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: a review [^111zxCHM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

There is robust evidence that buprenorphine's dose-dependent benefits for treating OUD extend at least up to 32 mg/d. Evidence for diversion harm is minimal, yet the consequences of inadequate dosing are predictable and catastrophic. Clinicians and regulators assume that the FDA's buprenorphine package label is evidence based. Unfortunately, the current label language contradicts established evidence and is antiquated regarding harms from fentanyl. However, to avoid off-label prescribing, clinicians must adhere to the specified target dose of 16 mg/d and limit of 24 mg/d — even if that leads to violation of principles of patient-centered care and inadvertently risks their patients' lives. For patients experiencing dose inadequacy within current FDA dosing guidelines, despite effective self-administration technique, transition to methadone or XR-BUP may be an option, but significant barriers frequently impede access to both.

To correct the label language, the FDA should (1) remove mention of a target dosage, (2) return to the 2004 CSAT dosing recommendation of up to 32 mg/d, and (3) recommend that the dose be titrated with consideration of patient-perceived dose adequacy up to the maintenance level that works best for the patient's recovery, which in some cases may exceed 32 mg/d. This review does not address the optimal initial dose or titration strategy, both of which may vary widely among individuals.

The federal government recently demonstrated recognition of the urgency of improving treatment of OUD by eliminating the buprenorphine waiver and requiring addiction treatment education for all DEA-licensed prescribers. The FDA should seize this moment to update the buprenorphine label, honoring the needs of — and providing evidence-based guidance to — many new prescribers and their patients.

Box 1. Key Points

Current FDA guidance for buprenorphine dosing recommends a target dosage of 16 mg/d and a dose range of 4 to 24 mg/d.
Decades of independent research establish evidence that individualization of doses at least up to 32 mg/d increases patient safety and retention in care.
Strict dose limits less than 32 mg/d harm patients in the context of widespread lethal fentanyl.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112q8rXV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Switching from methadone to another medication for the treatment of opioid use disorder may be appropriate if the patient experiences intolerable side effects or is not successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the use of methadone.

Patients switching from methadone to buprenorphine in the treatment of opioid use disorder should be on low doses of methadone before switching medications. Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort, whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may experience significant discomfort in switching medications.

Patients switching from methadone to oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids, before they can receive naltrexone. This may take up to 14 days, and a naloxone challenge may be useful in determining the lack of physical dependence on opioids. The only exception would apply when an experienced clinician receives consent from the patient to embark on a plan of naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management.

Patients who discontinue agonist therapy with methadone or buprenorphine and then resume opioid use should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, and especially the increased risk of death.

Part 5: Buprenorphine

Opioid-dependent patients should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before taking the first dose of buprenorphine to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal.

Induction of buprenorphine should start with a dose of 2–4 mg. Dosages may be increased in increments of 2–4 mg.

Clinicians should observe patients in their offices during induction. Emerging research suggests, however, that many patients need "not" be observed and that home buprenorphine induction may be considered. Home-based induction is recommended only if the patient or prescribing physician is experienced with the use of buprenorphine. This is based on the consensus opinion of the Guideline Committee.

Once it has been established that the initial dose is well tolerated, the buprenorphine dose can be increased fairly rapidly to a dose that provides stable effects for 24 hours and is clinically effective. Buprenorphine doses after induction and titration should be, on average, at least 8 mg per day. The US FDA approves dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses. In addition, the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^111AwmLy]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians are strongly encouraged to provide medication treatment for their patients with opioid use disorder. Those unable to provide treatment themselves should arrange for patients with opioid use disorder to receive care from a colleague who is able to provide treatment, from a substance use disorder treatment specialist (e.g. an office-based buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment clinician), or from an opioid treatment program certified by SAMHSA to provide methadone or buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder. Resources to help clinicians arrange for treatment include SAMHSA's buprenorphine physician locator and SAMHSA's Opioid Treatment Program Directory. Clinicians should assist patients in finding qualified treatment specialists, should arrange for patients to follow up with these specialists, and should coordinate continuing care with these specialists. Rapidly identifying appropriate care can be challenging. Treatment need in a community is often not met by capacity to provide buprenorphine or methadone therapy. Clinicians prescribing opioids in communities without sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use disorder should obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine. SAMHSA's Providers Clinical Support System offers training, technical assistance, and mentors to assist clinicians in assessment for and treatment of substance use disorders, specifically opioid use disorder, and on the interface of pain and opioid misuse. Clinicians prescribing opioids should identify treatment resources for substance use disorders including opioid use disorders in the community, establish a network of referral options that span the levels of care that patients might need to enable rapid collaboration and referral, when needed, and work together to ensure sufficient treatment capacity at the practice level.

Management of Opioid Misuse That Does Not Meet Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder

Clinicians can have challenges distinguishing between opioid misuse behaviors without opioid use disorder and mild or moderate opioid use disorder. For patients with opioid misuse that does not meet criteria for opioid use disorder (e.g. taking opioids in larger amounts than intended without meeting other criteria for opioid use disorder), clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, ensure that therapies for pain management have been optimized (see Recommendation 2), discuss with patients, and carefully weigh benefits and risks of continuing opioids at the current dosage (see Recommendation 5). For patients who choose to but are unable to taper, clinicians can reassess for opioid use disorder and offer buprenorphine treatment or refer for buprenorphine or methadone treatment if criteria for opioid use disorder are met. Even without a diagnosis of opioid use disorder, transitioning to buprenorphine for pain also can be considered because of reduced risk for overdose with buprenorphine compared with risk associated with full agonist opioids (see Recommendation 5).

2.3 Induction

Prior to induction, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e., long- or short-acting opioid products), the time since last opioid use, and the degree or level of opioid dependence.

Patients dependent on heroin or other short-acting opioid products:

At treatment initiation, the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablet should be administered only when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and not less than 4 hours after the patient last used an opioid.

It is recommended that an adequate treatment dose, titrated to clinical effectiveness, should be achieved as rapidly as possible. The dosing on the initial day of treatment may be given in 2 mg to 4 mg increments if preferred. In some studies, gradual induction over several days led to a high rate of dropout of buprenorphine patients during the induction period.

In a one-month study, patients received 8 mg of buprenorphine sublingual tablet on Day 1 and 16 mg buprenorphine sublingual tablet on Day 2. From Day 3 onward, patients received either buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual tablet or buprenorphine sublingual tablet at the same buprenorphine dose as Day 2 based on their assigned treatment. Induction in the studies of buprenorphine solution was accomplished over 3 to 4 days, depending on the target dose.

Patients dependent on methadone or other long-acting opioid products:

Patients dependent upon methadone or other long-acting opioid products may be more susceptible to precipitated and prolonged withdrawal during induction than those on short-acting opioid products; therefore, the first dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablet should only be administered when objective and clear signs of moderate opioid withdrawal appear, and generally not less than 24 hours after the patient last used a long-acting opioid product.

There is little controlled experience with the transfer of methadone-maintained patients to buprenorphine. Available evidence suggests that withdrawal signs and symptoms are possible during induction onto buprenorphine. Withdrawal appears more likely in patients maintained on higher doses of methadone (> 30 mg) and when the first buprenorphine dose is administered shortly after the last methadone dose.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115ieKuQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, opioid dosage thresholds for caution in the treatment of pain are not applicable to opioid agonist treatment of opioid use disorder because recommended dosages of methadone and buprenorphine for opioid use disorder differ from those for pain management. No recommended duration limit exists for treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine or methadone, and discontinuation is associated with risks for return to drug use and opioid overdose. If discontinued, buprenorphine should be tapered very gradually (over several months).

Compared with buprenorphine, which can be prescribed by clinicians with a waiver in any setting or dispensed from a SAMHSA-certified opioid treatment program, ongoing methadone treatment for opioid use disorder can only be provided through an opioid treatment program. As short-term exceptions, any clinician may administer (but not prescribe) methadone or buprenorphine to treat acute opioid withdrawal for up to 3 days, while working to refer the patient to opioid use disorder treatment. Previously, up to a 1-day supply could be administered per day for up to 3 days; in December 2020, Congress directed the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to revise regulations to allow for a 3-day supply of medication to be dispensed at one time; DEA subsequently advised practitioners how to request exceptions to the 1-day supply limitation pending amendment of 21 CFR 1306.07(b). Patients already receiving treatment for opioid use disorder and admitted for other medical reasons may continue to directly receive methadone or buprenorphine treatment in an emergency department or in a hospital throughout inpatient hospitalization.

Naltrexone does not require a waiver and can be prescribed in any setting. Additional recommendations have been published previously on naltrexone treatment for opioid use disorder. A minimum of 7–10 days free of opioids is recommended before the first naltrexone dose to avoid precipitation of severe opioid withdrawal. Extended-release injectable naltrexone is typically administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at 380 mg per injection, alternating buttocks for each subsequent injection. Certain patients, including those who metabolize naltrexone more rapidly, might benefit from dosing as frequently as every 3 weeks. Oral naltrexone is no longer recommended and should not be used except under very limited circumstances. No recommended duration limit exists for treatment of opioid use disorder with naltrexone. If discontinued, naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without precipitating withdrawal symptoms. Clinicians should warn patients who discontinue naltrexone of the risk for potentially fatal opioid overdose if opioid use is resumed, because of the loss of tolerance to the previous opioid dosage.

Postpartum treatment — continuation and dose adjustments: Pharmacological treatment for opioid use disorder should be continued following delivery; if methadone dose was increased as pregnancy progressed, the dosage will likely need to be reduced postpartum and titrated as needed to prevent sedation; dosage changes for buprenorphine are less common, but patients should be monitored closely throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period and dosages adjusted as needed.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^114qw5SD]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

To avoid precipitating withdrawal, transitioning any patient taking full agonist opioids to buprenorphine requires specific timing of the initial buprenorphine dose (see Recommendation 12 for application to patients with opioid use disorder). Patients should be in mild to moderate withdrawal from full agonist opioids before the first buprenorphine dose. To do this, experts have advised that clinicians and patients should wait at least 8–12 hours after the last dose of short-acting full agonist opioids and longer after the last dose of long-acting full agonist opioids (e.g. at least 12–24 hours after the last dose of an ER/LA full agonist opioid, and longer for methadone) before the first dose of buprenorphine is administered. As an alternative for patients not yet in opioid withdrawal, certain studies have described low dose initiation of buprenorphine to allow for initiation of buprenorphine in patients receiving full agonist opioids for acute or chronic pain. SAMHSA's Providers Clinical Support System offers training, technical assistance, and mentors to assist clinicians who are unfamiliar with initiation of buprenorphine and have additional questions about the diagnosis and treatment of opioid use disorder. Because the duration of action for analgesia is shorter than the duration of action for suppression of opioid withdrawal and stabilization of opioid use disorder, dosing of buprenorphine for pain is typically multiple times daily rather than once-a-day dosing as done for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Buprenorphine monitoring, diversion control, transitions, and duration: Clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion, with recommended strategies that may include frequent office visits (e.g., weekly in early treatment), drug testing including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for medication counts, and drug testing should be used to monitor patients for adherence to buprenorphine and use of illicit and controlled substances. Patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of treatment until they are determined to be stable, and when transitioning from buprenorphine to naltrexone providers should note that 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone, whereas when transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone there is no required time delay. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine, and patients who discontinue treatment should be made aware of the risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of death if they return to illicit opioid use, with treatment alternatives including methadone and naltrexone and opioid overdose prevention with naloxone discussed with any patient choosing to taper off buprenorphine. Buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process, close monitoring is recommended, buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months, and patients should be encouraged to remain in treatment for ongoing monitoring past the point of discontinuation.

### Buprenorphine for pain: a narrative review and practical applications [^115xwBu1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic noncancer pain affects about 20% of US adults and can significantly affect function and quality of life. Current guidelines recommend multimodal pain control. Despite risks associated with long-term opioid therapy, opioids are commonly prescribed. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist with an improved safety profile compared to full agonists. Some formulations are approved for chronic pain and others for opioid use disorder. Buprenorphine is an option for patients who use chronic daily opioids for pain. This review summarizes the literature on buprenorphine's efficacy and safety for chronic pain and provides recommendations to generalists on initiation, titration, and monitoring of buprenorphine-based pain treatment. We also discuss a communication approach when considering buprenorphine for pain.

### Common questions about buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder [^114RSNTE]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder, with a treatment retention rate of more than 50% at 1 year and substantially less risk of respiratory depression compared with methadone. Based on its effectiveness and safety profile, buprenorphine was recently made available to all physicians with Schedule III authority. Physicians should screen adult patients with a validated tool and offer buprenorphine to those with moderate or severe opioid use disorder. Doses should be titrated quickly to fully suppress cravings and withdrawal symptoms, typically 16 to 32 mg/day. Once patients are stabilized, they should have follow-up appointments every 1 to 3 months. Counseling or behavior therapy is not necessary for success and should be offered based on each patient's needs and preferences. Regular urine drug testing helps identify patients who may benefit from more intense treatment or other options; any unexpected test results should not be a primary reason for treatment termination. Buprenorphine is maintenance treatment for a chronic disease and should be continued for as long as it is beneficial. Relapse rates after discontinuation are lower in patients who complete 1 year of treatment, and they continue to decline with longer treatment duration.

Our examination of buprenorphine dosing begins with a discussion of patient-centered goals and clinical criteria for determining dose adequacy. We then present relevant pharmacological principles and research results regarding buprenorphine dose dependence. The history of buprenorphine dose regulation in the United States is reviewed in this context. We then describe nearly 3 decades of clinical evidence for a dose-response relationship with benefits extending to at least 32 mg/d, including the specific implications of pregnancy on dosing. We conclude by briefly examining the buprenorphine diversion concerns that are closely tied to existing dose-limit policy (Box 1).

### Understanding buprenorphine for use in chronic pain: expert opinion [^113JS6e4]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When used as directed, buprenorphine appears to have a relatively favorable therapeutic index (safety profile) and a slower onset of tolerance than full µ -opioid receptor agonists on the basis of its pharmacological profile; however, patient expectations regarding nausea, which is commonly observed during titration with buprenorphine products in opioid-naïve patients, should be clearly set.

Buprenorphine appears to have a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, and the Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force recently noted that buprenorphine is expected to have reduced risk for respiratory depression and may be better tolerated than full µ -opioid receptor agonists according to currently available data. As a caveat, respiratory depression is still a concern, especially when buprenorphine is used in combination with nonopioid sedatives/anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and gabapentin, carisoprodol and other muscle relaxants, amitriptyline, and Z-drugs (nonbenzodiazepine drugs with effects similar to those of benzodiazepines). Although buprenorphine is generally well tolerated, any relevant contraindications and other safety concerns should be considered when prescribing the medication for chronic pain. Combining opioids with other central nervous system suppressants is generally not recommended but may be considered after conducting a thoughtful risk/benefit analysis.

On the basis of the information above, buprenorphine may also be more suitable than Schedule II opioids in certain patient populations. Patients with chronic pain who may benefit from buprenorphine include those with an increased risk of life-threatening opioid-related adverse events (e.g. high body mass index/obstructive sleep apnea, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, pulmonary disease, concomitant use of drugs known to increase risk [benzodiazepines, gabapentin, pregabalin, muscle relaxants, alcohol], taking a high morphine milligram equivalent [MME]). In addition, those with chronic pain and an increased risk of life-threatening opioid-related aberrant behavior (e.g. indications of OUD or substance use disorder, heightened risk of overdose, elevated Opioid Risk Tool [ORT] or other screening tool score) may benefit from buprenorphine.

Consensus Recommendation

In patients with chronic pain who have been determined via risk/benefit analysis to benefit from opioid treatment, consider prescribing buprenorphine before Schedule II opioids and perhaps before some Schedule IV opioids, such as tramadol, on the basis of the patient's underlying conditions.

3 How Should Patients Receiving Buprenorphine Be Managed during the Perioperative/Trauma Period?

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114th8zu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 3: Treating opioid withdrawal — core recommendations and dosing: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, since abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome placing patients at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; patients should be advised about relapse and safety risks, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination, focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, opioid withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an opioid treatment program (OTP) or in an acute care setting (under limited circumstances); for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids, methadone doses should typically be 20–30 mg per day and the dose may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given with an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g. FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label clonidine) are safe and effective for management of opioid withdrawal; however, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing symptoms, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

Buprenorphine — indications, tapering guidance, contraindications, cautions, interactions, and regulatory warnings: Buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist available in a variety of formulations and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder, and it is also an effective treatment for opioid withdrawal with efficacy similar to methadone and superior to lofexidine or clonidine in opioid withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If tapering is chosen, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and insufficient evidence is available on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose; one trial found that longer courses of buprenorphine with gradual tapering were superior to rapid tapering for withdrawal. Buprenorphine is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any component of the formulation and patients with severe liver impairment are not good candidates for office-based treatment, while patients with hepatitis C infection who do not have severe liver impairment may be considered for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine should be used with caution for patients with current or past hepatic dysfunction, noting a direct comparison with methadone found no difference in incidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver damage during the initial 6 months in either treatment groups and that monitoring liver enzymes may be considered, and caution also applies to patients who, at present, have an alcohol use or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and to those with hypovolemia, severe cardiovascular disease, or taking drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects because buprenorphine may cause hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Significant interactions include that alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may enhance the central nervous system (CNS) depressive effect of buprenorphine and that buprenorphine is metabolized to nor-buprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4, so concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored and may require dose reduction of one or both agents. In 2016, based on literature reviews and reported adverse events, the FDA required the addition of warnings on all opioid product labels, including methadone and buprenorphine.

### Induction to methadone 80 mg in the first week of treatment of patients who use fentanyl: a case series from an outpatient opioid treatment program [^114eFnVb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and related analogues continue to drive the overdose crisis in the United States, where over 100,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2022. Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) using opioid agonist therapies like methadone and buprenorphine were developed to address OUD from heroin, and they are mainstay treatment options proven to reduce overdose mortality.

Methadone and buprenorphine remain effective in reducing mortality and morbidity for individuals using fentanyl, but new challenges have emerged and may continue to evolve as other high-potency synthetic opioids become more prevalent in the drug supply. The unique pharmacodynamics of fentanyl often lead dependent individuals to use fentanyl several times per day to stave off withdrawal, resulting in development of a much higher opioid tolerance compared to heroin or prescription opioids. Buprenorphine appears to be more likely to precipitate opioid withdrawal in patients using fentanyl (vs heroin and other short-acting opioids), complicating the induction process and leading to a proliferation of different strategies for helping patients achieve induction. Methadone doses that were effective for patients using heroin seem to be less effective at eliminating fentanyl use, suggesting that higher doses may be required.

Methadone induction guidelines are conservative, focused on minimizing overdose risk from the methadone itself rather than rapidly reaching a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal. One reason for this caution is that studies of individuals conducted before the introduction of fentanyl to illicit drug markets found that risk of overdose is highest in the first 4 weeks after starting methadone. The specific reasons for this are not known, and guideline titration schedules are based on patient response to a dose at steady state, which is reached after 4–5 days given an average half-life of 24 hours. A 2013 expert panel convened by the American Society of Addiction Medicine recommended a maximum initial dose of 30 mg, followed by 5-mg increases no sooner than every 5 days. Other expert panels are marginally more aggressive, recommending an initial dose of 10–30 mg, followed by increases of 5–10 mg no sooner than every 3 to 4 days of daily dosing. Following either approach may still require several weeks, if not months, to reach an effective dose — generally estimated to be between 80 and 120 mg for people using heroin — that reduces nonmedical opioid use by suppressing withdrawal and opioid cravings. Achieving successful induction may become even more challenging in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, such as methamphetamine use disorder, which has been linked to decreased retention rates. Another possibility for the increased mortality early in treatment with methadone, then, is ongoing nonmedical opioid use.

Part 5: Buprenorphine — initiation, dosing, and setting describes that buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who can give informed consent and have no specific contraindication. For patients who are currently opioid dependent, buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal, after which buprenorphine administration should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg. The setting for initiation should be carefully considered, with both office-based and home-based initiation considered safe and effective. Following initiation, the dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms, with evidence suggesting that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, while there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day and higher doses may increase the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder, and as data regarding their effectiveness are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence, and patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed with offers or referrals to psychosocial treatment in conjunction with buprenorphine, noting that declining or absence of such treatment should not preclude buprenorphine treatment.

Additional buprenorphine guidance — Providers may consider an alternative initiation approach for patients with concern for/history of intolerable opioid withdrawal during buprenorphine initiation or otherwise unable to taper to 30 mg MEDD, and it is recommended to either convert directly to an equivalent dose or cross-titrate for a short period of time with provision of a medication disposal bag for any remaining full agonist opioids. For patients taking ≥ 80 mg MEDD, convert directly to an equivalent dose of buprenorphine buccal film: 80–160 mg MEDD: initiate 300 mcg 8–12 hours after last dose of full agonist opioids, q12 hr; 161–220 mg MEDD: initiate 450 mcg 8–12 hours after last dose of full agonist opioids, q12 hr. Alternatively, continue current full agonist opioids for 4–8 days while gradually up-titrating buprenorphine buccal film to the lowest effective dose; once the buprenorphine dose is roughly an equianalgesic full agonist dose, stop the full agonist opioid (usually around day 4–8), and if patients stabilize before the proposed end dose, it is not necessary to proceed with further buprenorphine dose escalations.

Withdrawal management with buprenorphine — initiation, dosing, and special considerations indicates buprenorphine withdrawal management can be done either in an outpatient or an inpatient setting, none of the available forms are specifically FDA-approved for withdrawal management but they may be used for this purpose, and none of the products have shown superiority over another for this purpose. Because buprenorphine is a partial μ opioid receptor agonist with a higher affinity for the mu-receptor than most full agonists, it is important that buprenorphine not be started until a patient is exhibiting objective signs of opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal; opioid withdrawal usually occurs up to 12–18 hours after the last dose of short-acting opioids and up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of a long-acting agonist. Providers should consider dosing for buprenorphine in an inpatient setting where the patient can be closely monitored. With fentanyl, which has a long half-life (8–10 hours), some clinicians have recommended waiting until patients are in at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or more) before initiating buprenorphine. Withdrawal management with buprenorphine should start with an initial dose of 2–4 mg, titrated up as needed to control withdrawal (generally 4–16 mg per day), and the duration of the tapering schedule can be as brief as 3–5 days or over 30 days; clinicians should be guided by patient response in determining the optimum duration of the taper.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^114ZpwGC]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is rapid induction (RI) for initiating extended-release buprenorphine as safe and effective as standard induction (SI) in individuals who inject opioids or use fentanyl?

Findings

In this multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial with 729 participants, RI was well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at extended-release buprenorphine injection 2 overall and in fentanyl-positive participants. Administering the second extended-release buprenorphine injection 1 week after the first was well tolerated in both the RI arm and SI arm.

Meaning

These findings suggest support RI for extended-release buprenorphine induction in high-risk patients and demonstrate the feasibility of administering the first 2 doses at least 1 week apart.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113JpPeS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine initiation timing and withdrawal thresholds: Patients who are currently dependent on opioids should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the first dose, and clinicians should use objective signs of opioid withdrawal before initiating buprenorphine; generally, initiation should occur at least 6–12 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioids and 24–72 hours after the last use of long-acting opioids such as methadone, with a COWS score of 11–12 or more generally indicative of sufficient withdrawal. During office-based initiation, use of the COWS can be helpful, and some clinicians have recommended waiting for at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or higher) in the context of fentanyl exposure, which is short acting but has a long half-life (8–10 hours), although there is little existing evidence addressing this issue.

### Clinical case conference: strategies for transferring from methadone to buprenorphine [^111K84zQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The main advantage of the microdosing method is that the patient should only experience mild withdrawal symptoms at worst (if any) from any previous prescribed daily dose of methadone, although the negative is that the process takes a number of weeks to complete, but by the end, the patient should be on a stable daily dose of buprenorphine and no longer be on any methadone, providing a crossover in opioid agonist treatment.

The guidance developed locally for this method is to commence with sublingual 400 μg buprenorphine and gradually increase this dose every 24 hours initially by 400 μg, then as the dose has increased, increasing the dose increment at a greater rate (eg, 800 μg after dose reaches 3 mg, 1200 μg after dose reaches 8 mg, etc), whilst maintaining the methadone dose. Once the buprenorphine dose is over 12 mg, consideration to reducing the daily methadone dose can be made, up to 50%. Then as the buprenorphine increases further and the patient stabilizes on the dose, the methadone can be quickly reduced with few withdrawal symptoms expected, as the buprenorphine is occupying the majority of the receptor sites. The process can take 3 to 4 weeks to complete, but this is dependent on the individual patient and the rate of buprenorphine increase.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114y2BNX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — perioperative management for patients on buprenorphine or methadone — Discontinuation of methadone or buprenorphine before surgery is not required, and higher-potency intravenous full agonist opioids can be used perioperatively for analgesia. Decisions related to discontinuing or adjusting the dose of buprenorphine prior to a planned surgery should be made on an individual basis through consultation between the surgical and anesthesia teams and the addiction treatment provider when possible. If it is decided that buprenorphine or methadone should be discontinued before a planned surgery, this may occur the day before the procedure or on the day of surgery based on surgical and anesthesia team recommendations; higher-potency intravenous full agonist opioids can be used perioperatively for analgesia, and methadone or buprenorphine can be resumed post-operatively when the need for full opioid agonist analgesia has resolved. The addition of a short-acting full agonist opioid to the patient's regular dose of buprenorphine can be effective for the management of severe acute pain in supervised settings, such as during hospitalization; the dose of additional full agonist opioid analgesic is anticipated to be higher than typical doses for opioid-naive individuals, and the committee was unable to come to consensus on whether this adjunct can be safely prescribed in ambulatory care settings. A short period of withholding is up to 2–3 days, and if these medications are withheld for a longer period of time they may need to be reinitiated gradually by the prescribing clinician after the need for full opioid agonist analgesia has resolved.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^115iHPp8]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is high-dose (> 12 mg) buprenorphine induction safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated opioid use disorder who present to the emergency department?

Findings

In this case series of 579 cases, 54 clinicians followed a high-dose buprenorphine (monoproduct) protocol. There were no documented episodes of respiratory depression or excessive sedation, and precipitated withdrawal was rare (0.8% of cases) and was not associated with dosing.

Meaning

These findings suggest that high-dose buprenorphine induction, adopted by multiple clinicians in a single-site, urban emergency department, was safe and well tolerated in patients with untreated opioid use disorder.

### ASAM clinical considerations: buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder for individuals using high-potency synthetic opioids [^111gZDeV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) with buprenorphine has evolved considerably in the last decade as the scale of the OUD epidemic has increased along with the emergence of high-potency synthetic opioids (HPSOs) and stimulants in the drug supply. These changes have outpaced the development of prospective research, so a clinical consideration document based on expert consensus is needed to address pressing clinical questions. This clinical considerations document is based on a narrative literature review and expert consensus and will specifically address considerations for changes to the clinical practice of treatment of OUD with buprenorphine for individuals using HPSO. An expert panel developed 6 key questions addressing buprenorphine initiation, stabilization, and long-term treatment for individuals with OUD exposed to HPSO in various treatment settings. Broadly, the clinical considerations suggest that individualized strategies for buprenorphine initiation may be needed. The experience of opioid withdrawal negatively impacts the success of buprenorphine treatment, and attention to its management before and during buprenorphine initiation should be proactively addressed. Buprenorphine dose and dosing frequency should be individualized based on patients' treatment needs, the possibility of novel components in the drug supply should be considered during OUD treatment, and all forms of opioid agonist treatment should be offered and considered for patients. Together, these clinical considerations attempt to be responsive to the challenges and opportunities experienced by frontline clinicians using buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD in patients using HPSOs and highlight areas where prospective research is urgently needed.

Transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine — dosing, timing, and withdrawal thresholds specify that lower methadone doses transition more comfortably, initiation should occur in withdrawal, and specific buprenorphine doses are outlined. "Patients on low doses of methadone (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerate the transition to buprenorphine with minimal discomfort; whereas patients on higher doses of methadone may find that transitioning causes significant discomfort". "To minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal, it is recommended that clinicians use careful initial dosing followed by rapid titration up to an appropriate maintenance dose". "Patients should be experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the transition. This would typically occur up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of methadone", and "A COWS score of 11–12 or more is generally sufficient for significant withdrawal to allow a safe and comfortable initiation onto buprenorphine". "An initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine should be given… [and] additional 2–8 mg doses as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms".

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^11561Pdu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Methadone — psychosocial care, relapse management, and transitions state that patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on individual needs, in conjunction with methadone, and that a patient's decision to decline or the absence of psychosocial treatment should not preclude methadone treatment. For patients who previously received methadone, it should be reinstituted immediately if relapse occurs or if an assessment determines that the risk of relapse is high (unless contraindicated), with re‑initiation following the recommendations on initial dose and titration. Transitioning from methadone to another medication may be appropriate if dangerous or intolerable side effects occur or if treatment goals are not met, and patients transitioning to buprenorphine should ideally be on low doses of methadone, with low-dose patients (30–40 mg per day or less) generally tolerating transition with minimal discomfort while higher-dose patients may experience significant discomfort. Patients transitioning from methadone to naltrexone must be completely withdrawn from methadone and other opioids before receiving naltrexone. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with methadone.

### 2017 HIVMA of IDSA clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic pain in patients living with HIV [^112SNomw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Buprenorphine-based management of chronic pain in persons living with HIV who are on buprenorphine for opioid use disorder includes adjuvants, dose adjustments, formulation changes, and escalation strategies: Clinicians should use adjuvant therapy appropriate to the pain syndrome for mild-to-moderate breakthrough pain, and based on expert opinion the clinician should increase the dosage of buprenorphine in divided doses as an initial step, with dosing ranges of 4–16 mg divided into 8-hour doses noted as having shown benefit. Based on expert opinion, clinicians might switch from buprenorphine/naloxone to buprenorphine transdermal formulation alone. If a maximal dose of buprenorphine is reached, it is recommended that an additional long-acting potent opioid such as fentanyl, morphine, or hydromorphone should be tried, and if usual doses of an additional opioid are ineffective, a closely monitored trial of higher doses of an additional opioid is recommended, noting that buprenorphine's high binding affinity for the µ-opioid receptor may prevent lower doses of other opioids from accessing the µ-opioid receptor. For patients on buprenorphine maintenance with inadequate analgesia despite these strategies, transitioning the patient from buprenorphine to methadone maintenance is recommended.

### Opioid agonist to buprenorphine cross-titration during pregnancy: a case report [^111fun8v]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We present a case report of a first-trimester pregnant individual with chronic pain on chronic opioid therapy who successfully cross-titrated from full-μ agonist opioid to buprenorphine without causing significant withdrawal symptoms.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old gravida 1, para 0 woman with chronic pain on opioid therapy successfully completed a 6-week cross-titration from 120 morphine equivalent dose to buprenorphine in her first trimester without affecting pain scores, functional capacity, withdrawal symptoms except for mild nausea and insomnia, or adverse perinatal outcomes. After increasing her buprenorphine in the second trimester, at 38 weeks, she bore a healthy neonate without eliciting signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome while on a stable buprenorphine dose.

Conclusions

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Addiction Medicine agree that pregnant patients with chronic pain should avoid or minimize opioids. For patients on chronic opioid therapy unable to minimize opioid use during pregnancy, it is unclear whether to continue their chronic opioid therapy or transition to other medications, including buprenorphine. This case demonstrated how one pregnant person with chronic pain on opioid therapy but not meeting diagnostic criteria for opioid use disorder safely transitioned from full-μ agonist opioids to buprenorphine without precipitating withdrawal or adverse perinatal outcomes. Cross-titration could be similarly performed for a pregnant patient with untreated opioid use disorder. In addition, the used cross-titration schedule and the rationale are provided.

Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder

Although identification of an opioid use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. Clinicians should use nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic pain treatments as appropriate (see Recommendations 1 and 2) to provide optimal pain management. For patients with pain who have an active opioid use disorder but are not in treatment, clinicians should consider buprenorphine or methadone treatment for opioid use disorder, which also can help with concurrent management of pain. For patients who are treated with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder and experience acute pain, clinicians can consider temporarily increasing the buprenorphine dosing frequency (e.g. to twice per day) to help manage pain because the duration of effects of buprenorphine is shorter for pain than for suppression of withdrawal. For severe acute pain (e.g. from trauma or unplanned major surgery) in patients receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, clinicians can consider additional as-needed doses of buprenorphine. In supervised settings, adding a short-acting full agonist opioid to the patient's regular dosage of buprenorphine can be considered without discontinuing the patient's regular buprenorphine dosage; however, if a decision is made to discontinue buprenorphine to allow for more µ -opioid receptor availability, patients should be monitored closely because high doses of a full agonist opioid might be required, potentially leading to oversedation and respiratory depression as buprenorphine's partial agonist effect lessens. For patients receiving naltrexone for opioid use disorder, short-term use of higher-potency nonopioid analgesics (e.g. NSAIDs) can be considered to manage severe acute pain. Patients receiving methadone for opioid use disorder who require additional opioids as treatment for severe acute pain management should be monitored carefully, and when feasible, should optimally be treated by a clinician experienced in the treatment of pain in consultation with their opioid treatment program. The ASAM National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (2020 Focused Update) provides additional recommendations (see Part 9) for the management of patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder who have planned surgeries for which nonopioid therapies are not anticipated to provide sufficient pain relief.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine dosing at initiation: The risk of precipitated withdrawal can be reduced by using a lower initial dose, with an initial dose of 2–4 mg and observation recommended; if 60–90 minutes have passed without withdrawal symptoms, additional dosing can be done in increments of 2–8 mg, and once the initial dose is well tolerated, the dose can be increased fairly rapidly to provide stable effects for 24 hours. One extended-release buprenorphine injection that received tentative FDA approval in December 2018 is indicated for initiation, stabilization and maintenance when administered as a once-weekly or once-monthly injection, and only a single prior dose of transmucosal buprenorphine is required prior to initiation; the committee recommends clinicians use these products as indicated and be mindful of further evidence as it becomes available.

### Rapid low-dose buprenorphine initiation for hospitalized patients with opioid use disorder [^113vEH48]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low-dose buprenorphine initiation allows patients to start buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) while continuing full-agonist opioids. This strategy is beneficial for hospitalized patients who may have acute pain and are not able to tolerate withdrawal. However, most protocols require 7–10 to complete, which may create barriers in patients with shorter or unpredictable lengths of stay.

Objective

This cohort study examined the efficacy and feasibility of a rapid low-dose buprenorphine initiation protocol in the hospital setting.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with OUD (diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria) seen by an addiction medicine consult service at a single academic medical center who started buprenorphine via a rapid low-dose initiation between November 2021 and May 2022. Patients were prospectively tracked using an electronic registry, and data were abstracted from the electronic health record.

Results

Twenty-four patients underwent rapid low-dose initiation during the study period. All patients received full-agonist opioids before starting buprenorphine. Thirteen (54%) patients reported using fentanyl, with 5 patients reported endorsing use within 48 hours preceding buprenorphine initiation. Nineteen (79%) patients completed initiation with an average time to completion of 72 hours. Among patients who reported fentanyl use in the 48 hours before starting buprenorphine, 60% completed initiation and 40% elected to transition to methadone. No patients experienced precipitated withdrawal.

Conclusions

Rapid low-dose buprenorphine initiation provides a feasible and well-tolerated alternative to traditional and slower low-dose initiations for hospitalized patients.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: a review [^116fr8pu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Indeed, in the RB-US-07–001 study, 34% of participants used a maintenance dose of at least 24 mg/d, including 16% with at least 28 mg/d and 8% with at least 32 mg/d. (p37) Despite these study findings, existing SAMHSA recommendations, increasing peer-reviewed clinical evidence of protective advantages of a higher dose range (Table 1), and "clinical reality", the FDA's 2010 revised package label actually tightened maximum dosing guidance, stating: "Dosages higher than [24 mg/day] have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage". That statement remains on the current (2022) package label.

In 2010 — just as heroin superseded prescription pain medications as the predominant cause of opioid overdose deaths — the FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) required for approval of Suboxone film stated the following:

The reported lack of significant increase in brain mu-receptor occupancy between doses of 16 mg and 32 mg would imply that there should be little difference in clinical effectiveness at doses between 16 mg and 24 mg in most patients. When a patient expresses a need for a higher dose, consider the possible causes (e.g. environmental stressors or psychosocial issues that increase cravings or possible drug interactions). Before increasing the patient's dose, explore other alternatives. Also consider the possibility that the patient may be exaggerating symptoms to obtain additional medication for diversion.

Dosing recommendations for buprenorphine are therefore different from those for other FDA-regulated medications: (1) unlike other medications where dosing is determined based on clinical findings, buprenorphine's dosing is derived from the surrogate marker of MOR occupancy (and even then, at peak rather than the more clinically relevant average or minimum levels), and (2) patients' requests for higher doses are not to be taken at face value but instead are to be regarded with suspicion because, per the REMS language, patients may exaggerate symptoms for secondary gain. Despite current widespread calls for de-stigmatizing substance use disorders and promoting patient-centered treatment — including from government agencies — stigma and judgment are firmly embedded in the FDA's dosing guideline.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine dosing after initiation: Evidence suggests that buprenorphine doses of 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses at suppressing illicit opioid use; the FDA generally recommends dosing to a limit of 24 mg per day, noting limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of higher doses, and the use of higher doses may increase the risk of diversion.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1119dVP7]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine and acute pain management — temporarily increasing buprenorphine dosing and/or dividing the dose may be effective for acute pain management; the analgesic effects last for approximately 6–8 hours while withdrawal and craving suppression lasts for approximately 24 hours, and increasing the daily dose by 20–25% and splitting it into 3–4 doses can often adequately address acute pain; when moving to split dosing the clinician should ensure that the patient has not missed their last non-split dose. Patients with acute pain refractory to other treatments may benefit from as-needed buprenorphine, and adding a short-acting full opioid agonist to the patient's regular dose of buprenorphine can be effective; the guideline committee recommends that this may be considered in supervised settings, such as during hospitalization. In situations when a full opioid agonist is used for pain management, discontinuation of buprenorphine is not required; if buprenorphine is discontinued during severe pain to allow more mu opioid receptor availability, patients should be monitored closely because high doses of a full agonist may be required, and as the partial agonist effect dissipates the full agonist effect may lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression.

Buprenorphine chronic pain management — split dosing of buprenorphine with dosing every 6–8 hours may be adequate for chronic pain management in many patients with opioid use disorder and chronic pain. Chronic opioid therapy, especially at high doses, may heighten pain sensitivity, and some evidence suggests that patients experiencing substantial pain on high doses of full agonist opioids experience improved pain management when switched to buprenorphine. Buprenorphine therapy carries a lower risk of adverse effects, especially overdose, compared to full agonist opioids.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^1145tVBc]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

The high-dose pathway was widely accepted and adopted by a large proportion of ED clinicians, with 88% of physicians and 100% of APPs treating patients with buprenorphine. The ED length of stay was remarkably short, with a median of just over 2 hours for most patients with high-dose administration and often occurred in low-acuity areas, thus dispelling the myth perpetuated by many ED clinicians that adoption of ED-initiated buprenorphine is complex and time-consuming. The advantage over slower, more rigid, buprenorphine inductions is that patients can be more collaborative, rather than being forced into a treatment pathway that may not meet their needs.

Not all patients should receive a high-dose induction. Our findings suggest that clinicians followed guidance to exercise caution with larger doses in patients who are more ill. For example, we found that a larger percentage of patients requiring hospitalization were treated with lower doses of buprenorphine most likely consistent with the protocol. Although the safety profile of buprenorphine and the ceiling effect on its depression are well established, in ill or intoxicated patients with reduced respiratory reserve, the sedation and respiratory depression of buprenorphine can be clinically important.

In the context of the opioid overdose crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, consideration of the perceived risks of precipitated withdrawal and oversedation in rapid dose escalation should be balanced by considerations of the risk of delay in treatment. In a studyof primary care patients with unobserved home induction of buprenorphine, rates of precipitated withdrawal were 3%, greater than what we observed. The extended opioid blockade provided by the high-dose pathway may impart more substantial overdose protection and more effective blunting of the euphoric and reinforcing effects of any opioids used in the high-risk window following ED departure prior to engagement in follow-up care. The increasing prevalence of high-potency illicit opioids, such as fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, likely increases the risk of overdose after ED discharge, making the protective properties of buprenorphine all the more important.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal management, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not initiate opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal. Administer a dose of buprenorphine sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms (an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms) once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed.

Study Population and Treatments

Completion of one of the primary studies (study 006 or 007) was required for inclusion in this study; the primary studies enrolled male and female patients aged 18 to 65 years who met criteria for opioid dependence, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR).

All eligible patients had received buprenorphine-based opioid substitution therapy for at least 22 days in the primary studies. During the 24-week extension trial, patients received once-daily treatment with BNX-RDT, administered using various combinations of 1.4/0.36 and 5.7/1.4 mg. Patients who were receiving BNX-RDT at completion of the primary studies were continued at the same dose; those who were receiving BNX sublingual film at the completion of study 006 were initiated on a BNX-RDT dose based on a fixed conversion factor (5.7 mg BNX-RDT to 8.0 mg BNX sublingual film). The BNX-RDT dosage was titrated, if necessary, between 5.7/1.4 and 17.1/4.2 mg/d to achieve optimal relief of opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms while minimizing adverse effects. Titration was initially performed in buprenorphine dosage increments of 2.8 mg, with increments of 1.4 mg used as needed. During treatment, Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale assessments were conducted to monitor long-term control of withdrawal symptoms. For patients who experienced withdrawal symptoms, the BNX-RDT dose could be modified as permitted by the patient's titrated dose level with up to 1 to 2 hours between doses to avoid worsening of symptoms.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^116mp8ZM]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHAT WE SHOULD DO

We should assess patients for risk of opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, including methadone, in patients who select it. For patients without a formal OUD diagnosis who want to continue methadone after discharge, confirm the diagnosis using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Start and titrate methadone (Table 1) when patients endorse early opioid withdrawal symptoms after confirming they have opioid tolerance and are not actively sedated. Because methadone is a full opioid agonist and can be initiated before withdrawal develops it is unnecessary to obtain a Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score when starting it. We should also offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) for withdrawal, though these do not address the underlying pathophysiology of opioid withdrawal and insufficiently mitigate symptoms. Clinicians should recognize that patients using fentanyl or other potent synthetic opioids may have high tolerance and need higher doses of opioid agonists, including methadone, to alleviate withdrawal. When patients decline methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal, their opioid withdrawal symptoms or pain are not controlled on methadone or buprenorphine alone, or they are undergoing low-dose buprenorphine initiation, hospitalists can offer alternative opioid agonists (e.g. oxycodone, hydromorphone) during hospitalization though we cannot prescribe these medications for withdrawal at discharge.

Buprenorphine treatment — transitioning between medications: Transitioning from buprenorphine to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining their treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone does not typically result in any type of adverse reaction, and no time delay is required in transitioning a patient from buprenorphine to treatment with methadone. For naltrexone initiation, buprenorphine has a long half-life; 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last dose of buprenorphine and the start of naltrexone to ensure that the patient is not physically dependent on opioids, a naloxone challenge may be useful to demonstrate an absence of physical dependence, and investigators have begun to evaluate rapid transition methods using repeated very low naltrexone doses with ancillary medications over several days.

VA/DoD chronic pain guideline — buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone dosing highlights that a low dose buprenorphine initiation (LDBI) strategy is designed to avoid precipitated withdrawal during conversion and introduces small incremental doses of buprenorphine while either slowly reducing the full opioid agonist over time or maintaining the full agonist dose and then stopping it once the buprenorphine dose is sufficient to mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Dosing may be titrated to 16 to 24 mg/day in divided doses if needed, and the document notes there is no consensus regarding a particular LDI approach.

Buprenorphine Dose Stabilization

The weighted mean stable buprenorphine dose was 14 mg per day. The difference between the initial buprenorphine dose on day 1 and the stable dose ranged from 0.0 to 31.2 mg, with a crude mean of 11.7 mg. The difference between the total dose on the first day and the stable dose ranged from 0.0 to 28.8 mg with a crude mean of 6 mg.

Individual studies' progression from the first buprenorphine dose to stabilization varied widely (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-3). For example, a stable dose of buprenorphine was reached in a single day in some studies. Other studies used various fixed, multiple-day schedules that were designed to reach target doses anywhere between 8 mg and 32 mg over 2 to 7 days.,

In 3 studies, buprenorphine dosing was determined by the patient's response to the previous buprenorphine doses.

A single study used transdermal buprenorphine for the transition. The remaining studies were vague in their descriptions of the stabilization process.,

The microdosing procedure used in the case series is described in detail in Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2. Briefly, the intended process was to administer the patient's full dose of methadone for 7 days concurrently with an increasing dose of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone. The protocol used in the case series was intended to begin with a single 0.5-mg dose once on the first day and then escalate to an 8-mg dose the following morning and a 4-mg dose in the evening on day 7 (which was also the last day of methadone — still at the full dose). On day 8, the patient began taking a single daily 12-mg dose of buprenorphine. Two of 3 patients whose outcomes were described in the case series ultimately deviated from the treatment protocol (Supplementary Digital Content Table B-2).

### Low dose initiation of buprenorphine: a narrative review and practical approach [^1153RLms]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Low dose buprenorphine initiation, is an alternative method of initiating buprenorphine in which the starting dose is very low and gradually increased to therapeutic levels over a period of days. This method takes advantage of slow displacement of the full opioid agonist from mu-opioid receptors, avoiding the need for a person with opioid use disorder to experience opioid withdrawal symptoms before initiating buprenorphine, while also minimizing the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal. With this initiation method, full opioid agonists can be continued as buprenorphine is initiated, expanding the population to which buprenorphine can be offered. To date, the literature on low dose initiation is primarily case-based but rapidly growing. While evidence emerges, guidance for the use of low dose initiation is clearly desired and urgently needed in the context of an increasingly risky and contaminated opioid drug supply, particularly with high potency synthetic opioids, driving overdose deaths. Despite limited evidence, several principles to guide low dose initiation have been identified including: (1) choosing the appropriate clinical situation, (2) initiating at a low buprenorphine dose, (3) titrating the buprenorphine dose gradually, (4) continuing the full opioid agonist even if it is nonmedical, (5) communicating clearly with frequent monitoring, (6) pausing or delaying buprenorphine dose changes if opioid withdrawal symptoms occur, and (7) prioritizing care coordination. We review a practical approach to low dose initiation in hospital-based and outpatient settings guided by the current evidence.

Buprenorphine induction can be challenging for patients with chronic pain or patients who are unable to cease opioids for sufficient time to prevent precipitated opioid withdrawal. In the outpatient setting, low-dose buprenorphine induction strategies have been described to avoid these barriers; however, these strategies are not generalizable to the hospital setting where specific medication regulations may apply. We report a novel strategy for hospital-based low-dose buprenorphine initiation that facilitates transition from full opioid agonists to buprenorphine.

Naltrexone transition to methadone or buprenorphine — indications, process, and safety are outlined as follows: Transitioning from naltrexone to other opioid treatment medications may be appropriate when a patient experiences intolerable side effects, has not been successful in attaining or maintaining treatment goals through the initially chosen pharmacotherapy, or wants to change medications and is a candidate for alternative treatment. Transfer of medications should be planned, considered, and monitored, and transitioning from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment. Patients being transitioned from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids and thus the initial doses of methadone or buprenorphine should be low, with clinicians discussing potential sedation, impairment, and fatigue and carefully monitoring these symptoms during initiation and titration. Patients should not be transitioned until a significant amount of the naltrexone is no longer in their system, which varies but is typically about 1 day for oral naltrexone or 28 days for extended-release injectable naltrexone. Patients who discontinue naltrexone treatment should be made aware of the increased risks associated with opioid overdose, especially the increased risk of overdose death, and treatment alternatives including methadone and buprenorphine, as well as overdose prevention with naloxone, should be discussed.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — Buprenorphine indications, initiation, and dosing: Buprenorphine is a recommended treatment for patients with opioid use disorder who are able to give informed consent and have no specific contraindication, and for patients who are currently opioid dependent buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Once objective signs of withdrawal are observed, initiation should start with a dose of 2–4 mg and dosages may be increased in increments of 2–8 mg, with the initiation setting determined by clinical judgement because both office-based and home-based initiation are considered safe and effective when starting buprenorphine treatment. Following initiation, the buprenorphine dose should be titrated to alleviate symptoms to enable patients to discontinue illicit opioid use, evidence suggests that 16 mg per day or more may be more effective than lower doses, and there is limited evidence regarding the relative efficacy of doses higher than 24 mg per day with the use of higher doses potentially increasing the risk of diversion. The FDA recently approved several new buprenorphine formulations for treatment of opioid use disorder and, as effectiveness data are currently limited, clinicians should use these products as indicated and be mindful of emerging evidence as it becomes available. Patients' psychosocial needs should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs in conjunction with buprenorphine, but a patient's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay buprenorphine treatment with appropriate medication management.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) — perioperative management for patients on methadone or buprenorphine: Discontinuation of methadone or buprenorphine before surgery is not required, and higher-potency intravenous full agonist opioids can be used perioperatively for analgesia. Decisions related to discontinuing or adjusting the dose of buprenorphine prior to a planned surgery should be made on an individual basis through consultation between the surgical and anesthesia teams and the addiction treatment provider when possible. If it is decided that buprenorphine or methadone should be discontinued before planned surgery, this may occur the day before or the day of surgery. Methadone or buprenorphine can be resumed post‑operatively when the need for full opioid agonist analgesia has resolved, the initial dose and titration should typically be determined by the prescriber, and in general, pre‑surgery daily doses can be resumed if they were withheld for less than 2–3 days.

### High-dose buprenorphine treatment in the setting of fentanyl [^111d4Fvd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The emergence of fentanyl in the setting of the US opioid crisis demands reconsideration of clinical approaches to buprenorphine initiation for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), with the rationale that fentanyl's unique pharmacology leads to a greater risk of precipitated withdrawal (PW). Use of high-dose buprenorphine for initiation is a strategy that has been hypothesized to lead to less PW and better retention. In the absence of randomized clinical trials, it is important for clinicians to understand the evidence that suggests benefits of high-dose approaches while recognizing methodological limitations.

Observations

This article summarizes observational studies that have been published as of 2025 addressing key questions relevant to a high-dose buprenorphine approach. First, how common is PW with the standard-dose initiation of buprenorphine for persons who use fentanyl? Is the risk greater than for persons who do not use fentanyl? Second, is high-dose buprenorphine initiation associated with lower risk of PW compared with standard dose? Finally, is initiation of high-dose buprenorphine associated with better long-term treatment outcomes (greater retention and less health care utilization) compared with standard dose?

Conclusions and Relevance

Several recent studies provided a range of prevalence rates (1%-16%) for PW with buprenorphine initiation for persons with OUD using fentanyl, which may reflect differences in study design and setting. While certain studies described rates of PW that were 3 to 4 times higher among those with fentanyl use compared with those without, they were limited by low power due to the small number of PW events. Studies also did not provide clear evidence as to whether higher buprenorphine initiation is associated with lower risk of PW. Studies suggest higher retention and lower health care utilization with high dose vs the standard approach; however, there were methodologic problems due to observational study design, such as immortal time bias and unmeasured confounding. Evidence to inform clinicians' decisions whether to initiate buprenorphine treatment with high-dose strategies among patients who use fentanyl was limited, and more definitive studies are needed.

Withdrawal management with opioid agonists — methadone and buprenorphine notes that methadone and buprenorphine are both recommended for management of opioid withdrawal, and withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an OTP or inpatient setting. Opioid withdrawal management, on its own, without ongoing pharmacotherapy, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate to the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If the decision is made to taper, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and methadone tapers generally start with doses in the range of 20–30 mg per day and are completed in 6–10 days.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115pim5J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM 2020 opioid withdrawal — summary of recommendations includes the following: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, and abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome with risks including relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method and is not recommended; patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and ongoing maintenance medication with psychosocial treatment is the standard of care. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, methadone-based withdrawal management must be done in an OTP or an acute care setting; for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids the initial dose should typically be 20–30 mg per day and patients may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given (an initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine may be considered), and the dose is increased as needed. However, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

### Buprenorphine (buprenorphine transdermal system) [^1159x8PM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Titration and Maintenance of Therapy

Individually titrate buprenorphine transdermal system to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions. Continually reevaluate patients receiving buprenorphine transdermal system to assess the maintenance of pain control, signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and other adverse reactions, as well as reassessing for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.19)]. Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration. During use of opioid therapy for an extended period of time, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

The minimum buprenorphine transdermal system titration interval is 72 hours, based on the pharmacokinetic profile and time to reach steady state levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The maximum buprenorphine transdermal system dose is 20 mcg/hour. Do not exceed a dose of one 20 mcg/hour buprenorphine transdermal system due to the risk of QTc interval prolongation. In a clinical trial, buprenorphine transdermal system 40 mcg/hour (given as two buprenorphine transdermal system 20 mcg/hour systems) resulted in prolongation of the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Management of opioid use disorder, opioid withdrawal, and opioid overdose prevention in hospitalized adults: a systematic review of existing guidelines [^1155UXC9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations related to the consequences of opioid use are rising. National guidelines directing in-hospital opioid use disorder (OUD) management do not exist. OUD treatment guidelines intended for other treatment settings could inform in-hospital OUD management.

Objective

Evaluate the quality and content of existing guidelines for OUD treatment and management.

Data Sources

OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid PsychINFO, EBSCOhost CINHAL, ERCI Guidelines Trust, websites of relevant societies and advocacy organizations, and selected international search engines.

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2010 to June 2020 addressing OUD treatment, opioid withdrawal management, opioid overdose prevention, and care transitions among adults.

Data Extraction

We assessed quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.

Data Synthesis

Nineteen guidelines met the selection criteria. Most recommendations were based on observational studies or expert consensus. Guidelines recommended the use of nonstigmatizing language among patients with OUD; to assess patients with unhealthy opioid use for OUD using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Diseases-5th Edition criteria; use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat OUD and opioid withdrawal; use of multimodal, nonopioid therapy, and when needed, short-acting opioid analgesics in addition to buprenorphine or methadone, for acute pain management; ensuring linkage to ongoing methadone or buprenorphine treatment; referring patients to psychosocial treatment; and ensuring access to naloxone for opioid overdose reversal.

Conclusions

Included guidelines were informed by studies with various levels of rigor and quality. Future research should systematically study buprenorphine and methadone initiation and titration among people using fentanyl and people with pain, especially during hospitalization.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pharmacotherapy options outlines that the medications covered include those approved by the FDA for treatment of opioid use disorder, that FDA approvals have primarily been for "opioid dependence" as defined in prior DSM versions, and that pharmacologic treatment may not be appropriate for all patients along the opioid use disorder continuum; in one study optimal concordance occurred when four or more DSM-5 criteria were endorsed, the DSM-5 threshold for moderate opioid use disorder. Medications to be discussed include methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, naloxone, lofexidine, and clonidine; since 2015, in May 2018 the FDA approved the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist lofexidine as a treatment for withdrawal symptoms when opioids are abruptly discontinued, whereas clonidine is described as not FDA-approved for opioid use disorder and commonly used off-label for opioid withdrawal. Key outcomes for evaluating efficacy include decreased mortality, abstinence from opioids, and retention in treatment; a 2016 Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis found no difference between methadone and buprenorphine in retaining patients in treatment, reducing illicit opioid use or in reported adverse events, and a 2016 CADTH review found methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone equally effective in reducing mortality, with buprenorphine/naloxone more likely to produce abstinence while more patients on methadone were retained in treatment.

Buprenorphine treatment — duration and tapering: There is no recommended time limit for treatment with buprenorphine, and clinicians should not encourage patients to discontinue medication based on a pre-determined duration of treatment. Generally, treatment participation for less than 90 days is of limited effectiveness, and treatment lasting significantly longer is associated with more positive long-term outcomes. Patients and clinicians should not take the decision to terminate treatment with buprenorphine lightly; buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process and close monitoring is recommended, and buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months. Factors that may be taken into consideration include employment and financial stability; housing stability; engagement in mutual-help programs or involvement in other meaningful activities; sustained abstinence from opioid and other drugs during treatment; positive changes in psychosocial environment; evidence of additional psychosocial supports; and persistent engagement in treatment or ongoing monitoring past the point of medication discontinuation. Patients who relapse after pharmacotherapy has been discontinued should be returned to treatment with buprenorphine.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: a review [^1123sNKr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

More than 80,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2021, an increase of 61% in only 2 years. The mortality surge is largely due to exposure to unregulated, illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues (hereafter referred to as "fentanyl"). Fentanyl's lethality is conferred by its exceedingly high potency and lipophilicity. Buprenorphine and methadone, the 2 most effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs), remain valuable tools to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) and reduce fentanyl overdose death and other harms. It is more important than ever to optimize their use at scale.

Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, observes that "higher rates of tolerance and physical dependence associated with repeated fentanyl use might necessitate higher doses of methadone or buprenorphine than for other OUDs". Evolving research findings suggest a dangerous trend toward lower rates of MOUD initiation and retention since fentanyl use became prevalent, as well as a trend toward higher required doses of methadone.

The increased lethality of the drug supply highlights the importance of patient-centered care, which respects and responds to individuals' specific health needs and desired health outcomes, and ensures that patient values drive healthcare decisions. Examples of effective patient-centered strategies in treating substance use disorders include use of harm reduction principles, trauma-informed care, and peer recovery support. – A key component of patient-centered care in buprenorphine treatment for OUD is shared decision making in titrating the dose to achieve mutually agreed-upon treatment goals. Instead of collaboration, however, patients frequently face absolute dose limits of 16 or 24 mg/d. These limits often lead to inadequate protection against fentanyl use because of persistent withdrawal symptoms and craving — ultimately inducing patients to leave treatment.

In medicine, we are generally concerned about too high a dose being potential "poison". However, underdosing (eg, with oxygen, vasopressors, and antibiotics) can also lead to patient harm. Widespread underdosing of buprenorphine, if responsible for treatment failure, could directly harm many patients whose primary goals are simply to survive and avoid withdrawal. Because ongoing use of illicit fentanyl is frequently lethal, the rationale for buprenorphine dose limits must be evaluated carefully and justified using the highest standards of evidence.

### Dose-specific clinical outcomes in patients with opioid use disorder treated with 24–32 mg / day of buprenorphine [^117SSiyb]. Addiction (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

In people with opioid use disorder (OUD), buprenorphine is a vital treatment to decrease opioid use and overdose. The US Food and Drug Administration's prescribing information for buprenorphine advises dosing up to 24mg/day; however, doses of buprenorphine up to 32mg have been shown to be safe and effective. We compared outcomes associated increased dosing from 24 to 32mg/day.

Design

Prospective cohort investigation.

Setting

Low-barrier buprenorphine clinic in Washington, District of Columbia, USA.

Participants

Participants in the ANCHOR study (people with hepatitis C virus (HCV), OUD, and active opioid misuse who were treated for HCV and offered buprenorphine) who received buprenorphine at doses of 24 and/or 32mg/day. 72 participants were included in the analysis: 24 (33%) patients stabilized on 24mg, and 48 (67%) patients stabilized on 32mg. Patients were predominantly male (78%), Black (96%), unstably housed (57%), and used opioids by injection (93%).

Measurements

Patient-reported drug use, use frequency, triggers for use, and urine drug screens were collected at each visit. For analysis, the cohort was divided into individuals stabilized on 24mg (24mg cohort) or 32mg (32mg cohort). Drug use outcomes were assessed between cohorts at 24mg dosing and at respective maximum dosing. Within the 32mg cohort, outcomes were compared at 24mg versus 32mg dosing.

Findings

Within the 32mg cohort, increased dosing from 24 to 32mg was associated with a decline in opioid use (68.5% [5.2%] at 24mg vs 59.5% [5.6%] at 32mg; P = 0.02), frequency of use per week (1.58 [0.19] at 24mg vs. 1.15 [0.16] at 32mg; P = 0.0002) and physiologic triggers for use (38.2% [6.0%] at 24mg vs 7.0% [1.9%] at 32mg; P < 0.0001). At the end of the study period, there were significantly more patients retained in the 32mg cohort (78.7%) compared with the 24mg cohort (50.0%, P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Higher buprenorphine dosing (32mg/day) appears to improve outcomes in people with opioid use disorder, even in the absence of abstinence.

### Associations of methadone and BUP / NX dose titration patterns with retention in treatment and opioid use in individuals with prescription-type opioid use disorder: secondary analysis of the OPTIMA study [^114Df51Z]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) titration parameters (eg, range, duration, and rate) can vary during opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment. We describe methadone and BUP/NX titration patterns and their associations with treatment outcomes among individuals with a prescription-type OUD.

Methods

We used data from a 24-week open-label, multicenter randomized controlled trial, including N = 167 participants aged 18–64 years old with prescription-type OUD who received at least a first dose of treatment. Descriptive analyses of methadone and BUP/NX titration patterns were conducted, that is, range and duration from first to maximum dose, and rate (range/duration ratio). Outcomes included percentage of opioid-positive urine drug screens (UDS) and treatment retention. Adjusted linear and logistic regressions were used to study associations between titration patterns and percentage of opioid-positive UDS and treatment retention.

Results

Methadone doses were increased by a mean dose range of 42.4 mg over a mean duration of 42.2 days. BUP/NX doses were increased by a mean dose range of 8.4 mg over a mean duration of 28.7 days. Only methadone dose titration range (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05) and duration (odds ratio: 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05) were associated with higher retention. Only methadone dose titration rate was associated with lower percentage of opioid-positive UDS at weeks 12–24 (B: -2.77; 95% CI, -4.72 to -0.81).

Conclusions

Specific parameters of methadone titration were associated with treatment outcomes and may help in personalizing treatment schedules. Sustained methadone dose titration, when indicated, may help increase retention, whereas faster dose titration for methadone may help decrease opioid use.

### Patients maintained on buprenorphine for opioid use disorder should continue buprenorphine through the perioperative period [^113piDkR]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

We recommend continuing the dose of buprenorphine at 12 mg or less for one to three days after surgery should other opioids be needed for breakthrough pain, after which buprenorphine can be returned to its preoperative dose and the other opioids tapered in as timely a way as possible. Involving an acute pain service in the management of these patients is ideal. Analgesia is challenging in this patient population, and co-management with pain specialty services may help with pain control, buprenorphine dosing, and timely patient discharge. Communication prior to discharge between inpatient and outpatient treatment providers is key to the successful management of these patients. Postoperative planning is optimized by preoperative care coordination.

We recognize that discontinuing buprenorphine completely may be a better option for some patients and support the personalization of pain medicine for each individual. But we nonetheless believe that the practice of routinely discontinuing buprenorphine in this setting is misguided. Maintaining buprenorphine through the peri-operative period in patients being treated for opioid use disorder avoids risk of relapse and undue burden on the health care system and promotes safety, adherence, and continuity of care.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111pLDoC]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine management — clinicians should take steps to reduce the chance of buprenorphine diversion; recommended strategies may include frequent office visits (e.g., weekly in early treatment), drug testing including testing for buprenorphine and metabolites, and recall visits for medication counts. Drug testing should be used to monitor patients for adherence to buprenorphine and use of illicit and controlled substances, and patients should be seen frequently at the beginning of treatment until they are determined to be stable. When transitioning from buprenorphine to naltrexone, 7–14 days should typically elapse between the last buprenorphine dose and the start of naltrexone, whereas when transitioning from buprenorphine to methadone there is no required time delay. There is no recommended time limit for pharmacological treatment with buprenorphine, and buprenorphine taper and discontinuation is a slow process with close monitoring recommended; buprenorphine tapering is generally accomplished over several months.

Buprenorphine initiation setting — during initiation, the setting should be carefully considered, and both office-based and home-based observation is considered safe and effective; clinical judgement should be used to determine the most appropriate setting for a given patient and may include consideration of the patient's past experience with buprenorphine and assessment of their ability to manage initiation at home.

### Buprenorphine / naloxone vs methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder [^112xGDGd]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Previous studies on the comparative effectiveness between buprenorphine and methadone provided limited evidence on differences in treatment effects across key subgroups and were drawn from populations who use primarily heroin or prescription opioids, although fentanyl use is increasing across North America.

Objective

To assess the risk of treatment discontinuation and mortality among individuals receiving buprenorphine/naloxone vs methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Population-based retrospective cohort study using linked health administrative databases in British Columbia, Canada. The study included treatment recipients between January 1, 2010, and March 17, 2020, who were 18 years or older and not incarcerated, pregnant, or receiving palliative cancer care at initiation.

Exposures

Receipt of buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone among incident (first-time) users and prevalent new users (including first and subsequent treatment attempts).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% compatibility (confidence) intervals were estimated for treatment discontinuation (lasting ≥ 5 days for methadone and ≥ 6 days for buprenorphine/naloxone) and all-cause mortality within 24 months using discrete-time survival models for comparisons of medications as assigned at initiation regardless of treatment adherence ("initiator") and received according to dosing guidelines (approximating per-protocol analysis).

Results

A total of 30 891 incident users (39% receiving buprenorphine/naloxone; 66% male; median age, 33 [25th-75th, 26–43] years) were included in the initiator analysis and 25 614 in the per-protocol analysis. Incident users of buprenorphine/naloxone had a higher risk of treatment discontinuation compared with methadone in initiator analyses (88.8% vs 81.5% discontinued at 24 months; adjusted HR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.53–1.63]), with limited change in estimates when evaluated at optimal dose in per-protocol analysis (42.1% vs 30.7%; adjusted HR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.58–1.76]). Per-protocol analyses of mortality while receiving treatment exhibited ambiguous results among incident users (0.08% vs 0.13% mortality at 24 months; adjusted HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.24–1.35]) and among prevalent users (0.08% vs 0.09%; adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.54–1.73]). Results were consistent after the introduction of fentanyl and across patient subgroups and sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance

Receipt of methadone was associated with a lower risk of treatment discontinuation compared with buprenorphine/naloxone. The risk of mortality while receiving treatment was similar for buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone, although the CI estimate for the hazard ratio was wide.

Buprenorphine extended-release injection (Brixadi) — weekly or monthly administration is for moderate to severe opioid use disorder in patients who have initial treatment with a single dose of transmucosal buprenorphine or who are already being treated with buprenorphine; formulation considerations include tentative approval from FDA (not eligible for marketing in the U.S. until November 30, 2020), no risk for patient diversion or misuse, only a single prior dose of transmucosal buprenorphine required prior to initiation, weekly or monthly instead of daily medication compliance, and less fluctuation in buprenorphine levels (compared to daily doses).

2.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Severe Hepatic Impairment

Consider reducing the starting and titration incremental dose by half compared to patients with normal liver function, and monitor for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine.

Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Although no dose adjustment is necessary for patients with moderate hepatic impairment, buprenorphine hydrochloride sublingual tablets should be used with caution in these patients and prescribers should monitor patients for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine.

Mild Hepatic Impairment

No clinically significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

2.7 Unstable Patients

Healthcare providers will need to decide when they cannot appropriately provide further management for particular patients. For example, some patients may be abusing or dependent on various drugs, or unresponsive to psychosocial intervention such that the healthcare provider does not feel that he/she has the expertise to manage the patient. In such cases, the healthcare provider may want to assess whether to refer the patient to a specialist or more intensive behavioral treatment environment. Decisions should be based on a treatment plan established and agreed upon with the patient at the beginning of treatment.

Patients who continue to misuse, abuse, or divert buprenorphine products or other opioids should be provided with, or referred to, more intensive and structured treatment.

2.8 Stopping Treatment

The decision to discontinue therapy with buprenorphine and naloxone or buprenorphine after a period of maintenance should be made as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. Both gradual and abrupt discontinuation of buprenorphine has been used, but the data are insufficient to determine the best method of dose taper at the end of treatment.

### High-dose buprenorphine induction in the emergency department for treatment of opioid use disorder [^112hnMSS]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Initiation of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the emergency department (ED), combined with linkage to outpatient care, is an effective strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity among persons living with opioid addiction. With a total of 50 042 lives lost in 2019 because of opioid overdose deaths, projections of a 30% increase in 2020, and evidence that ED-initiated buprenorphine is both life-saving and cost-effective, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the US Surgeon General, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration have all called for ED access to initiation of buprenorphine for treatment of OUD. Yet, patients frequently face substantial barriers to obtaining buprenorphine in a timely manner after ED discharge because of a lack of ED clinicians with US Drug Enforcement Agency X-waivers permitting them to prescribe buprenorphine or other logistical issues in filling prescriptions associated with prior authorization requirements, transportation, and health insurance coverage gaps.,

The timing and dose of buprenorphine during induction may be an opportunity to address the lack of timely follow-up care after ED discharge. Existing treatment guidelines published by the Department of Health and Human Services, which were developed for office-based practice, limit the maximum sublingual (SL) buprenorphine induction dose during the first 24 hours to 8 to 12 mg. For most individuals with OUD, higher doses are required for effective agonist blockade and suppression of opioid withdrawal and craving. An accelerated induction procedure that achieves therapeutic buprenorphine levels obtained in less than 3 to 4 hours, vs the typical 2 to 3 days, could potentially increase safety during the crucial gap between ED discharge and continuation of treatment in the outpatient setting.

Thus, we evaluated an ED high-dose (> 12 mg) buprenorphine induction clinical pathway (Figure 1). We sought to describe patient and visit characteristics, clinical outcomes, and any adverse events associated with the high-dose protocol in a large cohort of patients with OUD presenting in opioid withdrawal.
