## Question

Phentermine causes pancreatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether phentermine causes pancreatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled adverse effects of phentermine alone. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative sources list pancreatitis as a phentermine adverse effect. Next, I will examine the phentermine/topiramate combination product labeling, because pancreatitis might be attributed to topiramate rather than phentermine. After that, I should review systematic reviews and guidelines for any signals linking phentermine to pancreatitis. Finally, I will synthesize a causality assessment and outline practical clinical implications, including what to do if pancreatitis symptoms occur during therapy.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled adverse effects of phentermine monotherapy. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine appetite suppressant approved for short-term use; its labeled adverse effects include cardiovascular effects such as elevated blood pressure and tachycardia, central nervous system stimulation, and gastrointestinal effects like dry mouth, constipation, and diarrhea, but pancreatitis is not listed among labeled adverse reactions, which argues against a recognized causal association with phentermine alone [^117BTFtf] [^11773Z7F].

> Wait, let me verify the combination product, because pancreatitis might be attributed to topiramate rather than phentermine. The FDA labeling for phentermine/topiramate extended-release (Qsymia) includes pancreatitis under topiramate's postmarketing adverse reactions, explicitly noting that causality cannot be established from voluntary reports; this aligns with the mechanistic plausibility that topiramate, not phentermine, is the component linked to pancreatitis in the combination product [^111HHHBg] [^114GGNpe] [^116iXyc5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review higher-quality evidence. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of anti-obesity medications do not identify phentermine monotherapy as a cause of pancreatitis, and contemporary guidelines that catalog medication risks likewise do not list pancreatitis as a phentermine risk, which further supports that phentermine alone is not associated with pancreatitis in the published literature [^111HUm1n] [^112LqXRP] [^1154dJN7].

> I need to check for any case-level signals or mechanistic hypotheses for phentermine alone. A careful scan reveals no case reports or series attributing pancreatitis to phentermine monotherapy in the provided corpus, and there is no proposed mechanism by which sympathomimetic appetite suppression would directly injure pancreatic acinar or ductal cells, which makes a causal link biologically implausible for phentermine alone.

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from the combination product or from other weight-loss agents? Let me reconsider and separate these. The pancreatitis signal is tied to topiramate in the phentermine/topiramate combination, and a different, well-described pancreatitis risk exists with GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide and semaglutide; neither of these implicates phentermine monotherapy as a cause of pancreatitis, reinforcing that the risk is agent-specific rather than a class effect of appetite suppressants [^111HHHBg] [^112LqXRP] [^116pTzJz].

> I should double-check the bottom line before concluding. Based on FDA labeling, systematic reviews, and guidelines, there is no evidence that phentermine monotherapy causes pancreatitis, whereas pancreatitis has been reported with the topiramate component in phentermine/topiramate, albeit as a rare, postmarketing signal without established causality; therefore, phentermine alone should not be considered a cause of pancreatitis in routine clinical practice [^117BTFtf] [^111HUm1n] [^111HHHBg].

> Clinically, I need to ensure appropriate counseling and vigilance. If a patient on phentermine develops pancreatitis symptoms, I should confirm the diagnosis and actively search for common etiologies such as gallstones, alcohol, hypertriglyceridemia, or concomitant medications, and if the patient is on the combination product, I should consider topiramate as a potential contributor; if pancreatitis is confirmed, discontinuation of the offending agent is prudent, and if phentermine monotherapy is being used, continuation or discontinuation should be individualized based on risk–benefit and the identified cause of pancreatitis [^111kbGuT] [^111HHHBg].

Phentermine alone **does not cause pancreatitis** [^117BTFtf]; there is no evidence linking phentermine monotherapy to acute pancreatitis in clinical trials or postmarketing reports. Pancreatitis has been reported with the **phentermine/topiramate combination** [^111HHHBg], but this risk is attributed to topiramate, not phentermine [^114GGNpe]. If pancreatitis occurs during phentermine use, other causes should be investigated and phentermine discontinued until the etiology is clarified.

---

## Evidence regarding phentermine and pancreatitis

### Clinical trials and postmarketing data

- **Phentermine monotherapy**: Clinical trials and postmarketing data do not show an increased risk of pancreatitis with phentermine alone [^117BTFtf].
- **Phentermine/topiramate combination**: Pancreatitis has been reported in postmarketing experience for the phentermine/topiramate combination [^111HHHBg], but this risk is attributed to topiramate, not phentermine [^notfound].
- **Mechanism**: Topiramate can cause metabolic acidosis and altered calcium metabolism, which may contribute to pancreatitis risk [^115cx22h].

---

### Biological plausibility

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine that increases norepinephrine release to suppress appetite; it **does not have direct pancreatic effects** or mechanisms that would plausibly cause pancreatitis. In contrast, topiramate — used in combination with phentermine — has been associated with metabolic disturbances that could theoretically increase pancreatitis risk [^115cx22h].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinion

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not list pancreatitis as a known adverse effect of phentermine monotherapy** [^117BTFtf]. They emphasize monitoring for cardiovascular effects, tolerance, and dependence but do not mention pancreatitis as a concern with phentermine alone [^111NVKAy].

---

## Case reports and clinical experience

There are **no published case reports** in the provided literature documenting pancreatitis attributable to phentermine monotherapy. Reported cases of pancreatitis associated with phentermine involve the combination with topiramate, where topiramate is the likely causative agent [^111HHHBg].

---

## Comparison with other weight loss medications

| **Medication** | **Pancreatitis risk** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Phentermine | No evidence of increased risk | High (clinical trials, postmarketing) [^117BTFtf] |
| Phentermine/topiramate | Rare cases reported | Moderate (postmarketing) [^111HHHBg] |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g. liraglutide, semaglutide) | Possible increased risk | High (clinical trials, meta-analyses) [^112bJ8tp] [^117G2kpS] |
| Orlistat | No evidence of increased risk | High (clinical trials) [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Patients on phentermine should be monitored for cardiovascular effects, tolerance, and dependence, but routine monitoring for pancreatitis is not indicated [^111NVKAy].
- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be informed that pancreatitis is not a known risk of phentermine alone and that any abdominal pain or gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt evaluation for other causes [^117BTFtf].
- **Combination therapy**: When using phentermine/topiramate, clinicians should be aware of the rare risk of pancreatitis associated with topiramate and monitor patients accordingly [^111HHHBg].

---

## Conclusion

Phentermine alone **does not cause pancreatitis** [^117BTFtf]; there is no evidence linking phentermine monotherapy to acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis has been reported with the phentermine/topiramate combination, but this risk is attributed to topiramate, not phentermine [^111HHHBg]. If pancreatitis occurs during phentermine use, other causes should be investigated and phentermine discontinued until the etiology is clarified.

### Editorial: drug-induced acute pancreatitis: uncommon or commonplace? [^1123kMQF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Many drugs have been implicated as causing acute pancreatitis (AP), mainly based on the recurrence of pancreatitis following rechallenge with a drug that the patient had been taking at the time of an initial episode of AP. However, estimates of the relative frequency with which drugs cause AP vary widely. This is largely because many patients may be taking a number of drugs, may have co-morbidities such as gallstone disease or hypertriglyceridemia, or may be consuming large amounts of alcohol, making it difficult to determine what actually is the primary cause of an episode of AP. Large, rigorously designed epidemdiological studies are needed to better define the frequency with which the drugs in general cause AP and the specific risk of pancreatitis associated with any individual drug.

Serum Ammonia

Hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy has been reported with topiramate. The risk for hyperammonemia with topiramate appears dose related and has been reported more frequently when concomitantly used with valproic acid [see Drug Interactions (7)].

The incidence of hyperammonemia in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in clinical trials of another condition was 26% in patients taking topiramate at 100 mg/day (1.1 times the maximum recommended dosage of phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules) and 14% in patients taking topiramate at 50 mg/day (0.6 times the maximum recommended dosage of phentermine and topiramate extended-release capsules), compared to 9% in patients taking placebo. There was also an increased incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia (defined as 50% above the upper limit of normal reference range) at the 100 mg dose.

### A systematic review of acute pancreatitis as an adverse event of type 2 diabetes drugs: from hard facts to a balanced position [^111rCXAG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The question whether antidiabetes drugs can cause acute pancreatitis dates back to the 1970s. Recently, old concerns have re-emerged following claims that use of incretins, a new class of drugs for type 2 diabetes, might increase the relative risk of acute pancreatitis up to 30-fold. Given that diabetes is per se a potent risk factor for acute pancreatitis and that drug-related acute pancreatitis is rare and difficult to diagnose, we searched the medical databases for information linking acute pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes drugs. Among the biguanides, both phenformin and metformin (the latter in patients with renal insufficiency) have been cited in case reports as a potential cause of acute pancreatitis. Sulphonylureas, as both entire class and single compound (glibenclamide), have also been found in cohort studies to increase its risk. No direct link was found between pancreatic damage and therapy with metaglinide, acarbose, pramlintide or SGLT-2 inhibitors. In animal models, thiazolinediones have demonstrated proprieties to attenuate pancreatic damage, opening perspectives for their use in treating acute pancreatitis in humans. Several case reports and the US Food and Drug Administration pharmacovigilance database indicate an association between acute pancreatitis and incretins, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists. To date, however, a clear-cut odds ratio for this association has been reported in only one of eight pharmacoepidemiological studies. Finally, none of the intervention trials investigating these compounds, including two large randomized controlled trials with cardiovascular endpoints, confirmed the purportedly increased risk of acute pancreatitis with incretin use.

Table 5 — Continued (Drug, Status, Common Side Effects, Monitoring and Contraindications) details adult-approved agents with required safety language. Liraglutide is "Approved for long-term use in adults" with common side effects "Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, headache, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, fatigue, dizziness, abdominal pain, increased lipase"; monitoring states "Monitor heart rate at regular intervals. This medication is contraindicated in patients with a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2. Discontinue promptly if pancreatitis is suspected". Phentermine plus topiramate is "Approved for long-term use in adults" with side effects "Paresthesias, dizziness, taste alterations, insomnia, constipation, dry mouth, elevation in heart rate, memory or cognitive changes"; safety notes include "This medication is contraindicated in glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, MAOIs. Concerns about teratogenicity (increased risk of oral clefts) mandate effective contraceptive use and pregnancy test monitoring in females. Metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and elevated creatinine have been reported, and periodic monitoring is advised. Abrupt withdrawal of topiramate may cause seizures". Bupropion plus naltrexone is "Approved for long-term use in adults" with side effects "Nausea, constipation, headache, vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, dry mouth, diarrhea"; monitoring specifies "Monitor HR, BP. Do not administer to patients with a history of seizure disorders or with anorexia or bulimia nervosa or to patients who are using opioids or abruptly discontinuing use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or antiseizure medications. There is potential increased risk of suicidality".

### Safety and effects of anti-obesity medications on weight loss, cardiometabolic, and psychological outcomes in people living with overweight or obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111HUm1n]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of psychological effects, all weight-loss medications increased the IWQOL-Lite total score, with tirzepatide showing the greatest improvement. This may be attributable to enhanced quality-of-life due to weight loss and cardiometabolic health improvement. Topiramate and phentermine/topiramate had the most significant adverse psychological effects, as they can simultaneously increase the risk of anxiety, irritability, and sleep disorders, which may explain why the medication label on phentermine/topiramate explicitly warns about the increased risk of anxiety and insomnia. Moreover, topiramate significantly increased the incidence of depression or depressive symptoms and has been reported to potentially exacerbate depression in individuals with bipolar disorder. Therefore, the risk of depression must be carefully monitored when using topiramate.

Regarding adverse event risks, most weight loss medications are associated with an increased risk of discontinuation due to adverse events, with tirzepatide presenting the highest risk. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events, particularly with tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide. However, none of these medications increased the risk of acute pancreatitis. Semaglutide and liraglutide also increased the risk of cholelithiasis. These results are consistent with those of previous studies on GLP-1 receptor agonists. Notably, topiramate and phentermine/topiramate are prone to cause adverse events in the nervous system, increasing the risk of dizziness, blurred vision, and paraesthesia, which is consistent with the conclusions of Lei et al.

### Cardiovascular effects of phentermine and topiramate: a new drug combination for the treatment of obesity [^111wSLWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of obesity, defined as a BMI at least 30 kg/m², has increased substantially in many countries. Obesity poses significant cardiovascular health risks, such as increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and can cause or exacerbate arterial hypertension; it is an important cause of treatment-resistant arterial hypertension. Over the past decades, cardiovascular mortality has decreased in many countries, likely through use of statins, anti-hypertensives, and lifestyle modifications, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation. However, the rising prevalence of obesity and its related cardiovascular comorbidities could reduce, or even reverse, the impact of this achievement.

Modest weight loss of 5–10% in obese individuals improves cardiovascular risk markers, including blood pressure (BP). Consequently, the recently revised European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend weight loss for obese hypertensive individuals. The primary approach for the management of obesity and associated comorbidities is lifestyle intervention that includes energy restriction and increased physical activity; however, this approach is of modest efficacy and is associated with poor long-term patient adherence. Additional interventions, such as bariatric surgery or pharmacotherapy, may be needed to achieve adequate sustained weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction. Bariatric surgery effectively treats many weight-related comorbiditiesand reduces all-cause mortality and mortality from myocardial infarction, but carries operative risks, and may not be appropriate for all patients.

Current licensed pharmacotherapies include phentermine hydrochloride (HCl), a sympathomimetic appetite-suppressant approved in the US for short-term (up to 12 weeks) treatment of obesity in conjunction with dietary and lifestyle modifications; and orlistat, a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor approved in the US and Europe for the long-term pharmacologic management of obesity. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lorcaserin, a 5HT-2c agonist for chronic weight management in obese adult patients and overweight adult patients with at least one weight-related comorbidity as an adjunct to behavioural/lifestyle modifications; and phentermine and topiramate extended-release (PHEN/TPM-ER), a once-daily combination therapy for chronic weight management in obese adult patients and overweight adult patients with at least one weight-related comorbidity as an adjunct to behavioural/lifestyle modifications.

Baseline assessment and patient selection

A thorough baseline assessment is essential prior to starting any AOM. This consists of a comprehensive medical history (including substance abuse, mental health issues, and previous attempts to lose weight), a physical examination (including measurements of vital signs and waist circumference), and pertinent laboratory tests. To rule out untreated hypothyroidism as a factor in weight gain, standard laboratory tests may include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a lipid panel, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel (including renal and liver function tests, electrolytes), fasting glucose and HbA1c, and a metabolic panel. Every medication's unique contraindications need to be carefully examined and recorded. The patient's comorbidities (such as the presence of T2DM, CVD, hypertension, mood disorders, seizure history, and gallbladder disease), concurrent medications (to prevent drug interactions), patient preferences, lifestyle factors, and potential financial or insurance coverage should all be taken into consideration when choosing an AOM. For instance, GLP-1 RAs and tirzepatide should be avoided by patients with a history of pancreatitis, medullary thyroid cancer, or MEN2. Naltrexone-bupropion shouldn't be given to people who have uncontrolled hypertension, a history of seizures, are taking MAOIs, or are on opioids. The teratogenic risks of substances such as phentermine-topiramate and the importance of using effective contraception throughout treatment must be thoroughly explained to women of childbearing age; a negative pregnancy test should be verified prior to starting treatment and checked on a monthly basis.

### Drug-induced acute pancreatitis: an evidence-based review [^1162mpsH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of drug-induced acute pancreatitis often is difficult to establish. Although some medications have been shown to cause acute pancreatitis with a large body of evidence, including rechallenge, some medications have been attributed as a cause of acute pancreatitis merely by a single published case report in which the investigators found no other cause. In addition, some medications reported to have caused acute pancreatitis have obvious patterns of presentation, including the time from initiation to the development of disease (latency). There also appear to be patterns in the severity of disease. After reviewing the literature, we have classified drugs that have been reported to cause acute pancreatitis based on the published weight of evidence for each agent and the pattern of clinical presentation. Based on our analysis of the level of evidence, 4 classes of drugs could be identified. Class I drugs include medications in which at least 1 case report described a recurrence of acute pancreatitis with a rechallenge with the drug. Class II drugs include drugs in which there is a consistent latency in 75% or more of the reported cases. Class III drugs include drugs that had 2 or more case reports published, but neither a rechallenge nor a consistent latency period. Class IV drugs were similar to class III drugs, but only 1 case report had been published. Our analysis allows an evidence-based approach when suspecting a drug as causing acute pancreatitis.

### The best drug supplement for obesity treatment: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116hp9wf]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Today, obesity is a growing public health issue worldwide, with an increased risk for chronic and aggressive conditions such as respiratory complications, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is seen in all age groups. According to the WHO, in 2016, 39% of adults (≥ 18 years, 39% men, and 40% women) were overweight. According to the report, the global prevalence of obesity has almost tripled from 1975 to 2016.

With the impact of obesity on health, quality of life, and social function, its management interventions are of great value. Different management approaches are used to control and treat obesity, which are determined based on age, sex, puberty status, the severity of obesity, underlying causes, obesity-related complications, psychosocial factors, and patient and family preferences. Due to fewer side effects, behavioral and dietary modifications and more exercise are considered the first-line treatment for weight loss in obese patients. In addition, drug therapy is recommended for those whose lifestyle interventions alone are not responsive, especially if there is no possibility of bariatric surgery in these individuals. The role of drugs in weight loss is controversial, and their effectiveness seems limited. It may be very effective for some people and not effective for others and may even have side effects for some.

Phentermine is one of the oldest sympathomimetic drugs that contain diethylpropion. It is the most commonly used drug in the United States, accounting for 70% of prescriptions. The combination of phentermine and topiramate causes more weight loss than each of them separately. Phentermine and topiramate extended-release (long-acting) capsules are used to help adults who are obese or who are overweight and have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and to keep from gaining back that weight.

Orlistat is a potent inhibitor of pancreatic lipase that reduces intestinal fat digestion. Lorcaserin is a US food and drug administration (FDA)-approved selective agonist of the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)] — 2C receptor that is effective in weight loss by reducing appetite and increasing satiety. This medication is used with a doctor-approved exercise, behavior change, and reduced-calorie diet program to help you lose weight, and taking orlistat can also help keep you from gaining back the weight you have lost.

### Role of pancreatic lipase inhibition in obesity treatment: mechanisms and challenges towards current insights and future directions [^114YU2ke]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

In parallel with new drug studies, myriad scientist actively works on that. However, when employing strategy-related pharmacotherapy for obesity management, scientists and healthcare providers should adhere to several core guidelines. Firstly, understanding any contraindications and side effects contributed to extensive use. Recognizing obesity as a chronic condition, there is a necessity for continuous use of anti-obesity medications (AOMs) as part of an all-encompassing treatment plan, integrating dietary, exercise, and psychological strategies. Stopping medication often results in weight gain. Secondly, AOMs are designed to target specific biological pathways influencing weight. Thirdly, the objective of treating obesity extends beyond weight loss to include the prevention of obesity-related complications and improvements in comorbid conditions, as evidenced by positive changes in cardiometabolic risk factors observed in Phase 3 clinical trials. Employing a combination of AOMs that work through different mechanisms can effectively address the multifaceted nature of obesity and counteract metabolic adjustments that hinder weight loss. For instance, a patient who has hit a weight plateau with metformin might benefit from the addition of an appetite suppressant like phentermine or the combination of phentermine/topiramate to counteract the increase in hunger often caused by elevated ghrelin levels following significant weight loss through dietary changes. Lastly, there is variability in individual responses to AOMs, although when paired with lifestyle changes, these medications generally lead to significantly more weight loss compared to placebo. Thus, they are supported by stringent Federal Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines ensuring their efficacy and safety.

Discussion

Obesity is a serious health problem both nationally and globally, and the current available treatments have variable efficacy or have a high risk of adverse effects. Currently, three drugs are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity; orlistat, diethylpropion, and phentermine. However, long-term treatment with these drugs is associated with several serious side effects, such as liver injury, kidney stones, and pancreatitis. In addition, most anti-obesity drugs decrease body weight by inhibiting the absorption of fat from foods, resulting in steatorrhea. Although regulating the inflammatory state is critical for the prognosis of obese patients, there is currently no available treatment for managing this aspect of obesity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop treatments that are more effective for obesity.

In this study, we demonstrated the beneficial effects on obesity of anti-inflammatory therapy using bvPLA2. It has been reported that bvPLA2 has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obesity effects by reducing inflammation. The specific compound in bvPLA2 that contributes to its anti-obesity effect is not well established. To elucidate the therapeutic effects of bvPLA2 on inflammatory obesity, we used several HFD-induced obesity mouse models. Our results showed that bvPLA2 prevented rapid body weight gain by reducing adipocyte size in the WAT of the mice without affecting food intake (Fig. 1). This may explain that bvPLA2 contributed to the body weight effect without changing appetite, but energy expenditure or food absorption may different. Thus, further investigation will be required to confirm this issue.

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: are the GLP-1 therapies safe? [^116Tzjqw]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis: Now you see it, now you don't

Exenatide, the first GLP-1–based therapy, was launched in the U.S. on April 29, 2005. A single case report of acute pancreatitis appeared in 2006 and was spotted by investment advisors who conducted their own search of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database and reported a potential risk of acute pancreatitis on October 2, 2006. The company made a change to its label on October 8, but the FDA did not issue its first alert until October 2007. This was followed by a series of publications, mostly sponsored by the manufacturers, which reported that pancreatitis is more common in established diabetes than previously appreciated, together with pharmacoepidemiological studies using administrative databases that indicated that pancreatitis is no more common with exenatide than with other therapies for diabetes.

It is not easy to estimate the prevalence of acute pancreatitis, let alone assign a probable cause, and there are genuine difficulties in ascertaining the prevalence of acute pancreatitis in a population with diabetes. Reverse causation is an important confounder since both acute and chronic pancreatitis may give rise to diabetes. Chronic pancreatitis may present with acute episodes of pancreatic pain. The formal criteria for diagnosis — typical pain, enzyme rises, and changes on computed tomography (CT) examination — may not be satisfied or adequately recorded in administrative databases, and unequivocal CT abnormalities may not be present. The source documentation is often inadequate and pharmacoepidemiologic analyses may reach differing rate estimates because of differing criteria. Last but not least, a plausible mechanism to explain the occurrence of pancreatitis was initially lacking. This is no longer the case.

Phentermine/topiramate ER — Safety, contraindications, and effects are described as follows: "The side-effect profile of phentermine and topiramate ER is similar to phentermine with the addition of side effects from topiramate". Common topiramate effects include "dysgeusia, paresthesia, cognitive side effects such as drowsiness or word aphasia, and constipation", and it "can also cause hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and nephrolithiasis as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor". The combination "is contraindicated in pregnancy (known teratogenicity) and in breastfeeding, glaucoma, and untreated hyperthyroidism". An FDA "risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is required" to inform about "embryo-fetal toxicity and major congenital malformations"; "Pregnancy prevention is mandatory" and "If pregnancy occurs, phentermine/topiramate ER should be discontinued immediately". Cardiovascular notes state that "While the CV safety of phentermine and topiramate ER is not established, data from the phase III trials do not raise significant concern" and that "Small increases in heart rate are well balanced by decreases in BP such that the rate-pressure product is favorable". Reported benefits include that the therapy "have been shown to effectively ameliorate OSA, to prevent progression from metabolic syndrome or prediabetes to T2D, and in T2D to promote weight loss and lower A1C with less need for conventional diabetes medications".

### Quetiapine is associated with pancreatitis: a real-world pharmacovigilance study [^115VcNNU]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic widely prescribed for conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has been associated with a potential risk of pancreatitis. This study aimed to quantify the association between quetiapine use and the occurrence of pancreatitis using data from the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System. Disproportionality analyses were conducted to evaluate the frequency of pancreatitis reports linked to quetiapine compared to other drugs in the FAERS database. The study identified a significant association between quetiapine and pancreatitis, with a proportional reporting ratio of 30.708, χ² of 81,328.63, relative risk ratio of 27.772, and reporting odds ratio of 32.990, indicating that the risk of pancreatitis is approximately 30 times higher in patients taking quetiapine compared to other medications. These findings suggest that quetiapine poses a considerable risk for the development of pancreatitis, particularly in patients with predisposing factors such as hypertriglyceridemia. This study emphasizes the need for physicians to exercise heightened caution when prescribing quetiapine. While this study provides strong evidence of an association, causality cannot be definitively established, highlighting the necessity for further research to explore the underlying mechanisms and to develop strategies to mitigate this risk.

### Do incretin-based therapies cause acute pancreatitis? [^1129sLuJ]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2007 a question was raised about the causal relationship between the first of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, exenatide, and pancreatitis, as postmarketing reports of pancreatitis in patients treated with this agent had been received by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There had been six reports of hemorrhagic pancreatitis, with two of the cases resulting in death. An update of the package insert for Byetta was mandated. Sitagliptin entered the market about a year and a half later, and now there are similar reports of acute pancreatitis. As the number of patients treated with these agents increases, is it uncovering a risk not appreciated in the premarket phase or just what should be expected from the population treated with these agents? To date, 88 cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported to the FDA in patients taking sitagliptin (Januvia/Janumet). Of these, two cases have been hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. A revision of the package insert for sitagliptin has been made recently. An examination of available data should help shed light on whether the relation is likely causal or merely incidental.

### Drug-induced acute pancreatitis in adults: an update [^116gsAgW]. Pancreas (2019). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced acute pancreatitis (DIAP) is a rare entity that is often challenging for clinicians. The aim of our study was to provide updated DIAP classes considering the updated definition of acute pancreatitis (AP) and in light of new medications and new case reports. A MEDLINE search (1950–2018) of the English language literature was performed looking for all adult (≥ 17 years old) human case reports with medication/drug induced as the cause of AP. The included case reports were required to provide the name of the drug, and diagnosis of AP must have been strictly established based on the revised Atlanta Classification criteria. A total of 183 medications were found to be implicated in 577 DIAP cases. A total of 78 cases were excluded because of minimal details or lack of definite diagnosis of AP. Drug-induced AP is rare, and most drugs cause mild DIAP. Only 2 drugs are well described in the literature to explain causation rather than association (azathioprine and didanosine). Larger case-control studies and a formal standardized DIAP reporting system are essential to study the true potential of the DIAP-implicated drugs described in this review.

Long-term prescribing of phentermine — regulatory status and data gaps are described: "Although phentermine is FDA approved for weight loss, it is not approved for long-term use". Intermittent therapy "has been tried", but the text questions its logic for weight regulation. Utilization notes that "Phentermine is currently the most widely prescribed weight loss medication, and it is likely that much of this prescribing is off label", likely reflecting "the low cost of phentermine as compared to other weight loss medications". Critically, "There currently are no long-term data on safety or efficacy, although recent data on 269 patients treated long term with phentermine suggest that the addiction potential is low".

### Normal lipase drug-induced pancreatitis: a novel finding [^111PmbCA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) in the setting of a normal serum amylase has been previously reported in the literature. Serum lipase on the other hand has a negative predictive value approaching 100% and therefore is an excellent test to rule out AP in the emergency department. The occurrence of AP with a normal lipase is extremely rare and has never been reported in the setting of drug-induced pancreatitis. Thiazide diuretics have been implicated as a cause of pancreatic injury via a number of proposed mechanisms. However, all such cases have been in the setting of elevated serum amylase or lipase. We report the first case of radiographically proven hydrochlorothiazide-induced pancreatitis with a normal lipase.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112p6Q1N]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4.2 Limitations

However, these findings must be understood within the context of their limitations. First, as mentioned earlier, there was heterogeneity in the included studies in terms of GLP‐1 RA dosage/type, study design, age (range of 14.4 to 68 years), follow‐up time (range of 1 to 198 weeks), and background medication usage. Most importantly, this heterogeneity was seen in the definition of pancreatitis, which was not consistently reported and was determined through investigator or independent committees. Second, we included only RCTs, which provide high‐quality evidence but generally have a shorter duration, which may not be long enough to fully capture the risk of pancreatic cancer. In contrast, databases and pharmacovigilance, such as FAERS, suggest increased pancreatic cancer risk, but these data are subject to reporting bias, preventing the determination of causality. Thus, the discrepancy between FAERS and the findings of this study highlights the need for long‐term observational studies to further clarify this risk. Third, a key limitation of the meta‐analysis is the exclusion of studies with zero events in both arms from the pooled risk ratio calculations. This was done due to the risk ratio becoming undefined if no events occur in either arm; these studies would not provide data to the pooled estimate and were excluded. However, this limits the comprehensiveness of the pooled values and can overestimate the overall relative risk as the excluded trials likely could dilute the observed risk ratio. RevMan software prevented smaller decimal precision of very small effect sizes, as we originally intended to use risk difference calculation, which could better capture the low incidence across all included studies. Fourth, despite the high quality of RCTs, patients typically enrolled in RCTs are highly selected and may not be representative of the general T2DM or obese population, possibly limiting the external validation of these findings. Fifth, although we included trials with at least a 1‐week follow‐up to maximise the capture of acute events of pancreatitis, this would limit the detection of longer‐term outcomes such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Long‐term observational studies, real‐world evidence, or pharmacovigilance are needed to reliably test these outcomes. To test this, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with trials that had at least 12 weeks of follow‐up to assess for differences in pancreatitis. Sixth, patients with a history of pancreatitis or risk factors for pancreatitis are usually excluded during the screening phase. It is important to note that acute pancreatitis secondary to drugs is a diagnosis of exclusion. Thus, cases that are deemed idiopathic may very well be due to drug exposure as well. Additionally, a lack of classic symptoms or a lack of evolution of symptoms may lead to further underdiagnosis.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^116UFpX3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In populations using GLP‐1 RAs in higher doses specifically for weight loss, less is currently known about pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risks. A real‐world comparative cohort study found rates of pancreatitis of 4.6 (semaglutide) and 7.9 (liraglutide) per 1000 person‐years compared with a remarkably low rate of 1.0 in bupropion‐naltrexone initiators, yielding a high yet imprecise HR of 9.1 (95% CI 1.3–66.0). Another real‐world comparative cohort study of GLP‐1RA initiators for overweight found no difference between these semaglutide and tirzepatide (HR 1.04, 0.52–2.11). These real‐world pancreatitis rates of approximately 4 to 8 per 1000 person‐years with GLP‐1RA are several fold higher than in the major weight loss RCTs of liraglutide RCT. Of note, meta‐analyses of RCTs in either T2D or weight loss have found no increased risk of pancreatitis. However, in the RCTs, people were not eligible if they had a history of chronic or recent acute pancreatitis, and if they had any disorder (such as psychiatric illness or alcohol abuse) potentially compromising their trial compliance, which — together with more selective pancreatitis case adjudication in the trials — might explain the higher absolute pancreatitis risks in some real‐world studies. Although most clinical guidelines as well as EMA and FDA list pancreatitis as a possible side effect of GLP‐1RAs, most real‐world studies suggest no clear increased pancreatitis risk with GLP‐1RAs, thus corroborating findings from meta‐analyses of the RCTs.

### Amoxicillin / clavulanic acid-induced pancreatitis: case report [^114cBLw4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Identifying the cause of acute pancreatitis can be somewhat challenging especially when trying to identify a certain drug as the causative agent. Drugs are responsible for approximately 0.1–2% of acute pancreatitis incidents with most information about drug-induced pancreatitis being collected from case reports and case series which means that true incidence can be even higher. There is no one main mechanism behind drug-induced acute pancreatitis, but several potential mechanisms are currently based on theories. Of the proposed mechanisms include: pancreatic duct constriction with localized angioedema and arteriolar thrombosis, cytotoxic and metabolic effects, and hypersensitivity reactions. As well as drugs with side effects of hypertriglyceridemia and chronic hypercalcemia that are considered risk factors for acute pancreatitis. The diagnosis of drug-induced acute pancreatitis requires a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and ruling out all other etiologies. Etiologies that were ruled out in this case comprise all possible causes of pancreatitis: gallstones, biliary sludge and microlithiasis, alcohol, smoking, hypertriglyceridemia, scorpion venom, post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), hypercalcemia, steroids intake, malignancy, infection, trauma, vascular disease. Based on American College of Gastroenterology guidelines, consideration for genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis is based on expert opinion and warranted for pancreatic cancer patients with a personal history of at least 2 attacks of acute pancreatitis of unknown etiology, a family history of pancreatitis, or early-age onset chronic pancreatitis; therefore, the decision was made by the primary and gastroenterology teams on the case not to forgo with genetic testing to rule out hereditary pancreatitis. Immunoglobulin G4 level was 24 mg/dL (reference range: 1–100 mg/dL) which ruled out autoimmune pancreatitis. The evidence found to implicate a certain drug to the development of acute pancreatitis is often inadequate especially when the mechanism is unknown. Badalov N. et al. proposed a classification system of drug-induced acute pancreatitis. This system was based on the number of case reports found in the literature, the available rechallenge data, latency period and ability to exclude other causes of acute pancreatitis. After reviewing summary of drug induced acute pancreatitis based on drug class, we found that ampicillin and penicillin are considered class IV (single case report published, but neither a rechallenge nor a consistent latency period documented). If the pancreatitis resolves after discontinuation of the drug, suspicion for drug-induced pancreatitis increases. A firm diagnosis can be reasonably established with a rechallenge of the offending drug that results in the recurrence of pancreatitis symptoms. Rechallenge was not done in this case. Very few cases, less than 5 total cases, were documented in the literature regarding ampicillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid induced acute pancreatitis with true mechanism still being unidentified. Table 2 shows the comparison between our patient's case with published data in the literature.

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis And metabolism [^113eN4oS]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Weight change from baseline is the primary efficacy end‐point in placebo‐controlled trials for obesity drugs, and the guidance specifies that weight loss should be demonstrated over the course of at least one‐year duration. The goals of weight loss in obesity management are to prevent or slow the progression of obesity‐related health outcomes and improve quality of life. Weight loss of 5 per cent — evaluated as mean change from baseline and in a categorical analysis of the proportion of patients losing 5 per cent body weight — is generally considered clinically meaningful in patients with obesity as it has been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic biomarkers, such as blood pressure, lipids and fasting glucose. 30

There are currently 5 drugs that are FDA‐approved for chronic weight management in patients with obesity: orlistat (gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor), lorcaserin (serotonin 2C receptor agonist), phentermine/topiramate (combination of a sympathomimetic anorectic and an antiepileptic drug), bupropion/naltrexone (combination of an aminoketone antidepressant and an opioid antagonist) and liraglutide (GLP‐1 receptor agonist). One‐year placebo‐subtracted weight loss from baseline body weight as described in the prescribing information ranges from 3% to 9% and depends to a large extent on the patient population, background lifestyle intervention, treatment adherence, study discontinuation rate and the statistical methods used to address missing data. The labelled prescribing information for these drugs includes changes in weight‐related secondary end‐points, such as blood pressure and lipids, but currently does not include liver‐related efficacy end‐points, or claims related to the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality or improvement in quality of life. To date, no obesity drug has demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction in a dedicated trial.

5 Conclusion

Overall analysis suggests a potential increased risk of pancreatitis with GLP‐1 RA use, which weakens when stratifying by background medication use. No conclusive evidence links GLP‐1 RA use to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, but a slightly significant association was found when stratified with background medications. Clinicians should remain cautious in patients with a high baseline pancreatic risk, and GLP‐1 RA treatment should be discontinued if pancreatitis symptoms develop. Further research should address standardising GLP‐1 RA exposure, follow‐up protocols, patient characteristics, and background therapies to eliminate heterogeneity across trials.

### Popularity of surgical and pharmacological obesity treatment methods searched by google users: the retrospective analysis of google trends statistics in 2004–2022 [^117EVfrE]. Obesity Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The RSV trends of banned anti-obesity drugs associate with their withdrawal. Fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine (in combination with phentermine or not) were withdrawn from the USA in 1997 due to their association with heart valve disease, which explains the decrease in RSV over time. FDA approved lorcaserin, but in 2020 the drug was withdrawn due to the increased risk of pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers. The interest of Google users in lorcaserin reflected both the approval and withdrawal of the drug by the FDA. RSV of phenylpropanolamine decreased over time due to FDA public health advisory in 2000 and further withdrawal of the drug in many countries. The SCOUT study revealed in 2010 the high risk of sibutramine which led to the withdrawal of the drug from Europe and the USA. GT revealed a peak in sibutramine interest in 2010, followed by a decline, although it remains notably popular due to its availability in certain countries, ranking as the 7th most searched topic from 2004–2022. The interest in rimonabant sharply decreased after 2008, when it was banned in Europe due to serious psychiatric effects.

A prior study indicated that certain diets might be faddish, as seen with the Atkins and 5:2 diets. Our observations align, with similar spikes in search interest for dietary supplement ingredients like chitosan, ephedra, kalahari cactus, and garcinia cambogia. This interest may stem from initial promising research, aggressive marketing by manufacturers, and media hype, which wanes when the products fail to deliver expected results.

The peak of interest in "Orlistat" in June 2007 could be attributed to its approval by the FDA and EMA, and the introduction of the first over-the-counter orlistat called Alli®. The peak of the search on "Phentermine/Topiramate" corresponds with FDA approval of the combination of phentermine and topiramate. In July 2013, two top sprinters were tested positive for oxilofrine, which gained media attention. However, we could not identify events that surged the interest of Google users in the other topics.

### Is there a link between liraglutide and pancreatitis? A post hoc review of pooled and patient-level data from completed liraglutide type 2 diabetes clinical trials [^117G2kpS]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To report the incidence of pancreatitis in type 2 diabetes trials of liraglutide and details of all pancreatitis cases.

Research Design and Methods

Data from Novo Nordisk-sponsored trials with liraglutide (phase 2 and 3; NN2211 identifiers) completed by 19 April 2013 were pooled. All pancreatitis cases were reviewed.

Results

Total exposure to liraglutide and active comparators was 5,021 and 1,354 patient-years, respectively (n = 6,345 and 1,846, respectively). Eight cases of acute pancreatitis (AP) with liraglutide and one with any comparator (glimepiride) were found. The incidence of AP was 1.6 cases/1,000 patient-years exposure (PYE) for liraglutide vs. 0.7 cases/1,000 PYE for total active comparators. One of the eight AP cases reported with liraglutide did not meet diagnostic criteria for AP. In six of these eight cases, recognized risk factors for AP were present and/or the onset of AP occurred > 6 months after liraglutide initiation. All patients were receiving multiple medications. Four cases of chronic pancreatitis (CP) with liraglutide and none with comparators were found. One of these four cases fulfilled diagnostic criteria for CP; these criteria were not met or information was missing in the remaining three.

Conclusions

Based on the small number of cases observed, the incidences of reported AP and CP were numerically greater with liraglutide than with comparators. Not all cases fulfilled diagnostic criteria, and confounding variables were present in 75% of the AP cases with liraglutide therapy, precluding firm conclusions.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — adverse effects, contraindications, cost, and evidence rating for maintenance agents: Side effects vary among these treatment options, and the antipsychotics can cause metabolic side effects, extrapyramidal movement disorders, tardive dyskinesia, and prolactin elevation (though aripiprazole is usually an exception). Valproate might cause weight gain, tremor, hair loss, liver dysfunction, and pancreatitis, while carbamazepine might cause sedation, dizziness, unsteadiness, gastrointestinal complaints, and blood dyscrasias. Further, valproate and carbamazepine should not be used in individuals of child-bearing potential. Costs are usually low because all are generic products, except lurasidone. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to this recommendation; therefore, it is categorized as Reviewed, New-added, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. Patient values and preferences varied because of differential preferences, vulnerabilities for possible side effects, and mixed preferences for oral or LAI routes.

Table 1
Anti-obesity medications: approval, mechanism of action, adverse events, and contraindications.

Orlistat has mainly a peripheral effect; it inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipases, thus decreasing dietary fat absorption. Phentermine is a sympathomimetic that is less potent than other amphetamine on dopamine release, and therefore, is associated with a lower risk of substance abuse. It stimulates serotonin release, but only at very high doses. Animal data showed increased energy expenditure with phentermine, although inconsistently, and this has never been confirmed in humans. As a standalone therapy, it is only approved for short term treatment (< 12 weeks). Phentermine combined with topiramate is approved for long term treatment of obesity. Topiramate is a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, glutamate antagonist and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that has been shown to suppress appetite, through mechanisms that are still unclear. Animal studies have shown increased energy expenditureand improved insulin sensitivity, but this has not been yet confirmed in humans. Naltrexone (opioid receptor antagonist that inhibits the POMC pathway inhibitor) and Bupropion (antidepressant, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor that directly stimulate POMC cells) work synergistically to increase POMC peptide production, and therefore decrease food intake. In addition, the combination Naltrexone/Bupropion (NB) acts on the reward pathways, as demonstrated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies.NB increased activity in various cortical areas in response to food cues, implying increased self-control and awareness of internal signals of fullness. Finally, glucagon like peptide receptor (GLP1-R) agonists, Liraglutide and Semaglutide, act centrally by decreasing appetite, and peripherally, on the pancreas by increasing insulin secretion and on the gastro-intestinal tract leading to decreased intestinal motility and delayed gastric emptying.

### Pancreatitis: a potential complication of liraglutide? [^115gnNnQ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence surrounding a potential association between liraglutide and pancreatitis.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (1948-July 12, 2012) and EMBASE (1974-week 27, 2012) using the search terms pancreatitis, liraglutide, and glucagon-like peptide 1/adverse effects. Reference citations from identified publications were reviewed. The manufacturer was contacted and regulatory documents from the Food and Drug Administration website were reviewed for unpublished data related to cases of pancreatitis associated with liraglutide use.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified sources that were published in English were considered for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Eleven cases of pancreatitis have been reported in patients taking liraglutide. Seven were from the LEAD (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes) studies, 1 was reported in the extension of a clinical trial, and 1 was in an unpublished obesity trial. Two were published postmarketing case reports. Nine of the cases reported were diagnosed as acute pancreatitis, while 2 were classified as chronic pancreatitis. The mean age of the patients was 57.5 years and mean body mass index was 33.92 kg/m(2). Six of the 11 cases occurred in male patients. Nine of the patients were white and 1 was African American. In 7 of the cases, onset occurred at liraglutide doses at or above 1.8 mg daily. Common comorbidities included history of pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, and diabetes. One case was fatal.

Conclusions

Pancreatitis is a potential complication with liraglutide therapy. Liraglutide should be used cautiously in patients at risk of pancreatitis (eg, alcohol abuse, history of pancreatitis, cholelithiasis).

### Interpreting adverse signals in diabetes drug development programs [^112FmNFr]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cancer

Deciding the proportionate level of caution to ascribe to a potential danger signal is never straightforward. Take for example the evidence for a putative link between incretin therapies (GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors) and pancreatitis, pancreatic ductal metaplasia, and pancreatic cancer (,–). Reports of cases of acute pancreatitis in patients receiving incretin therapies generated awareness, which may have prompted further similar reports and an accumulation of cases in the pharmacovigilance databases. However, the diagnosis of pancreatitis was not always confirmed; severity was highly variable; and although the condition is known to be more common among diabetic patients than among the nondiabetic population, estimated incidence rates have varied widely from < 1 to ∼5 per 1,000 patient-years. Given a need to await additional retrospective interrogation of large databases, the labeling advice to discontinue incretins in patients where pancreatitis is suspected would seem proportionate.

It is relevant to note here that pharmacovigilance is an ongoing process to monitor side effects, but a reported event is not necessarily caused by the medicines to which the report relates and should not be interpreted as meaning that a medicine is unsafe to use. Spontaneous reporting of suspected side effects should not be used as a basis for estimating incidence rates because they provide a numerator without knowing the denominator. Reporting rates are variable for many reasons, events are not confirmed, and confounding factors may not be taken into account.

An appreciation that pancreatitis presents a risk for pancreatic cancer, coupled with an animal study suggesting that incretins might cause pancreatic duct cell proliferation, sparked interest in a potential link between incretins and pancreatic cancer. Additional studies in several animal species could not confirm the ductal proliferation, but the FDA database showed more cases of pancreatic cancer in patients who had received certain incretins compared with other classes of diabetes drugs. The problem of attempting numerical analyses from spontaneous adverse event reporting has already been noted, but could this be a signal? Pancreatic cancer is rare at < 0.1 per 1,000 patient-years. It is slow to develop to detection, and unlike other cancers, its occurrence tends to decrease with time after diagnosis of diabetes. So, numbers and time may preclude an early resolution from postmarketing trials. In general, clinical experience to date does not appear to support an association of incretins with pancreatic cancer, but the issue has emphasized that procedures for extrapolating preclinical signals to clinical situations and projecting possible clinical signals into future clinical events are still tenuous.

### Phentermine induced acute interstitial nephritis [^113QdvRD]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has a number of medication-related aetiologies. Antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are common causes; however, any medication has the potential to cause drug-induced AIN. We report the first case of phentermine-induced AIN. A Caucasian woman aged 43 years presented with a 5-week history of lethargy, left-sided lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She had been taking phentermine for weight loss for 9months and had recently ceased the medication. The patient underwent a renal biopsy that showed a predominantly lymphohistiocytic interstitial infiltrate with a moderate number of eosinophils consistent with AIN. Phentermine is increasingly used for weight loss in obese patients. This is the first case implicating phentermine as the causative agent for drug-induced AIN. While rare, phentermine-induced AIN is a possible adverse reaction of phentermine. Physicians and patients need to be aware of this risk.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with "anorectic" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet.

The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an "anorectic" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss.

The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111kpYva]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Phentermine for obesity — based on extensive clinical use, "it seems reasonable for clinicians to prescribe phentermine long term as long as the patient:" meets all of the following: 1) has no evidence of serious cardiovascular disease; 2) does not have serious psychiatric disease or a history of substance abuse; 3) has been informed about weight loss medications that are FDA approved for long-term use and told that these have been documented to be safe and effective whereas phentermine has not; 4) does not demonstrate a clinically significant increase in pulse or BP when taking phentermine; and 5) demonstrates a significant weight loss while using the medication. There currently is minimal evidence of any serious long-term side effects when phentermine is used alone for weight loss, and phentermine has been prescribed for more than 20 years. Medication should be started at 7.5 or 15 mg/d initially and only increased if the patient is not achieving clinically significant weight loss; these aspects of care and the off-label nature of prescribing should be documented at each visit. Patients should be followed at least monthly during dose escalation and then at least every 3 months when on a stable dose. Phentermine 15 mg alone is able to induce over 7% weight loss at 6 months.

### Incretin treatment and risk of pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised studies [^1137iE3L]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition that often leads to hospital admission and even death. Important risk factors for acute pancreatitis include gallstones, alcohol use, older age, black race, smoking, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Exposure to certain drugs is also associated with acute pancreatitis. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are two classes of incretin based treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evidence from randomised controlled trials has shown that GLP-1 agonists effectively lower glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) by about 1%, reduce body weight, and rarely cause hypoglycaemia when used as monotherapy; DDP-4 inhibitors have intermediate efficacy regarding glucose controlwith no impact on body weight and a low risk of hypoglycaemia. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommends the consideration of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP agonists as second line treatment options.

In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned of a strong temporal association between exenatide and pancreatitis on the basis of 30 case reports of acute pancreatitis. In 2009, the FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of revisions to the prescribing information for Januvia (sitagliptin) and Janumet (sitagliptin/metformin) after announcing the observation of 88 post-marketing cases of acute pancreatitis. In 2012, one consumer group in the United States called for the withdrawal of liraglutideand cautioned that liraglutide is associated with higher than expected rates of pancreatitis, thyroid cancer, and kidney failure based on the following statement from FDA reviewers: "in clinical trials patients taking liraglutide had a risk of pancreatitis that was 3.7 fold higher than the risk in patients taking other antidiabetes drugs". In 2013, the concerns regarding the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer continued to grow, resulting in international debate. The BMJ has published several commentaries discussing the potential risk of pancreatitis and implications of using incretin based drugs. The FDA also has announced ongoing efforts to assess the risk of pancreatic associated with incretins. Yet the definitive recommendations regarding the risk are not available.

Efficacy of Currently Approved Therapies for Obesity

Orlistat

Orlistat is a selective inhibitor of pancreatic lipase, which thereby moderates the intestinal digestion and absorption of fat, approved for use by both the FDA and EMA. It should be taken with meals and is available both by prescription and over the counter in lower doses in the UK. Orlistat is indicated for patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 28 kg/m² in association with other risk factors (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia). Whilst people with obesity using orlistat lose an extra 2.9–3.4 kg weight over 12 months, gastrointestinal side effects, reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and steatorrhea are commonplace. Indeed, a recent systematic review observed a mean weight loss of 3.1 kg associated with orlistat use. Additional metabolic benefits associated with orlistat use include reduced blood pressure (systolic, 1.15 mmHg; diastolic, 1.07 mmHg) and reduced circulating lipids (total cholesterol, 0.30 mmol/l; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 0.27 mmol/l; triglycerides, 0.09 mmol/l). One study found the cost of weight loss per kilogram associated with orlistat was US$546, with a cost of US$71,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in Europe.

Phentermine/Topiramate

Phentermine is a sympathomimetic that stimulates noradrenaline release suppressing appetite, whilst topiramate is an anticonvulsant that augments the weight loss associated with phentermine use though the mechanism of appetite suppression is unclear. It is an effective weight loss agent with studies observing 6.6–8.6 kg weight loss over 12 months. A more recent meta-analysis observed a mean weight loss of 9.8 kg associated with its use in randomised-controlled trials. However, side effects include insomnia, dizziness and paresthesia. Whilst approved by the FDA in 2012, as a result of safety concerns the EMA rejected the use of this therapy. Phentermine/topiramate use was found to cost US $48,340 per QALY, a cost of US $232/kg weight loss.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111LJyi9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 3
Number of pancreatic events in patients with background medications.

The studies reviewed in this systematic analysis focused on patients classified as overweight or obese, with inclusion criteria encompassing individuals with a BMI ranging from 25 to 45. Amylase and lipase levels were also measured in some of the studies, with many patients showing elevated levels of these enzymes at the latest follow‐up. However, in some cases, despite the elevated levels, the increases were insufficient to meet the researchers' diagnostic criteria for pancreatitis.

This variation within the included studies limits the generalizability and validity of the pooled estimates. The low I² heterogeneity is also likely due to the fixed‐effects model and the sparse number of events, rather than true homogeneity across the studies. Concomitant background medication usage may influence the observed risk of acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, either through confounding or diluting the risk attributable to GLP‐1 RAs. For pancreatic cancer, subgroup analysis with background medications showed an association with pancreatic cancer. However, it is important to note that only studies with events were included in the pooled risk ratio estimate, as the other RCTs had zero events in both arms. This may overestimate the risk as the double‐zero studies would likely have diluted the RR, indicating that the true risk is lower than expected. Nevertheless, these zero‐event studies highlight the overall rare incidence of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in both arms. All studies were retained in the forest plots for transparency but were not included in the meta‐analysis.

### Valproic acid [^111U1APr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of valproic acid PO:
- **Acute pancreatitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as valproic acid has been associated with an increased risk of hepatic failure. Obtain LFTs before treatment and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first 6 months. Use extreme caution in pediatric patients aged < 2 years, especially with congenital metabolic disorders, severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, organic brain disease, or receiving multiple anticonvulsants. Do not use in patients with mitochondrial disease caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and in children < 2 years of age with suspected mitochondrial disorder.
- **Neural tube defects**: the use of valproic acid during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, other structural abnormalities (craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations), neurodevelopmental disorders, and decreased IQ. Do not use valproic acid for epilepsy or bipolar disorder in pregnant patients or patients contemplating pregnancy unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control. Do not use valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis in pregnant patients and in female patients of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. Do not use valproic acid in females of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.

### Post-marketing reports of pancreatitis in eluxadoline-treated patients pre and post US label change [^115qSkE9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background:

Eluxadoline, a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), underwent a change to its US prescribing information on 21 April 2017, contraindicating it in patients without a gallbladder due to increased risk of pancreatitis. This study aimed to elucidate the potential role of eluxadoline's label change on the number of reported spontaneous adverse events (AEs) of pancreatitis.

Methods:

A pharmacovigilance database (Oracle Argus) was searched for eluxadoline use and spontaneously reported pancreatitis cases from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018. Pancreatitis cases were reported as a proportion of the total number of reported AE cases in the safety database. The FDA's adverse event reporting system (AERS) was also interrogated for cases of pancreatitis concomitantly reported with eluxadoline use.

Results:

In patients who received eluxadoline, 273 reported cases of pancreatitis were recorded (total AEs n = 2191; 12.5%). When known, 28.2% of patients reporting pancreatitis had intact gallbladders (49/174). Eluxadoline was withdrawn in 97.5% of cases, with 87.1% of patients improving or recovered at time of reporting. Importantly, the reporting proportion of pancreatitis cases decreased from 14.4% to 8.9% post label change. Findings were supported by the AERS results, which demonstrated a decrease in reporting proportion from 21.2% to 12.8%.

Conclusions:

While cautious interpretation is warranted, post-marketing data indicate that the contraindication of eluxadoline in patients without a gallbladder led to reduced reported cases of pancreatitis, with no additional reports of moderately severe or severe cases. Eluxadoline is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for IBS-D when used according to the label.

### Incretin treatment and risk of pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised studies [^111PnnyW]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Data collection

From eligible randomised controlled trials we collected information on study characteristics (study design, sample size, number of treatment groups, length and design (such as variable or fixed) of follow-up, funding source, registry number, whether trials were international and, if so, countries involved, number of study sites, and study phase); patient characteristics (sex, age, duration of type 2 diabetes, baseline HbA1c concentrations, body mass index (BMI), and fasting plasma glucose); interventions (drugs commonly used across all groups (baseline treatment), incretin treatment, control group, dose, intensity, and duration of treatment); pancreatitis events in each of the treatment groups; and number of patients included for analyses in each of the treatment groups (that is, considered as a safety set).

For extension randomised controlled trials, in which treatment assignments were switched (for example, patients in placebo group started receiving incretins), we documented only the outcome data before that point. For multiple reports of the same trial, we collated all data into a single study. If outcome data for pancreatitis were reported at multiple follow-up points, we used data from the longest follow-up.

For observational studies, we documented information as for randomised controlled trials, when applicable. Additionally, we collected information regarding study design (such as retrospective cohort study), sources of data (such as claims data), method of ascertaining type 2 diabetes status (such as ICD (international classification of diseases) code), exposures (such as incretins, and such exposure variables as age), method of adjustment for confounding (such as adjustment or matching, and variables used for these techniques), and follow-up. We also documented unadjusted and adjusted results, in addition to raw event data and exposure time.

### Toxic-metabolic risk factors in pediatric pancreatitis: recommendations for diagnosis, management, and future research [^117WdAZa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis in children can result from metabolic and toxic risk factors, but the evidence linking these factors is sparse. We review the evidence for association or causality of these risk factors in pancreatitis, discuss management strategies, and their rationale. We conducted a review of the pediatric pancreatitis literature with respect to the following risk factors: hyperlipidemia, hypercalcemia, chronic renal failure, smoking exposure, alcohol, and medications. Areas of additional research were identified. Hypertriglyceridemia of 1000 mg/dL or greater poses an absolute risk for pancreatitis; persistent elevations of calcium are predisposing. Further research is necessary to determine whether end-stage renal disease leads to increased pancreatitis in children similar to adults. It is unknown whether cigarette smoking exposure, which clearly increases risk in adults, also increases risk in children. The role of alcohol in pediatric pancreatitis, whether direct or modifying, needs to be elucidated. The evidence supporting most cases of medication-induced pancreatitis is poor. Drug structure, improper handling of drug by host, and bystander status may be implicated. Other pancreatitis risk factors must be sought in all cases. The quality of evidence supporting causative role of various toxic and metabolic factors in pediatric pancreatitis is variable. Careful phenotyping is essential, including search for other etiologic risk factors. Directed therapy includes correction/removal of any agent identified, and general supportive measures. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of these pancreatitis risk factors in children.

### Role of pancreatic lipase inhibition in obesity treatment: mechanisms and challenges towards current insights and future directions [^112swyue]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Current PL inhibitors and their efficacy

The rising global incidence of obesity is an urgent public health issue linked to numerous metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. The metabolism of dietary fats is key to the onset and advancement of obesity. Recent research efforts have concentrated on the development and assessment of inhibitors of pancreatic lipase as a strategy for addressing obesity, especially when linked to diets rich in fats. These inhibitors work by limiting the digestion and absorption of fats, leading to reduced calorie consumption and supporting weight reduction. Pancreatic lipase inhibitors, a category of medications aimed at obesity treatment, inhibit the pancreatic lipase enzyme. This enzyme's role is to break down dietary triglycerides in the intestines. By blocking this enzyme, triglycerides are not converted into free fatty acids that can be absorbed, resulting in their excretion without digestion. This process helps reduce the number of calories absorbed from fat, aiding in weight loss. Orlistat, one of the most well-known PL inhibitors, offers a case study on the effectiveness, challenges, and side effects associated with this therapeutic approach. In this section, the article reviews the current landscape of pancreas lipase inhibitors, including synthetic drugs and natural compounds, their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and safety profiles. Several FDA-approval drugs will be discussed, including liraglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide, orlistat, and combinations like phentermine/topiramate and bupropion/naltrexone, noting their effectiveness in obesity management (Table 1).

2.3 Study Quality and Risk of Bias

The risk of bias (RoB) and study quality was assessed utilising the Cochrane RoB tool, given that all included studies were RCTs. Two independent authors assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality, and any disagreements were resolved via rigorous re‐review until consensus was achieved. The Cochrane tool contains seven domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcomes, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. Each domain is evaluated as high, low, or unclear RoB. Two independent authors analysed each article, and any discrepancies were resolved via rigorous re‐review or by consulting a third reviewer until agreement was reached.

2.4 Data Extraction and Analysis

The study variables extracted and analysed included title, author, study year, number of patients, GLP‐1 RA agent and dosages, mean age, mean follow‐up time, pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer rates, related lab values (amylase/lipase), and those taking background anti‐diabetic drugs. Notably, the diagnostic criteria were not consistently reported across the studies and were reported as investigator or an independent committee–determined AE. The data was compiled using Google Sheets (Google Drive; Google, Mountain View, CA). The mean, median, percentages, ranges, and standard deviations were reported if available and applicable.

Meta‐analysis was conducted using the fixed effects model to evaluate the risk ratio (RR) of developing acute pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Chronic pancreatitis was not specified for pooling, and pancreatic cancer was an exploratory outcome, given that trial durations were not expected to be long enough to assess the risks for these two conditions. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with RCTs that had at least 24 weeks of follow‐up to test for differences in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer findings. Heterogeneity was calculated with the I ‐squared statistic, with p ‐values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Forest plots were generated using Cochrane's Review Manager application (RevMan, version 5.4; The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Studies with double‐zero events (treatment arms that had zero events) were included in the forest plot for transparency.

### Phentermine hydrochloride (Adipex-P) [^112hcKg3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

No clinical studies have been conducted with ADIPEX-P®.

In relatively short-term clinical trials, adult obese subjects instructed in dietary management and treated with "anorectic" drugs lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet.

The magnitude of increased weight loss of drug-treated patients over placebo-treated patients is only a fraction of a pound a week. The rate of weight loss is greatest in the first weeks of therapy for both drug and placebo subjects and tends to decrease in succeeding weeks. The possible origins of the increased weight loss due to the various drug effects are not established. The amount of weight loss associated with the use of an "anorectic" drug varies from trial to trial, and the increased weight loss appears to be related in part to variables other than the drugs prescribed, such as the physician-investigator, the population treated and the diet prescribed. Studies do not permit conclusions as to the relative importance of the drug and non-drug factors on weight loss.

The natural history of obesity is measured over several years, whereas the studies cited are restricted to a few weeks' duration; thus, the total impact of drug-induced weight loss over that of diet alone must be considered clinically limited.

### Evaluating the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer among GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115fKiGK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Previous studies utilised postmarketing reports and observational studies, which carry inherent limitations that decrease the strengths of those studies. Notably, among the database studies, it was found that there was remarkable notoriety bias for the AEs reported. It is important to note that obesity increases the rates of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer risk factors (e.g. gallstones, hypertriglyceridemia, biliary disease). Furthermore, since T2DM is a risk factor for pancreatic disease, it can be difficult to differentiate whether pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer is attributable to the underlying condition or the GLP‐1 RA. Thus, patient and treatment selection provide another source of imbalance and confounding across these studies. Other systematic reviews and meta‐analyses found no significant findings for pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Cao et al. collected data from seven cardiovascular outcome trials with 56,004 patients with T2DM and a median follow‐up ranging from 1.3 to 5.4 years, with no significant difference compared to placebo for acute pancreatitis (OR: 1.05, 0.78–1.40, p = 0.76) or pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.12, 0.77–1.63, p = 0.56). Similarly, a 2023 meta‐analysis with 43 trials found that pancreatitis (OR: 1.24, 0.94–1.64, p = 0.13) and pancreatic cancer (OR: 1.28, 0.87–1.89, p = 0.20) displayed no clear association for GLP‐1 RA usage. Most recently, a 2024 population‐based cohort study following 543,595 patients at over 7 years of follow‐up supported no increased risk for pancreatic cancer (OR: 0.50, 0.15–1.71). However, an evaluation of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2020 found a significantly increased (proportional reporting ratio: 9.86) pancreatic cancer cases associated with GLP‐1 RAs compared to the other glucose‐lowering agents analysed in the study. Notably, the authors stated that the combination of GLP‐1 RAs with DPP‐4 inhibitors may have led to an increased reporting of several tumours, including pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, a 2024 study presented at the Endocrine Society's annual meeting evaluating 638,501 patients with a history of acute pancreatitis suggested that GLP‐1 RAs reduce the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. However, these findings have not been published, and further research is required to detail these preliminary results. Regardless, this possibility will offer more options for patients that will help improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Role of pancreatic lipase inhibition in obesity treatment: mechanisms and challenges towards current insights and future directions [^11325yE9]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

The FDA has approved six drugs for the long-term treatment of obesity, Contrave (bupropion and naltrexone), Saxenda (liraglutide), Xenical and Alli (orlistat), Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate), Wegovy (semaglutide), and Imcivree (setmelanotide). These medications mainly work by reducing hunger or enhancing satiety, with the exception of orlistat, which blocks the body's fat absorption. Contrave, blending addiction and depression therapies, may elevate the risk of suicide and blood pressure, and commonly causes nausea and headaches. Saxenda, an injectable for diabetes management, frequently leads to nausea and vomiting. Qsymia combines a weight-loss stimulant with an epilepsy drug, carrying risks of abuse, heightened heart rate, and possible birth defects. Administered weekly, semaglutide can cause gastrointestinal issues and fatigue. Approved for those over six with specific genetic conditions, Imcivree can decrease hunger and increase resting calorie expenditure, with possible side effects including skin issues, nausea, and changes in mood. Additionally, aminorex and sibutramine have been linked to cardiovascular toxicity, pulmonary hypertension, and a rise in non-fatal cardiovascular incidents. These medications necessitate careful selection and monitoring by healthcare providers due to the potential for side effects and specific application criteria, such as genetic testing for eligibility.

Moreover, this research investigates how astaxanthin, along with other xanthophylls like zeaxanthin and violaxanthin derived from plant and marine foods, can block pancreatic lipase, an essential enzyme in fat digestion. Initial in-silico studies showed these xanthophylls had a higher potential for inhibiting the enzyme compared to orlistat, a drug known for its lipid-lowering effects. However, when these findings were tested under conditions that simulate the natural process of lipid digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, using a method known as the potential of Hydrogen (pH)-stat test, the expected inhibitory effects were not observed. Particularly, sea buckthorn oil, which is rich in native xanthophylls, actually showed an increase in lipolysis by about 22% compared to oils with lower xanthophyll content. This suggests that while xanthophylls can inhibit pancreatic lipase in theoretical models, their amphiphilic nature might enhance the formation of emulsions during actual digestion, thereby increasing the breakdown and absorption of fats rather than inhibiting it.

VA/DoD chronic multisymptom illness guideline — evidence and safety for eluxadoline: In a network meta-analysis that included data from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,967 patients who received eluxadoline and 1,155 patients who received placebo at 12 weeks, eluxadoline was superior to placebo in bowel-related outcomes, and the benefit over placebo appears modest. At 12 weeks, failure to achieve the FDA-recommended endpoint was reduced with eluxadoline 100 mg BID (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.91) and 75 mg BID (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.94), and failure to achieve a global IBS symptom response was reduced with 100 mg BID (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.90) and 75 mg BID (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.98). In safety analyses across four RCTs at 12 weeks, there was no difference in overall adverse events versus placebo, but there was a higher risk of trial dropout due to adverse events such as nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain, with similar dropout risk for 75 mg BID and 100 mg BID. Eluxadoline is contraindicated in patients without a gallbladder, has additional contraindications including history of pancreatitis, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, severe liver disease, chronic or severe constipation, alcohol abuse, or suspected intestinal obstruction, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has classified eluxadoline as a schedule IV controlled substance with a low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence; following FDA approval, reports of pancreatitis were reported following use of this agent.

### GLP-1-based therapy for diabetes: what you do not know can hurt you [^114f1P2c]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Pancreatitis first emerged as a potential side effect of therapy with exenatide, initially reported as case reports and subsequently by numerous reports made through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse reporting mechanism. The Amylin Corporation's response to this putative link has been to suggest that it was a consequence of guilt by association rather than a drug effect since pancreatitis is more common in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes. The Amylin Corporation also suggested that since no mechanism is known to link GLP-1 mimetic therapy to pancreatitis, the association is unlikely causal. Pancreatitis was also seen in clinical studies of the GLP-1 agonist liraglutide. More recently, the FDA has reported more than 80 documented cases of pancreatitis in patients treated with sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor. It is also Merck's position that the reported pancreatitis with sitagliptin therapy is due to the increased risk of pancreatitis in type 2 diabetes rather than a consequence of drug therapy, mimicking the Amylin Corporation position.

In post-marketing studies sponsored by the marketing companies, no increased signal for acute pancreatitis has been identified. However, the duration of treatment in those studies is typically short, the quality of the patient follow-up is questionable, and evidence that prescriptions were actually taken is absent. Nonetheless, on the basis of the available clinical information, we agree with the conclusions of Drucker et al. that the data required to link GLP-1 therapy and acute pancreatitis is currently incomplete. However, in the context of a new class of medical therapy, the proverb "What you do not know cannot hurt you" clearly does not apply. We feel that enough preliminary evidence has accumulated to suggest that there is a plausible risk that long-term recipients of GLP-1–based therapy may develop asymptomatic chronic pancreatitis (Fig. 1), and worse, subsequently a minority of individuals treated by this class of drugs may develop pancreatic cancer.

### Exploring connections between weight-loss medications and thyroid cancer: a look at the FDA adverse event reporting system database [^111htVGi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

There has been a noticeable surge in the adoption of weight loss medications in a proactive approach to obesity management and its associated health risks. Among the pharmaceutical options that have garnered significant attention are Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor that reduces fat absorption in the gastrointestinal tract; Naltrexone/Bupropion, a combination therapy targeting both the opioid and dopamine/norepinephrine pathways to suppress appetite and increase metabolism; Liraglutide and Semaglutide (Ozempic), glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists originally used in diabetes management but repurposed for weight loss due to their appetite‐suppressing effects; and Phentermine/Topiramate, a combination of a sympathomimetic amine and an antiepileptic drug that reduces appetite and increases satiety.

Over the past few years, GLP‐1 receptor agonists have gained global popularity, namely Ozempic (Semaglutide) and Mounjaro (Tirzepatide). With the former emerging as one of the most prescribed medications, with over 9 million prescriptions recorded in the final quarter of 2022.

### Current and emerging medications for overweight or obesity in people with comorbidities [^116au4Kp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Orlistat

Orlistat (brand name Xenical®) is a reversible gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor that reduces fat absorption by ∼30% at the recommended therapeutic dose of 120 mg three times daily 37. In the prospective XENDOS clinical trial, orlistat (120 mg three times daily) produced significantly greater weight loss compared with placebo after 4 years (5.2% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001) 37, 49. Orlistat therapy was accompanied by an ∼50% risk reduction in progression to T2D in those with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, although it did not significantly decrease the rate of progression to impaired glucose tolerance or T2D in those with normal glucose tolerance at baseline 49. Improvements in blood pressure, waist circumference, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were also greater with orlistat than with placebo 49. Even at the over‐the‐counter dose of 60 mg three times daily (brand name Alli®), improvements in body composition, lipid profiles and blood pressure may be observed 50. Orlistat has well‐known gastrointestinal adverse events, including faecal leakage 37. It is also associated with a decrease in the absorption of fat‐soluble vitamins, which can be addressed by taking a daily multivitamin containing vitamins A, D, E, K and beta‐carotene 32, 37, 49. Orlistat is contraindicated in pregnancy (category X) 37.

Phentermine/Topiramate Extended Release

The combination of phentermine and topiramate ER (topiramate is an antiepileptic drug used for the treatment of seizures and migraines) received FDA approval for weight management in 2012 (for people with a BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 kg/m² and with weight‐related comorbidities), as an adjunct to diet and exercise (brand name Qsymia®) 38. In a randomized controlled trial of topiramate monotherapy (64–384 mg daily) for weight loss in obesity, adverse events related to the central or peripheral nervous system were observed, including paresthaesia, somnolence and difficulty with memory, concentration and attention 51. Most events were dose‐related 51, and topiramate monotherapy has not been pursued further for weight management.

### Risk of pancreatitis following treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with eluxadoline [^112iaCAX]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The Food and Drug Administration approved eluxadoline for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome despite cases of pancreatitis in early stage trials. We investigated the frequency of pancreatitis attributed to eluxadoline in postmarketing surveillance.

Methods

We extracted reports on eluxadoline submitted to the Federal Adverse Event Reporting System from January through September 2016. We collected data on patient age and sex, event date, reporting entity (consumer, physician, pharmacist, legal worker, or other), medications, dosages, presumed role in the event (coinciding, primary, or secondary suspect), treatment indication, and outcome (death, life threatening, hospitalization, disability, or other). We compared data for eluxadoline with data from antidiarrheals, oxycodone, and rifaximin using the κ 2 test, Kruskal-Wallis rank test, and analysis of variance; findings with P < .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Pancreatitis accounted for 16.4% of the 597 reports of adverse events linked to eluxadoline; 53 cases required hospitalization. Pancreatitis was listed as treatment complication of other agents in significantly lower proportions of cases (loperamide, 0.3%; diphenoxylate, 0.4%; oxycodone, 0.2%; rifaximin, 0.5%), with 75% of these submissions not considering the agent as causal.

Conclusions

In an analysis of reports on eluxadoline submitted to the Federal Adverse Event Reporting System, we confirmed a previously reported risk of pancreatitis associated with eluxadoline. The need for hospitalization in at least half of these instances and a recent report of 2 fatalities should prompt reassessments of the agent's risk-benefit ratio.

### Eluxadoline-induced pancreatitis occurring in an adult man without a prior cholecystectomy [^1115TAkR]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Eluxadoline is a novel medication that was approved in the USA in 2015 for the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Due to its unique mechanism of action as both an opioid agonist and antagonist, it has been placed as a schedule IV controlled substance. Since its approval, there have been several cases of eluxadoline-induced pancreatitis reported in the literature. The majority of patients who presented with eluxadoline-induced pancreatitis were reported to have had a prior cholecystectomy. Due to this, the Food and Drug Administration released a warning in 2017 that eluxadoline should no longer be used in patients who do not have a gall bladder. We present a rare case of an adult man without prior cholecystectomy who presented with severe mid-epigastric pain and was found to have eluxadoline-induced pancreatitis.

### Smoke or fire? Acute pancreatitis and the liraglutide trials [^114rkQMH]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, substantial clinical data have been presented showing that incretin-based therapies are effective glucose-lowering agents. Specifically, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists demonstrate an efficacy comparable to insulin treatment with minimal hypoglycemia and have favorable effects on body weight. Thus, many of the unmet clinical needs noted from prior therapies are addressed by these agents. However, even after many years of use, many continue to raise concerns about the long-term safety of these agents and, in particular, the concern with pancreatitis. This clearly remains a complicated topic. Thus, in this issue of Diabetes Care, we continue to update our readers on this very important issue by presenting two studies evaluating incretin-based medications and risk of pancreatitis. Both have undergone significant revisions based on peer review that provided significant clarification of the data. We applaud both author groups for being extremely responsive in providing the additional data and revisions requested by the editorial team. As such, because of the critical peer review, we feel both articles achieve the high level we require for Diabetes Care and are pleased to now present them to our readers. In keeping with our aim to comprehensively evaluate this topic, we asked for additional commentaries to be prepared. In the narrative outlined below, Prof. Edwin A.M. Gale provides a commentary on the report that focuses on clinical trials of liraglutide in the treatment of diabetes. In the narrative that follows Prof. Gale's contribution, Dr. Laurent Azoulay provides a commentary about the remaining uncertainty in this area and also discusses the results from a nationwide population-based case-control study. From the journal's perspective, both of the articles on pancreatitis and incretin-based therapies reported in this issue have been well vetted, and we feel both of the commentaries are insightful.

### Pancreatitis incidence in the exenatide BID, exenatide QW, and exenatide QW suspension development programs: pooled analysis of 35 clinical trials [^111wkygg]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incretin-based therapies, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Exenatide, the first approved GLP-1RA, effectively improves glycemic control through enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon release, delayed gastric emptying, and weight loss induced by reduced food intake. Since 2007, a number of postmarketing cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported with GLP-1RA treatment (including exenatide, liraglutide, and others) as well as with DPP-4 inhibitors, prompting the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue safety warnings about a possible temporal relationship between pancreatitis and agents in these classes. Subsequent to these reports, all currently marketed GLP1-RA and DPP-4 inhibitors have label warnings regarding pancreatitis.

In 2013, the FDA and the European Medicines Agency independently conducted comprehensive evaluations of preclinical and clinical data submitted in support of marketing applications of incretin-based drugs and collected additional postmarketing safety data. Both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency concluded that the current data do not suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis events with incretin-based therapies but warned that pancreatitis would continue to be considered a risk associated with these therapies until additional definitive clinical and real-world data become available.

Since that time, multiple studies have been conducted to investigate the potential relationship between incretin-based therapies — GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors — and pancreatitis. Importantly, several long-term randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes with GLP-1RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors were recently completed. Most of these trials, including results of EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01144338), adjudicated pancreatic events to enhance understanding of the risk of pancreatitis associated with incretin-based therapies.

### Incretin treatment and risk of pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised studies [^112bJ8tp]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the risk of pancreatitis associated with the use of incretin-based treatments in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Eligibility criteria Randomised and non-randomised controlled clinical trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, and case-control studies of treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with placebo, lifestyle modification, or active anti-diabetic drugs.

Data collection and analysis Pairs of trained reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. A modified Cochrane tool for randomised controlled trials and a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies were used to assess bias. We pooled data from randomised controlled trials using Peto odds ratios, and conducted four prespecified subgroup analyses and a post hoc subgroup analysis. Because of variation in outcome measures and forms of data, we describe the results of observational studies without a pooled analysis.

Results 60 studies (n = 353 639), consisting of 55 randomised controlled trials (n = 33 350) and five observational studies (three retrospective cohort studies, and two case-control studies; n = 320 289) were included. Pooled estimates of 55 randomised controlled trials (at low or moderate risk of bias involving 37 pancreatitis events, raw event rate 0.11%) did not suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis with incretins versus control (odds ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 2.17). Estimates by type of incretin suggested similar results (1.05 (0.37 to 2.94) for GLP-1 agonists v control; 1.06 (0.46 to 2.45) for DPP-4 inhibitors v control). Analyses according to the type of control, mode, duration of treatment, and individual incretin agents suggested no differential effect by subgroups, and sensitivity analyses by alternative statistical modelling and effect measures did not show important differences in effect estimates. Three retrospective cohort studies (moderate to high risk of bias, involving 1466 pancreatitis events, raw event rate 0.47%) also did not suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis associated with either exenatide (adjusted odds ratios 0.93 (0.63 to 1.36) in one study and 0.9 (0.6 to 1.5) in another) or sitagliptin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.0, 0.7 to 1.3); a case-control study at moderate risk of bias (1003 cases, 4012 controls) also suggested no significant association (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.69 to 1.38). Another case-control study (1269 cases, 1269 controls) at moderate risk of bias, however, suggested that the use of either exenatide or sitagliptin was associated with significantly increased odds of acute pancreatitis (use within two years v no use, adjusted odds ratio 2.07, 1.36 to 3.13).

Conclusions The available evidence suggests that the incidence of pancreatitis among patients using incretins is low and that the drugs do not increase the risk of pancreatitis. Current evidence, however, is not definitive, and more carefully designed and conducted observational studies are warranted to definitively establish the extent, if any, of increased risk.

### Post-marketing reports of pancreatitis in eluxadoline-treated patients pre and post US label change [^115SrPn9]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Eluxadoline, a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D), underwent a change to its US prescribing information on 21 April 2017, contraindicating it in patients without a gallbladder due to increased risk of pancreatitis. This study aimed to elucidate the potential role of eluxadoline's label change on the number of reported spontaneous adverse events (AEs) of pancreatitis.

Methods

A pharmacovigilance database (Oracle Argus) was searched for eluxadoline use and spontaneously reported pancreatitis cases from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018. Pancreatitis cases were reported as a proportion of the total number of reported AE cases in the safety database. The FDA's adverse event reporting system (AERS) was also interrogated for cases of pancreatitis concomitantly reported with eluxadoline use.

Results

In patients who received eluxadoline, 273 reported cases of pancreatitis were recorded (total AEs n = 2191; 12.5%). When known, 28.2% of patients reporting pancreatitis had intact gallbladders (49/174). Eluxadoline was withdrawn in 97.5% of cases, with 87.1% of patients improving or recovered at time of reporting. Importantly, the reporting proportion of pancreatitis cases decreased from 14.4% to 8.9% post label change. Findings were supported by the AERS results, which demonstrated a decrease in reporting proportion from 21.2% to 12.8%.

Conclusions

While cautious interpretation is warranted, post-marketing data indicate that the contraindication of eluxadoline in patients without a gallbladder led to reduced reported cases of pancreatitis, with no additional reports of moderately severe or severe cases. Eluxadoline is a safe and well-tolerated treatment option for IBS-D when used according to the label.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of adults with obesity / adiposity-based chronic disease-2025 update [^116BuNCx]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology obesity consensus — mitigating side effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs): adverse effects are "gastrointestinal in nature, occurring most commonly during dose escalation". For those naïve to therapy, "starting with the lowest dose is essential to prevent clinically significant side effects, and dose slow up-titration is vital in mitigating potential side effects if they occur", and "individuals benefit from monitoring which foods may exacerbate side effects (eg, fatty foods), not eating past the point of fullness, and eating smaller amounts at a given time but more frequently if needed". Patients "should be counseled that if they discontinue or pause treatment for a length of time, they may need to restart at a low dose and titrate up", GLP-1 RAs "also cause a modest increase in heart rate", and those with vomiting or diarrhea should be monitored "for dehydration and renal impairment". Therapy "is also associated with elevations in lipase and amylase in the absence of pancreatitis", and "The FDA still recommends close monitoring for mood changes, emerging or worsening depression, or suicidal behavior during treatment with GLP-1 RA".

### Incretin treatment and risk of pancreatitis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised studies [^117FZVBQ]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the risk of pancreatitis associated with the use of incretin-based treatments in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomised and non-randomised controlled clinical trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, and case-control studies of treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with placebo, lifestyle modification, or active anti-diabetic drugs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of trained reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. A modified Cochrane tool for randomised controlled trials and a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies were used to assess bias. We pooled data from randomised controlled trials using Peto odds ratios, and conducted four prespecified subgroup analyses and a post hoc subgroup analysis. Because of variation in outcome measures and forms of data, we describe the results of observational studies without a pooled analysis.

Results

60 studies (n = 353,639), consisting of 55 randomised controlled trials (n = 33,350) and five observational studies (three retrospective cohort studies, and two case-control studies; n = 320,289) were included. Pooled estimates of 55 randomised controlled trials (at low or moderate risk of bias involving 37 pancreatitis events, raw event rate 0.11%) did not suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis with incretins versus control (odds ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 2.17). Estimates by type of incretin suggested similar results (1.05 (0.37 to 2.94) for GLP-1 agonists v control; 1.06 (0.46 to 2.45) for DPP-4 inhibitors v control). Analyses according to the type of control, mode, duration of treatment, and individual incretin agents suggested no differential effect by subgroups, and sensitivity analyses by alternative statistical modelling and effect measures did not show important differences in effect estimates. Three retrospective cohort studies (moderate to high risk of bias, involving 1466 pancreatitis events, raw event rate 0.47%) also did not suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis associated with either exenatide (adjusted odds ratios 0.93 (0.63 to 1.36) in one study and 0.9 (0.6 to 1.5) in another) or sitagliptin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.0, 0.7 to 1.3); a case-control study at moderate risk of bias (1003 cases, 4012 controls) also suggested no significant association (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.69 to 1.38). Another case-control study (1269 cases, 1269 controls) at moderate risk of bias, however, suggested that the use of either exenatide or sitagliptin was associated with significantly increased odds of acute pancreatitis (use within two years v no use, adjusted odds ratio 2.07, 1.36 to 3.13).

### Incretin-based drugs and adverse pancreatic events: almost a decade later and uncertainty remains [^112tcyXw]. Diabetes Care (2015). Low credibility.

Over the past few years, substantial clinical data have been presented showing that incretin-based therapies are effective glucose-lowering agents. Specifically, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists demonstrate an efficacy comparable to insulin treatment with minimal hypoglycemia and have favorable effects on body weight. Thus, many of the unmet clinical needs noted from prior therapies are addressed by these agents. However, even after many years of use, many continue to raise concerns about the long-term safety of these agents and, in particular, the concern with pancreatitis. This clearly remains a complicated topic. Thus, in this issue of Diabetes Care, we continue to update our readers on this very important issue by presenting two studies evaluating incretin-based medications and risk of pancreatitis. Both have undergone significant revisions based on peer review that provided significant clarification of the data. We applaud both author groups for being extremely responsive in providing the additional data and revisions requested by the editorial team. As such, because of the critical peer review, we feel both articles achieve the high level we require for Diabetes Care and are pleased to now present them to our readers. In keeping with our aim to comprehensively evaluate this topic, we asked for additional commentaries to be prepared. In the narrative outlined below, Dr. Laurent Azoulay provides a commentary about the remaining uncertainty in this area and also discusses the results from a nationwide population-based case-control study. In the narrative preceding Dr. Azoulay's contribution, Prof. Edwin A.M. Gale provides a commentary on the report that focuses on clinical trials of liraglutide in the treatment of diabetes. From the journal's perspective, both of the articles on pancreatitis and incretin-based therapies reported in this issue have been well vetted, and we feel both of the commentaries are insightful.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^116pTzJz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors

Inform patients that semaglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents and that the human relevance of this finding has not been determined. Counsel patients to report symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a lump in the neck, hoarseness, dysphagia, or dyspnea) to their physician [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Acute Pancreatitis

Inform patients of the potential risk for acute pancreatitis and its symptoms: severe abdominal pain that sometimes radiates to the back, and which may or may not be accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Instruct patients to discontinue WEGOVY promptly and contact their physician if pancreatitis is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Acute Gallbladder Disease

Inform patients of the risk of acute gallbladder disease. Advise patients that substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of gallbladder disease, but that gallbladder disease may also occur in the absence of substantial or rapid weight loss. Instruct patients to contact their healthcare provider for appropriate clinical follow-up if gallbladder disease is suspected [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Conservative treatment of chronic pancreatitis [^114sj4rF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pancreatitis has been difficult to treat because the origin, pathophysiologic mechanisms and causes of unrelenting pain are so poorly understood. Furthermore, the pharmacologic agents often employed in other diseases with pain appear to be ineffective in many cases. The conservative management of chronic pancreatitis aims at (1) limiting progression and complications of the disease; (2) replacing lost exocrine and endocrine function; and (3) pain control. Thus, life style changes such as cessation of alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking, trials of pancreatic enzymes, treatment of duct obstruction and pseudocysts, and surgical therapies are currently employed. The good news is that the understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is now advancing rapidly, and hopefully patient-specific and highly effective therapies will become available in the near future.
