## Question

A 48-year-old patient presents with a reducible, nontender umbilical bulge. Abdominal exam and imaging show no signs of obstruction or strangulation. The diagnosis is an uncomplicated umbilical hernia. What ICD-10-CM code should be used for billing?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10-CM diagnosis code should be used for a 48-year-old with a reducible, nontender umbilical hernia without obstruction or strangulation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10 category for umbilical hernia. Then, I should verify whether the clinical descriptors "reducible" and "without obstruction or gangrene" map to a specific subcategory. Next, I will check for any exclusions or alternative codes that might apply if the hernia were incarcerated or strangulated. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and ensure it aligns with authoritative coding sources and clinical documentation guidance.

> Let me first confirm the umbrella category. Umbilical hernia in ICD-10-CM is coded under K42, which covers umbilical hernia and its subtypes, so I should anchor on K42 and then drill down to the appropriate subcategory based on clinical status [^e5cc1852].

> Wait, let me verify the subcategory that matches "reducible" and "without obstruction or gangrene". The subcategory K42.9 specifically denotes umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene, which fits a reducible, nontender umbilical hernia with no evidence of incarceration or strangulation. I initially wondered if K42.0 might be more specific, but hold on, I should verify — K42.0 refers to umbilical hernia with obstruction, which is not the scenario here, so K42.9 is correct for uncomplicated disease [^af28851a].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing an alternative code. K46.9 is "unspecified abdominal hernia without obstruction or gangrene", but that is too nonspecific when the anatomic site is known to be umbilical; using K42.9 is more precise and preferred when the umbilical location is documented, so I should not default to K46.9 in this case [^4ecdb736].

> Let me consider documentation requirements briefly. Accurate coding relies on the record stating the hernia type and status; contemporary surgical coding guidance emphasizes capturing hernia size, reducibility, and whether incarceration or strangulation is present, so I should confirm the chart notes reflect "umbilical", "reducible", and "no obstruction or gangrene" to support K42.9 rather than a more severe subcategory or an unspecified code [^6669b3a5].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for an uncomplicated, reducible umbilical hernia without obstruction or strangulation is K42.9 [^af28851a].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a reducible, nontender umbilical hernia without obstruction or strangulation is **K42.9** (umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene). This code applies to uncomplicated umbilical hernias in adults and should be used when there is no evidence of incarceration, obstruction, or gangrene. If the hernia becomes incarcerated, obstructed, or gangrenous, use K42.0, K42.1, or K42.2 as appropriate.

---

## ICD-10-CM code for uncomplicated umbilical hernia

The specific ICD-10-CM code for an uncomplicated umbilical hernia is **K42.9**, defined as "umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene" [^af28851a]. This code is used for umbilical hernias that are reducible, nontender, and without signs of obstruction or strangulation.

---

## Clinical documentation requirements

Accurate coding relies on thorough clinical documentation. For an uncomplicated umbilical hernia, the following elements should be clearly recorded:

- **Location**: Umbilical.
- **Reducibility**: Reducible or irreducible.
- **Presence of obstruction**: None.
- **Presence of gangrene**: None.
- **Tenderness**: Nontender.

---

## Differentiation from complicated umbilical hernias

ICD-10-CM provides specific codes for complicated umbilical hernias, including:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| K42.0 | Umbilical hernia with obstruction, without gangrene |
| K42.1 | Umbilical hernia with gangrene |
| K42.2 | Umbilical hernia without obstruction or gangrene |

---

In this case, because the hernia is reducible, nontender, and without obstruction or gangrene, **K42.9** is the appropriate code.

---

## Clinical implications of accurate coding

Accurate ICD-10-CM coding has important clinical and administrative implications:

- **Treatment planning**: Ensures appropriate management strategies are implemented.
- **Reimbursement**: Facilitates accurate billing and reimbursement processes.
- **Epidemiological data**: Contributes to reliable healthcare statistics and research.

---

## Conclusion

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a reducible, nontender umbilical hernia without obstruction or strangulation is **K42.9**. Accurate documentation and coding are essential for optimal patient care, appropriate reimbursement, and reliable healthcare data.

### Age-dependent costs and complications in pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^3f09e1b0]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To characterize regional variation in the age of patients undergoing umbilical hernia repair to determine costs and subsequent care.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study using a large convenience sample of US employer-based insurance claims from July 2012 to December 2015. We identified children younger than 18 years of age undergoing uncomplicated (not strangulated, incarcerated, or gangrenous) umbilical hernia repair as an isolated procedure (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision procedure codes 53.41, 53.42, 53.43, or 53.49, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision procedure code 0WQF0ZZ, or Current Procedural Terminology procedure codes 49580 or 49585).

Results

In all, 5212 children met criteria for inclusion. Children younger than age 2 years accounted for 9.7% of repairs, with significant variation by census region (6% to 14%, P < .001). Total payments for surgery varied by age; children younger than 2 years averaged $8219 and payments for older children were $6137. Postoperative admissions occurred at a rate of 73.1 per 1000 for children younger than age 2 years and 7.43 for older children; emergency department visits were 41.5 per 1000 for children younger than age 2 years vs 15.9 for older children (P < .001).

Conclusions

Umbilical hernias continue to be repaired at early ages with large regional variation. Umbilical hernia repair younger than age 2 years is associated with greater costs and greater frequency of postoperative hospitalization and emergency department visits.

Methods

Data source and cohort identification

This was a cross-sectional retrospective study using data from 2012 to 2019 from the IBM Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. This database includes person-specific enrollment, clinical use, and expenditure data across inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug services for active employees, early retirees, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuees, and dependents with employer-sponsored health insurance. The data come from a selection of over 350 large employers and health plans, and each year, data are available on over 40 million individuals, including approximately 10 million children.

This study included children (aged 0–18 years) who underwent uncomplicated UHR and who resided in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Children from MSAs were selected because of the selection bias that is inherent in HDHP coverage. Namely, a variety of unobserved factors that predict families’ HDHP enrollment may also be correlated with their health care-seeking behaviors. To address this, we elected to employ instrumental variable analyses. Over the past decade, HDHP coverage has grown rapidly, from approximately 20% to 50%, among commercially insured children. However, there has been a large variation in this growth across MSAs.We exploited this geographical variation in HDHP growth over time by using MSA/year-level HDHP prevalence among children in the Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters database as an instrumental variable.

Uncomplicated UHRs were identified using Current Procedural Technology, International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and ICD-10 Procedure Coding System procedure codes and diagnosis codes (online supplemental appendix table 1). We excluded neonates (infants 30 days of age or less), children with a diagnosis of omphalocele or gastroschisis, children not from MSAs, children from MSAs with fewer than 5000 children in the Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database in any year of the study period, and children from MSAs with a >10% rate of missingness of health plan type in any year of the study period. The MSA-related exclusion criteria were implemented because our instrumental variable was defined at the MSA-year level and because we wished to include a sample of children from each MSA that was relatively stable in size and in demographic and socioeconomic characteristics over time. These exclusions resulted in the inclusion of children from 100 MSAs, spread across 35 states in all regions of the USA (online supplemental appendix table 2).

### Repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias [^14b366a2]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Umbilical and epigastric hernias are primary midline defects that are present in up to 50% of the population. In the United States, only about 1% of the population carries this specific diagnosis, and only about 11% of these are repaired. Repair is aimed at symptoms relief or prevention, and the patient's goals and expectations should be explicitly identified and aligned with the health care team. This article details some relevant and interesting anatomic issues, reviews existing data, and highlights some common and important surgical techniques. Emphasis is placed on a patient-centered approach to the repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

### Recurrent emergent hernia repairs: who is at risk? [^634cd54d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data source and patient population

This is a retrospective study using data from the 100% fee-for-service Medicare claims data between 2011 and 2021. We identified and included adult (18+) beneficiaries who underwent an inpatient index urgent or emergent ventral/incisional or umbilical hernia repair using the relevant CPT, diagnosis, and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) (Supplemental Table 1). Patients were excluded from the index cohort if they had a hernia repair within 2 years prior to the start of the study period or if their repair was associated with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for repair of a recurrent ventral hernia (49,565, 49,566, 49,656, 49,657). Emergent procedures were determined by urgent or emergent admission status as defined by the Claim Inpatient Admission Type Code, validated in prior surgical studies using Medicare claims.

Hospital characteristics data were obtained from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Each admission was linked to a hospital by a unique hospital identifier and year of operation located in the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) file. Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and linked with each admission on a zip code level based on the beneficiary’s residence and year of operation. We utilized Area Health Resources Files data from the Health Resources and Services Administration to determine the primary care health professional shortage area (PC-HPSA) designation for each admission based on the beneficiary’s county of residence and year of operation. This study was approved by the University of Michigan Investigation Review Board and deemed exempt due to the use of secondary data.

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Documentation and coding for trauma and surgical critical care: updates and tips [^f9c3bbe3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Contemporary hernia coding

Hernia operation represents a significant portion of most acute care surgeons’ elective and emergent operative volume and productivity. Key changes to the 2023 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes made the coding for these procedures distinct from other general surgical procedures.Failure to adapt dictation and billing practices can lead to a substantial loss of productivity and reimbursement. The changes focus on two main areas: Coding of the procedure and elimination of the 90-day global period. Explanations of the rationale behind the changes are addressed in a recent American College of Surgeons Bulletin and are beyond the scope of this article.

Epigastric, incisional, Spigelian, umbilical, and ventral have all been classified as “anterior abdominal hernias”. Separate codes for open, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches, have been eliminated and a single set of new codes was created. Parastomal hernias now have two CPT codes for reducible and incarcerated/strangulated. Inguinal, femoral, and lumbar hernia coding remains unchanged. The mesh implantation code was removed, as it is assumed mesh is used in most repairs. The add-on code for infected mesh removal remains unchanged (11008) and a new one for removal of uninfected mesh was added (49623). The essential elements now include hernia size, initial or recurrent, and reducible or incarcerated/strangulated status. Summary of definitions of new CPT codes and work RVU (wRVU) are noted in tables1 2. As a reminder, lysis of adhesions remains included with the hernia repair and a separate code for laparoscopic or open enterolysis is not appropriate. However, if the lysis is extensive and requires substantial time and effort, a −22 modifier, “increased procedural service” may be used. The amount of increased payment will vary by payer but is typically 15% to 20%.

### Practice variation in umbilical hernia repair demonstrates a need for best practice guidelines [^f131aaca]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate and better understand variations in practice patterns, we analyzed ambulatory surgery claims data from 3 demographically diverse states to assess the relationship between age at umbilical hernia repair and patient, hospital, and geographic characteristics.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study of uncomplicated hernia repairs performed as a single procedure in 2012-2014, using the State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database for Wisconsin, New York, and Florida. Age and demographic characteristics of umbilical hernia repair patients are described.

Results

The State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database analysis included 6551 patients. Across 3 states, 8.2% of hernia repairs were performed in children <2 years, 18.7% in children age 2-3 years, and 73.0% in children age ≥4 years, but there was significant variability (P<.001) in practice patterns by state. In regression analysis, race, Medicaid insurance and rural residence were predictive of early repair, with African American patients less likely to have a repair before age 2 (OR 0.62, P=.046) and rural children (OR 1.53, P=.009) and Medicaid patients (OR 2.01, P<.001) more likely to do so. State of residence predicted early repair even when holding these variables constant.

Conclusions

The age of pediatric umbilical hernia repair varies widely. As hernias may resolve over time and can be safely monitored with watchful waiting, formal guidelines are needed to support delayed repair and prevent unnecessary operations.

### Variation in surgical management of asymptomatic umbilical hernia at freestanding children's hospitals [^2e6cebb0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To examine hospital-level variation in the timing of asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of children undergoing umbilical hernia repair at 38 children's hospitals using the Pediatric Health Information System database (01/2013-12/2017). Early repair was defined as surgery performed at 3 years of age or younger. Repairs were categorized as emergent/urgent if associated with diagnostic or procedural codes indicating obstruction or strangulation, or if they occurred within 2 weeks of an emergency department encounter. Multivariable regression was used to calculate hospital-level observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios for early repair adjusting for emergent/urgent repair and patient characteristics.

Results

23,144 children were included, of which 30% underwent early repair (hospital range: 6.9%-54.3%, p ≪ 0.001). Overall, 3.8% of all repairs were emergent/urgent, and higher rates of early repair did not correlate with higher rates of emergent/urgent repair across hospitals (r = -0.10). Following adjustment, hospital-level O/E ratios for early repair varied 8.9-fold (0.19-1.70, p ≪ 0.001).

Conclusion

Timing of asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair varies widely across children's hospitals, and the magnitude of this variation cannot be explained by differences in patient characteristics or the acuity of repair. Many children may be undergoing repair of hernias that may spontaneously close with further observation.

Level Of Evidence

Level III (retrospective comparative study).

### Umbilical hernia repair: overview of approaches and review of literature [^e7c8bc4e]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernias are ubiquitous, and surgery is indicated in symptomatic patients. Umbilical hernia defects can range from small (<1 cm) to very large/complex hernias, and treatment options should be tailored to the clinical situation. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic options exist for repair, with each having its advantages and disadvantages. In general, mesh should be used for repair, because it has been shown to decrease recurrence rates, even in small hernias. Although outcomes are generally favorable after umbilical hernia repairs, some patients have chronic complaints that are mostly related to recurrences.

### Laparoscopic versus open elective repair of primary umbilical hernias: short-term outcomes from the American college of surgeons national surgery quality improvement program [^af2e2bc3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 175,000 umbilical hernia repairs are performed annually in the US. Controversy exists regarding the optimal approach for the elective repair of primary umbilical hernias.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare 30-day outcomes of elective primary open (OHR) and laparoscopic (LHR) umbilical hernia repairs, using a prospectively collected dataset.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files during 2009 and 2010. Current Procedural Terminology and post-operative International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnostic codes were used to identify primary umbilical hernia repairs. Primary outcomes included composite endpoints of 30-day mortality, and major and overall complications. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were performed controlling for relevant patient characteristics. Secondary outcomes included operative time and hospital length of stay (LOS).

Results

Overall, 14,652 patients were identified-13,109 (89.5 %) OHR and 1543 (10.5 %) LHR. Univariate analyses of primary outcomes demonstrated similar 30-day morbidity and mortality between groups. In our multivariate model, however, after controlling for body mass index, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists class, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the odds ratio (OR) for overall complications favored LHR (OR 0.60; p = 0.01). This difference was driven primarily by the reduced wound complication rate in the LHR group [OR 0.41 (0.20, 0.78); p = 0.005]. LHR was associated with significantly longer operative time [57.7 min (SD 32.6) vs. 38.3 min (SD 22.9); p < 0.001], longer LOS [0.29 days (SD 0.68) vs. 0.17 days (SD 1.47); p = 0.001], and an increased rate of respiratory (0.52 vs. 0.10 %; p < 0.001) and cardiac (0.26 vs. 0.05 %; p = 0.005) complications.

Conclusions

This study identified potential decreased total and wound morbidity associated with LHR for elective primary umbilical hernia repairs at the expense of increased operative time, LOS, and respiratory and cardiac complications. These results should be considered within the context of a retrospective study with its inherent risks of bias and limitations.

### Surgical approach and long-term recurrence after ventral hernia repair [^831daa03]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source and Patient Population

We used data from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review Parts A and B files to identify initial (index) operations for patients 18 years or older who underwent elective, inpatient ventral hernia repair from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2020. Ventral hernia included all anterior abdominal wall hernias coded in claims as ventral, incisional, umbilical, or epigastric hernia repair. Patients were identified initially using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and ICD-10 procedure codes, which were cross-referenced with the corresponding ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Patients were excluded from the index cohort if they had a prior hernia repair in the 2 years leading up to the initial operation or if the operation was associated with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for repair of a recurrent ventral hernia (codes 49565, 49566, 49656, or 49657). All subsequent admissions for a ventral hernia operation after the index repair were excluded from the index cohort. Patients not enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare were also excluded due to lack of accurate follow-up. To ensure we accurately captured index hernia repairs from ICD-9 and ICD-10 procedure codes, patients were also excluded if they lacked a concurrent CPT code for hernia repair (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). A flow diagram with detailed stepwise patient inclusion and exclusion is available in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. This study used deidentified patient data and was therefore deemed exempt from regulation by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^9ac76f01]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We conducted a retrospective review of primary umbilical hernia repairs in patients performed at a single institution by a group of ten surgeons over a six-year period. Patients were identified as having an umbilical hernia by current procedural terminology (CPT) code. Consecutive surgeries were collected from November 1st, 2017, to November 1st, 2023. Exclusion criteria included incorrect current procedural terminology (CPT) codes, use of mesh, re-operative field, patients less than 18 years of age, and emergency surgery. Institutional review board approval was granted for this study.

The primary outcome was comparison of recurrence rates between braided and monofilament suture. Secondary outcomes included recurrence rate of absorbable and permanent monofilament suture, recurrence rate by repair method, rates of wound infection within thirty days, and suture granuloma formation. Charts were reviewed for recurrence defined either radiographically or by re-operative repair. Granuloma and infection rates were also recorded. Our follow-up time period was an average of 46 months via chart review.

Statistical analysis

We performed our statistical analysis with recurrence as our main dependent variable using a chi-square test. As a follow-up for each test, we performed a binomial logistic regression with the following control variables: sex, BMI, smoker status, ASA class, hypertension, CCI. We included these as a robustness test and to control for alternative explanations.

### Comprehensive genome-wide association study of different forms of hernia identifies more than 80 associated loci [^9f668e57]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

A hernia is an outpouching of tissue through a preformed or secondarily established fissure. Most hernias occur in the abdominal wall, only diaphragmatic hernias present with a defect of the diaphragm resulting in abdominal tissue entering the chest cavity. A Swedish study on the familial risk of different hernias, including inguinal, umbilical, femoral and incisional hernias, identified increased sibling risks not only for pairs with the same form of hernia, also for several combinations of discordant hernias. They concluded that genetic factors play a role in the etiology of hernias. The fact that increased risks were seen across different forms of hernia supports the hypothesis that there might be genetic risk factors contributing to multiple forms of hernia and combined analyses have potential to identify additional associated loci. Higher BMI is associated with increased and decreased risk of diaphragmatic herniaand inguinal hernia, respectively. On the other hand, inguinal hernia and gastroesophagal reflux (a frequent consequence of diaphragmatic hernia) have been associated with psychiatric disorders later in life, including depression and schizophrenia,. Comprehensive GWAS data on hernias are needed to investigate potential shared genetic susceptibility between hernias and these and other traits. So far, the only genome-wide association study on hernias was on inguinal hernias and identified four risk loci.

In this genome-wide association study based on data from the UK Biobank, we investigate five different forms of hernia classified according to ICD 10 codes by their location as inguinal (K40), femoral (K41), umbilical (K42), and diaphragmatic (K44), or by their origin in previous injury of the abdominal wall (ventral hernia, K43). To maximize power, we combine information about hernia from hospital records (surgery codes, ICD9- and ICD10-codes) and interview data (surgery and non-cancer illness). We also study two combined groups: any hernia and any hernia excluding individuals who only had diaphragmatic hernia, as diaphragmatic hernia is special by its location and the substantially lower rate of surgery-confirmed cases. Variants associated with inguinal hernia are followed up in silico in four additional study groups. In total, we identify 81 genetic loci associated with one or multiple forms of hernia. Pathway analysis provides further evidence that genes important for connective tissue morphology play an essential role in inguinal hernia etiology.

### Long-term recurrence and the safety of mesh use after emergency ventral hernia repair [^887cefea]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Outcome Measures and Explanatory Variables

We first characterized overall long-term reoperation rates for recurrence for emergent hernia repairs and reoperation rates for recurrence for emergent open umbilical and incisional-ventral hernia repairs. Operative recurrence was used instead of clinical or radiographic recurrence, which cannot be identified in Medicare claims data alone. Operative recurrence up to 10 years after initial surgery was identified by a subsequent hernia repair using the same CPT and ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes used to identify the initial hernia repair and/or the presence of specific hernia recurrence CPT codes (49565, 49566, 49656, and 49657), consistent with prior work.

The primary outcome was the reoperation rate for recurrence after open emergent hernia repair stratified by mesh use. Because mesh use is presumed for both laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hernia repairs (and not reimbursed if coded separately), we restricted this portion of our analysis to only ventral hernias repaired with an open approach. The emergent repairs performed in an open fashion were stratified by mesh use (CPT code 49568), and the subsequent reoperation rate for recurrence was identified the same manner as above.

Our secondary outcome was the incidence of mesh explantation with and without enterectomy in this same cohort (open, emergent hernia repairs). This is particularly relevant for emergent hernia repairs, in which there is a higher likelihood of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention class III (contaminated) or IV (dirty-infected) wounds due to bowel necrosis with enteric spillage or frank perforation, and evidence for the use of mesh is limited. CPT codes 11008 and 49402 were used to identify mesh explantation up to 5 years after emergent open ventral hernia repairs. Mesh explantation rates were stratified by the concurrent need for bowel resection (CPT code 44120) to identify any differences in cases likely to be identified as clean and clean-contaminated vs contaminated and dirty-infected.

### Are we recording postoperative complications correctly? Comparison of NHS hospital episode statistics with the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program [^56c3aa50]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data are used to measure surgical outcomes, but its quality has been considered inferior to that of clinical databases. We compare the recording accuracy of HES, an administrative database used in the National Health Service (NHS), with that of ACS NSQIP (American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program), a well-established clinical database.

Methods

1323 patient records from our hospital, common to both databases were compared for ten surgical procedures (amputation, appendicectomy, cholecystectomy, femoral hernia repair, Hartmann's procedure, incisional hernia repair, inguinal hernia repair, long saphenous vein surgery, parathyroidectomy and umbilical hernia repair) and nine postoperative complications (acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, urinary tract infection, blood transfusion, septic shock, surgical site infection and wound disruption) using text strings or ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) codes. κ coefficient was calculated as a measure of concordance between HES and ACS NSQIP databases.

Results

The databases showed perfect or very good agreement in recording a majority of surgical procedures (κ coefficient range 0.82-1.0), but there was discordance in recording postoperative complications. When HES was investigated using text string or ICD-10 code, the κ coefficient range for nine postoperative complications was 0.00-0.56, indicating poor to moderate inter-rater agreement. Concordance was even less when searched by HES coder's recommended way to record postoperative complications.

Conclusions

HES poorly registers postoperative complications. Suggested improvements include addition of dates when a condition is diagnosed, agreed criteria to identify postoperative complications, specifically trained coding staff for surgery and consistent use of the coding guidance.

### Surgical approach and long-term recurrence after ventral hernia repair [^772507ab]. JAMA Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Outcome Measures and Explanatory Variables

The primary outcome was operative recurrence for ventral hernia repair. Operative recurrence was used as a proxy for true clinical recurrence, which cannot be measured in Medicare claims data alone. The total number of ventral/incisional and umbilical hernia repairs was tabulated for each year studied. Surgical approach (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, or open) was identified using corresponding CPT, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Operation for recurrence was identified by a subsequent hernia repair using the same CPT, ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes used to identify the initial hernia repair, the presence of specific hernia recurrence CPT codes (codes 49565, 49566, 49656, and 49657), or both methods.

Explanatory variables included in our models were consistent with prior published work on hernia and included patient age, sex, race and ethnicity (eMethods 1 in Supplement 1), Elixhauser comorbidities, year of surgery, approach (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, or open), mesh use, the use of myofascial flap, and hernia subtype (ventral/incisional or umbilical). Patient race and ethnicity are included as identifiers in the Medicare claims database in this study and are represented in the following standard, fixed categories: Asian, Black, Hispanic, North American Native, White, other race, and unknown race. Only a single category could be selected, and no additional information is available in Medicare claims data regarding the composition of the other race category. Age was treated as a continuous variable. All other variables were treated as categorical.

### Association of sociodemographic factors with adherence to age-specific guidelines for asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children [^84523cde]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines recommend delaying repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernia in children until after age 4 to 5 years to allow for spontaneous closure.

Objective

To examine the association of sociodemographic factors with adherence to age-specific guidelines for asymptomatic umbilical hernia repair in children.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, children 17 years and younger who underwent umbilical hernia repair from January 2013 to June 2018 at 47 freestanding children's hospitals participating in the Pediatric Health Information System database were eligible for study inclusion. Children who underwent multiple procedures, repair of recurrent hernias, or had missing sociodemographic data were excluded.

Exposures

Early umbilical hernia repair was defined as repair at 3 years or younger. Emergent or urgent presentation was defined as repair performed during the same encounter or within 2 weeks of an emergency department visit, respectively. Patients were categorized by sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, income quintile, and presence of complex chronic conditions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with the odds of early repair after adjusting for emergent or urgent presentation and hospital-level effects.

Results

Of the 25 877 included children, 13 817 (53.4%) were female, 14 143 (54.7%) had public insurance, and the median (interquartile range) age was 5.0 (3.0-6.0) years. Following adjustment, increased odds of early repair was associated with public insurance (public vs commercial insurance: odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36-1.56; P<.001), lower income (lowest vs highest income quintile: OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.65; P<.001), and female sex (female vs male sex: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.13-1.27; P<.001). Children with public insurance in the lowest income quintile had 2.2-fold increased odds of early repair compared with children with commercial insurance in the highest income quintile (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.93-2.40; P<.001). Sociodemographic factors were not associated with increased odds of early repair in the subgroup of children who underwent early repair following emergent or urgent presentation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Public insurance, lower income, and female sex are independently associated with repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children earlier than recommended by current guidelines. These children may be at greater risk of undergoing repair of umbilical hernias that may spontaneously close with further observation.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^8331ddac]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for incisional hernia, more specifically with respect to abdominal closure techniques (trocar site closure), AHS/EHS 2022 guidelines recommend to consider suturing the fascial defect for trocar sites of ≥ 10 mm, especially after single-incision laparoscopic surgery and for trocars located at the umbilical site.

### Predictors of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia in children [^398dc62a]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

After obtaining approval from our institution’s research ethics board (REB), we performed a retrospective chart review in EPIC (Electronic Health Records). Hyperspace of all patients referred for umbilical hernia to CHEO between January 1990 and April 2017.

Study participants were identified from patient records, based on the diagnostic code for umbilical hernia obtained from the CHEO Clinical Research Unit. We included all children under 18 years of age who were referred to CHEO for umbilical hernia repair during the designated capture period, which explained how our study sample size was obtained. Umbilical hernia repair refers to the procedure whereby a surgeon makes a small incision at the base of a patient’s belly button and pushes the loop of bowel back into the abdominal wall. Exclusion criteria were: (1) young adults >18 years of age and (2) children with umbilical hernia who were discovered as an incidental finding while undergoing surgical procedure for another condition. Medical records for all patients identified were reviewed and abstracted. Data were compiled into The Research Electronic Data Capture Database (REDCap).

Variables extracted from medical records included date of birth, gender, age at first referral, size of defect (mm), comorbidities (any cardiac, genetic, neurological, and nephrological disorders), dates of resolution (day, month, year), incarceration, and/or strangulation, date of surgery, and any perioperative complications. The main outcome of interest was spontaneous resolution of hernia. One potential confounder is prematurity, defined as gestational age less than 37 weeks. To eliminate the potential for confounding, we excluded patients with an incidental finding of umbilical hernia from our study.

Descriptive statistics were performed for age, timing of repair, and complications. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of preoperative complications (incarceration/strangulation) and odds of spontaneous resolution of umbilical hernia, in an attempt to identify a cohort that would benefit from earlier surgical repair. A subgroup analysis was performed exclusively on patients with complications, due to the presence of effect modification between umbilical hernia and resolution of the hernia.

### Provincial review of adherence to age-specific guidelines for umbilical hernia repair and trends in management [^1207c2f0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernia (UH) is a common pediatric condition, for which delaying surgical repair for asymptomatic UH until after age 3 is recommended due to a high incidence of spontaneous closure. We aimed to determine the adherence to guidelines, rate of urgent surgical repair, outcomes, cost, and interinstitutional referral patterns of UH repair in the province of Quebec (Canada).

Methods

This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of children 28 days to 17 years old who underwent UH repair between 2010 and 2020 using health administrative databases. Children who had multiple procedures, or prolonged peri-operative stays were excluded. Early repair was defined as elective surgery at or under age 3.

Results

Of the 3215 children, 1744 (54.2%) were female, and 1872 (58.2%) were treated in a tertiary children's hospital. Guidelines were respected for 2853 out of 3215 children (89.7%). Patients living over 75 km from their treating hospitals (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.33-4.16, P < 0.01), with pre-existing comorbidities (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.96-4.05; P < 0.001), or being treated in a tertiary center (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.45-3.03, P < 0.001) had a higher risk of early repair. Repair at or under age 3 and urgent surgery were associated with significant cost increases of 411$ (P < 0.001) and 558$ (P < 0.001), respectively.

Conclusion

Quebec has a high rate of adherence to age-specific guidelines for UH repair. Future research should explore factors that explain transfers into tertiary centers, and the extent to which these reflect efficient use of resources.

### Epigastric hernias in children and the use of ultrasound in its diagnosis [^31e73ec3]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

We retrospectively included all patients below 18 years of age diagnosed with epigastric hernias in the two participating tertiary pediatric surgical departments from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2020. The available data were screened for misclassified umbilical or incisional hernias, but none were identified. Patients were identified via the specific diagnosis codes according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems in the German Modification for an epigastric hernia (K43.60/K43.70/K43.90). Data extraction with anonymization at the source was carried out by specifically trained chart abstractors using a prespecified data extraction chart, which was occasionally cross-checked to ensure the quality of extracted data as recommended elsewhere.We collected information on age, sex, body weight and height, symptoms on presentation, clinical findings, defect size, the preoperative use of ultrasound for diagnosis, and operation times. As there are no clear distinctions in the literature of what accounts for a periumbilical, supraumbilical and an epigastric hernia,we used the following definitions: periumbilical hernias were those immediately adjacent to the umbilical ring but were excluded from the analysis because they frequently occur in association with umbilical hernias. Supraumbilical herniaswere those epigastric hernias that were located up to 3 cm rostral to the umbilicus because anatomical studies have shown that the linea alba may have different properties there compared with more rostral partsand are clinically thought to be different from umbilical hernias.All more rostrally located epigastric hernias were considered true epigastric hernias. Ultrasound examinations were ordered at the discretion of the treating surgeon in both centers. All ultrasound examinations of epigastric hernias were conducted by board-certified pediatric radiologists in a standardized fashion. Open repairs, illustrated elsewhere,were usually performed via a transverse incision, in some cases with larger hernias via a longitudinal incision, located directly above the preoperatively marked hernia. Subcutaneous tissue was transected using electrocautery until the hernia was reached and exposed circumferentially. Following manual reduction of the hernia or if it was unsuccessful, the herniated fat was ligated and divided, and the fascia was closed using simple interrupted sutures. Available fascial defect sizes were measured intraoperatively and taken from the operation notes. The laparoscopic approach used in this report has been described in detail elsewhere.Statistical analysis was conducted using R(V.3.5.3) with its generic stats4 package. Differences in medians of numeric variables were compared via Mood’s test, and correlation analyses used point-biserial correlation from the correlation package(V.0.8.0).The normality of the data was checked via the Jarque-Bera test from the tseries package (V.0.10-52)supported by visual analysis of QQ plots. Homogeneity of variance between groups was tested via Levene’s test using the car package (V.3.0-7).Symptoms and results of the clinical examination, as dichotomous variables, were compared between males and females using Barnard’s testprovided in the Barnard package(V.1.8) as described elsewhere.In the jurisdiction of our ethics committees, retrospective analyses of routine clinical data with anonymization at the source are waived from institutional review board approval.

### An unusual case of umbilical hernia rupture with evisceration [^03e5f1f0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Umbilical hernia is a common pediatric diagnosis for which the initial management is usually nonoperative. The high incidence of spontaneous closure and the infrequency of complications in the first few years of life justify this conservative management strategy. The authors present a case of a 5-month-old girl with a history of prematurity and prolonged ventilatory support, who subsequently experienced bowel evisceration via a previously uncomplicated umbilical hernia.

### Umbilical hernias: the cost of waiting [^1d3e5c3e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Umbilical hernias are well described in the literature, but its impact on health care is less understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of non-operative management of umbilical hernias on cost, work absenteeism, and resource utilization.

Methods

The Truven Health Database, consisting of 279 employers and over 3000 hospitals, was reviewed for all umbilical hernia patients, aged 18-64 who were enrolled in health plans for 12 months prior to surgery and 12 months after surgery. Patients were excluded if they had a recurrence or had been offered a "no surgery" approach within 1 year of the index date. The remaining patients were separated into surgery (open or laparoscopic repair) or no surgery (NS). Post-cost analysis at 90 and 365 days and estimated days off from work were reviewed for each group.

Results

The non-surgery cohort had a higher proportion of females and comorbidity index. Adjusted analysis showed significantly higher 90 and 365 costs for the surgery group (p < 0.0001), though the cost difference did decrease over time. NS group had significantly higher estimated days of health-care utilization at both the 90 (1.99 vs. 3.58 p < 0.0001) and 365 (8.69 vs. 11.04 p < 0.0001) day post-index mark. A subgroup analysis demonstrated laparoscopic repair had higher costs compared to open primarily due to higher index procedure costs (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Though the financial costs were found to be higher in the surgery group, the majority of these were due to the surgery itself. Significantly higher days of health-care utilization and estimated days off work were experienced in the NS group. It is our belief that early operative intervention will lead to decreased costs and resource utilization.

### Association between age and umbilical hernia repair outcomes in children: a multistate population-based cohort study [^cd1116a9]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether patient age or other sociodemographic and clinical characteristics are associated with recurrence or unplanned related hospital revisits after pediatric umbilical hernia repair.

Study Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient, Emergency Department, and Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases of 7 states. Pediatric umbilical hernia repairs performed at any hospital or surgery center in 2010-2014 were included. Hernia recurrences and occurrences of unplanned and related hospital revisits within 30 days were evaluated.

Results

Of 9809 included patients, 52.0% were female and 50.5% were black. The 3-year hernia recurrence rate was 0.57% (95% CI 0.42, 0.73). In multivariable analysis, the recurrence rate was higher in children <4 years of age than in children 4-10 years of age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.09, 3.44). Unplanned related hospital revisits within 30 days occurred in 2.5% of patients. Patient characteristics associated with the risk of an unplanned related hospital revisit included age <4 years (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.70, 2.77) or >10 years (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.46, 3.05), public insurance (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.58, 2.79), asthma (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.32, 2.29), and initial presentation to the emergency department (HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.08, 5.61).

Conclusions

Rates of recurrence and unplanned related hospital revisits following pediatric umbilical hernia repair are higher in children younger than 4 years of age. These findings support delaying the repair of asymptomatic umbilical hernia in children until 4 years of age.

### Multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association study identifies novel candidate genes and pleiotropy effects across four abdominal hernia subtypes [^e5cc1852]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with abdominal hernia were included in our study based on clinical diagnoses and procedures recorded in the KPNC electronic health record (EHR) system. Specifically, clinical diagnoses and procedures were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10) codes, or Current Procedural Terminology, 4 th Edition (CPT-4) procedure codes. We defined inguinal hernia based on diagnosis codes (ICD-9: 550.X; ICD-10: K40.X), procedure codes (ICD-9: 53.0X, 53.1X, 17.1X, 17.2X; CPT-4:49491, 49492, 49495, 49496, 49500, 49501, 49505, 49507, 49520, 49521, 49525, 49650, 49651, 49659), and postoperative diagnosis. Femoral hernia cases were defined based on diagnosis codes (ICD-9: 551.0X, 552.0X, 553.0X; ICD-10: K41.X), procedure codes (ICD-9: 53.2X, 53.3X; CPT-4: 49550, 49553, 49555, 49557), and postoperative diagnosis. Umbilical hernia cases were defined based on diagnosis codes (ICD-9: 551.1X, 552.1X, 553.1X; ICD-10: K42.X), procedure codes (ICD-9: 53.4X; CPT-4:49580, 49582, 49585, 49587), and postoperative diagnosis. Ventral hernia cases were defined based on diagnosis codes (ICD-9: 551.2X, 552.2X, 553.2X; ICD-10: K43.X), procedure codes (ICD-9: 53.51X, 53.61X, 53.62X; CPT-4: 49560, 49561, 49565, 49566, 49568), and postoperative diagnosis. The control group included the non-cases and excluded individuals presenting with any evidence of any subtype of hernia. In the GERA cohort, 8,523, 341, 4,282, and 4,445 individuals with inguinal, femoral, umbilical, and ventral hernia subtypes were identified, respectively, with mean ages (in years) ranging from 65.4 (standard deviation [SD] = 11.7) for umbilical hernia cases to 69.8 (SD = 12.0) for femoral hernia cases (Table S1). The majority of cases for each hernia subtype were male, except for femoral hernia.

### Guidelines for treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias from the European hernia society and americas hernia society [^34e73480]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Umbilical and epigastric hernia repairs are frequently performed surgical procedures with an expected low complication rate. Nevertheless, the optimal method of repair with best short- and long-term outcomes remains debatable. The aim was to develop guidelines for the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias.

Methods

The guideline group consisted of surgeons from Europe and North America including members from the European Hernia Society and the Americas Hernia Society. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument were used. A systematic literature search was done on 1 May 2018, and updated on 1 February 2019.

Results

Literature reporting specifically on umbilical and epigastric hernias was limited in quantity and quality, resulting in a majority of the recommendations being graded as weak, based on low-quality evidence. The main recommendation was to use mesh for repair of umbilical and epigastric hernias to reduce the recurrence rate. Most umbilical and epigastric hernias may be repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh. A laparoscopic approach may be considered if the hernia defect is large, or if the patient has an increased risk of wound morbidity.

Conclusion

This is the first European and American guideline on the treatment of umbilical and epigastric hernias. It is recommended that symptomatic umbilical and epigastric hernias are repaired by an open approach with a preperitoneal flat mesh.

### Stratification of surgical site infection by operative factors and comparison of infection rates after hernia repair [^752e3eab]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether operative factors are associated with risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after hernia repair.

Design

Retrospective cohort study. Patients Commercially insured enrollees aged 6 months-64 years with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure or Current Procedural Terminology, fourth edition, codes for inguinal/femoral, umbilical, and incisional/ventral hernia repair procedures from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2010.

Methods

SSIs within 90 days after hernia repair were identified by diagnosis codes. The χ2 and Fisher exact tests were used to compare SSI incidence by operative factors.

Results

A total of 119,973 hernia repair procedures were analyzed. The incidence of SSI differed significantly by anatomic site, with rates of 0.45% (352/77,666) for inguinal/femoral, 1.16% (288/24,917) for umbilical, and 4.11% (715/17,390) for incisional/ventral hernia repair. Within anatomic sites, the incidence of SSI was significantly higher for open versus laparoscopic inguinal/femoral (0.48% [295/61,142] vs 0.34% [57/16,524], P=.020) and incisional/ventral (4.20% [701/16,699] vs 2.03% [14/691], P=.005) hernia repairs. The rate of SSI was higher following procedures with bowel obstruction/necrosis than procedures without obstruction/necrosis for open inguinal/femoral (0.89% [48/5,422] vs 0.44% [247/55,720], P<.001) and umbilical (1.57% [131/8,355] vs 0.95% [157/16,562], P<.001), but not incisional/ventral hernia repair (4.01% [224/5,585] vs 4.16% [491/11,805], P=.645).

Conclusions

The incidence of SSI was highest after open procedures, incisional/ventral repairs, and hernia repairs with bowel obstruction/necrosis. Stratification of hernia repair SSI rates by some operative factors may facilitate accurate comparison of SSI rates between facilities.

### Suture or mesh repair of the smallest umbilical hernias: a nationwide database study [^b92209a1]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mesh is recommended for umbilical hernias with defects>1 cm to reduce recurrence. For umbilical hernias with defect width≤1 cm, the literature is sparse. The aim of this nationwide cohort study was to assess outcomes after suture and mesh repair of umbilical hernias with defect width≤1 cm and to evaluate outcomes after onlay mesh repair specifically.

Methods

By merging data from the Danish Hernia Database and the National Patients Registry from 2007 to 2018, patients undergoing elective open repair of an umbilical hernia with defect width≤1 cm were identified. Available data included details about comorbidity, surgical technique, 90-day readmission, 90-day reoperation and operation for recurrence.

Results

A total of 7849 patients were included, of whom 25.7% (2013/7849) underwent mesh repair. Reoperation for recurrence was significantly decreased after mesh repair 3.1% (95% C.I. 2.1-4.1) compared with suture repair 6.7% (95% C.I. 6.0-7.4), P<0.001. Readmission and reoperation rates were significantly higher for mesh repair 7.9% (159/2013) and 2.6% (52/2013) than for suture repair 6.5% (381/5836) and 1.5% (89/5836), P=0.036 and P=0.002, respectively. Onlay mesh repairs had the lowest risk of recurrence 2.0% (95% C.I. 0.6-3.5), and readmission [7.9% (65/826)] and reoperation [3.9% (32/826)] rates within 90 days were comparable to suture repairs [6.5% (381/5836)] and [3.3% (192/5836)], P=0.149 and P=0.382, respectively.

Conclusions

Even for the smallest umbilical hernias, mesh repair significantly decreased the recurrence rate. Onlay mesh repair was associated with lowest risk of recurrence without increasing early complications.

### Multi-tissue transcriptome-wide association study identifies novel candidate genes and pleiotropy effects across four abdominal hernia subtypes [^5837d545]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The Institutional Review Board of the KPNC has approved all study procedures, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

UK Biobank and hernia subtypes

The UKB is a large prospective study of over 500,000 participants who reside in the United Kingdom and are aged between 40 and 69 years at the baseline recruitment visit.Genotyping and imputation of UKB samples were carried out by members of the UKB team, with full details on participant recruitment, genotyping, and imputation described elsewhere. Briefly, individuals were genotyped using the UK BiLEVE Axiom and UKB Axiom Arrays.Following genetic QC, imputation to the two reference panels (1) the full HRC (n = 32,488; no indels) and (2) a merger of 1000 Genomes Phase 3 and the UK10K (n = 6,285; indels) was conducted as previously described.

In the UKB, the inguinal hernia phenotype was assessed through diagnosis codes (ICD-10: K40.X), procedure codes (code 1563 in operation data field 20004, and codes T19, T20, T21 in procedure data field 41200), or self-report data (code 1513 in self-reported data field 20002). The femoral hernia phenotype was assessed through diagnosis codes (ICD-10: K41.X), procedure codes (code 1564 in operation data field 20004, and codes T22 and T23 in procedure data field 41200), or self-report data (code 1605 in self-reported data field 20002). The umbilical hernia phenotype was assessed through diagnosis codes (ICD-10: K42.X), procedure codes (code 1404 in operation data field 20004, and codes T24 and T97 in procedure data field 41200), or self-report data (code 1512 in self-reported data field 20002). The ventral hernia phenotype was assessed through diagnosis codes (ICD-10: K43.X), procedure codes (code 1405 in operation data field 20004, and codes T25 and T26 in procedure data field 41200), or self-report data (code 1606 in self-reported data field 20002). The control group included the non-cases and excluded individuals presenting with any evidence of any hernia subtype.

### Lack of insurance is associated with increased risk for hernia complications [^096dd530]. Annals of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine whether lack of insurance is associated with an increased likelihood of presenting to a hospital with a complicated hernia, and whether insurance status might be associated with clinical outcomes.

Context

Delays in elective repair of hernias appear to increase the likelihood of emergency presentation, morbidity, and mortality. Lack of access due to insurance status is a plausible contributor to such delays.

Methods

This retrospective study evaluated ambulatory surgical and inpatient hospitalization data from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006 in California. Patients who presented for a inguinal, umbilical, or ventral hernia repair or were hospitalized primarily related to the hernia, were at least 5 years old, and had Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), Medicare, private, or no insurance were included. The main outcome is presentation with a hernia involving bowel obstruction or gangrene, sepsis, or peritonitis. Secondary outcomes evaluated were inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay, and nonoperative management.

Results

Out of 147,665 encounters involving hernias, 13,254 (9.0%) involved presentation with a complicated hernia. While only 4.7% of encounters among patients with private insurance were for complicated hernias, 21.1% of those for patients without insurance involved complicated hernias (odds ratio [OR]: 7.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.05-9.76). Uninsured patients experienced greater mortality (OR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.01-5.24), lengths of hospital stay (incidence rate ratio: 3.34, 95% CI: 2.61-4.26), and were less likely to undergo operative management (OR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.11-0.22) than those with private insurance.

Conclusions

Lack of insurance is associated with a greater likelihood of presenting with a complicated inguinal, umbilical, or ventral hernia and increased mortality among all patients presenting with hernias at these anatomic sites.

### Learning curves for robotic-assisted ventral hernia repair [^8b572636]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

This study was deemed exempt from review and informed consent by the University of Michigan institutional review board due to the use of retrospective deidentified data. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

We used patient-level data from 100% Medicare fee-for-service patients who are enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B with no managed care. Detailed cohort selection methods can be found in the study by Fry et al,which used a similar process. Among these patients, we included Medicare beneficiaries aged 18 years or older who underwent elective inpatient ventral hernia repairs (ie, incisional or umbilical) between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020.

Individuals were identified by matching Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Edition (ICD-9 and ICD-10) procedure codes. These procedure codes were then cross-referenced with relevant ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis codes associated with ventral (incisional or umbilical) hernias (see eTable 1 in Supplement 1). The transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10 occurred in October 2015, but the coding changes related to ventral hernia repairs were minimal.

We linked inpatient index hernia surgical procedures with part B line-level claims to identify the National Provider Identification of performing surgeons. For each surgeon, we identified their earliest claim during the study period as their index hernia operation, arranged chronologically to assess reoperation rates for hernia recurrence based on the surgeon’s operation volume.

The surgeon’s patient volume was inflated using the proportion of Medicare patients at the hospital, better reflecting the total number of patients per surgeon, not limited to Medicare patients.We estimated hospital total case volume by extrapolating the Medicare hernia volume using the hospital level Medicare percentages for each year from 2010 to 2020. We calculated the percentage of Medicare patients out of total hospital admissions for each hospital using the ratio of hospital total Medicare discharges to the total admissions from American Hospital Association Annual Survey data.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^2ac9c67d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Umbilical hernias are extremely common, estimated to be prevalent in 23–50 percent of people. They account for approximately 6% to 14% of all abdominal wall hernias in adults. 90% of adult umbilical hernias are acquired due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, ascites, pregnancy, or chronic cough. Surgical repair of umbilical hernias is recommended for worsening pain, increase in size, and/or bowel obstructive symptoms. Primary suture repair is the general recommendation for small umbilical hernias, specifically those two centimeters or less in size. However, the risk of hernia recurrence with primary umbilical repair is not insignificant, estimated to be anywhere from 4.9 to 27 percent. The rate of recurrence appears to be related to the dimensions of the hernia, with smaller defects tending to have lower recurrence rate following repair.

Currently, there is little literature to support what suture type will provide the best repair with lowest recurrence risk for primary umbilical hernias. There are a myriad of suture types used for repair. Most commonly used sutures include monofilament absorbable (polydioxanone suture (PDS)), monofilament permanent (Prolene), and braided (Ethibond) suture. Several studies have been conducted to determine which suture is best to use when closing the abdominal cavity with surgeries such as laparotomies. However, in the setting of small primary umbilical hernias little is known about optimal suture choice for repair. While many surgeons use non-absorbable suture, there are also those who use absorbable suture in these cases with reportedly good outcomes.

Our study’s primary outcome aims to identify if there is less recurrence based on suture type. Secondary outcomes were evaluated looking for recurrence rates between repair techniques as well as comparisons between permanent and absorbable monofilament suture. In addition, we evaluated the rate of suture granulomas and wound infections.

### Delay in emergency hernia surgery is associated with worse outcomes [^e2e10b48]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients requiring emergent surgery for hernia vary widely in presentation and management. The purpose of this study was to determine if the variation in timing of urgent surgery impacts surgical outcomes.

Methods

The national NSQIP database for years 2011-2016 was queried for emergent surgeries for abdominal hernia resulting in obstruction or gangrene by primary post-op diagnosis. Diaphragmatic hernias were excluded. Patients were grouped by surgical timing from admission to day of surgery: same day, next day, and longer delay. Multinomial propensity score weighting was used to address potential differences in underlying covariates' clustering across the timing groups followed by multivariable logistic regression of morbidity and mortality.

Results

Weighted analysis yielded an effective sample size of 76,364. Hernia types included inguinal (20.9%); femoral (6.7%); umbilical (20.2%); ventral (41.0%); and other (10.4%). Delayed surgery was associated with increased rates of major complications (26.4% vs. 20.9%, p<0.001), longer operative times (+12.5 min, p<0.001), longer postoperative lengths of stay (+1.6 days, p<0.001), increased re-operations (5.9% vs. 4.7%, p=0.019), increased readmissions (7.0% vs. 5.7%, p=0.004), and increased 30-day mortality (2.4% vs. 1.7%, p=0.002). When controlling for other factors, next-day surgery (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05-1.45, p=0.009) and surgery delayed more than one day (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.13-1.73, p<0.002) were associated with an increased odds of a major complication. Mortality and readmission by timing of surgery were not independently significant.

Conclusions

Delay in surgery for emergent hernias increased the odds of major morbidity but not mortality. Patients presenting with hernia and an indication for urgent surgical intervention may benefit from an operation as soon as feasible rather than warrant waiting for further physiologic optimization, medical clearance, or specialized surgical personnel.

Insufficient evidence to recommend fascial closure at the trocar site for the prevention of trocar site hernia. Insufficient evidence regarding surgical site complications and pain. Insufficient evidence to recommend optimal closure technique or material.

METHODS

Study Design

After obtaining institutional board review approval (protocol #820208), a retrospective review was conducted on all patients ages 18 years and older undergoing non-emergent, open intra-abdominal, or gynecologic operation requiring abdominal wall fascial incision within the University of Pennsylvania Health System from January 2005 to June 2013. Eligible patients were identified by querying the electronic medical record for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) and year-specific Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. Patients were classified accordingly as having a gastric, bowel, hepatobiliary, spleen, or gynecologic intervention via open surgical approach.

Relevant exclusion criteria included laparoscopic surgical approach without an open component, documented IH diagnosis before index procedure, concurrent ventral hernia repair with index procedure, gynecologic procedure due to complication of pregnancy, operation not involving the gastrointestinal tract or gynecologic organs, death within 1 year of procedure, clinical follow-up of less than 1 year, and surgery performed in the outpatient setting or emergently (Fig. 1).

### Association between high deductible health plan coverage and age at pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^1168db89]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, we did not find that HDHP coverage is associated with a lower likelihood of children undergoing UHR before 4 years of age. Thus, our results do not suggest that HDHPs reduce potentially unnecessary surgical procedures or reduce deviation from best practice guidelines for the management of pediatric umbilical hernias. It is possible that future investigations of this or other procedures may yield different results, as the prevalence of HDHPs and the average deductible size in HDHPs have continued to rise in recent years.However, further research should investigate other factors that can be targeted to reduce unnecessary UHRs in young children, in accordance with best practice guidelines.

### National practice variation and disparities in pediatric umbilical hernia repair under five [^9c1b1745]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to assess national trends and predictors of elective pediatric umbilical hernia repair (UHR) before and after age five.

Summary Background Data

Limited surgical guidelines exist for pediatric umbilical hernias, leading to variations in practice patterns and timing of elective UHR.

Methods

The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (2016-2022) was used to identify isolated elective repairs of reducible umbilical hernias. Patients were categorized into early (0-4 years) and delayed (5-9 years) cohorts. Descriptive statistics and sample-weighted regression models were used to assess patient and hospital factors associated with delayed UHR. Outcome measures were total charge and non-home discharges. Age- and sex-adjusted national incidences were determined using negative binomial regression.

Results

Among 75,943 patients, the early (47.6%) and delayed (52.3%) cohorts had comparable case volumes. Early UHR was associated with higher total costs ($13,594 vs. $13,141) and non-home discharges (0.2% vs. 0.1%). The incidence of delayed UHR compared to that of early UHR increased after 2021. The incidence and odds of delayed UHR varied in the United States by region. Multivariate regression identified female sex, rural residence, non-private payment, and urban hospital location as factors with lower odds of delayed repair, while income above the 50th percentile and later years (2021-2022) were associated with higher odds of delayed repair.

Conclusions

Nearly half of elective UHR occurred before age five, with increased healthcare utilization and non-routine discharge. Significant socioeconomic and regional disparities highlight the need for standardized surgical guidelines to address the variability in pediatric umbilical hernia management.

### Current national practice patterns for inpatient management of ventral abdominal wall hernia in the United States [^870960d8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The health-care burden related to ventral hernia management is substantial, with more than 3 billion dollars in expenditures annually in the US. Previous studies have suggested that the utilization of laparoscopic repair remains relatively low although national volume estimates have not been reported. We sought to estimate the inpatient national volume of elective ventral hernia surgery and characterize the proportion of laparoscopic versus open operations.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify adults with a diagnosis of an umbilical, incisional, or ventral hernia who underwent an elective inpatient repair between 2009 and 2010. Cases that involved other major abdominal or pelvic operations were excluded. Covariates included patient demographics, surgical approach, and use of mesh. National surgical volume estimates were generated and length of stay and total hospital charges were compared for laparoscopic versus open repairs.

Results

A total of 112,070 ventral hernia repairs were included in the analysis: 72.1 % (n = 80,793) were incisional hernia repairs, while umbilical hernia repairs comprised only 6.9 % (n = 7,788). Laparoscopy was utilized in 26.6 % (n = 29,870) of cases. Mesh was placed in 85.8 % (n = 96,265) of cases, including 49.3 % (n = 3,841) of umbilical hernia repairs and 90.1 % (n = 72,973) of incisional hernia repairs. Length of stay and total hospital charges were significantly lower for laparoscopic umbilical, incisional, and "other" ventral hernia repairs (p values all <0.001). Total hospital charges during this 2-year period approached 4 billion dollars ($746 million for laparoscopic repair; $3 billion for open repair).

Conclusions

Utilization of laparoscopy for elective abdominal wall hernia repair remains relatively low in the US despite its excellent outcomes. Given the substantial financial burden associated with these hernias, future research focused on preventing the development and optimizing the surgical treatment of ventral abdominal wall hernias is warranted.

### Primary umbilical hernia repair: does suture type matter? [^67098d23]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study is limited by its retrospective design and reliance on medical records, including CT scans and clinical follow-up for recurrence identification. Additionally, as a single-center study with low risk surgical candidates, generalizability is limited. A multi-institutional study with longer and more robust follow-up would be beneficial to validate these findings. Our data was also comparatively low in monofilament suture compared to braided (Ethibond). Many of our surgeons have made a transition toward monofilament absorbable repair in the last five years and collecting data going forward will increase the power for this population.

Of the 500 patients, only 6 (1.2%) had diagnoses that should preferably have been made on the initial day of evaluation, leading to immediate treatment. Three of those patients had acute perforated appendicitis, one patient had an incarcerated ventral hernia without gangrene, one patient had an incarcerated umbilical hernia without gangrene, and another patient had intestinal adhesions with obstruction, but also without gangrene. After recovering from their operations, these patients were discharged from the hospital without complications.

### Potential for error when relying on administrative data [^3feefb5b]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Of 1 362 440 patients whose records were examined, 41 703 had a hernia diagnosis based on encounter ICD-10 diagnostic coding (Fig. 1). Of these patients, 28 555 (68%) had corresponding imaging records available. Based on ICD-10 diagnostic codes for outpatient encounters there were: 12 819 (45%) diaphragmatic hernias, 6979 (24%) ventral hernias, and 8757 (31%) inguinal hernias. Imaging verified the presence of hernia in 10 234 cases, yielding a true positive rate of 368% for the diagnosis. Diaphragmatic hernias were verified in 34% of cases labelled as such in clinic encounters, versus 44% for ventral hernias and 32% for inguinal hernias (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Flow diagram of the clinic encounter ICD coding validated by imaging database

These findings show a very high error rate when assuming a disease entity is present based on ambulatory billing codes found in administrative records. This probably results from clinicians coding visit diagnoses based on a clinical problem being considered, irrespective of its actual presence. For example, if a patient is referred for groin pain because of a possible hernia, the visit will be coded as ‘hernia’ until the diagnosis is ruled out. Although subsequent visits may refine the diagnosis, the erroneous diagnosis remains in the record when retrospectively analysed.

These findings highlight a fundamental weakness in using administrative data for disease identification. Encounter coding occurs because a diagnosis is considered and not necessarily proven. We found that reliance on billing codes for hernia identification could result in two-thirds of cases being erroneously identified. This issue extends beyond hernia, highlighting a serious limitation in using administrative data for clinical research. Validation of coding accuracy against actual disease presence is essential before assuming diagnosis validity.

### Frequency of potentially avoidable surgical referrals for asymptomatic umbilical hernias in children [^b2b351a7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Association of Pediatrics released guidelines in 2019 recommending delay of surgical referral in children with asymptomatic umbilical hernias until 4-5 y of age. The purpose of this study was to assess contemporary rates of potentially avoidable referrals in this cohort of children, and to assess whether rates have decreased following guideline release.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of umbilical hernias referrals evaluated at a single pediatric surgery clinic from October 2014 to August 2021. Potentially avoidable referrals (PAR) were defined as asymptomatic, non-enlarging umbilical hernia referrals in a child 3 y of age or younger without a history of incarceration. Referral indication, disposition following clinic visit, and rates of PAR were compared before and after guideline release.

Results

A total of 803 umbilical hernia referrals were evaluated, of which 48% were in children 3 y of age or younger at time of evaluation ("early" referrals). 33% of all referrals and 68% of early referrals were categorized as a PAR, and rates were similar before and after guideline release (all referrals: 32% versus 33%, P = 0.94; early referrals: 68% versus 67%, P = 0.94). Of the 333 early referrals who were managed expectantly per guideline recommendations, 2 (0.6%) developed incarceration which was managed with successful reduction and interval repair.

Conclusions

One-third of all referrals for umbilical hernia evaluation are potentially avoidable, and this rate did not change following release of American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Aligning expectations between surgeons and referring providers through improved education and guideline dissemination may reduce avoidable visits, lost caregiver productivity, and exposure to potentially avoidable surgery.

### Routine pediatric surgical emergencies: incidence, morbidity, and mortality during the 1st 8000 days of life – A narrative review [^afe6f7ea]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Incarcerated hernias

Abdominal wall hernias are another common cause of intestinal obstruction in LMICs, as loops of intestine can become trapped, incarcerated, and subsequently strangulated within these abdominal wall defects.

Umbilical hernias are especially common in Africa. Umbilical hernias can occur in 91% of children 5 years or younger and 46% of children who are 10–15-year-old. In the United States, umbilical hernias occur in 40–60% of infants and only 4% remain present after the age of 5, while the remaining spontaneously close. In general, umbilical hernias should be repaired by 5 years of age if the defect does not obliterate spontaneously. In single center studies, incarceration from an umbilical hernia can occur in 37–44% of patients presenting to the hospital with symptoms.

In Africa, inguinal hernias are present in 1–5% of children overall and in 35% of premature babies. In the United States, the condition has a similar prevalence of 1–5% in children overall and a lower prevalence at 9–11% in premature infants. Similar incidence rates exist in Asia, where inguinal hernias occur in 6.6% of males and 0.7% of females in a nationwide Taiwanese population study. Given the heightened risk of incarceration, early elective herniotomy is the treatment of choice after diagnosis of a reducible inguinal hernia.

Elective herniotomy is usually a short outpatient case and is extremely cost-effective. However, surgical backlog or compromised access to surgical care frequently prevents timely repair of these defects, which leads to a high incidence of incarcerated and strangulated hernias in LMICs. In a Nigerian study, obstructed hernias made up 14.8% of all abdominal surgical emergencies, ranking third after typhoid ileal perforation and intussusception. Inadequate surgical capacity to accommodate elective cases prevents early surgical correction of this common condition, leading to preventable morbidity that necessitates emergent repair.

### Association between high deductible health plan coverage and age at pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^dcc74240]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

This study was limited primarily by a lack of availability of some important data within the Marketscan database. Clinical data such as severity and frequency of symptoms at presentation, ease of reduction, size of the fascial defect, progression over time, and other important clinical details were not available, although these factors likely would not differ across groups defined by commercial health insurance plan type. As in any administrative database, there was also likely some degree of miscoding of diagnoses and procedures. However, per the specifications of the data use agreement, we were unfortunately unable to identify patients to conduct chart review validation. We were also unable to evaluate patient-level socioeconomic status or race/ethnicity and therefore could not investigate how our findings differed according to these factors. While we did not find an association between HDHP status and the avoidance of early UHR, it is possible that there may be such an association among lower income or racial/ethnic minority families, who are often less able to bear the burden of high cost-sharing. We were, however, able to evaluate median income and racial/ethnic distribution at the MSA/year level. At this level, we found that median household income among families with children and the percentage of non-Hispanic white children increased with increasing HDHP prevalence. Since both factors are associated with higher healthcare use in general,they were used as exogenous variables in our instrumental variable analysis. However, future studies that account for patient-level socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity would be valuable. Unfortunately, we were also not able to assess surgeon preferences or practice patterns in this study because the majority of the included cases (>60%) lacked a surgeon national provider identifier in the database that could be used to track how often a particular surgeon had performed UHR in children under 4 years of age or what proportion of children of different ages who had consulted with a particular surgeon about UHR then proceeded to undergo the procedure. Future studies that evaluate the relative importance of parent, surgeon, and primary care physician preferences on age at pediatric UHR would be valuable. Last, our inclusion criterion requiring MSAs to have no more than 10% missing data on health plan type in any year of the study period resulted in the exclusion of 36 MSAs (representing 2170 patients). Although this is a sizeable number, the remaining included MSAs still represented a large and geographically diverse population across 35 states. We did not use multiple imputation to impute missing health plan type because, unfortunately, the Marketscan database lacks the information needed to accurately impute this, especially employer IDs and data on the types of health plans offered by employers in a given year.

### Factors associated with long-term outcomes of umbilical hernia repair [^6c2c2659]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Umbilical hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed general surgical procedures. However, there is little consensus about the factors that lead to umbilical hernia recurrence.

Objective

To better understand the factors associated with long-term umbilical hernia recurrence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cohort of 332 military veteran patients who underwent umbilical hernia repair was studied between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2008, at the VA Boston Healthcare System. Recurrence and mortality outcomes were tracked from that period until June 1, 2014. Data were collected on patient characteristics, operative, and postoperative factors and univariate and multivariable analyses were used to assess which factors were significantly associated with umbilical hernia recurrence and mortality. All patients with primary umbilical hernia repair, with or without a concurrent unrelated procedure, were included in the study. Patients excluded were those who underwent umbilical hernia repair as a part of another major planned procedure with abdominal incisions. Data were collected from June 1, 2014, to November 1, 2015. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2, 2015, to April 1, 2016.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary study outcomes were umbilical hernia recurrence and death.

Results

Of the 332 patients in this study, 321 (96.7%) were male, mean age was 58.4 years, and mean (SD) time of follow-up was 8.5 (4.1) years. The hernia recurrence rate was 6.0% (n=20) at a mean 3.1 years after index repair (median, 1.0-year; range, 0.33-13 years). The primary suture repair recurrence rate was 9.8% (16 of 163 patients), and the mesh repair recurrence rate was 2.4% (4 of 169 patients). On univariate analysis, ascites (P=.02), liver disease (P=.02), diabetes (P=.04), and primary suture (nonmesh) repairs (P=.04) were significantly associated with increased recurrence rates. Patients who had a history of hernias (125 [39%]) were less likely to have umbilical hernia recurrences (χ21=4.65, P=.03). On multivariable regression analysis, obesity and ascites were associated with significantly increased odds ratios of recurrence of 3.3 (95% CI, 1.0-10.1) and 8.0 (95% CI, 1.8-34.4), respectively. Mesh repair was seen to decrease recurrence with odds of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.08-0.95). There was no significant difference in complication rates between mesh repair and primary suture repair. The survival rate was 73% (n=242) at the end of the study. Factors associated with mortality were older age, smoking, liver disease, ascites, emergency or semiurgent repair, and need for intraoperative bowel resection.

Conclusions and Relevance

Ascites, liver disease, diabetes, obesity, and primary suture repair without mesh are associated with increased umbilical hernia recurrence rates. Elective umbilical hernia repair with mesh should be considered in patients with multiple comorbidities given that the use of mesh offers protection from recurrence without major morbidity.

### Mesh versus suture repair of umbilical hernia in adults: a randomised, double-blind, controlled, multicentre trial [^a16da483]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both mesh and suture repair are used for the treatment of umbilical hernias, but for smaller umbilical hernias (diameter 1-4 cm) there is little evidence whether mesh repair would be beneficial. In this study we aimed to investigate whether use of a mesh was better in reducing recurrence compared with suture repair for smaller umbilical hernias.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, controlled multicentre trial in 12 hospitals (nine in the Netherlands, two in Germany, and one in Italy). Eligible participants were adults aged at least 18 years with a primary umbilical hernia of diameter 1-4 cm, and were randomly assigned (1:1) intraoperatively to either suture repair or mesh repair. In the first 3 years of the inclusion period, blocked randomisation (of non-specified size) was achieved by an envelope randomisation system; after this time computer-generated randomisation was introduced. Patients, investigators, and analysts were masked to the allocated treatment, and participants were stratified by hernia size (1-2 cm and >2-4 cm). At study initiation, all surgeons were invited to training sessions to ensure they used the same standardised techniques for suture repair or mesh repair. Patients underwent physical examinations at 2 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24-30 months after the operation. The primary outcome was the rate of recurrences of the umbilical hernia after 24 months assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population by physical examination and, in case of any doubt, abdominal ultrasound. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789230.

Findings

Between June 21, 2006, and April 16, 2014, we randomly assigned 300 patients, 150 to mesh repair and 150 to suture repair. The median follow-up was 25·1 months (IQR 15·5-33·4). After a maximum follow-up of 30 months, there were fewer recurrences in the mesh group than in the suture group (six [4%] in 146 patients vs 17 [12%] in 138 patients; 2-year actuarial estimates of recurrence 3·6% [95% CI 1·4-9·4] vs 11·4% (6·8-18·9); p=0·01, hazard ratio 0·31, 95% CI 0·12-0·80, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 12·8). The most common postoperative complications were seroma (one [<1%] in the suture group vs five [3%] in the mesh group), haematoma (two [1%] vs three [2%]), and wound infection (one [<1%] vs three [2%]). There were no anaesthetic complications or postoperative deaths.

Interpretation

This is the first study showing high level evidence for mesh repair in patients with small hernias of diameter 1-4 cm. Hence we suggest mesh repair should be used for operations on all patients with an umbilical hernia of this size.

### Development and multicentre validation of the FLEX score: personalised preoperative surgical risk prediction using attention-based ICD-10 and current procedural terminology set embeddings [^0b7cec0b]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Example patients

To demonstrate the clinical implementation of FLEX, we defined five hypothetical example patients; Supplementary Table S8 reports their characteristics, procedures with CPT codes, comorbidities with ICD-10 codes, FLEX-predicted risk of adverse postoperative outcomes, and HFRS. Supplementary Table S9 reports attention weights for each CPT and ICD-10 code in these five patients, along with the impact of each code on the four predicted outcomes.

Patient 1: A 75-yr-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and history of multiple falls presents with a closed loop small bowel obstruction. She is taken to the operating room for an urgent exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection. FLEX predicted 2.7% probability of 30-day mortality, 34.1% probability of 30-day readmission, 63.1% probability of discharge to long-term care, and a hospital stay of 8.8 days. Attention weights identified closed loop small bowel obstruction as the most impactful diagnosis. The patient's history of multiple falls was associated with increased risk of discharge to long-term care.

Patient 2: A 73-yr-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes presents with a symptomatic reducible ventral hernia. She undergoes elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with mesh. FLEX predicted 0.24% probability of 30-day mortality, 7.0% probability of 30-day readmission, 6.2% probability of discharge to long-term care, and a hospital stay of 1.7 days. Attention weights identified ventral hernia as the most impactful diagnosis, associated with reduced risk of discharge to long-term care. The hernia repair was associated with reduced risk of readmission, discharge to long-term care, and shorter hospital length of stay. The diagnosis of heart failure was associated with increased risk of all four adverse outcomes.

### Association between high deductible health plan coverage and age at pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^08c2107a]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

The study cohort consisted of 8601 children. Table 1 shows the characteristics of these children at the time of their UHR, overall and in groups defined by HDHP versus non-HDHP insurance coverage. The median age was 5 years in both groups, and no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the outcomes of interest, namely, being less than 4 years of age or being greater than 5 years of age at the time of UHR. However, geographical region, metropolitan area size, and year were all found to be associated with HDHP status. No association was found between having a chronic condition or undergoing a concurrent surgical procedure at the time of UHR and HDHP status.

Table 2 shows that there were no associations between our instrumental variable and patient sex, whether any chronic condition was present, or whether any concurrent surgical procedure was performed. Thus, these characteristics among children undergoing UHR did not vary across metropolitan areas according to these areas’ rates of HDHP coverage among privately insured children. However, some population-level characteristics of metropolitan areas did vary across quartiles of the instrument. Namely, the MSA/year-level median household income among families with children and the percentage of children of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity both increased with increasing quartiles of the instrument. As expected, the percentage of included children who had HDHP coverage increased with increasing quartiles of the instrument. An F test from the first-stage model also demonstrated the strength of the instrument, as the instrument contributed significantly to the instrumental variable model (F 1,8031 =189.49, p<0.001).

Two-stage least squares regression analysis incorporating the instrument demonstrated no significant association between HDHP coverage and the probability of a child undergoing UHR at an age less than 4 years, with the difference in this probability being 2.4% (–13.0% to 17.7%, p=0.76). Similarly, two-stage least squares regression analysis incorporating the same instrument demonstrated no significant association between HDHP coverage and the probability of a child undergoing UHR at an age greater than 5 years, with the difference in this probability being 1.4% (–15.7% to –18.5%, p=0.87). The results of both analyses were similar when they were restricted to children who were 10 years of age or younger at the time of their surgery (table 3).

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Is laparoscopic repair of incarcerated abdominal hernias safe? Analysis of short-term outcomes [^b33d9b97]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of literature surrounding the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic repair for acutely incarcerated abdominal hernias. The objective of this study was to compare the 30-day morbidity and mortality between laparoscopic and open repairs of incarcerated abdominal hernias.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the National Surgery Quality Improvement Program from 2005 to 2012. The study population was selected using ICD-9 diagnostic codes describing abdominal hernias with obstruction, but without gangrene. Cases with documented bowel resection were excluded. Group classification was based on CPT coding. Study outcomes included the 30-day major complication, reoperation and mortality rates. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounding for all study outcomes.

Results

A total of 2688 and 15,562 patients were in the laparoscopic and open group, respectively. After adjustment for clinically relevant confounders, laparoscopic surgery was associated with a significantly lower 30-day infectious (OR 0.36, p < 0.001, 95 % CI 0.23-0.56) and serious complication rates (OR 0.66, p < 0.001, 95 % CI 0.55-0.80). However, there was no statistical difference with respect to the 30-day reoperation (OR 0.81, p = 0.28, 95 % CI 0.56-1.18) or mortality rates (OR 0.94, p = 0.80, 95 % CI 0.58-1.53).

Conclusions

Patients with incarcerated abdominal hernias who underwent laparoscopic repair had a significantly lower 30-day morbidity compared to patients with open repair. Although the 30-day reoperation and mortality rates were also lower, there was no statistically significant difference. Laparoscopic surgery appears to be safe in the management of select incarcerated abdominal hernias.

### Positive predictive value of, and, codes for identification of congenital heart defects [^589039dc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHDs) beyond the first year of life varies across the United States, depending on the data source, case definition, and methods used by investigators.Public health surveillance to determine disease prevalence and long‐term outcomes for this population often relies on large administrative and electronic health record data sets from various sources, including publicly available national data sets, employer health plan data (eg, MarketScan), electronic medical records (eMRs), and billing data from hospital systems and government agencies.The reliability of CHD case detection in eMR and administrative data depends on the accuracy of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) diagnosis code documentation in patient records.Identifying CHD cases by ICD‐9‐CM / ICD‐10‐CM codes may be prone to errors from misspecification, upcoding, rule‐out codes, and other issues that contribute to false‐positive (FP) and false‐negative classifications.CHD studies often use ICD‐9‐CM and ICD‐10‐CM code groups, 745.xx to 747.xx (63 codes) and Q20.x to Q26.x (73 codes), respectively, to define a CHD cohort.Some of the codes in this group, however, represent gastrointestinal tract, renal, spinal, extremity, umbilical artery, and other noncardiac vascular anomalies. ICD‐10‐CM relocated many noncardiac vascular anomalies into groups Q27.x and Q28.x, but nonspecific CHD codes remain within Q20.x to Q26.x. In addition, some codes intended to represent CHD lack diagnostic specificity and have resulted in poor positive predictive values (PPVs) for true CHD identification.,,,,For example, ICD‐9‐CM code 745.5, which represents both secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO), had a PPV of only 23.7% in an adolescent and adult population.Exclusion of code 745.5 and CHD codes categorized as “other” increased PPV of CHD codes by >10 percentage points to 86.5%but at the expense of losing an estimated 24% of true CHD cases with code 745.5 in an administrative data set.

Figure 2. 
Cumulative Incidence of Operative Recurrence Following Ventral or Incisional Subtype Hernia Repairs Only and Umbilical Hernia Subtype Repairs Only, Stratified by Approach (Robotic-Assisted, Laparoscopic, and Open) From 2010-2020

Cumulative incidence of operative hernia recurrence following ventral or incisional (A) and umbilical (B) hernia repair was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for patient age, sex, race and ethnicity, Elixhauser comorbidities, year of surgery, approach (robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, or open), mesh use, the use of myofascial flap, and hernia subtype (ventral/incisional or umbilical). Analysis included use of an instrumental variable to reduce measured and unmeasured confounding. The instrument used was robotic-assisted ventral hernia repair use rate within a hospital referral region in the 12 months prior to a patient’s initial ventral hernia repair. 95% CIs are not visible as the largest interval was −0.18% to 0.18% from point estimates for ventral and incisional subtype hernias and −0.14% to 0.14% from point estimates for umbilical-subtype hernias.

### Laparoscopic versus open anterior abdominal wall hernia repair: 30-day morbidity and mortality using the ACS-NSQIP database [^0a1bdcbe]. Annals of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare short-term outcomes after laparoscopic and open abdominal wall hernia repair.

Methods

Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database (2005-2009), 71,054 patients who underwent an abdominal wall hernia repair were identified (17% laparoscopic, 83% open). Laparoscopic and open techniques were compared. Regression models and nonparametric 1:1 matching algorithms were used to minimize the influence of treatment selection bias. The association between surgical approach and risk-adjusted adverse event rates after abdominal wall hernia repair was determined. Subgroup analysis was performed between inpatient/outpatient surgery, strangulated/reducible, and initial/recurrent hernias as well as between umbilical, incisional and other ventral hernias.

Results

Patients undergoing laparoscopic repair were less likely to experience an overall morbidity (6.0% vs. 3.8%; odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.68) or a serious morbidity (2.5% vs. 1.6%; OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.71) compared to open repair. Analysis using multivariate adjustment and patient matching showed similar findings. Mortality rates were the same. Laparoscopically repaired strangulated and recurrent hernias, had a significantly lower overall morbidity (4.7% vs. 8.1%, P < 0.0001 and 4.1% vs. 12.2%, P < 0.0001, respectively). Significantly lower overall morbidity was also noted for the laparoscopic approach when the hernias were categorized into umbilical (1.9% vs. 3.0%, P = 0.009), ventral (3.9% vs. 6.3%, P < 0.0001), and incisional (4.3% vs. 9.1%, P < 0.0001). No differences were noted between laparoscopic and open repairs in patients undergoing outpatient surgery, when the hernias were reducible.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic hernia repair is infrequently used and associated with lower 30-day morbidity, particularly when hernias are complicated.

### ECMO utilization in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia in the USA [^26fd7a2c]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Study population

Hospitalization records for infants <28 days old with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis code for CDH (ICD, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 756.6 or V13.67, or ICD, 10th Revision, CM (ICD-10-CM) codes Q79 or Z87.738) listed as any 1 of the 15 diagnoses on the discharge record were selected for inclusion. Only the patients <28 days of age on admission were included in order to select for initial postnatal hospitalizations. Afterwards, those infants who were transferred to another institution were excluded to eliminate double counting of infants who were born at one institution and then transferred out for a higher level of care. Infants with CDH then were classified based on whether they were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ICD-9-CM codes 39.65 or V15.87, or ICD-10-CM codes 5A15223 or Z92.8) or not. Patient demographics, such as year of birth, birth weight category, gender, race/ethnicity, payer type and mortality, were collected as categorical variables. ‘In-hospital birth’ was defined as infants receiving ECMO care in the same hospital as where the neonate was born, as opposed to infants who were transferred after birth for higher level of care. The total cost of initial neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization was included as a linear variable. Hospital characteristics included hospital US census region (Northeast, Midwest, South or West)(figure 1), hospital location (urban vs rural), teaching or non-teaching status and bed size. The urban/rural designation was determined by the Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA).Hospitals residing in counties with a CBSA type of ‘metropolitan’ were considered urban, whereas hospitals with a CBSA type of ‘micropolitan’ or non-core were classified as rural. A hospital is considered a teaching hospital if it has one or more Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved residency programs, is a member of the Council of Teaching Hospitalsor has a ratio of full-time equivalent interns and residents to beds of 0.25 or higher. Bedsize categories are based on the number of hospital beds and are specific to the hospital’s location and teaching status. Bedsize assesses the number of short-term acute care beds set up and staffed in a hospital. Hospital information was obtained from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals.We collected information on the clinical risk factor of pneumothorax. (ICD-9-CM 512.81 or ICD-10-CM J93.9). Due to data use retractions or incompleteness of hospitalization records, some variables had missing information.

### Coding update of the SMFM definition of low risk for cesarean delivery from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM [^9ece1f72]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2015, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine developed a low risk for cesarean delivery definition based on administrative claims-based diagnosis codes described by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition is a clinical enrichment of 2 available measures from the Joint Commission and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine measure excludes diagnosis codes that represent clinically relevant risk factors that are absolute or relative contraindications to vaginal birth while retaining diagnosis codes such as labor disorders that are discretionary risk factors for cesarean delivery. The introduction of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification in October 2015 expanded the number of available diagnosis codes and enabled a greater depth and breadth of clinical description. These coding improvements further enhance the clinical validity of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition and its potential utility in tracking progress toward the goal of safely lowering the US cesarean delivery rate. This report updates the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine definition of low risk for cesarean delivery using International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification coding.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in outcomes among newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia [^24fa7c86]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design, Setting, Participants

This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study using demographic, clinical, and outcome data from the Children’s Hospital Association Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). The PHIS database contains administrative and billing data from 49 children’s hospitals in the US.Data quality and reliability are assured by the Children’s Hospital Association, participating institutions, and Truven Health Analytics. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis and procedure codes were used to identify patient-level data.

Institutional review board approval was obtained at Johns Hopkins University and exemption of patient consent was granted. Review board approval was deemed exempt at Yale University because the data was publicly available and deidentified. The PHIS database was queried for patients with CDH using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnoses codes between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2020. Patients were included if they were admitted on day of life 0 and underwent surgical repair of their diaphragmatic hernia (ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes, eTable in Supplement 1). Patients who did not undergo surgical repair and those with missing race and ethnicity data were excluded from analysis. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

### European hernia society guidelines on management of rectus diastasis [^35aca048]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

KQ8 What is the optimal treatment of rectus diastasis with concomitant umbilical or epigastric hernias?

Statement: Mesh-based repair is recommended according to the European Hernia Society and Americas Hernia Society Guidelines for Treatment of Umbilical and Epigastric Hernias. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath may be sufficient to repair the smallest (less than 1 cm) umbilical or epigastric hernias. Other approaches have been reported. The endoscopic subcutaneous dissection followed by linea alba plication with an onlay mesh was the most reported technique.

Recommendation: A mesh-based repair of RD with concomitant midline hernias is suggested. Plication of the linea alba may be sufficient to repair a diastasis associated with small (less than 1 cm) umbilical/epigastric hernias.

Quality of evidence: Low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

KQ9 Is there a role for specific postoperative management of RD repair?

Statement: Abdominal binders appear to aid mobilization, and reduce postoperative pain and psychological stress. They have no effect on seroma formation or pulmonary function. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme is used worldwide.

Recommendation: As a clinical expertise guidance, the use of an abdominal binder in the postoperative period can be suggested. The noted advantages of reduced pain, enhanced mobilization, and their perceived psychological support after surgery, make their contribution modest but of value. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme can be recommended.

Quality of evidence: Very low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

### Association between high deductible health plan coverage and age at pediatric umbilical hernia repair [^214c37be]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

High deductible health plans (HDHPs) are associated with the avoidance of both necessary and unnecessary healthcare. Umbilical hernia repair (UHR) is a procedure that is frequently unnecessarily performed in young children, contrary to best practice guidelines. We hypothesized that children with HDHPs, as compared with other types of commercial health plans, are less likely to undergo UHR before 4 years of age but are also more likely to have UHR delayed beyond 5 years of age.

Methods

Children aged 0–18 years old residing in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) who underwent UHR in 2012–2019 were identified in the IBM Marketscan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. A quasi-experimental study design using MSA/year-level HDHP prevalence among children as an instrumental variable was employed to account for selection bias in HDHP enrollment. Two-stage least squares regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between HDHP coverage and age at UHR.

Results

A total of 8601 children were included (median age 5 years, IQR 3–7). Univariable analysis revealed no differences between the HDHP and non-HDHP groups in the likelihood of UHR being performed before 4 years of age (27.7% vs 28.7%, p=0.37) or after 5 years of age (39.8% vs 38.9%, p=0.52). Geographical region, metropolitan area size, and year were associated with HDHP enrollment. Instrumental variable analysis demonstrated no association between HDHP coverage and undergoing UHR at <4 years of age (p=0.76) or >5 years of age (p=0.87).

Conclusions

HDHP coverage is not associated with age at pediatric UHR. Future studies should investigate other means by which UHRs in young children can be avoided.

Results

Case selection

A total of 4832 records from MCA and 5211 records from MCB were included in the study and analysed in a parallel manner (table 2). On average, the ICD-9-CM subsets had more codes per record than the ICD-10-CM subsets: 8.9 versus 8.4 and 12.5 versus 12.3 in the MCA and MCB datasets, respectively. In the MCA dataset, 657 and 659 dually coded records had a principal diagnosis from the list of nature-of-injury codes shown in table 1, using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM, respectively. In the MCB dataset, the corresponding numbers were 537 and 544 records, respectively.

Table 2 
Sample selection and characteristics of the Clinical Modification of the 9th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)/Clinical Modification of the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD-10-CM) dually coded datasets

In the MCA dataset, five records had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas seven records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). In the MCB dataset, one record had an ICD-9-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-10-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code, whereas eight records had an ICD-10-CM injury code as the principal diagnosis, but the ICD-9-CM principal diagnosis was not an injury code (table 3). Specifically, the ICD-10-CM case definition for injury has been slightly expanded by the NCHS, such that initial encounters for periprosthetic fractures around internal prosthetic joints (T84.04 before 10/01/2016; M97 thereafter) and encounters for injuries and abuse complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (O9A.2-O9A.5) are now included.These expansions accounted for 9 of the additional 15 records that were selected as injuries based only on ICD-10-CM diagnoses, whereas the exclusion of subsequent encounters from the ICD-10-CM case definition accounted for five of the six records selected based only on ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

### A risk model and cost analysis of incisional hernia after elective, abdominal surgery based upon 12, 373 cases: the case for targeted prophylactic intervention [^a2dc9259]. Annals of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data Collection

Data pertaining to demographic information, medical history, and admitting diagnosis were obtained by querying the electronic medical record. Comorbidities were defined according to the Elixhauser index (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality classifications),and body mass index (kg/m 2) was coded according to the World Health Organization classification (see Supplemental Digital Content 1).Cardiovascular disease was defined by the presence of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or congestive heart failure. Pulmonary disease included history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or chronic respiratory failure, or ventilator dependence. Renal disease was defined by acute or chronic renal failure requiring dialysis, and liver disease included a documented history of cirrhosis, ascites, or varices.

Patients were categorized by operative characteristics, according to the primary index operation as gastric, hepatobiliary, spleen, bowel, or gynecologic surgery (see Supplemental Digital Content 2). Gastric surgery was further subclassified as partial gastrectomy, total gastrectomy, or bariatric surgery. Bowel surgery was subdivided into small bowel and large bowel procedures, with large bowel procedures further classified into total colectomy, partial colectomy, and proctectomy. These subclassifications were not considered mutually exclusive; as such, patients undergoing multiple procedures across groups were treated similarly as those undergoing procedures in 1 group only. History of abdominal surgery was noted, as was active acute gastrointestinal inflammatory process and disseminated systemic infection. Prior surgical complications were recorded as well, including history of superficial wound infection, wound dehiscence, abscess, seroma, hematoma, postoperative wound bleeding, enterocutaneous fistula, and small bowel obstruction (see Supplemental Digital Content 3).

The primary outcome of interest was surgical reoperation for postoperative IH defined by both International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis and procedure codes for hernia. This endpoint was chosen because it was the most reliable indicator for the presence of a true IH, defined as an abdominal wall fascial defect occurring at a prior laparotomy incision site. Patients with a prior diagnosis of IH or those who underwent IH repair before or concurrently with the index procedure were excluded from analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to IH repair, incidence of reoperation, and additional postoperative surgical complications, defined as superficial wound cellulitis, deep-space infection, wound dehiscence, seroma, hematoma, acute wound bleeding, enterocutaneous fistula, sepsis, and small bowel obstruction.

One solution to make this transition easier is to take a cue from the Commission on Cancer and use synoptic operative reporting, in which a series of discrete fields are answered as part of the operative note.This is used to ensure all essential elements are included in each operative report. A well-written statement of increased complexity can be included to justify modifier-22 and decrease denials.

Hernia size should be measured prior to operation/dissection and may be reported from a CT scan. Multiple defects<10 cm apart should all be measured as a single defect. If10 cm apart, the individual hernia diameters should be summed. The incarcerated/strangulated codes should be used for multiple hernias if one or more are incarcerated/strangulated and the recurrent code should be used if one or more of the hernias are recurrent. If no size is documented, the smallest size code is used.

Recent CMS changes affecting professional coding and billing for MDs and APPs

For documentation, coding and billing, critical care is care rendered to critically ill or injured patients under specific conditions. Trauma and acute care providers provide significant amounts of critical care and managing a variety of seriously ill and injured patients and are able to generate significant charges for that work.Much of that care may qualify for time-based critical care CPT Evaluation and Management (E&M) codes 99291 and 99292. 99291 has a wRVU value of 4.5, the highest wRVU for any E&M code.

### WSES guidelines for emergency repair of complicated abdominal wall hernias [^98f46ecb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A large number of abdominal hernias require emergency surgery. However, these procedures are associated with poor prognoses and a higher rate of post-operative complications.

A World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Consensus Conference was held in Bergamo on July 2013, during the 2 nd Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery with the goal of defining recommendations for emergency repair of abdominal wall hernias in adults. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference approved by a WSES expert panel.

Abdominal hernias may be classified as groin hernias (femoral and inguinal) and ventral hernias (umbilical, epigastric, spigelian and incisional).

An incarcerated hernia may be defined as a hernia in which the contents have become irreducible due to a narrow opening in the abdominal wall or adhesions within the cavity. Intestinal obstruction can complicate an incarcerated hernia. In contrast, a strangulated hernia is one in which the blood supply to the contents of the hernia (eg omentum, bowel) s becomes compromised.

Strangulated hernias remain a significant challenge, as they are sometimes difficult to diagnose purely by physical examination yet require urgent surgical intervention. Early surgical intervention of a strangulated hernia with obstruction is crucial as delayed diagnosis can lead to bowel resection with longer recovery and its attendant complications. Strangulated hernias can have serious deleterious effects such as, bowel obstruction, bacterial translocation, and intestinal wall necrosis (potentially resulting in bowel perforation). It poses a significant risk to emergency hernia repair, as there is an increased incidence of surgical field contamination, leading to high rates of post-operative infection and probably recurrence.

Bacteria inherently colonize all surgical wounds, but only a fraction of these contaminates ultimately lead to infection. In most patients infection does not occur because innate host defences are able to eliminate microbes at the surgical site. However, there is some evidence that the implantation of foreign materials, such as prosthetic mesh, may lead to a decreased threshold for infection.

### Update of the international herniaSurge guidelines for groin hernia management [^5879868a]. BJS Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to terminology, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use the following terminology for groin hernias:
|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
|Acutely irreducible hernia|- A hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination but were previously reducible before the acute onset of symptoms|
|Chronically irreducible hernia|- A long-standing hernia in which the contents cannot be reduced on physical examination and is not associated with sudden onset of new symptoms|
|Strangulated hernia|- A hernia with strangulated content which can only be described as such after the diagnosis is confirmed by preoperative imaging or intraoperative findings.|

### A pitfall of using general equivalence mappings to estimate national trends of surgical utilization for pediatric patients [^cb686f9e]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

General equivalence mappings (GEMs) were developed to facilitate a transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Validation of GEMs is suggested as coding errors have been reported for adult populations. The purpose of this study was to illustrate limitations of the GEMs for pediatric surgical procedures.

Methods

Using the 2014 to 2016 National Inpatient Sample, we evaluated all patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. ICD-9 codes for the repair were independently classified as laparoscopic or open approach by two surgeons. Conversions of the ICD-9 to ICD-10 codes were compared between the GEMs strategy and surgeons' manual mapping. National trends were compared for overall, adult, and pediatric populations.

Results

We found significant inconsistencies in the proportion of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair based on mapping strategies employed. For adults, the comparison of the proportions in 2016 was 17.79% (GEMs) versus 21.44% (Manual). In pediatric population, the contrast was 0.45% (GEMs) versus 17.75% (Manual), and no laparoscopic repair cases were found using GEMs in the last quarter of 2015.

Conclusion

Some conversions of ICD-9 and ICD-10 using the current GEMs are not valid for certain populations and procedures. Clinical validation of coding conversions is essential.

Level Of Evidence

Level V.

### Trends and predictors of laparoscopic bilateral inguinal hernia repair in Spain: a population-based study [^021db279]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

We conducted a retrospective observational study using the Hospital Discharge Registry of the Spanish Ministry of Health (Registro de Actividad de Atención Especializada-Conjunto Mínimo Básico de Datos, RAE-CMBD). The RAE-CMBD collects the healthcare activity of all public and private hospitals in the country.

Since 2016, the RAE-CMDB has collected 20 diagnoses and 20 procedures for each patient based on the International Classification of Diseases Version 10 (ICD-10).

Study population

The study population includes patients who underwent a bilateral inguinal hernia repair procedure in the Spanish National Health System hospitals from 2016 to 2019.

Inclusion criteria: (1) Patients with primary and recurrent bilateral inguinal hernia repair procedure and(2) Age over 14 years.

Exclusion criteria: (1) Manual reduction of the hernia.

The flowchart (Fig. 1) shows the ICD-10 diagnosis codes used to identify patients.

Fig. 1 
Case Selection Flow Chart IHR: Inguinal hernia repair IDC-10: 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases

Variables analyzed

Demographic characteristics and comorbidities

Demographic and clinical data included age, sex, and region of residence. We identified comorbidities at hospital admission for each patient. To identify specific comorbidities, we used the ICD-10 diagnosis codes described by Quan et al. ICD-10 codes for comorbidities are presented in the supplementary material.

We analyzed the rate of utilization of laparoscopy according to geographic distribution. Spain is divided into 19 territorial entities called Autonomous Communities, the first political and administrative division level.

Hospital characteristics

We analyzed the distribution of high-utilization hospitals (defined as laparoscopy utilization in BIHR of 50% or higher) in Autonomous Communities. The laparoscopy utilization rate by Hospital Volume (defined as BIHR performed in one year) was also analyzed.

Characteristics of the hernia and surgery

The hernia characteristics collected were recurrence and complicated hernia (obstruction or gangrene). The surgical approach used was described as open or laparoscopic. In addition, the type of admission for surgery was identified as inpatient o outpatient.

Outcomes and perioperative complications

The variables analyzed were hospital stay and perioperative complications such as bleeding, hematoma and seroma, pulmonary complication, cardiac complication, renal complication, urinary retention and infection, paralytic ileus, and visceral and vascular injuries. We used the POA-N (not present at admission) indicator to identify perioperative complications during hospitalization. ICD-10 codes for perioperative complications are presented in the supplementary material.

### Association between high-deductible health plans and hernia acuity [^8c8465fa]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

About half of people younger than 65 years with private insurance are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). While these plans entail substantially higher out-of-pocket costs for patients with chronic medical conditions who require ongoing care, their effect on patients undergoing surgery who require acute care is poorly understood. It is plausible that higher out-of-pocket costs may lead to delays in care and more complex surgical conditions.

Objective

To determine the association between enrollment in HDHPs and presentation with incarcerated or strangulated hernia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort analysis included privately insured patients aged 18 to 63 years from a large commercial insurance claims database who underwent a ventral or groin hernia operation from January 2016 through June 2019 and classified their coverage as either a traditional health plan or an HDHP per the Internal Revenue Service's definition. Multivariable regression, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, was used to examine the association between enrollment in an HDHP and the primary outcome of presentation with an incarcerated or strangulated hernia.

Exposures

Traditional health plan vs HDHP.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of an incarcerated or strangulated hernia per International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes.

Results

Among 83 281 patients (71.9% men and 28.1% women; mean [SD] age, 48.7 [10.9] years) who underwent hernia surgery, 27 477 (33.0%) were enrolled in an HDHP and 21 876 (26.2%) had a hernia that was coded as incarcerated or strangulated. The mean annual deductible was considerably higher for those in the HDHP group than their traditional health plan counterparts (unadjusted mean [SD], $3635 [$2094] vs $705 [$737]; adjusted, -$2931; P<.001). Patients in the HDHP group were more likely to present with an incarcerated or strangulated hernia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.11; P<.001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, enrollment in an HDHP was associated with higher odds of presenting with an incarcerated or strangulated hernia, which is more likely to require emergency surgery that precludes medical optimization. These data suggest that, among patients with groin and ventral hernias, enrollment in an HDHP may be associated with delays in surgical care that result in complex disease presentation.

### Incarceration rates in pediatric inguinal hernia: do not trust the coding [^6a4dfc40]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although recent reports have suggested optimal wait times for inguinal hernia repair to prevent incarceration, these may not apply to all patients or be feasible in the context of limited resources. We evaluated our experience to determine if patient age and interval to operation increased the risk of incarceration.

Methods

A retrospective review of children younger than 2 years old undergoing inguinal hernia repair from 2004 to 2007 was performed. Patients were divided based on age at diagnosis (A, 0-28 days; B, 4-26 weeks; C, 27-52 weeks; and D, 53-104 weeks). We evaluated incarceration rates in each group, defined as the need for sedation to achieve reduction, and compared these to International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10), coding. Wait times were evaluated, and the rate and daily risk of incarceration were calculated for each age group.

Results

Two hundred sixty-eight patients were included in our analysis, with an overall mean wait time of 43 +/- 50 days between diagnosis and surgery. Forty-five patients were labeled as incarcerated by ICD-10 coding, although 23 patients (51%) were reduced without sedation, leaving a true incarceration rate of 8% (22/268). Of these 22 patients, 18 were incarcerated at index presentation. There was no difference in incarceration rates between groups (A, 5.3%; B, 8.0%; C, 11.5%; and D, 8.8%), although older patients had significantly longer wait times.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that ICD-10 coding of incarceration is an inaccurate parameter of actual irreducibility. Hernia incarceration in children awaiting repair represented a minority of overall incarcerations in our cohort, suggesting strict wait times may not alter incarceration risk.

### Protocol for a drugs exposure pregnancy registry for implementation in resource-limited settings [^fd39dbda]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

All significant findings from analyses need to be communicated to sentinel site staff on an ongoing basis. Should any information come to light, which may directly or indirectly benefit or harm the patient, the attending clinician or health care provider should be informed as soon as possible (e.g. if a baby is born with a hereditary or potentially preventable birth defect the mother may need counselling, or if it is noticed that a clinic is prescribing inappropriate medication to pregnant women). The woman should be informed that anonymized information from all countries will be pooled in a relational online database and the findings shared with the facility.

Ascertainment and classification of outcome

An International Birth Defects Assessment Panel has been established by WHO to review, confirm and classify major birth defects reported by the participating sites. Although all birth defects are documented, exclusion criteria have been developed by the Panel on the categories of birth defects which are not relevant. All defects that do not constitute “major malformations” defined as a structural abnormality with surgical, medical or cosmetic importance and hereditary and chromosomal disorders that are not caused by exposure to drugs, are excluded.

The following features/anomalies are therefore excluded from the primary endpoint of assessing drug-related risk :

• minor anomalies (e.g. transverse palmar crease)

• normal variations (e.g. umbilical hernia in African infants)

• hereditary disorders (e.g. polydactyly, postaxial Type B)

• birth marks (e.g. haemangiomas; congenital moles)

• chromosome abnormalities (e.g. Down syndrome)

• positional deformities (e.g. congenital hip dislocation in infants who are born in breech position;

• features of prematurity (e.g. undescended testes and patent ductus arteriosus in infants less than 37 weeks gestational age;

• biochemical abnormalities(e.g. carriers of cystic fibrosis, and abnormal haemoglobins that may be identified during newborn screening.

### Nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis among privately insured patients [^2149ac2b]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Health care professionals have shown significant interest in nonoperative management for uncomplicated appendicitis, but long-term population-level data are lacking.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of nonoperatively managed appendicitis against appendectomy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This national retrospective cohort study used claims data from a private insurance database to compare patients admitted with uncomplicated appendicitis from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2014, undergoing appendectomy vs nonoperative management. Coarsened exact matching was applied before multivariate analysis to reduce imbalance between groups. Data were analyzed from February 12 through May 1, 2018.

Exposures

Appendectomy (control arm) or nonoperative management (treatment arm).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Short-term primary clinical outcomes included emergency department visits, hospital readmission, abdominal abscess, and Clostridium difficile infections. Long-term primary clinical outcomes were small-bowel obstructions, incisional hernias, and appendiceal cancers. Nonoperative management failure was defined by hospital readmission with appendicitis diagnosis and an appendicitis-associated operation or procedure. Secondary outcomes included number of follow-up visits, length and cost of index hospitalization, and total cost of appendicitis-associated care. Covariates included age, sex, region, insurance plan type, admission year, and Charlson comorbidity index.

Results

Of 58 329 patients with uncomplicated appendicitis (52.7% men; mean [SD] age, 31.9 [16.5] years), 55 709 (95.5%) underwent appendectomy and 2620 (4.5%) underwent nonoperative management. Patients in the nonoperative management group were more likely to have appendicitis-associated readmissions (adjusted odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.63-2.77; P<.001) and to develop an abscess (adjusted odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05-1.92; P=.02). Patients in the nonoperative management group required more follow-up visits in the year after index admission (unadjusted mean [SD], 1.6 [6.3] vs 0.3 [1.4] visits; adjusted +1.11 visits; P<.001) and had lower index hospitalization cost (unadjusted mean [SD], $11 502 [$9287] vs $13 551 [$10 160]; adjusted -$2117, P<.001), but total cost of appendicitis care was higher when follow-up care was considered (unadjusted, $14 934 [$31 122] vs $14 186 [$10 889]; adjusted +$785; P=.003). During a mean (SD) of 3.2 (1.7) years of follow-up, failure of nonoperative management occurred in 101 patients (3.9%); median time to recurrence was 42 days (interquartile range, 8-125 days). Among the patients who experienced treatment failure, 44 did so within 30 days.

Conclusions and Relevance

According to results of this study, nonoperative management failure rates were lower than previously reported. Nonoperative management was associated with higher rates of abscess, readmission, and higher overall cost of care. These data suggest that nonoperative management may not be the preferred first-line therapy for all patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.

### Technology dependence among hospitalized US children [^a0c22d38]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of the Kids Inpatient Database (KID). KID is the largest pediatric all-payer inpatient database with hospitalizations from 3998 acute care hospitals of all types (not just children’s hospitals) in 49 states.We excluded admissions for uncomplicated newborns and obstetrics and gynecology conditions. Using CCCv3, we identified hospitalizations with International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes consistent with TD.Two study team members (E.G. and J.C.) assigned each of the 1279 ICD-10-CM codes for TD into 7 body systems and 54 TD categories (eTables 1-3 in Supplement 1). We resolved categorization discrepancies by study team consensus. The statistical analytic system file categorizing the 1279 ICD-10-CM codes is available in the eMethods in Supplement 2. We determined the 10 most common prevalent combinations of TD by discharge by absolute rank. We calculated weighted frequencies and compared discharges with and without TD using χ 2 tests. We summarized results following thereporting guideline.The Children’s Mercy Kansas City institutional review board deemed this study non–human participants research, therefore not requiring informed consent. Analysis was from October 2023 to March 2025 using SAS Enterprise Guide version 8.3 (SAS Institute). Statistical significance was a 2-sided P <.05.

### ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM mapping of the AAST emergency general surgery disease severity grading systems: conceptual approach, limitations, and recommendations for the future [^57d673b3]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) recently established a grading system for uniform reporting of anatomic severity of several emergency general surgery (EGS) diseases. There are five grades of severity for each disease, ranging from I (lowest severity) to V (highest severity). However, the grading process requires manual chart review. We sought to evaluate whether International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM) codes might allow estimation of AAST grades for EGS diseases. The Patient Assessment and Outcomes Committee of the AAST reviewed all available ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes relevant to 16 EGS diseases with available AAST grades. We then matched grades for each EGS disease with one or more ICD codes. We used the Official Coding Guidelines for ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and the American Hospital Association's "Coding Clinic for ICD-9-CM" for coding guidance. The ICD codes did not allow for matching all five AAST grades of severity for each of the 16 diseases. With ICD-9-CM, six diseases mapped into four categories of severity (instead of five), another six diseases into three categories of severity, and four diseases into only two categories of severity. With ICD-10-CM, five diseases mapped into four categories of severity, seven diseases into three categories, and four diseases into two categories. Two diseases mapped into discontinuous categories of grades (two in ICD-9-CM and one in ICD-10-CM). Although resolution is limited, ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes might have some utility in roughly approximating the severity of the AAST grades in the absence of more precise information. These ICD mappings should be validated and refined before widespread use to characterize EGS disease severity. In the long-term, it may be desirable to develop alternatives to ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for routine collection of disease severity characteristics.

### Local anesthesia is associated with fewer complications in umbilical hernia repair in frail veterans [^3b676ee5]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal anesthesia modality for umbilical hernia repair is unclear. We hypothesized that using local rather than general anesthesia would be associated with improved outcomes, especially for frail patients.

Methods

We utilized the 1998-2018 Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program to identify patients who underwent elective, open umbilical hernia repair under general or local anesthesia. We used the Risk Analysis Index to measure frailty. Outcomes included complications and operative time.

Results

There were 4958 Veterans (13%) whose hernias were repaired under local anesthesia. Compared to general anesthesia, local was associated with a 12%-24% faster operative time for all patients, and an 86% lower (OR 0.14, 95%CI 0.03-0.72) complication rate for frail patients.

Conclusions

Local anesthesia may reduce the operative time for all patients and complications for frail patients having umbilical hernia repair.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^f4141d2d]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Abdominal hernias in cirrhosis and ascites—Abdominal wall and inguinal hernias are common, and umbilical hernias develop in approximately 20% of patients with cirrhosis. Hernias may result from increased abdominal pressure from ascites with weakened abdominal muscles, and poor nutrition can lead to rapidly enlarging hernias, whereas optimal fluid control, appropriate nutrition, and conservative management with binders may minimize or prevent hernia development and progression. Hernias may present with incarceration, pressure necrosis, rupture, evisceration, and peritonitis, and a rapid decline in the ascitic fluid volume (e.g., LVP) can paradoxically cause incarceration. Patients who are candidates for liver transplantation (LT) in the near future should defer hernia repair until during or after transplantation, while for patients in whom transplantation is not imminent elective herniorrhaphy may be offered after careful consideration of risks and benefits, with a possible need for an emergent operation. Clinically apparent ascites should be controlled before elective herniorrhaphy, laparoscopic approaches are preferred, the use of prosthetic mesh may reduce recurrence but may increase infections and other complications, and postoperatively control of ascites and optimization of nutrition are key determinants of successful outcome.
