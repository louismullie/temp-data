## Question

Pulsitille Tinnitus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pulsatile tinnitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining pulsatile tinnitus and why it is clinically distinct. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation priorities, including history, exam, and audiometry. Next, I will categorize etiologies and map them to an imaging algorithm. After that, I need to check when invasive angiography is warranted and outline treatment pathways by etiology. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, special populations, and synthesize a practical algorithm with diagnostic yields and key takeaways, making sure each assertion is supported by appropriate references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical significance. Pulsatile tinnitus is a rhythmic sound synchronous with the heartbeat, perceived without an external acoustic stimulus, and unlike nonpulsatile tinnitus, it carries a higher likelihood of an identifiable and sometimes dangerous vascular or structural cause, which is why it warrants a structured workup rather than reassurance alone [^115o4Ahw] [^114GeG41].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation steps before jumping to imaging. A thorough history should document onset, laterality, tempo, positional effects, and associated symptoms such as headache, visual obscurations, cranial neuropathies, otalgia, otorrhea, vertigo, and systemic features like anemia or hyperthyroidism; I should also screen for ototoxic exposures and quantify symptom burden and quality of life impact to distinguish bothersome from nonbothersome tinnitus, as this shapes urgency and referral needs [^113ZRK5C] [^117CAZfH]. On exam, I need to perform otoscopy for retrotympanic vascular masses or jugular bulb anomalies, auscultate the periauricular region, mastoid, orbits, and neck for bruits or venous hums, and palpate for compressibility or positional change with maneuvers like head turning or jugular compression; objective tinnitus on auscultation is a key clue to vascular flow abnormalities [^116GiXry]. I should confirm baseline audiometry for all pulsatile tinnitus patients because conductive or sensorineural patterns can redirect the differential and imaging choices, and unilateral or asymmetric findings heighten concern for retrocochlear disease [^112WNEU5] [^111YM7Fr].

> Hold on, I should verify the etiologic framework to guide testing. A practical categorization separates vascular, structural, and metabolic causes; vascular etiologies predominate and include arterial stenosis or dissection, arteriovenous shunts such as dural arteriovenous fistula, and venous disorders including idiopathic intracranial hypertension with transverse sinus stenosis, sigmoid sinus wall anomalies, and jugular bulb variants; structural causes include paragangliomas and other temporal bone masses, while metabolic or systemic drivers include anemia, hyperthyroidism, and high-output states; importantly, more than 70% of patients will have an identifiable cause with a careful evaluation, so I should not accept "idiopathic" prematurely [^115o4Ahw] [^114GeG41].

> Next, I should review the imaging algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines and local expertise. If otoscopy reveals a retrotympanic vascular mass or suspected glomus tumor or aberrant carotid artery, high-resolution temporal bone CT is first-line to define bony relationships and vascular variants; if otoscopy is normal, combined vascular imaging with CTA/CTV of the head and neck or MRI/MRA/MRV of the brain and internal auditory canals is appropriate to evaluate arterial and venous pathology; MRI is increasingly preferred as a first-line screening test for its safety and ability to detect shunting lesions, venous sinus stenosis, and tumors, while CT remains valuable for bony detail and calcified lesions; I should double-check that ACR Appropriateness Criteria endorse tailored vascular imaging for pulsatile tinnitus without a retrotympanic lesion, which they do [^1129JRm4] [^11353XiU] [^116V9A83] [^112WNEU5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought MRI/MRA/MRV would have the highest diagnostic yield across the board, but I should correct that assumption. In undifferentiated pulsatile tinnitus cohorts, CT venography and formal angiography can demonstrate high diagnostic yield and specificity for certain vascular lesions, whereas MRI/MRV excels at venous sinus disease and soft-tissue masses; yield varies by clinical phenotype, with higher detection in patients with positive exam findings, so pretest probability from the bedside meaningfully steers imaging performance and should be documented explicitly [^116mmKTr] [^114GeG41].

> I need to ensure I do not overuse invasive angiography. Digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard for confirming dural arteriovenous fistulas and other arteriovenous shunts when noninvasive studies are indeterminate but clinical suspicion remains high; it also enables endovascular treatment in the same session when indicated, so I should reserve it for cases where the result will change management or when noninvasive imaging is equivocal but the pretest probability is substantial [^114NkeQf].

> Let me consider treatment pathways by etiology, and I should confirm expected outcomes to set realistic expectations. For dural arteriovenous fistulas and other arteriovenous shunts, endovascular embolization yields durable symptom resolution in the vast majority; for venous sinus stenosis, including transverse sinus stenosis in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, venous sinus stenting provides high rates of lasting improvement; for sigmoid sinus wall anomalies or diverticula, surgical resurfacing or obliteration is effective when conservative measures fail; for carotid stenosis, revascularization by endarterectomy or stenting can cure pulsatile tinnitus in selected patients; for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, weight loss and acetazolamide are foundational, with stenting reserved for refractory cases; for paragangliomas, modern management favors observation, subtotal resection, or stereotactic radiation depending on size, growth, and cranial nerve involvement; I should also remember that simple venous hums or jugular variants may respond to conservative measures and reassurance [^114NkeQf] [^112kwxk2] [^112xHZa5] [^111EZXXG] [^1154Gqkv] [^112UDj8n] [^111wqCDr].

> But wait, what if the patient has red flags that demand expedited workup. Sudden onset pulsatile tinnitus, focal neurologic deficits, cranial neuropathies, or signs of carotid dissection warrant urgent imaging and vascular consultation; fibromuscular dysplasia is an underrecognized association with pulsatile tinnitus and cervical bruits, so I should actively look for it and counsel on migraine management cautiously given dissection risk; in children, venous sinus thrombosis and idiopathic intracranial hypertension must be considered, and hematologic or genetic prothrombotic states may be relevant [^113stWLL] [^116UHnpQ] [^112yoFiL].

> I should double-check the diagnostic yield and how to optimize it. With a comprehensive algorithm that integrates history, exam, audiometry, and appropriately selected imaging, diagnostic yield can exceed 90% in patients who complete the recommended workup, and multiple concurrent pathologies are not rare, so I must avoid anchoring on a single finding; sound measurements in the ear canal can objectify pulsatile tinnitus in nearly half of cases and may help distinguish arterial from venous etiologies, complementing auscultation and imaging [^1165KkKM] [^117XdcnL].

> Next, I should review follow-up and longitudinal care. If no cause is identified after appropriate imaging, I should reconsider the diagnosis, repeat key elements of the history and exam, and consider second-opinion review of imaging. If idiopathic intracranial hypertension is suspected but not confirmed, targeted ophthalmologic assessment for papilledema and formal visual fields, and when appropriate, lumbar puncture with opening pressure, can clarify. Conversely, if a benign venous variant is found, reassurance and observation with periodic symptom review may suffice, reserving intervention for progressive or intolerable symptoms [^112kwxk2] [^1178QAVj].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Start with history, exam including otoscopy and auscultation, and audiometry. If a retrotympanic vascular mass is seen, obtain temporal bone CT. If otoscopy is normal, obtain vascular imaging with CTA/CTV or MRI/MRA/MRV based on local expertise and patient factors. Escalate to catheter angiography when shunt is suspected and noninvasive imaging is nondiagnostic. Refer to otolaryngology, neurology, neuro-ophthalmology, interventional neuroradiology, or vascular surgery as dictated by the identified etiology. Throughout, maintain vigilance for dangerous causes such as dural arteriovenous fistula, carotid dissection, paraganglioma, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension to prevent delays in definitive therapy [^115o4Ahw] [^11353XiU] [^1129JRm4].

> Key takeaway, and I should confirm this is consistent with the evidence: pulsatile tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease, and a structured, reference-based approach anchored in careful history, exam, and judicious imaging identifies a cause in the vast majority and can be life-saving when serious vascular disease is uncovered. Never dismiss pulsatile tinnitus as "just tinnitus", and never substitute imaging for a meticulous bedside evaluation that narrows the differential and guides the right test at the right time [^115o4Ahw] [^114GeG41].

Pulsatile tinnitus is a **rhythmic sound synchronous with the heartbeat** [^112F1nwL] and often signals a vascular or structural abnormality [^1175iUqm]. A thorough history and exam, including otoscopy and auscultation, are essential to guide imaging and management [^116GiXry]. MRI/MRA/MRV is **first-line imaging** [^116V9A83] for most patients, while CTA/CTV is preferred when a retrotympanic mass is suspected [^1129JRm4] or MRI is contraindicated [^notfound]. Common causes include venous sinus stenosis, dural arteriovenous fistula, paraganglioma, carotid stenosis, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115yZTgv]; treatment is cause-specific, with endovascular stenting or embolization for vascular lesions [^114NkeQf], surgery or radiation for tumors [^1154Gqkv], and acetazolamide or weight loss for IIH [^112kwxk2]. Prompt evaluation is critical because pulsatile tinnitus can herald stroke, hemorrhage, or blindness [^111wBZvf].

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

- **Onset and duration**: Sudden onset suggests vascular events (e.g. dissection, thrombosis) [^115G8bM5]; chronic course suggests benign vascular variants or tumors [^notfound].
- **Laterality**: Unilateral symptoms increase suspicion for localized vascular or structural lesions [^115cUJuX].
- **Associated symptoms**: Headache, visual changes, cranial neuropathies, or otologic symptoms guide diagnosis [^116GiXry].
- **Risk factors**: Hypertension, hyperthyroidism, anemia, pregnancy, and medications (e.g. anticoagulants) should be elicited [^116DJv6c].

---

### Physical examination

- **Otoscopy**: Look for retrotympanic masses (e.g. paraganglioma) or vascular anomalies [^1129JRm4].
- **Auscultation**: Head, neck, and periauricular bruits suggest arterial or venous flow abnormalities [^116DJv6c].
- **Neurologic exam**: Cranial nerve deficits or focal findings indicate intracranial pathology [^116GiXry].

---

## Imaging modalities and diagnostic algorithms

Imaging is essential to identify the cause of pulsatile tinnitus; the choice depends on **clinical findings and suspected etiology** [^11353XiU].

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| MRI/MRA/MRV | - First-line for most patients <br/> - Venous sinus stenosis <br/> - DAVF <br/> - Tumors <br/> - IIH | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue resolution | Contraindications (e.g. pacemaker, severe claustrophobia) |
| CTA/CTV | - Suspected arterial stenosis <br/> - Dissection <br/> - Retrotympanic mass <br/> - MRI contraindicated | - Fast <br/> - High spatial resolution <br/> - Good for bony structures | Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast risks |
| DSA | - Gold standard for DAVF <br/> - Complex vascular lesions <br/> - Pre-intervention planning | - High sensitivity/specificity <br/> - Therapeutic potential | Invasive <br/> - Complication risks |

---

MRI/MRA/MRV is **first-line** for most patients, particularly for venous sinus stenosis, DAVF, tumors, and IIH [^11353XiU]. CTA/CTV is preferred when a retrotympanic mass is suspected [^notfound], MRI is contraindicated, or arterial pathology is suspected. DSA remains the gold standard for DAVF and complex vascular lesions, especially when intervention is planned [^114NkeQf].

---

## Common etiologies

Pulsatile tinnitus has diverse causes; **vascular etiologies predominate** [^114NkeQf].

---

### Vascular causes

- **Venous sinus stenosis**: Common; often associated with IIH [^113ZzsHh]; endovascular stenting is effective [^114NkeQf].
- **Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF)**: Potentially dangerous; endovascular embolization is curative in most cases [^114NkeQf].
- **Carotid artery stenosis**: Atherosclerotic disease causing turbulent flow; treated with endarterectomy or stenting [^111EZXXG].
- **Paraganglioma (glomus tumor)**: Highly vascular tumors causing objective tinnitus; managed surgically or with radiation [^1154Gqkv].
- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)**: Associated with venous sinus stenosis; managed medically or with venous stenting [^112kwxk2].

---

### Non-vascular causes

Non-vascular causes include **temporal bone abnormalities** — such as sigmoid sinus dehiscence, jugular bulb anomalies, and superior semicircular canal dehiscence [^112WNEU5] — and **neoplasms**, including vestibular schwannoma and other skull base tumors [^116GiXry].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment is **cause-specific** and often curative when the underlying lesion is addressed [^114GeG41].

---

### Vascular lesions

For vascular lesions, **endovascular stenting** is effective for venous sinus stenosis and select arterial lesions [^114NkeQf], while **embolization** is curative for DAVFs and AVMs [^notfound]. Carotid endarterectomy or stenting treats carotid stenosis [^111EZXXG].

---

### Tumors

For tumors, **surgical resection** is used for paragangliomas and other skull base tumors, and **radiation therapy** serves as an alternative or adjunct to surgery [^1154Gqkv].

---

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

For idiopathic intracranial hypertension, **medical management** with acetazolamide, weight loss, and lifestyle changes is first-line [^112kwxk2], and **venous sinus stenting** is reserved for refractory cases [^113ZzsHh].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause and timeliness of intervention. Untreated vascular lesions can lead to **stroke, hemorrhage, or blindness** [^111wBZvf]. Most patients experience significant improvement or resolution after targeted therapy [^114GeG41].

---

Pulsatile tinnitus is a **symptom of underlying vascular or structural disease** [^115o4Ahw]; a structured approach with targeted imaging and cause-specific therapy yields high diagnostic yield and durable symptom relief [^1165KkKM] [^114NkeQf].

Appendix B: Routine care — initial evaluation and characterization — Patients who report tinnitus during a clinical evaluation should be asked additional questions regarding initial onset, frequency of occurrence, duration, and laterality, and in some cases such as unilateral or pulsatile tinnitus, the patient should be referred for a medical workup. The provider must also determine whether the patient is bothered by their tinnitus and the extent to which it interferes with daily activities or quality of life (QoL), and when such problems are reported the patient is characterized as having bothersome tinnitus and might need additional evaluation to facilitate appropriate recommendations and referrals.

Conclusion

BHAG are an underrecognized entity and are prevalent in patients with PT. The presence of BHAG is strongly associated with IIH, therefore, these lesions are an important neuroimaging finding which should prompt expedited clinical workup. Future work is needed to clarify the mechanistic relationship underlying this association.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain a combination of parenchymal and vascular imaging (either head/head and neck CTA or a combination of head and internal auditory canal MRI, MRA, and/or head MRV) in patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus with no retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^111986pM]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our data indicate that the presence of an IAM VL or of vestibulocochlear NVC is no more frequent in ears with unexplained unilateral PT than in contralateral asymptomatic ears. In addition, the likelihood of PT was not influenced by the distance of the IAM VL from the IAM fundus or by the angulation of the IAM VL, and PT was no more prevalent if CN8-NVC was located within the TZ or CMP-TZ segments. This would argue against the analysis and reporting of IAM VLs or vestibulocochlear NVC in the context of PT, and it gives the clinician confidence to reassure the patient that these are unlikely to be an aetiology of PT.

Conclusions

We report the novel use of CFD to demonstrate how high frequency velocity fluctuations produced near the inner ear structures by a venous lesion can manifest as pulsatile tinnitus. We were able to accurately reproduce the sonance of the patient's subjectively reported PT using innovative advanced hemodynamic simulation techniques and a new computational sonification method.

### Tinnitus: diagnosis and management [^111YM7Fr]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is the sensation of hearing a sound in the absence of an internal or external source and is a common problem encountered in primary care. Most cases of tinnitus are benign and idiopathic and are strongly associated with sensorineural hearing loss. A standard workup begins with a targeted history and physical examination to identify treatable causes and associated symptoms that may improve with treatment. Less common but potentially dangerous causes such as vascular tumors and vestibular schwannoma should be ruled out. A comprehensive audiologic evaluation should be performed for patients who experience unilateral tinnitus, tinnitus that has been present for six months or longer, or that is accompanied by hearing problems. Neuroimaging is not part of the standard workup unless the tinnitus is asymmetric or unilateral, pulsatile, associated with focal neurologic abnormalities, or associated with asymmetric hearing loss. Cognitive behavior therapy is the only treatment that has been shown to improve quality of life in patients with tinnitus. Sound therapy and tinnitus retraining therapy are treatment options, but evidence is inconclusive. Melatonin, antidepressants, and cognitive training may help with sleep disturbance, mood disorders, and cognitive impairments, respectively. Avoidance of noise exposure may help prevent the development or progression of tinnitus. Providing information about the natural progression of tinnitus and being familiar with the causes that warrant additional evaluation, imaging, and specialist involvement are essential to comprehensive care.

### Objective pulsatile tinnitus: a video clip demonstration of the condition [^1176JyTz]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon condition. We describe a case of pulsatile tinnitus and visually demonstrate a pulsating tympanic membrane caused by a postoperative cerebrospinal leak into the mastoid air cells following resection of a left temporal petrous meningioma. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature where an objective pulsatile tinnitus has been captured on video (see www.laryngoscope.com).

### Sound measurements in pulsatile tinnitus: a review in 171 patients [^117XdcnL]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic application of external ear canal sound measurements in pulsatile tinnitus (PT).

Study Design

Retrospective chart review on a prospective series of sound measurements.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

A cohort of 171 PT patients with sound measurements during diagnostic workup for PT (2016–2023).

Main Outcome Measure

The percentages of PT patients per pathology and diagnosis, with PT objectified by sound measurements.

Results

In 57% of the patients, an identifiable etiology that could explain the PT was identified using various imaging modalities. The PT could be detected with a sound measurement in the ear canal in 48% of these patients. In absence of an identifiable etiology, an objective PT was found in only 15% of the cases. PT was more often detected for patients with arterial pathologies than venous or nonvascular pathologies (73% vs 50% and 22%, respectively). Particularly, in PT patients with a DAVF, an objective PT was found for all patients (100%). The sound measurements were found to be more sensitive than auscultation in detecting bruits in PT patients.

Conclusion

A sound recording can objectify PT in almost half of the cases with a diagnosis as determined by imaging. In patients where the PT cannot be detected, arterial pathologies (particularly DAVFs) are less likely. Combined with a thorough clinical evaluation and proper imaging studies, sound measurements can be of added value in the clinical pathway of PT patients.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^116fK8r2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Our opinion is that it would interest the readership of BMJ Case Reports because it describes an important clinical lesson regarding performing a thorough history and physical before using adjunctive radiographic modalities. Examining the patient is the basis of medicine and should not be forgotten. It is an elementary but significant fact that has long-lasting implications. Our hope is that by urging those in medicine to continue to utilising skills such as auscultation, it will decrease patient costs and improve the quality of healthcare.

### Simple things are not simple: pulsatile tinnitus due to tortuous occipital artery [^113f2CKq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus is often a chronic and debilitating condition and normally has a vascular origin. We describe a case of pulsatile tinnitus due to an aberrant branch of the external carotid artery (ECA), which has not been reported previously.

Method

A 67-year-old female with chronic unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, which could be controlled completely with direct pressure on a small tortuous superficial branch behind her left ear. This was confirmed with doppler to be an unusually tortuous occipital branch of the ECA. Under local anesthesia, this vessel was identified with intraoperative doppler and ligated.

Result

Complete resolution of tinnitus immediately, with consistent results 3 months postoperatively.

Conclusions

Pulsatile tinnitus due to aberrances in the occipital ECA branch is rare, and in this case, was successfully treated with minor surgery.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^1153SyQu]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

After being counselled on the risks, benefits and alternatives, the patient elected to receive endovascular treatment. There were no complications. The patient has stated that she has had full relief of her symptoms with the procedure.

### Arteriovenous malformation in the parotid region presenting as pulsatile tinnitus: a case report [^111Wi7WV]. Head & Neck (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus is a unique symptom in the general population and often leads patients to medical attention.

Methods and Results

We report a patient who had an arteriovenous malformation of superficial temporal artery in the parotid region causing pulsatile tinnitus and insomnia. Magnetic resonance angiography and carotid angiography were useful tools for the detection of this vascular malformation. Successful treatment of this lesion was achieved by endovascular embolization.

Conclusion

This case illustrates a thorough diagnostic work-up with a high index of suspicion and a proper treatment option is rewarding when dealing with such a rare disease.

### Neurosurgical causes of pulsatile tinnitus: contemporary update [^115yZTgv]. Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditionally in the domain of the otolaryngologist, pulsatile tinnitus (PT) has become increasingly relevant to neurosurgeons. PT may prove to be a harbinger of life-threatening pathology; however, often, it is a marker of a more benign process. Irrespectively, the neurosurgeon should be familiar with the many potential etiologies of this unique and challenging patient population. In this review, we discuss the myriad causes of PT, categorized by pulse-phase rhythmicity.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^11587qMM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope, exclusions, and target population — Patients with identifiable causative diagnoses of secondary tinnitus are excluded from this guideline, and clinicians should decide whether to apply these recommendations to patients with these conditions on an individualized basis; the guideline also excludes patients with pulsatile tinnitus, or tinnitus related to complex auditory hallucinations or hallucinations related to psychosis or epilepsy. The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus, with the target audience being any clinician, including nonphysicians, and the target patient population limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome. Regarding burden, in the United States the estimated prevalence of experiencing tinnitus at any time is 25.3% and experiencing frequent (almost always or at least once a day) tinnitus is 7.9%.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113ZRK5C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

History and physical examination in tinnitus — core elements to document — are specified as follows. "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL". "The characteristics of the tinnitus should be detailed, including laterality and pulsatile nature". "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded". "Symptoms of hearing loss,44 disequilibrium, or other neurologic deficits should be documented". "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus". "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications should be discussed". "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use should be elicited". Clinicians are advised that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties". Finally, "Although most tinnitus patients will have few relevant positive physical findings, the examination should be directed to identifying secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Tinnitus and cardiovascular disease: the population-based troms ø study (2015–2016) [^115kC3EQ]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

A review article by Kempen et al summarises results on the associations between the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease and several types of traffic noise; air traffic, road traffic and rail traffic. For hypertension, ischaemic heart disease and stroke, results were mixed, with some indications of modest positive associations. Only some of these findings were statistically significant. Regarding the association between road traffic noise and ischaemic heart disease, however, findings were more consistent. Even though we presented results from only a single cross-sectional study on tinnitus, they align with these results on traffic noise — we found a significant positive association between tinnitus symptom intensity and prevalence of myocardial infarction in our non-stratified analyses.

There are some limitations to this study. We used cross-sectional data and did not have information on the onset of tinnitus, so we do not know which of the conditions came first. Thus, while our study contributes knowledge about the overall associations between tinnitus and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the general adult population, mechanisms for the associations could not be explored. Furthermore, a possible impact of tinnitus on the development of cardiovascular disease would likely be a long-term effect, possibly with a stronger association between tinnitus and cardiovascular disease for individuals with prolonged tinnitus. We could not compare prevalences according to duration of tinnitus, neither did we have information on specific types of tinnitus (like pulsatile tinnitus), which could possibly affect associations. All tinnitus and vascular condition data, except for blood pressure measurements, were self-reported. Being a general population health study covering numerous topics, it was not possible to include a thorough clinical assessment of tinnitus or any full-scale tinnitus inventory (like the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory) in the Tromsø Study. Instead, and rather similar to how it has been done in other population studies, tinnitus was assessed using single items measuring tinnitus status, frequentness and bother. It is a strength of the study that we used the proposed standard measure of tinnitus prevalence in population studies, 'tinnitus lasting more than five min during the past year'. The other items were also selected to align with other population-based studies.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^115U5VuD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — imaging studies directive: Clinicians should not obtain imaging studies of the head and neck in patients with tinnitus, specifically to evaluate the tinnitus, unless they have 1 or more of the following: tinnitus that localizes to 1 ear, pulsatile tinnitus, focal neurological abnormalities, or asymmetric hearing loss. This is a Strong recommendation (against) based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with supporting ratings of "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies" and "Level of confidence in the evidence: High".

### Pulsatile tinnitus: a harbinger of a greater ill? [^115G8bM5]. Head & Neck (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon otologic symptom, which may be the presenting complaint of a potentially devastating pathology. Understanding this manifestation as a possible symptom of a significant vascular abnormality is crucial to guide management and treatment.

Methods and Results

We describe a 38-year-old woman with sudden-onset right-sided pulsatile tinnitus. A right extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection was diagnosed with MRI/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and treated with anticoagulation. Follow-up MRI/MRA demonstrated complete resolution. Two months later, left-sided pulsatile tinnitus evolved. An MRI/MRA of the neck demonstrated left-sided extracranial ICA dissection. She was treated in a similar fashion and a repeat MRI/MRA demonstrated its resolution.

Conclusion

Spontaneous extracranial ICA dissection may present with pulsatile tinnitus as the only symptom in 4% to 50% of patients. Subsequent evolution of a contralateral dissection is even more uncommon. Generally, treatment of this phenomenon is conservative utilizing anticoagulation or aspirin; however, surgical intervention may be necessary.

### Tinnitus and cardiovascular disease: the population-based troms ø study (2015–2016) [^115Xiqqn]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

In our study, the relatively strongest associations were generally found between low tinnitus symptom intensity and cardiovascular conditions, and this was also the only category of tinnitus symptom intensity that presented significant results. It is not clear why only low-intensity tinnitus should be related to cardiovascular health outcomes. It could be that individuals reporting the lowest level of tinnitus symptom intensity are inherently more attentive to disease, more sensitive and thus more prone to stress. This explanation is in line with findings from a Norwegian study on the association between tinnitus and mental health, where worse mental health was reported among individuals with low tinnitus symptom intensity compared with those with high symptom intensity (frequentness and duration), for some groups of age and sex. It should be noted, however, that participants in the category with low-intensity tinnitus in the present study reported to be not bothered or only a little bothered by their tinnitus. Alternatively, the association may be due to cardiovascular disease causing tinnitus through its effect on blood circulation. Pulsatile tinnitus, which is a rhythmic type of tinnitus synchronous with the heartbeat, often originates from vascular causes. It may be that vascular changes related to cardiovascular disease could bring about pulsatile tinnitus occurring sporadically, for instance, in relation to physical exertion. If so, an association between only low-intensity (and thus infrequent) tinnitus and cardiovascular disease makes sense. Since we had no information on tinnitus type, we were not able to examine this any further. Importantly, since CIs were overlapping for all categories of tinnitus symptom intensity in the present study, we cannot say for certain that there were differences between categories, and the associations between low tinnitus symptom intensity and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases need to be replicated in future studies.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^113kWrQJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus — etiologies and evaluation emphasize vascular and neoplastic causes and specify when comprehensive workup is warranted. Pulsatile tinnitus can be caused by intracranial hypertension, neoplasms, and vascular disorders and deserves special attention during the directed history and examination. Although most of these tumors are in the abdomen, 3% of nonadrenal paragangliomas are in the head and neck, and glomus tumors are rare but are the most common tumor of the middle ear. Patients with glomus tumors commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus (80%), whereas some present with hearing loss (60%), and tinnitus from these lesions is usually unilateral. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and fistulae can cause tinnitus, and serious consequences, including intracerebral hemorrhage, may occur without treatment. Although debated, a systematic review found vascular loop compression of the eighth cranial nerve was 80 times more common in patients with pulsatile tinnitus than those with nonpulsatile tinnitus. Less serious phenomena can also cause pulsatile tinnitus, including venous hums, aberrant carotid arteries, and carotid transmissions, many of which are unilateral; venous hums are caused by turbulent blood flow through the jugular bulb and can be associated with sigmoid sinus diverticulum or dehiscence, and carotid transmission can result from stenosis or transmitted heart murmurs. In light of these issues, the patient with pulsatile tinnitus should have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out systemic cardiovascular or neurologic disease.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^116hb3SZ]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

Institutional approval (project number 15888) was obtained, and patient consent was waived. This was a retrospective case-controlled cross-sectional study undertaken in a tertiary referral centre. Consecutive patients undergoing MRI for the investigation of PT were identified from a search of a radiology imaging system database between 1/1/2012 to 31/07/2021. The Boolean search terms comprised the keywords tin* AND whoos* OR pulsa*. Patient demographics, laterality of PT, otoscopic findings, other audiovestibular symptoms or diagnoses, and other medical conditions were recorded. The mean air (0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, and 8 kHz) and bone conduction thresholds (0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz) were recorded from the pure tone audiogram performed at the shortest interval from the MRI study.

Exclusion criteria were bilateral tinnitus or insufficient details on lateralisation of PT, absent or degraded 3D HR T2w sequences, alternative causes of PT on imaging or medical assessment, abnormal otoscopy, air-bone gap on audiometry indicating conductive hearing loss, absent audiogram, and significant intracranial/ear pathology, trauma, or surgery. The study flowchart shown in Fig. 1 summarises the patient selection process.

### Bilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by bilateral dilated mastoid emissary vein [^1172uczm]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rhythmic type of tinnitus. Most cases are caused by vascular disorders and present as synchronous with the patient's heartbeat. A dilated mastoid emissary vein may cause pulsatile tinnitus. Here, we report the first case of bilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by dilated bilateral mastoid emissary vein. The patient suffered from bilateral pulsatile tinnitus for 2 years. His bilateral tinnitus disappeared temporarily when the bilateral mastoid processes were compressed. Temporal bone computed tomographic (CT) showed the bilateral dilated mastoid emissary canals. Cranial Magnetic resonance venograms (MRV) showed the bilateral dilated mastoid emissary veins. We explained the risk of surgery to the patient. Because the patient could tolerate his tinnitus and did not have a hemangioma or tumor, he did not choose to undergo surgery.

### Improving diagnostic yield in patients with pulsatile tinnitus: a ten-year analysis [^1165KkKM]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the yield of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) and to review the common etiologies and present clinical pears for their diagnosis.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients with PT from 2013 to 2023. Charts were reviewed for demographic data (age, sex, BMI), side of PT (or bilateral), specialty clinic of initial evaluation, coexistent symptoms in addition to PT, and final diagnosis (or non-diagnosis). Clinical, audiometric, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Putative chart diagnoses were reviewed by the authors and deemed likely or unlikely to be the source of the patient's PT. Those with "unlikely" were grouped in the "idiopathic" cohort. The diagnostic algorithm is presented in detail.

Results

Two hundred and 90 patients were included for analysis. The overall diagnostic yield was 90.7% for all patients and 95.6% for those patients who completed the recommended workup - a substantial improvement over published rates. Twenty-nine etiologies were identified with the most common etiology was idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Twenty-one diagnoses comprised no more than 5% of patients. Seventy-three patients (25.2%) had more than one pathology as a potential source for their PT.

Conclusions

PT can present a diagnostic challenge to the clinician. The findings of this study, however, reveal that proper evaluation based on obtaining a thorough history, performing a physical examination, coupled with properly directed imaging studies and blood testing can accomplish a high diagnostic yield of at least one potential etiology.

### Genetic susceptibility to bilateral tinnitus in a Swedish twin cohort [^111999qW]. Genetics in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus, the phantom sensation of sound, is a common condition that is chronic in more than 15% of the population. Severe tinnitus-induced distress, which occurs in 1–2% of the population, interferes with sleep and work productivity. Although a gender bias in tinnitus is still uncertain, the majority of studies report that men are more often affected than women. The incidence of tinnitus increases with age and correlates with hearing loss and other age-related disorders (e.g. hypertension and diabetes). Moreover, tinnitus is considered by most clinicians to have a broad etiology, ranging from noise trauma to ototoxicity, hearing loss, stress, or Ménière disease. The tinnitus percept can be pulsatile, nonpulsatile, constant, or intermittent; it can be tonal, sound like buzzing, whooshing, or ringing, and it can affect one or both ears.

Conclusions

PT is common among patients with FMD. These patients have higher rates of neurovascular symptoms and extracranial carotid artery involvement compared with those without PT. Additional studies are required to better understand the mechanisms of PT in FMD and to delineate optimal treatment strategies. These data also support investigation of the prevalence of FMD among people who present with PT and awareness of FMD as a cause of PT among providers who evaluate patients with this symptom.

### Hearing loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and otalgia… [^112pgmxb]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

A 54-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and migraines presented to a tertiary care otolaryngology clinic reporting 3 months of worsening right ear pain and 1 month of pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss. She denied a history of fever, otorrhea, prior ear infections, vertigo, or otologic surgery. The patient first saw her primary care physician, who visualized a mass in the right ear canal and attempted needle aspiration, which led to self-resolved bleeding. She was given ciprofloxacin ear drops and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, which did not improve her symptoms. On examination, her right external auditory canal was completely obstructed by a fleshy, pulsatile mass with a red hue. Results of Weber tuning fork examination lateralized to the right ear and a Rinne examination suggested a conductive hearing loss.

Formal audiogram results confirmed conductive hearing loss in the right ear and type B tympanometry, which was indicative of poor eardrum mobility. Computed tomography of the temporal bone without contrast showed a well-circumscribed 9-mm lesion in the EAC with bony erosion along the junction of the anterior wall and floor. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass that was confined to the EAC. Chapel AC, Page JC, Sweeney AD. Hearing Loss, Pulsatile Tinnitus, and Otalgia.

### Diagnostic approach to pulsatile tinnitus: a narrative review [^115o4Ahw]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom affecting millions of Americans and can be a harbinger of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy.

Observations

An underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus can be identified in more than 70% of patients with a thorough evaluation. We advocate categorizing the myriad causes of pulsatile tinnitus into structural, metabolic, and vascular groups. Structural causes of pulsatile tinnitus include neoplasms and temporal bone pathologic abnormalities. Metabolic causes of pulsatile tinnitus include ototoxic medications and systemic causes of high cardiac output. Vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus include idiopathic intracranial hypertension and dural arteriovenous fistulas. This categorization facilitates a practical evaluation, referral, and treatment pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Categorizing the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus ensures that dangerous causes of pulsatile tinnitus are not missed, and that patients receive the appropriate care from the proper specialist when needed.

### Pulsatile tinnitus: a review of the literature and an unusual case of iatrogenic pneumocephalus causing pulsatile tinnitus [^113NHWjT]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus is frequently attributed to identifiable and treatable causes, in contrast to the more common subjective non-pulsatile tinnitus. It usually originates from vascular structures as a result of either increased blood flow or lumen stenosis; atherosclerotic carotid or subclavian artery disease; arterial, venous, or arteriovenous malformations, fistulas, or dissection; and paragangliomas. Other causes have also been reported, with often unclear pathophysiology.

Objective

The aim of this paper is to present a case of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to iatrogenic pneumocephalus and to review the literature on pulsatile tinnitus.

Subject

A 48-year-old white woman had a roaring, very disturbing, pulsatile tinnitus after the removal of a cerebellar lobe meningioma. When the patient experienced the symptom of tinnitus, a pulsatile movement of the tympanic membrane could be clearly seen, and this was synchronous with the patient's heartbeat. Computed tomography revealed an epidural pneumocephalus in the left posterior fossa communicating freely with the air cell system of the left mastoid cavity without any sign of residual tumor. A simple mastoidectomy was performed. The whole air cell system was removed and the mastoid cavity was filled with abdominal fat. After the operation, the pulsatile tinnitus ceased completely and the pneumocephalus disappeared gradually. The patient is free of symptoms 11 months after surgery.

Conclusion

Otologists, neurosurgeons, and skull base surgeons should be aware of this surgical complication and be careful to identify any accidental opening to the air cell system of the temporal bone and meticulously close it when it happens. The review of the literature leads to the conclusion that pulsatile tinnitus should be thoroughly investigated, as it may be related to diseases that may have serious complications.

### Pulsatile tinnitus from reversal of flow in an aberrant occipital artery: resolved after carotid artery stenting [^112rqdwe]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Carotid artery stent placement, performed for correction of an asymptomatic severe stenosis, leads to the resolution of persistent and troublesome pulsatile tinnitus. Tinnitus has been reported as a consequence of severe carotid stenoses on previous occasions. This case highlights how an aberrant occipital artery originating above a carotid artery stenosis can result in flow reversal and be a mechanism by which tinnitus may develop.

### Sigmoid sinus diverticulum, dehiscence, and venous sinus stenosis: potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension? [^111evAVQ]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Pulsatile tinnitus is experienced by most patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The pathophysiology remains uncertain; however, transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence have been proposed as potential etiologies. We aimed to determine whether the prevalence of transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence was increased in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and pulsatile tinnitus relative to those without pulsatile tinnitus and a control group.

Materials and Methods

CT vascular studies of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus (n = 42), without pulsatile tinnitus (n = 37), and controls (n = 75) were independently reviewed for the presence of severe transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence according to published criteria. The prevalence of transverse sinus stenosis and sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus was compared with that in the nonpulsatile tinnitus idiopathic intracranial hypertension group and the control group. Further comparisons included differing degrees of transverse sinus stenosis (50% and 75%), laterality of transverse sinus stenosis/sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence, and ipsilateral transverse sinus stenosis combined with sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence.

Results

Severe bilateral transverse sinus stenoses were more frequent in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension than in controls (P < .001), but there was no significant association between transverse sinus stenosis and pulsatile tinnitus within the idiopathic intracranial hypertension group. Sigmoid sinus dehiscence (right- or left-sided) was also more common in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension compared with controls (P = 0.01), but there was no significant association with pulsatile tinnitus within the idiopathic intracranial hypertension group.

Conclusions

While our data corroborate previous studies demonstrating increased prevalence of sigmoid sinus diverticulum/dehiscence and transverse sinus stenosis in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, we did not establish an increased prevalence in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension with pulsatile tinnitus compared with those without. It is therefore unlikely that these entities represent a direct structural correlate of pulsatile tinnitus in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Torrents of torment: turbulence as a mechanism of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to venous stenosis revealed by high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics [^114nek4w]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. It is a prevalent, often debilitating condition that can result in a significant psychological burden and, consequently, can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a rhythmical sound that is usually related to the patient's heartbeat.PT can be related to non-structural causes (eg, hypertension, hyperthyroidism or anemia) or structural/anatomical causes. These structural causes can be non-vascular, such as bone erosions/dehiscence, pneumatization or even tumors of the temporal bone. The vascular causes of PT may include aneurysms, dissections, arteriovenous malformations or shuntsand anatomical normal variations (such as the persistence of the stapedial artery).

In addition, venous abnormalities can also cause vascular-related PT, and these include jugular bulb abnormalitiesor the presence of vestigial veinsas well as developmental venous anomalies. In addition, in recent years there has been an increasing recognition of other venous sinus lesions and PT, including a strong association with intracranial idiopathic hypertension (IIH). These venous lesions may include venous sinus stenosis, thrombosis, diverticulum, dilatations, giant arachnoid granulations or extrinsic compressions of the sinuses.

Despite reports of successful treatments of PT related to these venous lesions, much controversy still exists regarding the role of these vascular lesions (especially venous lesions) in the etiology of PT. We report the novel use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to demonstrate how a venous lesion can produce a PT. We used innovative advanced simulation techniques and a new computational sonification method to translate the hemodynamic parameters derived from the CFD analysis into a sound that accurately reproduced the sonance of the patient's (subjective) PT.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: a report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^113pvKNM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic arterial disease that has a variable presentation including pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The frequency and characteristics of PT in FMD are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PT in FMD and compare characteristics between patients with and without PT. Methods and Results Data were queried from the US Registry for FMD from 2009 to 2020. The primary outcomes were frequency of PT among the FMD population and prevalence of baseline characteristics, signs/symptoms, and vascular bed involvement in patients with and without PT. Of 2613 patients with FMD who were included in the analysis, 972 (37.2%) reported PT. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to explore factors associated with PT. Compared with those without PT, patients with PT were more likely to have involvement of the extracranial carotid artery (90.0% versus 78.6%; odds ratio, 1.49; P = 0.005) and to have higher prevalence of other neurovascular signs/symptoms including headache (82.5% versus 62.7%; odds ratio, 1.82; P < 0.001), dizziness (44.9% versus 22.9%; odds ratio, 2.01; P < 0.001), and cervical bruit (37.5% versus 15.8%; odds ratio, 2.73; P < 0.001) compared with those without PT. Conclusions PT is common among patients with FMD. Patients with FMD who present with PT have higher rates of neurovascular signs/symptoms, cervical bruit, and involvement of the extracranial carotid arteries. The coexistence of the 2 conditions should be recognized, and providers who evaluate patients with PT should be aware of FMD as a potential cause.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^117CAZfH]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD tinnitus history and symptoms — provider should first rule out transient ear noise, defined as the perception of sound, usually occurring in one ear at a time and described as high-pitched ringing or tone, lasting fewer than five minutes, and sometimes accompanied by a sense of hearing loss and aural fullness; transient ear noise is common and does not generally require clinical management. If transient ear noise is ruled out, the following pertinent information should be obtained (not in any particular order): frequency, laterality, quality (e.g., pulsatile, non-pulsatile), and intensity of tinnitus; circumstance and date of onset of tinnitus; impact of tinnitus on sleep, daily activities, or quality of life (screen the patient with a validated instrument, when indicated); hearing loss (e.g., asymmetric, bilateral, unilateral, sudden, recent); ear pressure or fullness with normal ear exam; presence of co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, insomnia, dental issues (e.g., temporomandibular disorder [TMD]), cervical issues; and history of head or neck injury; blast exposure; noise exposure; hearing difficulties; sound tolerance issues; ear pain, drainage, or both; dizziness or vertigo; or possible ototoxic medication (see Appendix C).

### Pulsatile tinnitus and the intrameatal vascular loop: why do we not hear our carotids? [^113KyDXf]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the heart beat or respiration in one or both ears. In 15% of patients with pulsatile tinnitus, no cause can be found. Other investigators have suggested that a vascular loop entering the internal auditory meatus can be another cause of arterial, pulse synchronous tinnitus. If so, we should constantly hear the arterial pulsations of the carotid arteries passing through the petrous bone.

Methods

Using magnetic resonance imaging, 17 patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus and 46 with non-pulsatile tinnitus were analyzed for the presence of a vascular loop entering into the internal acoustic meatus. Four temporal bones were sectioned to find structural differences between the internal acoustic meatus and the pericarotid area. Four patients with intrameatal vascular loops and ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus underwent surgery by Teflon interpositioning between the loop and the cochlea.

Results

In unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, a statistically highly significant amount of intrameatal vascular loops was noted in comparison to non-pulsatile tinnitus. A well-developed pericarotid venous plexus was found histologically. Three of the four patients who underwent surgery were initially tinnitus free, but pulsations recurred after 3 months in one patient.

Conclusion

Vascular loops in the internal auditory canal may generate pulsatile tinnitus. It may be treated by placing Teflon between the cochlea and the intrameatal vascular loop. One then does not hear the pulsation of the carotids due to a dampening effect of a pericarotid venous plexus.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as a first symptom of essential thrombocythemia [^116mYCXo]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2010). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is the sensation of sound inside the head and is a common symptom encountered daily by otorhinolaryngologists. Pulsatile tinnitus sufferers hear rhythmical noise at the same rate as a heartbeat and can present a diagnostic challenge. In this report, we present a 32-year-old patient with pulsatile tinnitus that led to the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. The symptom of pulsatile tinnitus allowed an early diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia and a more favorable prognosis. The case demonstrates the importance of blood tests for all patients who present with pulsatile tinnitus of unknown origin.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^115Wzg8Z]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the presence of internal auditory meatus vascular loops (IVLs) or vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact (CN8-NVC) between unexplained unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (PT) ears and contralateral asymptomatic ears. Furthermore, to investigate whether IVL depth or angulation, or CN8-NVC location is associated with the presence of PT.

Materials and methods

Single-centre retrospective case-controlled study of patients undergoing three-dimensional T2-weighted MRI for unexplained unilateral PT from January 2012 to July 2021. Two blinded observers recorded the presence of IVLs or CN8-NVCs, whilst evaluating IVL depth and angulation. Proportions of ears with IVLs or CN8-NVCs were compared between PT ears and contralateral control ears with McNemar's test. Mann–Whitney U or Student's t -test compared the depth and angulation of IVLs and the location of CN8-NVC with respect to the transition zone between ears with and without PT.

Results

Three hundred thirty-seven patients were evaluated (250 female; mean age 47 ± 16 years). There was no significant difference between the proportion of IVLs (19.3% vs 25.2%; p = 0.06) or CN8-NVCs (59.9% vs 65.6%; p = 0.12) in PT ears as compared to contralateral control ears. There was no significant difference in IVL depth (median loop-fundus distance 6.5 mm vs 6.8 mm; p = 0.45), IVL angulation (median interlimb distance 3.1 mm vs 3.3 mm; p = 0.54), or CN8-NVC location within the transition zone (p = 0.58) between ears with and without PT.

Conclusion

Unexplained unilateral PT is not associated with the presence of an ipsilateral IVL or CN8-NVC. Likelihood of PT is not influenced by depth or angulation of an ipsilateral IVL, nor by whether CN8-NVC is at the transition zone.

Key Points

Question The relevance of internal auditory meatus (IAM) vascular loops or vestibulocochlear NVC in the context of PT remains uncertain.

Findings Likelihood of unilateral PT was not influenced by the presence, depth, or angulation of IAM vascular loops, nor by the presence or location of vestibulocochlear NVC.

Clinical relevance This study argues against the analysis and reporting of IAM vascular loops or vestibulocochlear NVC in the context of PT, and it gives the clinician confidence to reassure the patient that these are unlikely to be an aetiology.

### Contemporary management of jugular paragangliomas [^1154Gqkv]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Jugular paragangliomas are generally benign slow-growing tumors that can cause pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, and cranial nerves neuropathy. Progressive growth can also lead to intracranial extension. Historically, the treatment of choice for these lesions has been gross total resection. However, over the last 15 years, many groups have adopted less invasive management strategies including stereotactic radiation therapy, subtotal resection, and primary observation in order to reduce treatment-associated morbidity. The focus of this article is to review the modern management of jugular paraganglioma, highlighting the evolving treatment paradigm at the Otology Group of Vanderbilt.

### Pulsatile tinnitus associated with internal carotid artery morphologic abnormalities [^112DGymh]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Internal carotid artery morphologic abnormalities mainly consist of tortuosities and coilings and can present with pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The purpose of this presentation is to report 3 representative cases and propose clinical and radiologic diagnostic criteria.

Patients

Three patients presenting with PT.

Intervention

Clinical evaluation including auscultation of the ear canal and head and neck. All patients underwent computed tomography angiography of the head and neck.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical evaluation, computed tomography angiography of the head and neck.

Results

Head bruit or objective tinnitus were detected in 2 patients. Symptoms of cerebral ischemia were absent. All patients were found to have tortuosities of the internal carotid arteries below the cranium base. One patient, in addition to tortuosity, had coiling as well.

Conclusion

Morphologic abnormalities of the internal carotid artery may be associated with PT. Proper clinical evaluation coupled with computed tomography angiography of the head and neck can differentiate these abnormalities from other more serious vascular etiologies.

### Pulsatile tinnitus caused by internal jugular phlebectasia in an adult [^111wqCDr]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Internal jugular phlebectasia is a rare condition. Children with internal jugular phlebectasia are often discovered by their parents when they notice a soft mass in the neck that appears when the child cries, coughs, or breathes deeply. Most internal jugular vein dilatations occur unilaterally on the right side according to the literature reports. To our knowledge, no other internal jugular phlebectasia patients reported pulsatile tinnitus as the major complaint without a soft mass in the neck. The authors reported a female adult patient with left-side internal jugular phlebectasia with pulsatile tinnitus as the major complaint without a soft mass in the neck. Internal jugular phlebectasia was diagnosed by color ultrasound of the internal jugular vein. Pure-tone audiometry, tympanometry, hemoglobin, thyroid function, and magnetic resonance imaging were made to differentiate other diseases that can cause the pulsatile tinnitus. Conservative treatment is recommended in this report. The possibility of internal jugular vein dilatation should be considered when differentiate the possible diseases that caused pulsatile tinnitus.

### Surgical management of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to jugular bulb or sigmoid sinus diverticulum with review of literature [^112xHZa5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Jugular bulb and sigmoid sinus anomalies are well-known causes of vascular pulsatile tinnitus. Common anomalies reported in the literature include high-riding and/or dehiscent jugular bulb, and sigmoid sinus dehiscence. However, cases of pulsatile tinnitus due to diverticulosis of the jugular bulb or sigmoid sinus are less commonly encountered, with the best management option yet to be established. In particular, reports on surgical management of pulsatile tinnitus caused by jugular bulb diverticulum have been lacking in the literature.

Objectives

To report two cases of pulsatile tinnitus with jugular bulb and/or sigmoid sinus diverticulum, and their management strategies and outcomes. In this series, we describe the first reported successful case of pulsatile tinnitus due to jugular bulb diverticulum that was surgically-treated.

Subjects and Methods

Two patients diagnosed with either jugular bulb and/or sigmoid sinus diverticulum, who had presented to the Otolaryngology clinic with pulsatile tinnitus between 2016 and 2017, were studied. Demographic and clinical data were obtained, including their management details and clinical outcomes.

Results

Two cases (one with jugular bulb diverticulum and one with both sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb diverticula) underwent surgical intervention, and both had immediate resolution of pulsatile tinnitus post-operatively. This was sustained at subsequent follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic, and there were no major complications encountered for both cases intra- and post-operatively.

Conclusion

Transmastoid reconstruction/resurfacing of jugular bulb and sigmoid sinus diverticulum with/without obliteration of the diverticulum is a safe and effective approach in the management of bothersome pulsatile tinnitus arising from these causes.

### Pulsatile tinnitus as the primary symptom in IIH: a distinct clinical entity [^113aiVeU]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) who present with pulsatile tinnitus (PT) to the Otolaryngology service with those with IIH who present with more classical symptoms to non-otolaryngologists.

Methods

Chart query confirmed all patients diagnosed with PT and IIH (by modified Friedman criteria). Cohort 1: Those who presented with PT as their chief complaint were evaluated by one of the otology team members, referred to neuro-ophthalmology, and subsequently diagnosed with IIH. Cohort 2: Those who presented initially with headaches and/or visual abnormalities to a nonotolaryngologist where they were diagnosed with IIH syndrome and subsequently referred to and evaluated by an otologist for associated PT. Demographic data recorded included age, sex, and BMI. Analyzed symptoms included the presence of headache and visual disturbances. Clinical findings such as papilledema and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurements and imaging findings were also examined.

Results

Forty (20 in each group) consecutive patients were included for analysis. All were female. Patients in Cohort 1 were statistically less likely to have visual symptoms (25% vs. 90%, p < 0.001) or papilledema (40% vs. 85%, p < 0.003). There was no difference in headache prevalence, though those in Cohort 1 were more likely to be mild. CSF opening pressure was lower in patients presenting with PT (29.2 ± 6.39 vs. 35.1 ± 10.8, p = 0.04).

Conclusions

Patients with IIH presenting with PT are a distinct entity from those with classic IIH. Clinicians must be aware so that appropriate management can be initiated.

### Imaging of pulsatile tinnitus [^114GeG41]. Radiographics (2024). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is a common complaint that approximately three-fourths of adults will experience at some point in their life. While for many it is a mild nuisance, for some it can be debilitating, affecting cognition and quality of life, increasing stress, and leading to anxiety, depression, and in severe circumstances even suicide. Pulsatile tinnitus refers to the perception of a heartbeat-like sound without external stimulus. Although less common than nonpulsatile tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus raises concern for underlying disease that can have a high risk of causing the patient harm if undiagnosed, and most of these patients will have positive findings at imaging. While these findings are often subtle, identifying them can have a meaningful impact on the patient's quality of life. The literature on pulsatile tinnitus is changing rapidly with improved imaging techniques and novel minimally invasive treatment options. A careful history and physical examination together with appropriate imaging are therefore critical in identifying the underlying cause. With emerging surgical, endovascular, and supportive technologies, the vast majority of patients with bothersome pulsatile tinnitus can be cured or have their symptoms ameliorated. The objective of this narrative review is to present a comprehensive analysis of the currently available literature on pulsatile tinnitus, with a focus on understanding its pathophysiologic mechanisms, diagnostic pathways, imaging findings, and the spectrum of available management strategies and ultimately to propose a structured framework that aids radiologists as well as clinicians in identifying an underlying diagnosis and guiding management of these patients. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

### Torrents of torment: turbulence as a mechanism of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to venous stenosis revealed by high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics [^1167Wsua]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a debilitating condition that can be caused by a vascular abnormality, such as an arterial or venous lesion. Although treatment of PT-related venous lesions has been shown to successfully cure patients of the associated 'tormenting' rhythmical sound, much controversy still exists regarding their role in the etiology of PT.

Methods

A patient presented with a history of worsening, unilateral PT. A partial venous sinus obstruction related to the large arachnoid granulation was detected on the right side, and subsequently stented at the right transverse sinus. High-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was performed on a 3D model digitally segmented from the pre-stent venogram, with assumed pulsatile flow rates. A post-stent CFD model was also constructed from this. Data-driven sonification was performed on the CFD velocity data, blinded to the patient's self-reported sounds.

Results

The patient reported that the PT was completely resolved after stenting, and has had no recurrence of the symptoms after more than 2 years. CFD simulation revealed highly disturbed, turbulent-like flow at the sigmoid sinus close to auditory structures, producing a sonified audio signal that reproduced the subjective sonance of the patient's PT. No turbulence or sounds were evident at the stenosis, or anywhere in the post-stent model.

Conclusions

For the first time, turbulence generated distal to a venous stenosis is shown to be a cause of PT. High-fidelity CFD may be useful for identifying patients with such 'torrents' of flow, to help guide treatment decision-making.

### Diagnostic approach to pulsatile tinnitus… [^115TXcEq]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Narsinh KH, Hui F, Saloner D, et al. Diagnostic Approach to Pulsatile Tinnitus: A Narrative Review. JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2022; 148: 476–483. doi: 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.4470 Importance Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom affecting millions of Americans and can be a harbinger of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy. Observations. An underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus can be identified in more than 70% of patients with a thorough evaluation. We advocate categorizing the myriad causes of pulsatile tinnitus into structural, metabolic, and vascular groups. Structural causes of pulsatile tinnitus include neoplasms and temporal bone pathologic abnormalities. Metabolic causes of pulsatile tinnitus include ototoxic medications and systemic causes of high cardiac output.

Vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus include idiopathic intracranial hypertension and dural arteriovenous fistulas. This categorization facilitates a practical evaluation, referral, and treatment pattern. Conclusions and Relevance Categorizing the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus ensures that dangerous causes of pulsatile tinnitus are not missed, and that patients receive the appropriate care from the proper specialist when needed.

### Reduced jet velocity in venous flow after CSF drainage: assessing hemodynamic causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^113ZzsHh]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is commonly associated with transverse sinus stenosis, a venous cause of pulsatile tinnitus. In patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, CSF drainage via lumbar puncture decreases intracranial pressure, which relieves the stenosis, and may provide at least temporary cessation of pulsatile tinnitus. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in venous blood flow caused by lowered intracranial pressure in patients with pulsatile tinnitus to help identify the cause of pulsatile tinnitus.

Materials and Methods

Ten patients with suspected transverse sinus stenosis as a venous etiology for pulsatile tinnitus symptoms underwent MR imaging before and after lumbar puncture in the same session. The protocol included flow assessment and rating of pulsatile tinnitus intensity before and after lumbar puncture and MR venography before lumbar puncture. Post-lumbar puncture MR venography was performed in 1 subject.

Results

There was a lumbar puncture-induced reduction in venous peak velocity that correlated with the opening pressure (r = -0.72, P = 0.019) without a concomitant reduction in flow rate. Patients with flow jets had their peak velocity reduced by 0.30 ± 0.18 m/s (P = 0.002), correlating with a reduction in CSF pressure (r = 0.82, P = 0.024) and the reduction in subjectively scored pulsatile tinnitus intensity (r = 0.78, P = 0.023). The post-lumbar puncture MR venography demonstrated alleviation of the stenosis.

Conclusions

Our results show a lumbar puncture-induced reduction in venous peak velocity without a concomitant reduction in flow rate. We hypothesize that the reduction is caused by the expansion of the stenosis after lumbar puncture. Our results further show a correlation between the peak velocity and pulsatile tinnitus intensity, suggesting the flow jet to be instrumental in the development of sound.

### Petrosquamosal sinus in the temporal bone as a cause of pulsatile tinnitus: a radiological detection [^112k7co4]. Clinical Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

We report a newly evidenced cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus — the petrosquamosal sinus in the temporal bone. We also present the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with an incapacitating objective pulsatile tinnitus in the left ear for 10 years. The radiology evidenced a petrosquamosal sinus in the air cells of the left temporal bone. The symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus disappeared completely after surgical treatment.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: a report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^117Jdchw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic arterial disease that has a variable presentation including pulsatile tinnitus (PT). The frequency and characteristics of PT in FMD are not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of PT in FMD and compare characteristics between patients with and without PT.

Methods and Results

Data were queried from the US Registry for FMD from 2009 to 2020. The primary outcomes were frequency of PT among the FMD population and prevalence of baseline characteristics, signs/symptoms, and vascular bed involvement in patients with and without PT. Of 2613 patients with FMD who were included in the analysis, 972 (37.2%) reported PT. Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression were performed to explore factors associated with PT. Compared with those without PT, patients with PT were more likely to have involvement of the extracranial carotid artery (90.0% versus 78.6%; odds ratio, 1.49; P = 0.005) and to have higher prevalence of other neurovascular signs/symptoms including headache (82.5% versus 62.7%; odds ratio, 1.82; P < 0.001), dizziness (44.9% versus 22.9%; odds ratio, 2.01; P < 0.001), and cervical bruit (37.5% versus 15.8%; odds ratio, 2.73; P < 0.001) compared with those without PT.

Conclusions

PT is common among patients with FMD. Patients with FMD who present with PT have higher rates of neurovascular signs/symptoms, cervical bruit, and involvement of the extracranial carotid arteries. The coexistence of the 2 conditions should be recognized, and providers who evaluate patients with PT should be aware of FMD as a potential cause.

### Pulsatile tinnitus due to stenosis of the marginal sinus: diagnosis and endovascular treatment [^112nv6qv]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Venous pulsatile tinnitus is a disabling condition mainly caused by a stenosis of the lateral sinus. Here, we aimed to report a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, stenosis of the marginal sinus.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed patients with isolated venous pulsatile tinnitus for which the suspected cause was a stenosis of the marginal sinus, treated or not, between January 2017 and December 2020. Patient charts and imaging were systematically reviewed. All patients underwent noncontrast temporal bone CT and MR imaging.

Results

Eight patients (7 women; median age, 36years) were included. Six patients (75%) were overweight, and 1 patient had idiopathic intracranial hypertension. All patients presented with a typical venous pulsatile tinnitus. The stenosis of the marginal sinus was detected using oblique reconstructions on postcontrast 3D MR imaging. There was no other pathologic finding except ipsilateral stenosis of the lateral sinus in 3 patients. Four patients underwent endovascular therapy with placement of a stent in the marginal sinus, leading to complete resolution of the pulsatile tinnitus for all of them. No complication occurred. Of note, the symptoms of intracranial hypertension also regressed after stent placement in that patient.

Conclusions

Marginal sinus stenosis is a novel cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, which can be easily detected on MR imaging. Marginal sinus stent placement is safe and efficient. We hypothesized that the marginal sinus stenosis pathophysiology is similar to that of lateral sinus stenosis, which is a common and well-known cause of venous pulsatile tinnitus, explaining the similar clinical presentation and endovascular management.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^113stWLL]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) — cardinal signs or symptoms include severe and/or chronic migraine headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, cervical bruit on exam, stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or amaurosis fugax, and unilateral head/neck pain or focal neurologic findings suggestive of a cervical artery dissection; possible symptoms include headaches (not chronic migraine or not migraine-type), tinnitus (not pulsatile), and dizziness/light-headedness. Chronic migraine is defined as headache occurring on 15 or more days/month for > 3 months, with at least 8 days/month having features of a migraine headache; for FMD, cervical bruits are best heard high in the neck at the level of the angle of the mandible and with the bell of the stethoscope, and among patients with FMD, TIA-like events should be distinguished from migraine with aura by a dedicated neurological assessment.

### Clinical predictors of pulsatile tinnitus in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: an age-matched cohort study [^112BWRHj]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) occurs in many but not all patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). It is poorly understood why some patients with IIH develop PT, yet others do not. The purpose of this study was to determine if any clinical findings differ between those with and without PT in IIH, potentially shedding light on a pathophysiologic mechanism.

Methods

Age-matched cohort analysis of patients with documented IIH and presence or absence of PT was performed, collecting data including body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, visual acuity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, sleep apnea, migraines, and transient visual obscurations, among others. Independent-sample t test and χ2 test were used to analyze continuous and binary variables, respectively, with multivariate analysis conducted including variables statistically significant on univariate analysis.

Results

Eighty subjects with IIH met the inclusion criteria (40 PT+, 40 PT-). CSF opening pressure showed no significant difference between the two groups. The PT+ cohort was found to have an average BMI of 45.1 kg/m², which was significantly higher than the PT- group (37.7 kg/m²; p = 0.0023). PT+ pulse pressure (60.1 mm Hg) was also significantly higher than the PT- group (51.6 mm Hg; p = 0.019). PT+ patients were also significantly more likely to have sleep apnea (p < 0.001) and migraines (p = 0.0036). Multiple logistic regression revealed an adjusted odds ratio of 13.9 for sleep apnea, 4.1 for migraines, and 1.01 for every increase in unit of BMI.

Conclusion

Among patients with IIH, presence of PT is associated with higher BMI and pulse pressure, and increased incidence of sleep apnea and migraines. Given no significant difference in CSF pressures between the two groups, PT may not be a product of increased disease severity but may be related to sequelae of obesity, such as increased pulse pressure and sleep apnea.

### Brain herniation (encephalocele) into arachnoid granulations: prevalence and association with pulsatile tinnitus and idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115BUF1n]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study describes the prevalence and clinical and imaging characteristics of BHAG in a large, consecutive cohort of patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation for PT. We identify two key observations in this analysis: First, BHAG are a relatively common imaging finding in PT patients, with a prevalence of 6% of this cohort. This suggests that BHAG may be underreported and/or underrecognized by neuroradiologists. Second, patients with PT and BHAG are significantly more likely to have underlying IIH than PT patients without BHAG (OR 4.2, CI 1.5–12, p = 0.006). The latter observation confirms the clinical importance of diagnosing BHAG, which should prompt evaluation for underlying IIH in this patient population. Radiologists, neurologists, otorhinolaryngologists, and other clinicians who care for patients with PT should be aware of this relationship to prevent blindness and other morbidity associated with untreated IIH.

The present data suggest that BHAG are likely an underrecognized entity in neuroimaging. This observed prevalence of BHAG in PT patients was substantially higher than a prior estimated prevalence of < 1% in the general population in a study of over 6000 MRI studies. Although BHAG pathogenesis remains obscure, several theories exist to explain their cause. Battal et al. recently described several potential etiologies including: (1) weakness in arachnoid granulations due to protruding veins; (2) transient increase in intracranial pressure; or (3) spontaneous herniation. Previous work has suggested an association between BHAG and increased intracranial pressure, but the association of BHAG in PT patients has not been reported. Our study also builds on prior investigations by showing, for the first time, a strong association between MR findings of BHAG and IIH (Fig. 2), which implies a pathophysiologic relationship between these entities as has previously been hypothesized.

### Management of vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus [^111wBZvf]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom affecting millions of Americans and can be a harbinger of hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. Careful diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is critical in providing optimal care and guiding the appropriate treatment strategy. When a vascular cause of pulsatile tinnitus has been established, attention must be focused on the patient's risk of hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, or blindness, as well as the risks of the available treatment options, in order to guide decision-making. Herein we review our approach to management of the vascular causes of pulsatile tinnitus and provide a literature review while highlighting gaps in our current knowledge and evidence basis.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^112F1nwL]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external stimulus. Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is perceived as a rhythmic sound at the rate of the cardiac cycle and is thought to represent 4–10% of tinnitus. Imaging is performed in order to identify the aetiology of PT, which may aid prognostication and target therapy. Evaluating the diagnostic yield of imaging in PT is challenging due to the heterogeneity of study designs, with rates of positive findings ranging from 44% to 91%. The most frequent abnormalities include paragangliomas, dural arteriovenous fistulae, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, venous anatomical variants and atheromatous disease. Both CT and MRI-based protocols with vascular imaging are recommended for the investigation of PT.

Previous authors have proposed that normal internal auditory meatus (IAM) vascular loops (VLs) may also be responsible for PT. Proposed mechanisms include neurovascular contact (NVC) and demyelination of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN8), reduced vascular perfusion and increased transmission of pulsatile sound from turbulent blood flow through the cerebrospinal fluid. The IAM internal auditory meatus vascular loop (IVLs) usually arise from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and may be seen as an anatomical variant in 10%. IVLs and CN8 NVC are optimally evaluated with three-dimensional (3D) fast spin echo or gradient echo high-resolution (HR) T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequences, and this may be a justification for the inclusion of these sequences in PT MRI protocols.

### Bilateral carotid endarterectomy as treatment of vascular pulsatile tinnitus [^111EZXXG]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Atherosclerotic carotid artery disease (ACAD) is a rare but recognized cause of pulsatile tinnitus. Existing literature of reported cure for pulsatile tinnitus is reviewed. We found: (1) a male preponderance exists; (2) ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for tinnitus is 92% (12 of 13) effective; (3) proximal lesions lend themselves to CEA whereas distal lesions have been treated by stenting; (4) overall 68% (15 of 22) are cured by intervention; and (5) 89% (17 of 19) can expect immediate relief. We now present a case of bilateral pulsatile tinnitus relieved by bilateral carotid endarterectomy.

### Intraparotid superficial temporal artery arteriovenous malformation causing persistent pulsatile tinnitus [^111U7Wwp]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This article discusses the diagnosis, imaging workup, and management of a rare cause of pulsatile tinnitus: intraparotid arteriovenous malformation.

Patient

A single patient with a superficial temporal arteriovenous malformation diagnosed by carotid duplex causing pulsatile tinnitus that failed initial surgical management. Repeat imaging failed to identify a cause for the persistent tinnitus.

Intervention

Reoperation with a parotid approach based on physical exam findings.

Results

Removal of a more proximal arteriovenous malformation in the parotid gland resulted in long-term resolution of the patient's pulsatile tinnitus.

Conclusions

Physical examination is essential in the workup and management of pulsatile tinnitus. Imaging is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of pulsatile tinnitus but should not be solely relied upon.

### Imaging of tinnitus [^115WgiYw]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

From a radiologic workup perspective, tinnitus is classified into pulsatile, which can be objective, and nonpulsatile, which is typically subjective. There is considerable discrepancy within the literature regarding the percentage of positive findings in patients with pulsatile tinnitus. The authors discuss the overlap in the radiographic findings detected in association with tinnitus in both asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients and the importance for imaging to detect treatable causes. They discuss imaging related to diagnosis and treatment and provide an imaging workup algorithm.

### Lateralized carotid artery: an unusual cause of pulsatile tinnitus [^116cgsyN]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2001). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a patient who had a pulsatile tinnitus that was caused by a laterally displaced internal carotid artery. Her condition was treated with the use of a hearing did, which suppressed the tinnitus. We also review the literature on laterally displaced internal carotid arteries, and discuss their differentiation from a congenitally aberrant artery.

### Dying art of a history and physical: pulsatile tinnitus [^1112D4ci]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Modern medicine often leaves the history and physical by the wayside. Physicians instead skip directly to diagnostic modalities like MRI and angiography. In this case report, we discuss a patient who presented with migraine symptoms. Auscultation revealed signs of pulsatile tinnitus. Further imaging concluded that it was secondary to a type I dural arteriovenous fistula. Thanks to a proper and thorough history and physical, the patient was streamlined into an accurate and efficient work-up leading to symptomatic relief and quality of life improvement. Imaging is a powerful adjunctive technique in modern medicine, but physicians must not rely on machines to diagnose their patients. If this trend continues, it will have a tremendous negative impact on the cost and calibre of healthcare. Our hope is that this case will spread awareness in the medical community, urging physicians to use the lost art of a history and physical.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^112WNEU5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is abnormal perception of sound and has many subtypes. Clinical evaluation, audiometry, and otoscopy should be performed before ordering any imaging, as the choice of imaging will depend on various factors. Type of tinnitus (pulsatile or nonpulsatile) and otoscopy findings of a vascular retrotympanic lesion are key determinants to guide the choice of imaging studies. High-resolution CT temporal bone is an excellent tool to detect glomus tumors, abnormal course of vessels, and some other abnormalities when a vascular retrotympanic lesion is seen on otoscopy. CTA or a combination of MR and MRA/MRV are used to evaluate arterial or venous abnormalities like dural arteriovenous fistula, arteriovenous malformation, carotid stenosis, dural sinus stenosis, and bony abnormalities like sigmoid sinus wall abnormalities in cases of pulsatile tinnitus without a vascular retrotympanic lesion. MR of the brain is excellent in detecting mass lesions such as vestibular schwannomas in cases of unilateral nonpulsatile tinnitus. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Occipital artery anastomosis to vertebral artery causing pulsatile tinnitus [^116NVjLr]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus can result from various vascular etiologies that cause transmission of pulsatile turbulent flow into the inner ear. Less commonly, non-vascular sources cause increased blood flow and transmission of sound perceived as tinnitus. Thorough clinical examination leads to appropriate imaging evaluation and therapeutic planning. Most pulsatile tinnitus results from expected mechanisms, such as dural arteriovenous fistula, jugular bulb dehiscence, or paraganglioma; however, the literature contains reports of numerous rare causes, particularly variant anatomic morphologies. We present the case of a novel cause of pulsatile tinnitus in which collateral vascular flow compensated for decreased normal intracranial cerebral arterial supply and might have caused catastrophic consequences if intervened upon after assumptions based on an incomplete evaluation.

### Imaging in pulsatile tinnitus [^1175iUqm]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Tinnitus may be continuous or pulsatile. Vascular lesions are the most frequent radiologically demonstrable cause of pulsatile tinnitus. These include congenital vascular anomalies (which may be arterial or venous), vascular tumours, and a variety of acquired vasculopathies. The choice of imaging depends on the clinical findings. If a mass is present at otoscopy, thin-section computed tomography (CT) is indicated. In the otoscopically normal patient, there is a range of possible imaging approaches. However, combined CT angiography and venography is particularly useful.

### Endovascular treatment of pulsatile tinnitus due to superior petrous sinus stenosis and superior semicircular canal dehiscence [^111QNDwc]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a debilitating symptom that can have many different origins.1 2 In most cases, an underlying cause can be identified and venous stenting is an effective treatment for vascular causes such as dural sinus stenosis.3 Superior semicircular canal dehiscence4 5 by the superior petrosal sinus (SPS) is a rare cause of pulsatile tinnitus.6 Surgery is effective for improving symptoms but it is invasive and has a higher rate of complications.7 Endovascular treatment should be considered as an alternative to surgery for these cases. 8 We describe a case of pulsatile tinnitus secondary to an SPS stenosis and dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal (video 1).neurintsurg; jnis-2025–023185v1/V1F1V1Video 1Superior petrous sinus stenting. Stenting of the SPS was performed under conscious sedation after a clear reduction of pulsatile tinnitus following the temporary partial deployment of the stent. Follow-ups demonstrated patency of the stent with the persistent complete resolution of tinnitus. This case illustrates the utility of temporary stent deployment under conscious sedation to establish causality between SPS stenosis and pulsatile tinnitus.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^112GG84p]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — mental health, cognition, and core clinical evaluation elements include table-directed actions and narrative guidance. For mental health symptoms, the table lists "Referral to mental health professionals for assessment and treatment of depression and/or anxiety; urgent referral for suicidal patients", and for apparent cognitive impairments, "The presence of dementia will affect the results of tinnitus and audiologic assessments". The guideline further states that "Clinicians who evaluate patients with tinnitus should document the presence or absence of symptoms and conditions that dictate the need for referral to otolaryngology, audiology, and related specialties" and that "The history should include the details of onset of tinnitus, the duration of symptoms, and the effects of the tinnitus on patient QOL" with characteristics "including laterality and pulsatile nature". It advises that "Auditory phenomena such as hallucinations should be excluded" and that "Ototoxic agents, including common over-the-counter medications such as aspirin (in high doses), can cause tinnitus", with "Potential exposure to such ototoxic agents or suspect medications" and "A history of excessive alcohol, caffeine, or tobacco use" to be discussed or elicited. It adds that "An appropriate clinical evaluation should occur early to direct the need for and the type of additional testing and treatment" and that "the patient encounter should identify any severe coexisting mental illness, such as depression or dementia, as these patients may need expedited referral and management", while noting that "the examination should be directed to identify secondary tinnitus, with potentially treatable or explainable causes, as well as to find signs of serious disease".

### Treatment of venous pulsatile tinnitus in younger women [^112UDj8n]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We present 7 cases of pulsatile tinnitus (PT) of venous origin in younger women seen over a period of 24 years and treated by Internal Jugular Bulb ligation.

Methods

All patients had a pulsatile bruit in one side of the neck that disappeared when gentle pressure over the internal jugular vein (IJV) caused it to collapse as seen in a duplex scan. Their computed tomography showed a dominant venous system with a high jugular bulb on the side of the bruit.

Results

The IJV was ligated under local anesthesia. Five patients in whom the ligation was done above the facial vein were cured. Two patients in whom the ligation was done below the facial vein experienced a decrease but not disappearance of the PT.

Conclusions

Once other possible causes for PT have been discarded, ligation of the IJV above the facial vein cures this condition.

- pulsatile tinnitus

- focal neurological abnormalities

- asymmetric hearing loss.

### Imaging of pulsatile tinnitus: a review of 74 patients [^112gZAr4]. Clinical Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of imaging modalities in detecting the underlying pathologies in patients with pulsatile tinnitus.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-four patients with pulsatile tinnitus were radiologically evaluated. All patients except two are evaluated on a thin-section bone algorithm computed tomography scan covering the temporal bone and skull base, 14 patients with or without contrast-enhanced brain computed tomography, 7 patients with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, 5 patients with digital subtraction angiography, and 12 patients with Doppler ultrasonography.

Results

The underlying pathology of tinnitus was detected in 50 patients (67.6%), and 24 patients were normal with radiologic studies. The most common cause was high jugular bulbus (21%) followed by atherosclerosis, dehiscent jugular bulbus, aneurysm of internal carotid artery, dural arteriovenous fistula, aberrant internal carotid artery, jugular diverticulum, and glomus tumor.

Conclusion

It was concluded that radiologic imaging methods are effective in detecting the underlying pathology of pulsatile tinnitus.

### ESR essentials: diagnostic strategies in tinnitus-practice recommendations by the European society of head and neck radiology [^115fh5BT]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is common, with approximately 1/4 of the elderly population experiencing chronic tinnitus. While non-pulsatile tinnitus usually has no structural cause, pulsatile tinnitus is more likely to have an identifiable aetiology, and imaging plays a key role in the search for treatable and life-threatening causes. Since the characteristics of the tinnitus guide the diagnostic strategy, a detailed clinical assessment should always be performed before imaging is considered. In the setting of non-pulsatile tinnitus, imaging with MRI should only be performed if it is unilateral or asymmetric, or when it is associated with focal neurologic abnormalities or asymmetric hearing loss. In contrast, imaging investigation is always required in the presence of pulsatile tinnitus. Whilst there are specific clinical features in which temporal bone CT will be the initial imaging strategy for pulsatile tinnitus (e.g., retrotympanic mass or conductive hearing loss), most patients will require either CT or MRI with arterial and venous imaging. The clinical categorisation of pulsatile tinnitus as "arterial" or "venous" may guide the radiological search and help understand the significance of certain imaging findings (e.g., venous variants). Significant pathology (e.g., dural arteriovenous malformation) must be excluded in the context of objective pulsatile tinnitus and may require additional cross-sectional imaging; conventional angiography is now rarely indicated. KEY POINTS: In patients with unilateral, non-pulsatile tinnitus, MRI should be performed to rule out retrocochlear disease. All patients with pulsatile tinnitus should be imaged and the clinical assessment guides the selection of the most appropriate imaging technique. If the first imaging study does not reveal the suspected cause of objective pulsatile tinnitus, additional imaging investigations should be performed to exclude alternative diagnoses.

### CT arteriography and venography in the evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus with normal otoscopic examination [^112SmDfQ]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Our retrospective study aims to assess the ability of computed tomography arteriography and venography (CT A/V) to detect various findings that suggest a potential cause of pulsatile tinnitus and to examine the association between these findings and the side of pulsatile tinnitus.

Study Design

A retrospective review of CT arteriography and venography of 32 patients with established pulsatile tinnitus and normal otoscopic examination was performed. The scans were performed using a 64-slice multidetector scanner and were reviewed to look for findings that are known to cause pulsatile tinnitus.

Results

One or more findings that are known to cause pulsatile tinnitus were detected on the symptomatic side in 30 patients; on the asymptomatic side in 3 patients, one patient with bilateral pulsatile tinnitus showed a potential cause of symptoms only on one side, and in one patient no potential cause could be identified. There is a significant association seen between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and various potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus detected (P < 0.001), between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and various potential venous cause detected (P < 0.001), and between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and the side of dominant venous system (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

CT arteriography and venography is a useful tool in detecting many described potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus. Significant association is demonstrated between the side of pulsatile tinnitus and the potential causes of pulsatile tinnitus detected by CT arteriography and venography when the otoscopic examination is normal.

### Metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as unilateral pulsatile tinnitus: a case report [^116HJzrF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare symptom, yet it may herald life-threatening pathology in the absence of other symptoms or signs. Pulsatile tinnitus tends to imply a vascular cause, but metastatic disease also can present in this way. Clinicians should therefore adopt a specific diagnostic algorithm for pulsatile tinnitus and always consider the possibility of metastatic disease. A history of malignant disease and new cranial nerve palsies should raise clinical suspicion for skull base metastases. We describe the case of a 63-year-old woman presenting with unilateral subjective pulsatile tinnitus and a middle ear mass visible on otoscopy. Her background included the diagnosis of idiopathic unilateral vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsies 4 years previously, with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Repeat MRI and computed tomography imaging were consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. This case raises important questions about imaging protocols and the role of serial scanning in patients at high risk of metastatic disease.

### Cerebrovascular pulsatile tinnitus: causes, treatments, and outcomes in 164 patients with neuroangiographic correlation [^114NkeQf]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) can cause significant detriment to quality of life and may herald a life-threatening condition. Endovascular evaluation is the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of PT and facilitates treatment. However, no large study has determined the distribution of causes and treatment outcomes of PT evaluated endovascularly.

Methods

Consecutive patients evaluated at a multidisciplinary PT clinic from a single academic center were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a suspected cerebrovascular etiology of PT based on clinical and/or non-invasive imaging, who were evaluated by endovascular techniques (arteriography, venography, manometry, and/or balloon test occlusion), were included in analysis. Baseline clinical features and treatment results by final etiology of PT were compared.

Results

Of 552 patients referred for PT evaluation, 164 patients (29.7%) who underwent endovascular evaluation of PT were included. Mean (± SD) age at first clinical evaluation was 54.3 ± 14.1 years (range 25–89 years); 111 patients (67.7%) were female. PT causes were 75.6% vascular and 24.4% non-vascular. Arteriovenous shunting lesions caused 20.7% of cases, venous etiologies 48.2%, and arterial etiologies 6.7%. Of patients with a shunting lesion treated with endovascular embolization, 96.9% had lasting significant improvement or resolution in PT. Endovascular stenting for venous sinus stenosis gave 84.6% of patients lasting improvement or resolution in PT. Arterial and non-vascular PT had fewer patients treated endovascularly and less improvement in PT symptoms.

Conclusion

PT with a suspected vascular cause is most often attributable to venous etiologies. PT caused by arteriovenous shunting or venous sinus stenosis may be effectively treated endovascularly.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^111dQzbY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — key medical history items with immediate implications (Table 6) include the following: For unilateral tinnitus, the table lists the implication "Referral for comprehensive audiologic assessment and an otologic evaluation; additional testing such as imaging where indicated". For pulsatile tinnitus, it states "Consider cardiovascular and general physical examination (hypertension, heart murmurs, carotid bruits, venous hums); examination of the head and neck for signs of vascular tumors or other lesions; comprehensive audiology; imaging and other testing where indicated". For hearing loss, it specifies "Referral for comprehensive audiology; otologic evaluation to look for the wide range of pathologies that could cause hearing loss associated with tinnitus; consider hearing aid evaluation when indicated". For sudden onset of hearing loss with tinnitus, the implication is "See sudden SNHL guideline".

### Toward a diagnostic imaging algorithm for undifferentiated pulsatile tinnitus [^116mmKTr]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Decisions around the diagnostic evaluation for pulsatile tinnitus (PT) remain challenging. We describe the usage patterns and diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities and propose an evidence-based diagnostic approach for undifferentiated PT.

Study Design

Retrospective.

Setting

Single otology/neurotology clinic.

Subjects

Patients with PT presenting between 2009 and 2020.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic yield, and diagnostic accuracy.

Results

A total of 315 subjects met inclusion criteria (74% female, mean ± SD age = 52 ± 17 years). Subjects were divided into four cohorts based on exam findings: normal (n = 229), venous cohort (n = 34), arterial cohort (n = 16), and outer/middle ear pathology cohort (n = 40). In total, 53% of patients received a nonidiopathic diagnosis for PT. The most common identifiable cause was sigmoid sinus dehiscence (78%) in the venous cohort, carotid stenosis (36%) in the arterial cohort, and glomus tumor (56%) in the outer/middle ear pathology cohort. There was a higher diagnostic rate among patients with positive exam findings compared to those with unrevealing exams (p = 0.04). Imaging studies with the highest diagnostic yield were computed tomography (CT) venography (44%), formal angiography (42%), and magnetic resonance venography (40%); studies with the highest specificity were formal angiography (0.82), CT angiography (0.67), and CT venography (0.67). A diagnostic algorithm is proposed.

Conclusions

Reaching a diagnosis in patients with PT requires a systematic approach, taking into account both clinical and radiographic information. Physical examination is a key first step for differentiating patients into venous, arterial, and other cohorts to narrow down the likely pathology and determine which radiographic studies have the highest yield and accuracy.

### Association of fibromuscular dysplasia and pulsatile tinnitus: a report of the US registry for fibromuscular dysplasia [^111p3Hcg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The cause of PT in patients with FMD remains unclear. PT can be caused by vascular disorders including stenosis or tortuosity of the carotid artery, intraluminal webs resulting in turbulent flow, and other vascular abnormalities including aneurysms, dissections, or arteriovenous fistulas, all potentially present in patients with FMD. Another potential contributor to PT in patients with FMD is the presence of an S‐curve, or extreme arterial tortuosity, of the internal carotid artery, resulting in turbulent blood flow and PT. A review of 116 patients with FMD found 32% of patients had an S‐curve present in the internal carotid artery. We are unable to comment on the prevalence of S‐curve presence in this study, as these data are not collected by the US Registry. Notably, carotid involvement in FMD is typically in the mid or distal artery, close to the ear, which may be a contributing factor. From the non‐FMD literature, other factors associated with PT include nonvascular disorders such as intracranial tumors, intracranial hypertension, and sarcoidosis. However, in many cases of PT, there is no clear cause. In a single‐center review of 84 patients with PT, 68% of patients were found to have an underlying etiology, usually vascular in nature; however, an underlying etiology could not be identified in the remaining 32% of patients. Among patients with PT in this study, 22.9% were found to have a carotid or vertebral dissection, 8.8% had a carotid or vertebral aneurysm, and 37.5% had a cervical bruit, a manifestation of turbulence. Still, approximately one‐third of the patients did not have any associated vascular findings, consistent with prior studies. Another potential contributor to PT is antihypertensive medications; however, in this study, antihypertensive medications were used less in patients with FMD presenting with PT compared with those without PT. Indeed, additional research to better understand both FMD and its relationship to PT is needed.

### Diagnostic approach to tinnitus [^115cUJuX]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Tinnitus is a common disorder with many possible causes. Most cases of tinnitus are subjective, but occasionally the tinnitus can be heard by an examiner. Otologic problems, especially hearing loss, are the most common causes of subjective tinnitus. Common causes of conductive hearing loss include external ear infection, cerumen impaction, and middle ear effusion. Sensorineural hearing loss may be caused by exposure to excessive loud noise, presbycusis, ototoxic medications, or Meniere's disease. Unilateral hearing loss plus tinnitus should increase suspicion for acoustic neuroma. Subjective tinnitus also may be caused by neurologic, metabolic, or psychogenic disorders. Objective tinnitus usually is caused by vascular abnormalities of the carotid artery or jugular venous systems. Initial evaluation of tinnitus should include a thorough history, head and neck examination, and audiometric testing to identify an underlying etiology. Unilateral or pulsatile tinnitus may be caused by more serious pathology and typically merits specialized audiometric testing and radiologic studies. In patients who are discomforted by tinnitus and have no remediable cause, auditory masking may provide some relief.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^116GiXry]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — general examination approach specifies core components and associated comorbidity assessment. A routine examination of the head and neck, including careful otoscopy, is the focus of such an examination, and a focused neurologic examination should exclude motor and/or sensory deficits as well as cranial nerve issues that may accompany central nervous system lesions. When pulsatile tinnitus is reported, the examination should focus on identification of cardiovascular disease and vascular lesions, and a full head and neck examination, a general cardiovascular examination, and auscultation/palpation of the head and neck, the skull and mastoid prominences, and orbits should be part of this evaluation. The examination may find treatable otologic conditions that cause tinnitus; cerumen impaction or other ear canal obstructions are diagnosed with otoscopy. Tinnitus can occur in patients with middle ear disease, with or without resultant conductive hearing loss, such as that caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction, otitis media, or otosclerosis, and disorders of the cochlear or vestibular apparatus, such as Ménière's disease (endolymphatic hydrops) and superior canal dehiscence, can cause tinnitus. Vestibular schwannoma can cause tinnitus as well, and tinnitus can occur with medical conditions not directly associated with the ear, including vascular tumors, palatal/middle ear myoclonus, intracranial hypertension, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Emotional distress and/or disturbance of sleep are often associated with severe tinnitus, and the initial history and physical examination should also include assessment of possible associated emotional disturbance or psychiatric illness, which is crucial for patients who may be severely depressed.

### Pulsatile tinnitus, not nocturnal palpitations… [^114yHcsh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — A recent answer submitted by Dr Abrams1 does not seem to fit the question asked. The heading for this particular question and answer is "Nocturnal Palpitations. " The answer is certainly appropriate for this heading; however, the question asked concerns a hypertensive patient who hears his pulse in his ear. This symptom is best described as pulsatile tinnitus, an auditory sensation. This sensation can be further classified into subjective pulsatile tinnitus, heard only by the patient and not the examiner, and objective pulsatile tinnitus, heard by both the patient and the examiner. Auscultation should be performed by the physician, listening both in the external auditory canal, superior and posterior to the ear, and in the neck area. This type of symptom may represent one of the earliest indications of various problems, such as a carotid bruit, an arteriovenous malformation or fistula, a glomus tumor of the middle. Britton BH.

### Understanding idiopathic intracranial hypertension: mechanisms, management, and future directions [^112kwxk2]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure that predominantly affects young, obese women. Pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, but several causal factors have been proposed. Symptoms can include headaches, visual loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and back and neck pain, but the clinical presentation is highly variable. Although few studies have been done to support evidence-based management, several recent advances have the potential to enhance understanding of the causes of the disease and to guide treatment decisions. Investigators of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) reported beneficial effects of acetazolamide in patients with mild visual loss. Studies have also established weight loss as an effective disease-modifying treatment, and further clinical trials to investigate new treatments are underway. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is expected to increase as rates of obesity increase; efforts to reduce diagnostic delays and identify new, effective approaches to treatment will be key to meeting the needs of a growing number of patients.

### Non-invasive imaging modalities for diagnosing pulsatile tinnitus: a comprehensive review and recommended imaging algorithm [^116V9A83]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a challenging diagnostic condition arising from various vascular, neoplastic, and systemic disorders. Non-invasive imaging is essential for identifying underlying causes while minimizing risks of invasive diagnostic angiography. Although no consensus exists on the primary imaging modality for PT and currently CT, ultrasound, and MRI are used in the diagnostic pathway, MRI is increasingly preferred as the first-line screening test for its diagnostic efficacy and safety. MRI protocols such as time-of-flight, magnetic resonance angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, and arterial spin labeling can identify serious causes, including vascular shunting lesions, venous sinus stenosis, and tumors. In this narrative review of the current literature we discuss the benefits and limitations of various non-invasive imaging modalities in identifying the characteristic imaging findings of the most common causes of PT and also provide an algorithm that clinicians can use to guide the imaging evaluation.

### Vertebro-vertebral fistula presenting as a pulsatile tinnitus [^112v3Ucd]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external acoustic stimulus, resulting in an estimated prevalence of 10% to 15% in adults. Tinnitus may be classified as pulsatile (PT) or continuous (non-PT), and may be subjective (heard only by the patient) or objective (also audible to the examiner). PT is usually related to vascular causes and is pulse synchronous (coinciding with the patient's heartbeat). PT is much less common affecting approximately 4% of patients with tinnitus, but unlike non-PT, usually has a specific identifiable cause. We present a case of a man without previous otological disease or head trauma, with a left-ear subjective PT. MR angiography detected a left vertebro-vertebral arteriovenous fistula, which was treated by endovascular embolisation with important symptomatic relief.

### Clinical practice guideline: allergic rhinitis [^115V3KfP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus — vascular and neoplastic causes and evaluation are detailed. "Pulsatile tinnitus can be caused by intracranial hypertension, neoplasms, and vascular disorders" and "Paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors, can cause tinnitus", with distribution noted as "3% of nonadrenal paragangliomas are in the head and neck". Presentation data include "Patients with glomus tumors commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus (80%), whereas some present with hearing loss (60%)", and "Tinnitus from these lesions is usually unilateral". Regarding vascular loops, a systematic review "showed that such loops were 80 times more common in patients with pulsatile tinnitus than those with nonpulsatile tinnitus". In light of these issues, "the patient with pulsatile tinnitus should have a thorough medical evaluation to rule out systemic cardiovascular or neurologic disease", with examples including "hyperthyroidism, hypertriglyceridemia, vascular stenoses and aneurysms, and coronary artery disease".

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^1178QAVj]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Clues from the history

Headaches are common and can be highly variable (see later). They may be of new onset or more chronic, particularly in those with previous migraine. Visual symptoms include blurred or double vision. Patients can describe transient loss of vision and/or 'greying out' of vision: so-called 'transient visual obscurations'. They usually relate to postural changes; and are usually brief, typically only seconds. Patients may report horizontal diplopia from a false-localising abducens nerve palsy. There may be pulsatile tinnitus — a rhythmic 'whooshing' sound heard in either or both ears synchronous with the patient's heartbeat, and often present only on lying down. Many patients do not volunteer this symptom unless directly asked.

### First international consensus on the diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia [^116UHnpQ]. Vascular Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Headache and pulsatile tinnitus in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are common; significant headache was reported in 67.5% of patients, with migraines the most frequent type (38% of patients in the US Registry; 28% in ARCADIA), and pulsatile tinnitus was reported as a presenting symptom in 32% of patients. For migraine in FMD, management may include lifestyle modification, preventive therapies, and abortive medications, but particular caution is advised in prescribing triptans, ergots, and other vasoconstrictive agents, especially in those with prior cervical artery dissection (CeAD) or SCAD in whom these agents may be contraindicated; consultation with audiology and otolaryngology may help evaluate hearing and other causes of pulsatile tinnitus.
