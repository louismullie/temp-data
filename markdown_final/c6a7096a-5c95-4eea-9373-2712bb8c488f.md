## Question

pronostic value of seizures post cardiac arrest

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognostic value of seizures after cardiac arrest in adult patients who remain comatose, and how to apply this information clinically, including the use of EEG-based monitoring and relevant guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and scope, including clinical versus electrographic seizures and the time windows of assessment. Then, I should verify what high-quality contemporary guidelines say about using seizures for prognostication. Next, I will review key studies and meta-analyses for prognostic performance and specificity, paying close attention to confounders like sedation and timing. After that, I should distinguish seizure features with high prognostic specificity from those with uncertain or limited value. Then, I will integrate EEG timing, monitoring strategies, and the concept of multimodal prognostication. Finally, I will translate this into practical bedside actions, including when and how to treat seizures, and conclude with a balanced synthesis and cautions about false positives and late recovery.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and scope so I don't conflate concepts. Clinical seizures in this context include myoclonus, tonic–clonic events, and status epilepticus observed at the bedside, whereas electrographic seizures are defined on EEG by evolving rhythmic discharges meeting ACNS criteria, and the term "seizures" in prognostication literature often spans discrete seizures, status epilepticus, and periodic/rhythmic patterns on the ictal–interictal continuum, all of which need to be interpreted with respect to background continuity and reactivity and the timing relative to arrest and rewarming.

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before jumping to conclusions. The 2025 AHA guidelines advise that the prognostic value of seizures per se in comatose post–cardiac arrest adults is uncertain when evaluated with other prognostic tests, but status epilepticus persisting at or beyond 72 hours, particularly when assessed alongside other indices, can support an unfavorable prognosis; conversely, absence of seizures should not be used to predict favorable outcome, and prognostication should remain multimodal and delayed until confounders are cleared [^111x8vhu] [^113hitX4]. The 2021 ERC/ESICM guidance similarly cautions against relying on isolated EEG features and recommends integrating seizures/status epilepticus with other predictors, with particular caution early after arrest and during therapeutic hypothermia due to confounding by sedatives and temperature effects [^113pJTTT] [^113pJTTT].

> I should confirm the epidemiology and general prognostic signal from observational cohorts. Clinical seizures occur in roughly 20–30% of comatose survivors, myoclonus predominates, and their presence correlates with worse outcomes, though with imperfect specificity and sensitivity; in the TTM-trial post hoc analysis, myoclonic seizures were the most common and most predictive, with a false positive rate for poor outcome around 4.3%, but two patients with status myoclonus ultimately recovered, reminding me not to overcall based on myoclonus alone [^112fasVs] [^11281YFX]. Earlier and later seizures both carried adverse prognostic implications in that cohort, yet both can rarely be compatible with good recovery when viewed in isolation [^11281YFX].

> Hold on, I should verify which EEG-defined seizure features carry the strongest negative prognostic weight. Highly malignant EEG patterns — burst suppression or suppression with generalized periodic discharges — are consistently associated with poor outcome with very high specificity, often approaching 98–100% in multiple cohorts when recorded after rewarming and off confounders; these patterns should be interpreted only in combination with other tests and after clearance of sedatives and metabolic derangements to avoid false positives [^112KGJHm] [^11146PF4] [^114Z37AG]. The 2025 AHA guideline also supports using burst suppression off sedation at 72 hours or more as part of a multimodal assessment for unfavorable prognosis, reinforcing that these are late, corroborated findings rather than early standalone signals [^112Bs2m5].

> But wait, what if the seizures are on a relatively preserved background or appear later after rewarming? I need to check for exceptions. A substantial minority of patients with postanoxic status epilepticus can recover, particularly when EEG background continuity is preserved, reactivity is present, and there are no additional poor-outcome markers; pooled and cohort analyses suggest that in selected patients without two or more classic poor-prognosis predictors, roughly 8–25% may achieve good functional outcomes, especially when SE is halted and background continuity improves over time [^115KvU4Z] [^116E2TTe]. Let me reconsider the TTM-era data too: in one prospective series, 2 of 33 patients with PSE recovered with favorable outcomes, indicating that PSE alone is not universally fatal, albeit with low sensitivity for good outcome and high overall mortality in the broader cohort [^114aP8ZB].

> I should double-check the timing and monitoring strategy because detection sensitivity matters. Continuous EEG for up to 48–72 hours detects epileptiform activity, including nonconvulsive seizures, far more reliably than brief spot EEGs; brief intermittent EEG misses most potentially treatable seizures and can delay detection by roughly 11–12 hours compared with continuous monitoring, which can materially affect both treatment and prognostication timelines [^114C1C9M] [^114HT432] [^1132PwPz]. However, continuous EEG adds only modest incremental prognostic information over intermittent EEG when integrated into multimodal models, so the key is to ensure adequate duration and timely interpretation rather than assuming continuous monitoring will independently resolve prognostic uncertainty [^114C1C9M] [^114HT432].

> Next, I should review how to integrate seizures into a multimodal prognostication framework. No single test, including seizures or status epilepticus, should dictate withdrawal decisions; instead, seizures should be weighed alongside brainstem reflexes, SSEPs, serum biomarkers such as NSE or neurofilament light, and neuroimaging, with the most robust negative predictors being bilaterally absent pupillary/corneal reflexes and bilaterally absent N20 responses, typically assessed after 48–72 hours off confounders; when multiple concordant poor-outcome signs are present, the confidence in a poor prognosis increases substantially [^111r8KMg] [^116GDX62] [^117XwYyB]. Conversely, a continuous or nearly continuous normal-voltage EEG background without seizures or abundant periodic discharges within 72 hours, especially when corroborated by other favorable indices, supports a meaningful chance of good recovery and should prompt continued aggressive care and reassessment rather than early WLST [^111ij9qU] [^113RhjDU].

> I will now examine practical bedside management so I don't conflate prognostication with treatment decisions. Clinically apparent seizures should be treated promptly after ROSC, and nonconvulsive seizures detected on EEG should be considered for treatment; however, routine prophylaxis is not recommended given lack of benefit and potential harms, and the choice of antiseizure medications can mirror those used for other etiologies, with levetiracetam and valproate commonly used first-line in the ICU setting [^111nuRJq] [^112i6zjd] [^111rYU2C] [^112ggLTo]. Let me verify the caveat: while aggressive suppression of status epilepticus is feasible in many patients, the TELSTAR randomized approach achieved electrographic control without improving 3‑month outcomes in a cohort with very high rates of poor outcomes, so treatment should be framed as potentially beneficial but not guaranteed to alter prognosis, and decisions to escalate should be individualized within a multimodal prognostic context [^113HxWkE].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that early myoclonus alone predicts poor outcome with near certainty. I should correct that. The AHA 2025 guideline explicitly notes that the prognostic usefulness of undifferentiated myoclonus within 72 hours is uncertain, and emerging literature shows that myoclonus phenotypes, timing, and associated EEG background matter; some patients with early myoclonus recover, particularly when EEG background is continuous and reactive, so I need to avoid anchoring on myoclonus without EEG correlation and full multimodal assessment [^111bAeeY] [^112FWRyL] [^114qfwpR].

> Let me synthesize the prognostic value succinctly. Seizures after cardiac arrest, especially myoclonus and status epilepticus, are associated with worse outcomes but have limited standalone specificity. When seizures occur on a suppressed or burst-suppression background, or when status epilepticus persists beyond 72 hours off confounders, they strengthen the case for an unfavorable prognosis, yet rare recoveries do occur and mandate multimodal confirmation before WLST decisions. Conversely, seizures on a continuous, reactive background, particularly when they abate with treatment, may be compatible with meaningful recovery and warrant continued care and reassessment [^111x8vhu] [^113hitX4] [^11281YFX] [^115KvU4Z].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical steps are clear. Obtain EEG promptly in comatose patients who do not follow commands, extend monitoring to at least 48 hours when feasible to improve detection of nonconvulsive seizures, interpret all EEG findings in the context of background continuity and reactivity and the timing relative to arrest and rewarming, treat clinically apparent and confirmed nonconvulsive seizures while avoiding routine prophylaxis, and anchor prognostication to a multimodal assessment performed no earlier than 72 hours off major confounders, recognizing that highly malignant EEG patterns, absent brainstem reflexes, and bilaterally absent N20s carry the strongest negative prognostic weight when concordant [^116rJZHK] [^114HT432] [^111nuRJq] [^111r8KMg] [^116GDX62].

Seizures after cardiac arrest are common and **strongly associated with poor neurological outcomes** [^11281YFX], particularly when they are early, prolonged, or refractory [^113V4DNP]. Early myoclonus and status epilepticus are especially predictive of unfavorable outcomes, with high specificity but low sensitivity [^11281YFX]. Seizures likely reflect severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and may worsen secondary injury through excitotoxicity and metabolic stress [^112ggLTo]. However, **some patients with seizures can recover**, so seizures should be integrated into a multimodal prognostication approach [^112SmRU1] and not used in isolation to guide decisions about life-sustaining therapy [^1117BeyG].

---

## Incidence and types of seizures after cardiac arrest

Seizures occur in **20–30% of comatose survivors** after cardiac arrest [^11281YFX] [^112fasVs]. The most common types include:

- **Myoclonic seizures**: Most frequent, occurring in approximately 26% of patients [^11281YFX].
- **Generalized tonic-clonic seizures**: Less common but clinically significant.
- **Nonconvulsive seizures**: Detected primarily through continuous EEG monitoring [^115SPMA3].

---

## Prognostic significance of seizures

Seizures after cardiac arrest are **strongly associated with poor neurological outcomes** [^111PKMwX], including persistent vegetative state, severe disability, or death [^113f78wC]. The prognostic value varies with seizure type, timing, and EEG characteristics:

| **Seizure characteristic** | **Prognostic significance** |
|-|-|
| Early myoclonus (within 24–48 hours) | - Strongly associated with poor outcome [^113BEQhW] <br/> - High specificity but low sensitivity [^111PKMwX] |
| Status epilepticus (prolonged seizures) | - Strongly predictive of unfavorable outcome [^114aP8ZB] <br/> - High specificity but low sensitivity [^111PKMwX] |
| EEG background suppression or burst suppression | - Highly specific for poor outcome [^116ovCw9] <br/> - Sensitivity varies [^111PKMwX] |
| Continuous or nearly continuous normal voltage EEG background | - Associated with favorable outcome [^111ij9qU] <br/> - High specificity and moderate sensitivity [^113qLg9j] |

---

## Mechanisms underlying seizures and poor outcomes

Seizures after cardiac arrest are thought to reflect **severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI)** [^112ggLTo], characterized by:

- **Excitotoxicity**: Excessive glutamate release causing neuronal damage.
- **Metabolic stress**: Increased energy demand exacerbating brain injury.
- **Secondary brain injury**: Seizures may independently worsen neurological damage [^113HxWkE].

---

## Influence of therapeutic hypothermia on seizure prognostic value

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has **altered the prognostic landscape** [^112qi7rd] after cardiac arrest. Although seizures remain associated with poor outcomes, TH may improve outcomes in some patients, complicating prognostication. Therefore, seizures should be interpreted within a multimodal framework that includes clinical examination, EEG, biomarkers, and neuroimaging [^112keRrk].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **multimodal approach** to prognostication after cardiac arrest:

- **Multimodal prognostication**: Combine clinical examination, EEG, biomarkers, and neuroimaging [^116GDX62] [^112SmRU1].
- **EEG monitoring**: Recommended for detecting nonconvulsive seizures and guiding management [^116rJZHK] [^112i6zjd].
- **Cautious interpretation**: Seizures should not be used in isolation to predict poor outcomes or guide withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy [^1117BeyG] [^112qi7rd].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors limit the prognostic value of seizures after cardiac arrest:

- **Sedation and medications**: Sedatives and antiepileptics can suppress seizures, masking their true incidence and prognostic significance [^112ggLTo] [^113HxWkE].
- **Timing of assessment**: Early seizures may differ prognostically from late seizures [^113HxWkE].
- **Individual variability**: Some patients with seizures recover, highlighting the need for caution in prognostication [^115KvU4Z].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the strong association between seizures and poor outcomes, **aggressive seizure management is recommended**:

- **Antiepileptic treatment**: Initiate treatment for clinically apparent and nonconvulsive seizures [^111nuRJq] [^112i6zjd].
- **Continuous EEG monitoring**: Essential for detecting nonconvulsive seizures and guiding therapy [^114C1C9M] [^111kSfvt].
- **Multimodal prognostication**: Use seizures as part of a broader prognostic framework, avoiding premature decisions about withdrawal of care [^112qi7rd] [^112SmRU1].

Seizures after cardiac arrest are **strongly associated with poor neurological outcomes** [^113V4DNP] [^11281YFX] [^115EbABg], particularly when early, prolonged, or refractory. However, some patients with seizures can recover, so seizures should be integrated into a multimodal prognostication approach and not used in isolation to guide decisions about life-sustaining therapy [^11281YFX] [^112keRrk].

Advanced life support — post-cardiac arrest seizure management: The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation continues to suggest against the use of prophylactic anti-seizure medication in post-cardiac arrest adults who are comatose, and there is a new recommendation that suggests treatment of rhythmic and periodic electroencephalography (EEG) patterns that are on the ictal-interictal continuum in comatose post-cardiac arrest adults. Red Cross Guidelines are informed by the 2024 ILCOR systematic review on post-cardiac arrest seizure prophylaxis and treatment, and the guideline and recommendation against the use of prophylactic anti-seizure medication post-cardiac arrest is based on the lack of direct evidence that anti-seizure medication prevents seizures or improves important clinical outcomes, the evidence that the medication is not associated with improved outcomes in adults with other forms of acute brain injury and can produce significant side effects, and the note that sedatives are commonly used in comatose post-cardiac arrest patients and are known to have anti-seizure effects.

### Long-term risk of seizures among cardiac arrest survivors [^115KMXTs]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The long-term risk of seizures in cardiac arrest survivors is not established. We hypothesized that survivors of cardiac arrest face an increased long-term risk for seizures.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study using 2008–2015 claims data from a nationally representative 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 66 years-old. Our exposure of interest was a hospital diagnosis code of cardiac arrest, defined by previously validated ICD-9-CM codes. Since we were interested in long-term risk, we excluded patients with a history of seizure, and those who were diagnosed with a seizure during hospitalization or died during the index hospitalization. Our outcome was a diagnosis of seizure. Survival statistics were used to calculate seizure incidence and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between cardiac arrest and long-term seizures after adjustment for demographics and Charlson comorbidities.

Results

Among 1,764,508 beneficiaries with a mean 4.5 years of follow-up, we identified 57,437 patients with cardiac arrest who survived to discharge without a seizure. The annual incidence of seizures was 1.26% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20–1.33%) compared to 0.61% (95% CI, 0.61–0.62%) in other Medicare patients. In unadjusted analysis, cardiac arrest was associated with an increased risk of post-discharge seizures (hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7–1.9), but the association was lost after adjustment for demographics and comorbidities (HR 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9–1.0; P = 0.12).

Conclusion

The long-term risk of seizures was not elevated in patients with cardiac arrest who survived to hospital discharge without a seizure.

Key Points

Question

Does continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring improve detection of epileptiform events associated with neurological outcome or potentially treatable seizure among patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest compared with brief intermittent EEG?

Findings

In this cohort study including 759 patients who were resuscitated from cardiac arrest, continuous monitoring for nearly 48 hours was needed to achieve 95% sensitivity for prognostic epileptiform events; compared with brief intermittent EEG, continuous monitoring did not improve prediction of outcome at hospital discharge. Potentially treatable seizures were uncommon and rarely detected by brief intermittent monitoring.

Meaning

Compared with continuous EEG, brief intermittent EEG is insensitive for detection of potentially treatable seizures after cardiac arrest but may be sufficient to guide multimodality prediction of outcome at hospital discharge.

### The prognostic value of 48-h continuous EEG during therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest [^115PdwGh]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) during the first 48 h following cardiac arrest (CA) in patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).

Methods

We reviewed data from 92 comatose post-CA patients over a 6 year-period; cEEG recordings were performed during TTM and restoration of normothermia. EEG findings were divided into four time-periods: 0–8, 8–16, 16–24, and 24–48 h after CA. Background EEG findings were defined as moderate encephalopathy (diffuse slowing with reactivity/variability), severe encephalopathy (diffuse slowing without reactivity/variability), burst suppression or suppression, and dichotomized as malignant (suppression/burst suppression/severe encephalopathy) or benign (moderate encephalopathy). Epileptiform activity was defined as the presence of seizures, sporadic epileptiform discharges, or periodic discharges. Neurological outcome was assessed at 3 months using the cerebral performance categories (CPC) score (good outcome: CPC 1–2).

Results

26/92 (28%) patients had a good outcome. Malignant patterns were associated with a poor outcome at all time-points, with a high positive predictive value (94–97%) but a poor negative predictive value (44–56%). Epileptiform activity did not influence the prognostic value of EEG patterns. All patients with moderate encephalopathy and seizures or generalized periodic discharges had a poor outcome.

Conclusions

cEEG can identify patients with poor outcome from the first hours following CA, with limited predictive value for good outcome. Epileptiform activity did not improve the prognostic accuracy of EEG, but seizures and generalized periodic discharges were associated with poor outcome even when developing on a benign EEG pattern.

Insights and implications — confounders in predicting good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest: The Red Cross guidelines for predicting good neurological outcome are informed by the ILCOR systematic review and treatment recommendations. While assessment of the Glasgow Coma Scale motor score may be useful for recognizing comatose patients who should undergo functional and structural testing for prognostication, it is important to consider that the use of sedatives, such as midazolam and analgesics, may confound the assessment. Other confounders may include electrolyte abnormalities, encephalopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, multiorgan failure, unrecognized seizures and traumatic brain injury. Prognostication requires both functional (i.e., neurological examination) and structural test information considered over time and with consideration of confounders.

### Advanced life support. neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest and ROSC: prediction of good neurological outcome [^111ij9qU]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — electroencephalography (EEG) after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) for predicting good neurological outcome: A continuous or nearly continuous normal voltage EEG background without seizures or abundant or generalized periodic discharges was consistent across 12 studies, with greater than 80% specificity and greater than 50% sensitivity for most studies. The use of sedatives is a potential confounder when using an EEG for prognostication since the amplitude may be suppressed and continuity of the EEG decreased. After ROSC, EEG background is suppressed, with the patterns evolving over time from more malignant appearance to more benign, and the sooner a favorable EEG pattern develops appears to be associated with a favorable prognosis.

### Neurologic prognostication after cardiac arrest using brain biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^117XwYyB]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Results We identified 2953 studies, of which 86 studies with 10 567 patients were included. Biomarker analysis at 48 hours after ROSC demonstrated that neurofilament light had the highest predictive value for unfavorable neurologic outcome, with an area under the curve of 0.
92. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is the primary determinant of outcome following cardiac arrest. 1, 2 Survivors of HIBI can experience a wide range of clinical outcomes along a spectrum encompassing full neurologic recovery, persistent vegetative states, or severe or mild disabilities, 3–6 thereby making accurate prognostication imperative to inform health care teams and caregivers. Considerable efforts have been directed toward identifying accurate neurologic prognostication for patients with HIBI.

7 Guidelines recommend using multiple modalities including clinical examination, electroencephalography, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and neuroimaging. 8–10. As a prespecified subgroup analysis, we calculated SROC curves and respective optimal thresholds for each biomarker using data from patients who received TTM as well as specifically in patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Moreover, we also conducted a subanalysis excluding studies that assessed outcome at less than 3 months after cardiac arrest. Heterogeneity was assessed by clinical evaluation of each included study and by visual inspection of individual study ROC plots.
25. Figure 3 displays the pooled medians for each brain biomarker longitudinally from admission, 24, 48, and 72 hours after ROSC in patients with favorable vs unfavorable neurologic outcome.

For each brain biomarker, we performed a prespecified subgroup analysis of SROC curves for studies that specified the use of TTM and calculated the pooled medians for these patients. Based on the associated interquartile ranges, it appears that Nf-L and NSE concentrations were higher among patients with unfavorable neurologic outcome at all included times. S100 calcium-binding protein β, GFAP, and UCH-L1 showed greater variability and more overlap between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcome.

Overall sensitivity of spot EEG monitoring strategies for event detection was low compared with continuous EEG. Using the prognostic events definition, sensitivity ranged from 66% (95% CI, 62%-69%) to 68% (95% CI, 66%-70%) for spot EEG alone and increased to 76% (95% CI, 74%-78%) to 79% (95% CI, 77%-81%) if observation of a risk state prompted conversion to continuous monitoring thereafter (Table 4). Using the potentially treatable seizure definition, sensitivity ranged from 7% (95% CI, 4%-12%) to 8% (95% CI, 4%-12%) for spot EEG alone and increased to a range of 37% (95% CI, 31%-46%) to 42% (95% CI, 38%-46%) if observation of a risk state prompted conversion to continuous monitoring thereafter. Across models, use of simulated spot EEG resulted in an 11-hour to 12-hour delay in event detection compared with continuous EEG. Compared with no EEG monitoring, the addition of continuous EEG results classified based on the prognostic events definition to a multimodality outcome model significantly increased discriminatory power and increased the proportion of patients with near-zero estimated probability of recovery from 7% (95% CI, 5%-9%) to 26% (95% CI, 22%-30%) (P < .001) (Table 4). Compared with continuous EEG, simulated spot EEG resulted in a statistically but not clinically significant improvement in predictive performance across models (Table 4). There was no improvement in ability to identify patients with near-zero recovery probability using the potentially treatable seizure event definitions.

### Prognostic value of electrographic postanoxic status epilepticus in comatose cardiac-arrest survivors in the therapeutic hypothermia era [^114aP8ZB]. Resuscitation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The independent prognostic significance of postanoxic status epilepticus (PSE) has not been evaluated prospectively since the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia. We studied 1-year functional outcomes and their determinants in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (CA), with special attention to PSE.

Methods

106 comatose CA survivors admitted to the intensive care unit in 2005–2010 were included in a prospective observational study. The main outcome measure was a Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC) of 1 or 2 (favorable outcome) 1 year after CA.

Results

CA occurred out-of-hospital in 89 (84%) patients and was witnessed from onset in 94 (89%). Median times were 6 min (IQR, 0–11) from CA to first-responder arrival and 23 min (14–40) from collapse to return of spontaneous circulation. PSE was diagnosed in 33 (31%) patients at a median of 39 h (4–49) after CA. PSE was refractory in 24 (22%) cases and malignant in 19 (20%). After 1 year, 31 (29.3%) patients had favorable outcomes including 2 (6.44%) with PSE. Factors independently associated with poor outcome (CPC ≥ 3) were PSE (odds ratio [OR], 14.28; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.77–50.0; P = 0.001), time to restoration of spontaneous circulation (OR, 1.04/min; 95% CI, 1–1.07; P = 0.035), and LOD score on day 1 (OR, 1.28/point; 95% CI, 1.08–1.54; P = 0.003).

Conclusion

PSE strongly and independently predicts a poor outcome in comatose CA survivors receiving therapeutic hypothermia, but some patients with PSE survive with good functional outcomes. PSE alone is not sufficient to predict failure to awaken after CA in the era of therapeutic hypothermia.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)

Evidence (ESM Table 2)

Absence of EEG reactivity

In TH-treated patients, absence of EEG background reactivity during TH is almost invariably associated with poor outcome [FPR 2 (1–7) %;] while, after rewarming at 48–72 h from ROSC, it predicts a poor outcome with 0 (0–3) % FPR. However, in one study in posthypoxic myoclonus, three patients with no EEG reactivity after rewarming from TH had a good outcome. Among four prognostication studies on absent EEG reactivity after cardiac arrest included in this document, three were made by the same group of investigators. Limitations of EEG reactivity include being operator-dependent and non-quantitative, and lacking standardization. Techniques for automated analysis of EEG background reactivity are under investigation.

Status epilepticus

In TH-treated patients, the presence of status epilepticus (SE), i.e. a prolonged epileptiform activity, during TH or immediately after rewarming is almost invariably followed by poor outcome (FPR from 0 to 6%). Among those patients, absence of EEG reactivity or a discontinuous EEG background predicted no chance of neurological recovery. All studies on SE included only a few patients. Definitions of SE were inconsistent among those studies (see ESM Appendix 5).

Clinical seizures occur in one third of patients with PCABI treated in the ICU and may be of epileptic or non-epileptic origin. Myoclonus is the dominating manifestation but generalized or focal tonic–clonic seizures are also common, often occurring in the same patient. EEG is crucial to confirm that a clinical seizure is related to cortical epileptic activity, since seizure mimics are common in the ICU and since the use of sedatives and muscle-relaxants suppress clinical manifestations of seizures. EEG is also useful to prognosticate outcome (see below) and follow effects of treatment.

Seizures cause metabolic stress and are associated with poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest, providing a rationale for treatment. However, it is unclear whether seizures cause further brain damage, or whether they simply are a marker of severe PCABI. To date there is no direct evidence that antiepileptic treatment improves the outcome of PCABI. The TELSTAR trial (NCT02056236) is randomising patients with status epilepticus after cardiac arrest to either medical treatment to suppress all electrographic seizure activity, or no treatment and may provide useful evidence to answer that question. Current guidelines suggest treating postanoxic status epilepticus with sodium valproate and levetiracetam as first line agents in addition to increased sedation. However, prophylactic antiepileptic treatment is not recommended. Usual sedative agents used in ICU have anti-epileptic effects, and this should be kept in mind since seizures often manifest as sedation is weaned.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, electroencephalography, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the usefulness of rhythmic or periodic discharges to support the prognosis of unfavorable neurological outcome in adult patients who remain comatose after ROSC is uncertain when evaluated with other prognostic tests.

### Emergency neurological life support: resuscitation following cardiac arrest [^1121riWo]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is the most common cause of death in North America. An organized bundle of neurocritical care interventions can improve chances of survival and neurological recovery in patients who are successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Therefore, resuscitation following cardiac arrest was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support protocol. Key aspects of successful early post-arrest management include: prevention of secondary brain injury; identification of treatable causes of arrest in need of emergent intervention; and, delayed neurological prognostication. Secondary brain injury can be attenuated through targeted temperature management (TTM), avoidance of hypoxia and hypotension, avoidance of hyperoxia, hyperventilation or hypoventilation, and treatment of seizures. Most patients remaining comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest should undergo TTM. Treatable precipitants of arrest that require emergent intervention include, but are not limited to, acute coronary syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and major trauma. Accurate neurological prognostication is generally not appropriate for several days after cardiac arrest, so early aggressive care should never be limited based on perceived poor neurological prognosis.

Methods

Retrospective descriptive analysis using data from the international multicentre Target Temperature after Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM) Trial randomizing 939 adult patients with CA of presumed cardiac cause to a targeted temperature management of 33 °C or 36 °C between 2010 and 2013. Rationale, design and results have previously been published. Ethical consent was obtained in each participating country. The TTM-database contains information on clinical data, patient demographics, neurological prognostication, withdrawal of life-sustaining-therapy (WLST) and follow-up at 6 months after CA. Poor neurological outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category Scale (CPC) 3–5 (severe cerebral disability, vegetative state or brain death). GCS-M and clinical seizures were evaluated daily; brain stem reflexes were registered at formal neurological prognostication ≥ 108 h post-arrest. In this study, we used GCS-M on day 4 (72–96 h post-arrest), since this is closest to guideline recommendations.

A routine EEG was performed in unconscious patients 48–72 h post-arrest, and if available, SSEP was performed during normothermia and was recommended for patients unconscious between 84 and 108 h after cardiac arrest. Blinded retrospective evaluation of original EEG data was based on the terminology of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society and classified into unreactive burst - suppression and unreactive status epilepticus (abundant rhythmic/periodic discharges) according to ERC/ESICM. In an exploratory analysis the recently proposed standardized highly malignant EEG patterns was applied.

Serum samples were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h after CA, stored in a central biobank and analysed after TTM-trial completion. We defined NSE levels as "high" if ≥ 48 pg/mL at 48 h and/or ≥ 38 pg/mL at 72 h, corresponding to 2% false positive rates for poor outcome as previously published. In a sensitivity analysis, we explored an alternative cut-off ≥ 33 pg/mL at 48 and/or 72 h as suggested in previous guidelines and recently used validating the ERC/ESICM algorithm. Both CT and MRI were performed on clinical indication and evaluated for generalized oedema by local radiologists in a pragmatic approach similar to clinical practice. The first available CT was included in this study.

Outcome prediction of neurological recovery in an unconscious survivor of cardiorespiratory arrest is difficult and uncertain. We describe the case of a 25-yr-old post-arrest survivor who made a remarkable neurological improvement despite a seemingly hopeless prognosis. Conventional clinical and neurophysiological assessments need to be interpreted with care in the presence of uncontrolled seizure activity and sedative medications. The measurement of biochemical markers in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid may be useful in helping the clinician to arrive at a more accurate neurological outcome prediction.

Practical approach: suggested prognostication strategy

Prognostication is indicated in patients with prolonged coma after resuscitation. A thorough clinical examination should be performed daily to detect signs of neurological recovery such as purposeful movements or to identify a clinical picture suggesting that brain death has occurred.

Following global post-anoxic injury, the brain will make a gradual recovery. Brainstem reflexes return first, then the motor response to pain and, finally, cortical activity and consciousness. This process is completed within 72 h from arrest. Consequently, in the absence of residual sedation, 72 h after ROSC seems to be a suitable time for prognostication. However, in patients who have received sedatives ≤ 12 h before the 72 h neurological assessment, the reliability of clinical examination may be reduced. Special care must be taken in TH-treated patients, since hypothermia prolongs the effects of both opiates and neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Before decisive assessment is performed, major confounders must be excluded; apart from sedation and neuromuscular blockade, these include hypothermia, severe hypotension, hypoglycaemia, and metabolic and respiratory derangements. Sedatives and neuromuscular blocking drugs should be suspended long enough to avoid interference with clinical examination. Short-acting drugs are preferred whenever possible. When residual sedation/paralysis is suspected, consider using antidotes to reverse the effects of these drugs. Be careful if using flumazenil to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, since this drug may lower the seizure threshold.

We suggest using the prognostication strategy outlined in the algorithm on Fig. 1 in all comatose patients with an absent or extensor motor response to pain at ≥ 72 h from ROSC. Results of earlier prognostic tests should also be considered at this time point.

Fig. 1
Suggested prognostication algorithm. The algorithm is entered ≥ 72 h after ROSC if, after the exclusion of confounders (particularly residual sedation), the patient remains unconscious with a Glasgow Motor Score of 1 or 2. The absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes, and/or bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave, indicates a poor outcome is very likely. If neither of the features is present, wait at least 24 h before reassessing. At this stage, two or more of the following indicate that a poor outcome is likely: status myoclonus ≤ 48 h; high neuron-specific enolase values; unreactive EEG with burst suppression or status epilepticus; diffuse anoxic injury on brain CT and/or MRI. If none of these criteria are met consider continue to observe and re-evaluate

### Standardized EEG interpretation accurately predicts prognosis after cardiac arrest [^112KGJHm]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Eight study sites randomized 202 patients to targeted temperature management at 33°C (n = 103) or 36°C (n = 99). A routine EEG was recorded at a median 77 hours (interquartile range 53–102) after cardiac arrest in 103 patients still comatose after rewarming.

Exclusion and inclusion in the present study is described in figure 2. In 99 of the 202 randomized patients, 69 of whom awoke and 22 died before the recommended time point of prognostication, EEGs were not performed.

Figure 2
Study flow chart of exclusion from and inclusion into the study

The recommended time point of prognostication was 72 hours after rewarming, corresponding to approximately 108 hours after the cardiac arrest. The most probable cause of death according to the treating physician is reported (cerebral, multiorgan failure, or cardiovascular). Eight study sites were included since they had an EEG system that allowed export of EEG data that included notations regarding testing of reactivity.

Eight patients with prolonged coma (> 5 days) did not have an EEG. One of these was brain dead and 2 had absent N20 potentials. In the remaining 5 patients, the reason for missing EEG was unclear. Two of these patients did not have WLST and eventually recovered to CPC 3, 1 died on day 5 of cerebral cause without WLST, 1 died on day 6 due to multiorgan failure without WLST, and 1 died on day 5 of cerebral cause after WLST.

The patients' characteristics are presented in table 1. Patients with EEG were more likely to have a poor outcome.

Table 1
Patient characteristics

Characteristics of the patients on the day of EEG registration are presented in table 2. At this time point the majority were deeply comatose. Clinical seizures occurred during the EEG recording in 16%, mostly myoclonus, and 35% of patients had antiepileptic treatment.

Patient characteristics on the day of EEG recording (n = 103)

Highly malignant EEG.

The prognostic ability of the highly malignant patterns is presented in table 3 (primary hypotheses). A highly malignant pattern was reported by the majority of the 4 interpreters (mode value) in 38 patients (37%) and all had a poor neurologic outcome. The sensitivity for a highly malignant pattern to predict a poor outcome was 50% (mode value). Sensitivity varied among the 4 interpreters but specificity was 100% for all individual interpreters (table e-1 on the Neurology ® Web site at).

### Epileptiform electrographic patterns after cardiac arrest… [^116Sg7yB]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

For decades, electroencephalogram has been a cornerstone for prognostication of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Along with clinical examination, somatosensory evoked potentials, serum biomarkers, and brain imaging, "highly malignant patterns" are routinely used to identify patients with poor functional prognosis. 1 About one-third of patients may show epileptiform abnormalities — spikes, sharp waves, or spike waves — in the first days, often taking a periodic or rhythmic pattern or even fulfilling criteria for electrographic seizures. These patterns have traditionally been considered to herald poor prognosis and may be coupled with myoclonic jerks in two-thirds of patients. 2, 3 Rossetti AO, Benghanem S.

Advanced life support — neuroprognostication for prediction of good neurological outcome in comatose adults after cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) lists modalities that can be used with specified time windows. Clinical findings in the first 4 days after cardiac arrest include Glasgow Coma Scale Motor Score > 3. Brain imaging 72 hours to 7 days after ROSC lists MRI: Absence of diffusion restriction. Biomarkers within 72 hours after ROSC list neuron-specific enolase (NSE): Normal (< 17 micrograms/liter). Electroencephalogram (EEG) within 72 hours after ROSC lists continuous normal voltage EEG background without periodic discharges or seizures. The page notes this information may serve as a guide for predicting an increased likelihood of favorable neurological outcome in adults who are comatose after ROSC and that test findings should be interpreted in combination with other tests.

### Multimodal prediction of favorable outcome after cardiac arrest: a cohort study [^112L7DdU]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Can a multimodal prognostic model reliably identify patients with favorable neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest?

Findings: We created and externally validated a multimodal prognostic score identifying within the first 72 hours most patients reaching functional independence at 3 months (sensitivity of 97.5%, accuracy of 77.5%, area under the curve of 0.88), using routinely available tools (four electroencephalographic features, one serological, one clinical).

Meaning: Our study addresses an important and understudied issue with a potential to influence current practice, namely focusing on favorable (as opposed to the currently used unfavorable) outcome in patients after cardiac arrest.

Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury after cardiac arrest (CA) is related to considerable morbidity and mortality; death occurs mostly following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). Accurate prognostication is essential, and recent recommendations, such as those of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, propose a multimodal approach combining clinical examination, electrophysiology, brain imaging, and serological biomarkers.

However, existing guidelines essentially focus on prediction of unfavorable outcome, thereby leaving many patients in an intermediate prognosis. Furthermore, because of confounders, or when some patients require longer recovery, a subset of patients might be at risk of premature WLST. There is therefore a crucial need to reliably identify patients with good recovery chances, not only to reduce prognostication uncertainty, but also to reassure families and direct resources from caregivers.

Several indicators of good outcome have already been identified: continuous, reactive electroencephalography (EEG) without epileptiform features, absence of diffusion-weighted changes on brain MRI, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score greater than or equal to 3, or normal values of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE). However, these variables have been mostly described separately, and their sensitivity toward a favorable outcome appears often suboptimal when the test is considered alone. As opposed to prediction of unfavorable prognosis (which aims at a maximum specificity to avoid false positivity with potential catastrophic consequences), prediction of favorable outcome ideally needs high sensitivity to avoid missing patients with a potential for good recovery. Indeed, most predictive modalities are dichotomous, but forecast of favorable outcome is not always efficiently achieved by simply inverting sensitivity and specificity of poor outcome predictors, since their sensitivity toward good prognosis may result too low. Additionally, some predictors are continuous or ordinal variables and require a threshold identification, which will differ depending on the outcome considered.

NEUROLOGICAL MANAGEMENT IN THE ICU: EARLY TRIAGE

Early determination of brain-injury severity is a double-edged sword. Accurate early risk assessment facilitates triage of appropriate patients to post-CA coronary revascularization and mechanical circulatory support, helps guide family conversations and resource use, and could be used to identify optimal patients for clinical trials. But when early neurological risk assessment is inappropriately applied to end-of-life decision-making, accuracy is poor and mortality is likely increased through erroneous prognostication. Therefore, we distinguish between early risk assessment, which may help advance post-CA care, and early prognostication, which is dangerous and should be avoided.

Prognostication after CA is delayed until a high degree of accuracy can be determined and until the prognosis is stable; early prognostication is flawed, is associated with excess mortality, and should be avoided. Thus, future research opportunities include developing tools that differentiate prognosticating for poor outcome from triaging patients for early intervention. Evaluating which early post-CA findings — including clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, serum biomarkers, or others — differentiate patients for individualized treatment interventions requires further study.

Early Triage Statements

Early risk stratification is not intended as a tool for triage to withdraw life support and is not used for that purpose (90.5%, 19/21).
Data that do not establish neurological risk stratification in the first 6 hours after CA include the patient's age, duration of CPR, seizure activity, serum lactate level or pH, Glasgow motor subscore in patients who received NMB or sedation, pupillary function in patients who received atropine, and optic nerve sheath diameter (95.3%, 20/21).
Validated illness severity scores may be used to optimize therapeutic interventions (88.2%, 15/17).

### Brain injury after cardiac arrest: pathophysiology, treatment, and prognosis [^113V4DNP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

ACNS has identified specific subtypes of burst-suppression of special prognostic interest in PCABI. Burst suppression with identical bursts is a burst-suppression where the first 0.5 s or more of each burst or each stereotyped cluster of 2 or more bursts appear visually similar. Highly epileptiform bursts are present if > 50% of the bursts include epileptiform discharges or rhythmic activity. In a multicentre European study on 850 patients, both these subtypes predicted poor neurological outcome at 6 months with 100% specificity as early as 6 h after ROSC.

Presence of electrographic seizures superimposed on the EEG background also portend a poor neurological outcome in PCABI. This is particularly true when seizures occur early, during the first 12–24 h from ROSC or are associated with other unfavourable features such as an unreactive or suppressed EEG background. ACNS defines 'unequivocal seizures' as generalised rhythmic spike-and-wave discharges with a frequency ≥ 3 Hz or clearly evolving discharges of any type > 4 Hz. This definition has been inconsistently used in prognostication studies. The term 'status epilepticus' is used to indicate the presence of continuous and persistent seizures. The 2021 update of the ACNS terminology standardised the definition of 'electrographic status epilepticus' (ESE) as an electrographic seizure lasting for ≥ 10 min or for a total duration of ≥ 20% in a 60-min recording. However, the definitions used in the pre-2021 literature are inconsistent, and for that reason the 2021 Guidelines on post-resuscitation care did not recommend using the term 'status epilepticus" for prognostication until sufficient evidence using a standardised definition will be available.

EEG background reactivity consists of a measurable change in amplitude or frequency when a stimulus is applied. The methods of stimulation or assessment of reactivity vary widely and only recently an expert consensus proposed a standardisation of both the stimulus type, repetition and duration. This variability has probably contributed to the inconsistent accuracy of EEG reactivity as a prognostic test in literature. Presence of EEG reactivity is nevertheless a sign of good neurological outcome, while its absence has little added value to EEG background.

### Electroencephalography in survivors of cardiac arrest: comparing pre-and post-therapeutic hypothermia eras [^115SPMA3]. Neurocritical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Electroencephalography in the setting of hypothermia and anoxia has been studied in humans since the 1950s. Specific patterns after cardiac arrest have been associated with prognosis since the 1960s, with several prognostic rating scales developed in the second half of the twentieth century. In 2002, two pivotal clinical trials were published, demonstrating improved neurologic outcomes in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest of shockable rhythms. In the following years, TH became the standard of care in these patients. During the same time period, the use of continuous EEG monitoring in critically ill patients increased, which led to the recognition of subclinical seizures occurring in patients after cardiac arrest. As a result of these changes, greater amounts of EEG data are being collected, and the significance of specific patterns is being re-explored. We review the current role of EEG for the identification of seizures and the estimation of prognosis after cardiac resuscitation.

### Sensitivity of continuous electroencephalography to detect ictal activity after cardiac arrest [^114HT432]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Epileptiform electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns are common after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, are associated with patient outcome, and may require treatment. It is unknown whether continuous EEG monitoring is needed to detect these patterns or if brief intermittent monitoring is sufficient. If continuous monitoring is required, the necessary duration of observation is unknown.

Objective

To quantify the time-dependent sensitivity of continuous EEG for epileptiform event detection, and to compare continuous EEG to several alternative EEG-monitoring strategies for post-cardiac arrest outcome prediction.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational cohort study was conducted in 2 academic medical centers between September 2010 and January 2018. Participants included 759 adults who were comatose after being resuscitated from cardiac arrest and who underwent 24 hours or more of EEG monitoring.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Epileptiform EEG patterns associated with neurological outcome at hospital discharge, such as seizures likely to cause secondary injury.

Results

Overall, 759 patients were included in the analysis; 281 (37.0%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 58 (17) years. Epileptiform EEG activity was observed in 414 participants (54.5%), of whom only 26 (3.4%) developed potentially treatable seizures. Brief intermittent EEG had an estimated 66% (95% CI, 62%-69%) to 68% (95% CI, 66%-70%) sensitivity for detection of prognostic epileptiform events. Depending on initial continuity of the EEG background, 0 to 51 hours of monitoring were needed to achieve 95% sensitivity for the detection of prognostic epileptiform events. Brief intermittent EEG had a sensitivity of 7% (95% CI, 4%-12%) to 8% (95% CI, 4%-12%) for the detection of potentially treatable seizures, and 0 to 53 hours of continuous monitoring were needed to achieve 95% sensitivity for the detection of potentially treatable seizures. Brief intermittent EEG results yielded similar information compared with continuous EEG results when added to multivariable models predicting neurological outcome.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with continuous EEG monitoring, brief intermittent monitoring was insensitive for detection of epileptiform events. Monitoring EEG results significantly improved multimodality prediction of neurological outcome, but continuous monitoring appeared to add little additional information compared with brief intermittent monitoring.

Cardiac arrest is common and deadly, affecting up to 700000 people in the United States annually. Advanced cardiac life support measures are commonly employed to improve outcomes. This 2025 guideline on adult post-cardiac arrest care from the American Heart Association summarizes the most recent published evidence for and recommendations on several important areas of post-cardiac arrest management. Based on structured evidence reviews, guidelines are provided for initial blood pressure, oxygen, ventilation, and glucose goals. Evidence evaluating the routine use of antibiotics after return of spontaneous circulation is reviewed. The update also reviews diagnostic testing modalities, temperature control goals and duration, and the use of percutaneous coronary intervention and mechanical circulatory support in the patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest. New data regarding the detection and management of seizures have been incorporated, along with updates regarding the timing and modalities used in neuroprognostication. These guidelines now differentiate prognostication for favorable versus unfavorable outcome. New sections on the utility of advanced neuromonitoring, along with definitions and treatment options for myoclonus, are included to guide the clinician. Expanded recommendations regarding how to optimize survivorship for patients, caregivers, and rescuers are reviewed. Finally, the potential role of organ donation in the patient resuscitated from cardiac arrest is reviewed.

### Association of neuron-specific enolase values with outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors is dependent on the time of sample collection [^116civ7U]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Europe and in North America has been estimated to be 50 to 100 per 100,000 of the general population. Despite recent advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and post-resuscitation care, survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest remain poor. Among patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), reasons for poor outcome include brain injury, myocardial dysfunction and systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury. The severity of these three primary components of post-cardiac arrest syndrome is not uniform and depends on the cause of OHCA, the duration of the cardiac arrest and the extent of ischemic injury. Brain damage has been shown to be the most common cause of poor neurological outcome and death after cardiac arrest. To date, the only therapeutic intervention supported by clinical evidence of improved neurological outcome is the management of target core temperature at 33.0 °C or 36.0 °C for 12 h to 24 h. However, even if the best evidence-based recommended therapy is provided, a substantial proportion of patients remain comatose after normalization of body temperature and withdrawal of sedation. Rapid and precise prognostication in these patients is crucial for the selection of the most appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic strategy, including possible withdrawal of further care in hopeless cases. Although prognostic options for these patients exist, they are currently limited. Recent guidelines recommend multimodal strategy for prognostication in cardiac arrest survivors. The absence of brain stem reflexes and bilateral absence of cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials are the most powerful negative prognostic factors, and must be investigated first. The second line of prognostication includes electroencephalography and imaging techniques, in addition to biomarkers of brain damage, especially the estimation of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels. However, the current guidelines do not recommend a specific NSE threshold to accurately predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

### Prediction of poor neurological outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^111PKMwX]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In three large studies adopting the ACNS terminology, continuous or generalised periodic discharges on a suppressed EEG background were 100% predictive of poor neurological outcome within a time range of 12–120 h from ROSC. This pattern was a combination of two important unfavourable EEG features, and it has been included within the "highly malignant" patterns (see below).

In our previous review, the presence of seizures predicted poor neurological outcome with 0% FPR. However, the evidence was limited to three studies, and definitions were inconsistent. In the present review, seizures were documented in six studies, four of which used a standardised (ACNS) definition. Seizures were 100% specific for poor neurological outcome in all studies we included, except in one where one patient with seizures occurring at 96 h recovered. Sensitivity was generally low, below 20% in almost all cases (Table 39).

The presence of prolonged seizures is generally defined as "status epilepticus" (SE). However, the ACNS terminology does not include this term, and there is no consensus on the duration and continuity of discharges to qualify a pattern as SE, nor on whether SE should include only unequivocal seizures or may also include periodic discharges. SE was described in several studies included in our review. Its definitions were, however, inconsistent or even absent (Table 42). Sensitivities varied widely, probably reflecting differences in classifications, or differences in timing and duration of EEG recording. Although SE (however defined) was usually associated with poor neurological outcome, this association was not consistent. Some specific EEG features of SE described in the studies we included suggest a potential for recovery. These include preserved reactivity, late appearance (after TTM), or presence of a continuous or nearly continuous background. These findings confirmed evidence included in our previous review.

In all studies on seizures or SE, the prevalence of this index may have been affected by sedatives and/or antiepileptic treatment. Moreover, it is unclear whether seizure activity is a result of severe HIBI or if it may, in turn, cause further brain damage through massive excitotoxicity, in which case aggressive treatment would be justified. The TELSTAR trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02056236) is randomising patients with SE to either medical treatment to suppress all electrographic seizure activity, or no treatment and may provide some answers to this question.

Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights

The complete evidence-to-decision framework can be found on the ILCOR website, and the evidence-to-decision table is provided in Appendix A. Key points include the following:

In making the recommendation in favor of a continuous or nearly continuous, normal-voltage EEG background without seizures or abundant or generalized periodic discharges as a predictor of good neurological outcome in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, the task force members considered the consistency of the evidence (12 studies, mostly with > 80% specificity and > 50% sensitivity) and the consistency of the definition made using ACNS or ACNS-compatible terminology.
The background definition was consistent in 6 of these studies. Although the criteria for periodic discharges varied slightly within this subgroup, this did not affect the prediction accuracy.
Evidence from the remaining 6 studies confirmed the ability of a continuous or nearly continuous, normal-voltage EEG background without seizures or discharges to predict good neurological outcome. These studies also included a low-voltage or discontinuous EEG background among the "favorable" EEG patterns. These patterns are farther from normal than a continuous or nearly continuous background, and their accuracy could not be assessed separately. The ILCOR task force considered the evidence supporting these patterns insufficient for recommending their use.
The remaining studies on EEG used definitions of favorable patterns that did not comply with the ACNS terminology and were highly heterogeneous.
Lack of blinding is a limitation of studies that use EEG data.
In recommending against using amplitude-integrated EEG or EEG-derived indices such as BIS or cerebral recovery index, the panel considered that these techniques do not allow or allow only a limited morphological assessment of the original EEG signal. Moreover, the evidence was limited to few studies (only 1 study for cerebral recovery index).
Any possible withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies in post–cardiac arrest patients should be undertaken only by using several prognostication modalities according to the 2020 CoSTR on the prediction of poor outcome, which includes distinct recommendations.

### Performance of a guideline-recommended algorithm for prognostication of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest [^115EbABg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

According to trial protocol, WLST was permitted when any of the following criteria were fulfilled; (1) status myoclonus ≤ 24 h post-arrest and bilaterally absent N20 potentials after rewarming, (2) persisting coma (GCS-M ≤ 2) AND bilaterally absent N20 potentials OR a treatment refractory status epilepticus at ≥ 108 h post-arrest, (3) brain death according to national legislation or (4) ethical reasons (also including treatment refractory shock or end-stage multiorgan failure). If applicable, the presumed cause of death was reported by the physician responsible for patient care.

Statistical analyses

Continuous variables are expressed as median (interquartile range) and categorical variables in numbers (percentages). Analyses were performed using two different cohorts. Prognostic accuracies of the ERC/ESICM algorithm and explorative variations thereof were calculated in patients examined with GCS-M on day 4 (n = 585). Missing diagnostic examinations were regarded "negative/non-pathological", allowing evaluation according to remaining ERC/ESICM criteria similar to clinical practice.

To reduce selection bias, prognostic accuracies of single and combinations of diagnostic methods were calculated using all patients with 6-month outcome registered (n = 933). Only patients actually examined were included when calculating prognostic accuracies. Prognostic accuracies of methods were compared to each other using the McNemar's Test.

The term "true" was used when predicted outcome and reported outcome were identical, whilst "false" indicated that outcome prediction was contrary to the reported outcome. "Negative" referred to good outcome (CPC1–2), and "positive" referred to poor outcome (CPC3–5). For example, "true positive" (TP) indicated a patient where both predicted and reported outcome was poor. 95% confidence intervals were calculated with Wilson's method. Analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Categorization of post-cardiac arrest patients according to the pattern of amplitude-integrated electroencephalography after return of spontaneous circulation [^114cciCJ]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Predicting the neurological outcome of patients post cardiac arrest during target temperature management (TTM) remains a challenge. Current guidelines recommend continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) in these patients for seizure management. Moreover, the pattern of conventional EEG or cEEG is also thought to be a useful prognostic tool and a large number of studies have reported the effectiveness of these tests in predicting both good and poor prognoses. However, cEEG is difficult for non-neurologists to interpret. Intensivists or emergency physicians, who treat survivors of cardiac arrest, require prognostic markers that they could assess at the bedside to customize post-cardiac-arrest care for each patient. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) is a type of quantitative EEG and is usually derived from single-channel or two-channel cEEG recordings. The maximum and minimum amplitudes within a short period are displayed as bandwidths along with a compressed time scale. aEEG is easily interpreted by intensivists and emergency physicians at the bedside. Recently, the pattern of aEEG after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) has been reported to be useful for predicting neurological outcomes in adult patients post cardiac arrest. The early recovery of a normal pattern of aEEG after ROSC is reported to be a predictor of good neurological outcome. On the other hand, the absence or late recovery of a normal trace, or the presence of burst suppression, suggests a poor neurological outcome. In the present study, we hypothesized that the pattern of aEEG after ROSC could be used to categorize patients post cardiac arrest according to their expected neurological outcome, making it a useful tool for personalizing the care of these patients.

### Utility and rationale for continuous EEG monitoring: a primer for the general intensivist [^117CXMXW]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Other than EEG features, studies have consistently demonstrated that seizures and seizure dynamics strongly correlate with outcomes. The findings indicate that the presence of seizures, especially nonconvulsive SE, is significantly associated with a worsened prognosis in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Rittenberger et al. found that among 101 post-cardiac arrest patients, the outcome was poor in the 12% with nonconvulsive SE. Legriel et al. detailed that among 106 comatose cardiac-arrest survivors, postanoxic status epilepticus (PSE) was diagnosed in 33 (31%) patients with a strong, independent correlation with poor outcome. Additionally, a post-hoc analysis of a large, randomized trial with strict criteria for withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (n = 939) identified an association between early or late seizures and poor outcomes. Myoclonic seizures were the most common and most predictive of poor outcomes. Post-arrest myoclonus has diverse prognostic implications, depending on its source (cortical or subcortical), timing of onset related to the cardiac arrest, and electroclinical profile. Once considered pathognomonic of invariably poor outcomes, a good outcome at hospital discharge can be achieved in patients despite cortical or subcortical myoclonus, although regaining consciousness earlier is more likely in those with subcortical origin. Cortical myoclonus has been recognized to have at least two electroclinical patterns. Elmer pattern 1 (Fig. 5 A), characterized by a burst-suppressed background with high amplitude polyspikes in lockstep with myoclonic jerks, has a 100% mortality rate according to a single-center study. In contrast, Elmer pattern 2 (Fig. 5 B), characterized by midline-predominant spiky periodic discharges in lockstep with myoclonic jerks with a relatively continuous background, had a 50% survival rate, with all survivors being discharged to home or rehabilitation. Reactivity, long regarded as a harbinger of unfavorable outcomes, has faced scrutiny due to its high rate of false positives, and this was confirmed by Liu et al. who found a false positive ratio reaching 25% when a standardized somatosensory stimulus was used to elicit EEG reactivity. This discrepancy is attributed to variations in testing and interpretation standards. An international consensus statement was developed in 2018 by Admiraal et al. generating a stimulus protocol for EEG reactivity testing and the interpretation of EEG reactivity in daily clinical care (Fig. 6). Therefore, EEG has a significant role as a neuroprognostic tool, enabling the prediction of favorable (consciousness and independence) or unfavorable (disorder of consciousness and disabled state) outcomes in a timely dependent manner. EEG is widely used and considered necessary for outcome prediction by most providers caring for cardiac arrest patients and recommended by guidelines.

### Multimodal prediction of favorable outcome after cardiac arrest: a cohort study [^113TG4eW]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study proposes a multimodal prognostic score detecting most patients who will reach functional independence (CPC 1–2) or survive (CPC 1–3) at 3 months, using routinely available tools (four EEG features, one serological, one clinical). The model may represent an improvement to existing prognostication methods, giving families and caregivers, within 72 hours of CA, reliable information on chances of favorable outcome. Further emphasis on multimodal prognostic scores in large cohorts is indicated.

Electroencephalogram after cardiac arrest — review scope: Last Full Review: ILCOR 2023 notes background that the brain is prone to hypoxic injury during cardiac arrest and following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), with some patients developing global cerebral edema followed by herniation and brain death within 24 hours while others remain comatose and at risk for severe neurological injury. In 2020, a systematic review assessed the ability to predict poor neurological outcome in comatose adult survivors from cardiac arrest using multiple modalities including clinical examination, blood biomarkers, electrophysiology and neuroimaging, and the studies identified were considered by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) with four separate Consensuses on Science with Treatment.

### EEG monitoring after cardiac arrest [^113HxWkE]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

EEG to detect and treat seizures

Superimposed rhythmic and periodic EEG patterns (RPPs) that may reflect electrographic seizures have been reported in 10–35% of comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Although isolated discharges on EEG hold no predictive value, generalised periodic discharges or electrographic seizures are associated with a poor neurological outcome. An earlier occurrence of epileptiform activity, evolution from a suppressed background pattern, and lower background continuity are associated with a higher likelihood of unfavourable outcome.

There is currently no consensus on what the optimal treatment strategy of seizures after cardiac arrest is. Prolonged seizures may cause further brain damage through excitotoxicity, in which case aggressive treatment could be beneficial. In the recently published multicentre TELSTAR trial, a stepwise administration of antiepileptic agents and protocolised sedation (intravenous phenytoin plus benzodiazepines, followed by levetiracetam or valproic acid plus propofol in case of failure, and thiopental if the second step was unsuccessful) achieved complete suppression of all RPPs during 48 consecutive hours in 49/88 (56%) patients vs. 2/83 (2%) with standard care. However, at 3 months, neurological outcome did not differ between the two groups. The overall rate of poor neurological outcome was very high (92%). While the TELSTAR trial suggests that aggressive anti-seizure therapy may be futile in the most severe patients with post-anoxic status epilepticus, the benefit of seizure suppression in patients with seizures or status epilepticus lacking other conclusive unfavourable signs remains to be determined.

Neurological Management in the ICU: Early Triage

Early determination of brain-injury severity is a double-edged sword. Accurate early risk assessment facilitates triage of appropriate patients to post-CA coronary revascularization and mechanical circulatory support, helps guide family conversations and resource use, and could be used to identify optimal patients for clinical trials. But when early neurological risk assessment is inappropriately applied to end-of-life decision-making, accuracy is poor and mortality is likely increased through erroneous prognostication. Therefore, we distinguish between early risk assessment, which may help advance post-CA care, and early prognostication, which is dangerous and should be avoided.

Prognostication after CA is delayed until a high degree of accuracy can be determined and until the prognosis is stable; early prognostication is flawed, is associated with excess mortality, and should be avoided. Thus, future research opportunities include developing tools that differentiate prognosticating for poor outcome from triaging patients for early intervention. Evaluating which early post-CA findings — including clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, serum biomarkers, or — others — differentiate patients for individualized treatment interventions requires further study.

Early Triage Statements

Early risk stratification is not intended as a tool for triage to withdraw life support and is not used for that purpose (90.5%, 19/21).
Data that do not establish neurological risk stratification in the first 6 hours after CA include the patient's age, duration of CPR, seizure activity, serum lactate level or pH, Glasgow motor subscore in patients who received NMB or sedation, pupillary function in patients who received atropine, and optic nerve sheath diameter (95.3%, 20/21).
Validated illness severity scores may be used to optimize therapeutic interventions (88.2%, 15/17).

### Standardized EEG interpretation accurately predicts prognosis after cardiac arrest [^11146PF4]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is commonand most patients remain unconscious after restoration of spontaneous circulation. Approximately half of these patients will die during the hospital stay, the majority from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.

Intensive care is usually continued until a prediction of poor outcome is made, based on clinical neurologic examination, commonly combined with other prognostic tools. EEG is the most widely used prognostic tool to support a clinical examination and is accessible in most hospitals; it is recommended for both prognostication and ruling out subclinical seizures.

There is no high-level evidence for predicting poor prognosis using EEG and meta-analysis of available data is confounded by the wide variety of classification systems used. Other drawbacks of EEG include interrater variability, and the confounding effects of ongoing or residual sedation.

The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) has proposed a standardized critical care EEG terminologyto facilitate multicenter studies and maximize interrater reliability. We used this recently revised terminology to evaluate prospectively recorded EEGs in the Target Temperature Management (TTM) trial, which randomized 950 patients to 33°C vs 36°C controlled temperature after cardiac arrest and reported no differences in mortality or neurocognitive function.

Using the ACNS terminology, we defined highly malignant EEG patternsand found substantial interrater and intrarater agreement. The main objective of this study was to evaluate whether the proposed highly malignant EEG patterns reliably predict a poor neurologic outcome for patients who remain in a coma after cardiac arrest. Moreover, we explored the prognostic performance of malignant and benign EEG patterns.

### Association of initial illness severity and outcomes after cardiac arrest with targeted temperature management at 36 ° C or 33 ° C [^115GcRrN]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

We maintain a quality improvement database of all patients treated for cardiac arrest at our institution. We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients in this database who were comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and who were treated with TTM. We initiated our study after noting decreased survival in subsets of patients treated with TTM at 36 °C after 2013. The University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office approved retrospective analysis of this database and determined this research to be exempt from the requirement to obtain informed consent. This report follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline for cohort studies.

Our institution is a regional referral center for post–cardiac arrest care. In addition to receiving patients directly from the scene of their cardiac arrest, many patients are initially transported to a local hospital via emergency medical services and are then transferred to our regional center for specialized care. Within our center, a team of physicians provides consultation on most cardiac arrest cases to direct cardiac arrest–specific aspects of care. This group included physicians with prior training in emergency medicine, critical care medicine, or neurology with multiple years of experience as a post–cardiac arrest consultant. Specific domains for which we regiment treatment include TTM, hemodynamic goals, seizure detection and management, ordering and interpretation of testing for neurologic prognostication, referral for rehabilitation, and secondary prevention. Most patients receive electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring during TTM given the incidence of malignant EEG patterns in the post–cardiac arrest population and their association with neurologic outcomes. Most patients also have routine computed tomography (CT) of the brain within the first hours of admission to assess for early signs of cerebral edema and for neurologic etiologies of cardiac arrest. Neurologic prognostication uses clinical examination, EEG, evoked potentials, and repeated imaging as ordered and interpreted by our consultation team, according to principles we have previously described.

### Prognostic significance of clinical seizures after cardiac arrest and target temperature management [^11281YFX]. Resuscitation (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

Clinical seizures are common after cardiac arrest and predictive of a poor neurological outcome. Seizures may be myoclonic, tonic-clonic or a combination of seizure types. This study reports the incidence and prognostic significance of clinical seizures in the target temperature management (TTM) after cardiac arrest trial. Our hypotheses were that seizures are associated with a poor prognosis and that the incidence of seizures is not affected by the target temperature.

Methods

Post-hoc analysis of reported clinical seizures during day 1–7 in the TTM-trial including their treatment, EEG-findings, and long-term neurological outcome. The trial randomised 939 comatose survivors to TTM at 33°C or 36°C with strict criteria for withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies. Sensitivity, specificity and false positive rate for poor outcome were reported for different types of seizures.

Results

Clinical seizures were registered in 268 patients (29%), similarly distributed in both intervention arms. Early and late seizures were equally predictive of poor outcome. Myoclonic seizures were the most common (240 patients, 26%) and the most predictive of a poor outcome (sensitivity 36.1%, false positive rate 4.3%). Two patients with status myoclonus regained consciousness, one with a good neurological outcome, generating a false positive rate of poor outcome of 0.2% (95%CI 0.0–1.0).

Conclusion

Clinical seizures are common after cardiac arrest and indicate poor outcome with limited specificity. Prolonged seizures are a very grave sign but occasional patients may have a good outcome. The level of the target temperature does not affect the prevalence or prognostic significance of seizures.

### Continuous EEG monitoring enhances multimodal outcome prediction in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [^113vb6Bc]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoxic brain injury is the largest contributor to disability and mortality after cardiac arrest. We aim to identify electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics that can predict outcome on cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM).

Methods

We retrospectively examined clinical, EEG, functional outcome at discharge, and in-hospital mortality for 373 adult subjects with return of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. Poor outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 3–5. Pure suppression-burst (SB) was defined as SB not associated with status epilepticus (SE), seizures, or generalized periodic discharges.

Results

In-hospital mortality was 68.6% (N = 256). Presence of both unreactive EEG background and SE was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% (95% confidence interval: 0.96–1) and a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0% (95% CI: 0–0.11) for poor functional outcome. A prediction model including demographics data, admission exam, presence of status epilepticus, pure SB, and lack of EEG reactivity had an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87–0.95) for poor functional outcome prediction, and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94–0.98) for in-hospital mortality. Presence of pure SB (N = 87) was confounded by anesthetics use in 83.9% of the cases, and was not an independent predictor of poor functional outcome, having a FPR of 23% (95% CI: 0.19–0.28).

Conclusions

An unreactive EEG background and SE predicted poor functional outcome and in-hospital mortality in cardiac arrest patients undergoing TTM. Prognostic value of pure SB is confounded by use of sedative agents, and its use on prognostication decisions should be made with caution.

Recommendations

We suggest:
Using the term status myoclonus to indicate a continuous and generalized myoclonus persisting for ≥ 30 min in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.
Using the presence of a status myoclonus within 48 h from ROSC in combination with other predictors to predict poor outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, either TH-treated or non-TH-treated.
Evaluating patients with post-arrest status myoclonus off sedation whenever possible; in those patients, EEG recording can be useful to identify EEG signs of awareness and reactivity and to reveal a coexistent epileptiform activity.

Knowledge gaps

A consensus-based, uniform nomenclature and definition for status myoclonus is needed.
The distinctive pathophysiological and electrophysiological features of postanoxic status myoclonus, in comparison with more benign forms of myoclonus, like the Lance–Adams syndrome, need to be further investigated.

### Prognostic value of continuous EEG monitoring during therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest [^113fFGMA]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) improves outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (CA). TH also alters the predictive value of neurologic prognostication in patients with postanoxic coma. We and others recently demonstrated that, compared with previous studies performed before the introduction of TH, neurologic examination performed at 72 hours may be unreliable to predict outcome after CA, and that standard EEG may significantly improve prognostication at this time.

Continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) provides important information regarding brain function, particularly in comatose patients, and is increasingly used to monitor early on-line changes of cerebral electrophysiology at the bedside in critically ill patients. Only a few studies have evaluated the role of cEEG performed during TH in the early phase of postresuscitation care. These studies, however, either included pediatric populations only or were focused primarily on the prevalence of postanoxic seizures. However, the exact prognostic value of cEEG findings during TH in patients with postanoxic coma has not been investigated. In this prospective study, we sought to examine the relation between cEEG findings during TH and outcome in comatose survivors of CA. We primarily tested the hypothesis that the type and reactivity of cEEG background during TH may reliably predict patient prognosis.

Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

2023 Treatment Recommendations

All evaluated tests were used in combination with other tests by clinicians in these studies. Although the predictive accuracy of tests was evaluated individually, we recommend that no single test should be used in isolation for prediction of good neurological outcome (good practice statement).

We suggest using EEG within 6 to 72 hours after ROC for predicting good neurological outcome in children after cardiac arrest (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence).

We suggest using the following EEG features after ROC for predicting good neurological outcome: presence of sleep spindle and sleep II architecture at 12 to 24 hours, continuous or normal background EEG between 1 and 72 hours, or EEG reactivity between 6 and 24 hours (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).

We suggest against using the following EEG features after ROC to predict good neurological outcome: absence of clinical or electrographic seizures; absence of status epilepticus; absence of myoclonic epilepsy; absence of burst suppression, burst attenuation, or generalized periodic epileptiform discharges; or absence of attenuated, isoelectric, or flat EEG (weak recommendation, very low–certainty evidence).

We cannot make a recommendation for or against the use of the presence or absence of N20 response SSEPs after ROC for predicting good neurological outcome.

We cannot make a recommendation for or against the use of EEG variability, EEG voltage, or quantitative EEG score for predicting good neurological outcomes.

Justification and Evidence-to-Decision Framework Highlights

The complete evidence-to-decision framework can be found on the ILCOR website, and the evidence-to-decision table is provided in Appendix A. Key points include the following:

ACNS definitions for seizures and EEG indices were followed in only some studies. EEG and SSEP prognostic criteria require clear and reproducible definitions and require validation in the PICU environment.
The complex interpretation of normality in background EEG patterns in preterm and term infants and the impact of brain maturation on EEG patterns in infancy and childhood require expert neurophysiology input. Studies reported limited information on the handling of this area, and further refinement of definitions and application of recommendation is required.
There was limited or no accounting for when tests were undertaken in relation to concurrent pharmacological exposure, sedation, and ongoing treatment (eg, targeted temperature management) in patients after cardiac arrest.
SSEPs have a high level of precision in adult studies of neuroprognostication in comatose patients after cardiac arrest. The PLS Task Force recognizes the lack of available data in children and strongly encourages further multicenter evaluation.

### Advanced life support. neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest and ROSC: prediction of poor neurological outcome [^1117BeyG]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Electrophysiology tests after adult post–cardiac arrest: An International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) systematic review evaluated the use of electrophysiology studies assessed within one week from cardiac arrest on adults who are comatose after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in any setting, regardless of target temperature. In the post-cardiac arrest adult patient, neither background reactivity alone nor seizures on electroencephalogram (EEG) or status epilepticus should be used to predict poor outcome; in the post-arrest adult patient, any of the following can be used to predict poor outcome — presence of epileptiform activity on EEG, burst suppression on EEG in patients who are off sedation after cardiac arrest and comatose, and highly malignant EEG patterns. In the post-arrest adult, healthcare professionals can consider using a bilaterally absent somatosensory evoked potential wave in combination with other indices to predict poor outcome, and very low-certainty evidence from a total of 20 observational studies evaluated the use of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).

### Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: an advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^114Z37AG]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

We suggest:
Using EEG-based predictors such as absence of EEG reactivity to external stimuli, presence of burst-suppression or status epilepticus at ≥ 72 h after ROSC to predict poor outcome in comatose survivors from cardiac arrest.
Using these predictors only in combination (i.e. presence of burst-suppression or status epilepticus plus an unreactive background) and combining them with other predictors, since these criteria lack standardisation and the relevant evidence is limited to a few studies performed by experienced electrophysiologists.
Not using a low EEG voltage to predict outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, because of the limited evidence and the risk of interference from hypothermia, ongoing sedation and technical factors.

We recommend not using burst-suppression for prognostication during the first 24–36 h after ROSC or during TH in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

Apart from its prognostic significance, recording of EEG — either continuous or intermittent — in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest both during TH and after rewarming is helpful to assess the level of consciousness — which may be masked by prolonged sedation, neuromuscular dysfunction or myoclonus — and to detect and treat non-convulsive seizures, which may occur in about one-quarter of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

Knowledge gaps

Larger prospective studies on the prevalence and the predictive value of EEG changes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest are needed, especially in patients who have been rewarmed from controlled temperature.
The definition of SE and the modalities for eliciting and evaluating EEG reactivity need standardisation. In future studies, definitions of burst suppression and low-voltage EEG should comply with recent recommendations.
It is not clear whether postanoxic SE is only a marker of brain injury or whether it contributes directly to neurological injury, nor if anti-epileptic treatments may potentially improve its outcome.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^115ivYmH]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Electroencephalography (EEG) reactivity and background after cardiac arrest show variable prognostic performance: reactivity present within 24 h achieved a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 80% for prediction of good 6-month functional outcome, whereas a continuous background within 12 h achieved a sensitivity of 19% and a specificity of 98%. EEG reactivity 12–24 h from return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) achieved a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 65% for the prediction of good long-term outcome. The primary concerns with EEG reactivity as a predictor include subjectivity and a higher false positive rate, up to 44% in one study. The presence of discrete electrographic seizures is not a reliable predictor of outcome. Superimposed generalized or lateralized periodic discharges are a frequent finding in the first 48–72 h following ROSC, and generalized alpha and theta patterns are relatively uncommon with insufficient high-quality evidence to support a recommendation to use these patterns in neuroprognostication.

Description of the Predictor

This predictor refers to spontaneous myoclonus, the involuntary spasmodic contraction of groups of axial or appendicular muscles, in the early period (< 48 h) following ROSC from hypoxia-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Although EEG may be performed to establish the source of myoclonus (cortical, subcortical, or other), detect seizures, and evaluate background, this predictor refers to the purely clinical finding without concomitant EEG evaluation. Status myoclonus, a severe form of early myoclonus, has been defined as spontaneous, repetitive, unrelenting, generalized multifocal myoclonus involving the face, limbs, and axial musculature in comatose patients < 48 h from ROSC. Some definitions of this phenomenon have specified a duration of 30 min. Status myoclonus, in particular, has traditionally been associated with a poor prognosis. Of note, Lance–Adams syndrome, characterized by the delayed onset and subsequent persistence of sporadic myoclonus in survivors of cardiac arrest, is a distinct entity frequently associated with good functional recovery.

Recommendation

When counseling family members and/or surrogates of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, we suggest that the occurrence of myoclonus < 48 h from ROSC, in the absence of concomitant EEG evaluation, not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 3 months or later (weak recommendation; very low quality evidence).

### Electrographic and clinical determinants of good outcome after postanoxic status epilepticus [^116E2TTe]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients in coma after resuscitation from cardiac arrest (CA) constitute a common patient category in the intensive care unit (ICU), and neurologists are often involved in prognostication and treatment of postanoxic electrographic status epilepticus (PSE) that affects up to a third of these patients. While PSE is associated with high mortality rates, survival with good functional outcome has been reported in approximately 10% of patients. To determine which patients with PSE have a chance of good outcome and might benefit from prolonged ICU treatment, and in which patients treatment is futile, is a relevant clinical dilemma. Several characteristics of PSE associated with good outcome have been proposed. For example, a late start of PSE from a restored EEG background pattern has mainly been reported in patients with good outcome. On the contrary, early onset of PSE, or onset from a suppressed or noncontinuous background, has almost exclusively been observed in patients with poor outcome.,

This is a preplanned substudy of the international multicenter Targeted Hypothermia vs Targeted Normothermia After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial, also known as the TTM2-trial. The prespecified hypothesis was that a multilevel strategy, based on early clinical and electrographic characteristics, would identify patients with a favorable PSE profile and increased probability of good long-term functional outcome. This strategy was not communicated to the treating teams.

### Myoclonus after cardiac arrest: need for standardization – A systematic review and research proposal on terminology [^114qfwpR]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Is there uniformity in defining myoclonus following cardiac arrest? How does the nomenclature impact on outcome assessment?

Findings: A systematic review of 119 studies revealed heterogeneity in myoclonus definitions, associated electroencephalogram patterns, and outcomes. Categorizing patients including electroencephalogram patterns demonstrated better association with outcomes than current myoclonus definitions.

Meaning: The substantial heterogeneity in myoclonus definitions emphasizes the need for international consensus. A research proposal on terminology facilitates the integration of electroencephalogram background and status epilepticus criteria.

Myoclonus is characterized by sudden, brief, and involuntary movements caused by muscle contractions/inhibitions and is often observed in comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA). While generally associated with poor outcome, a small subset of patients achieves good prognosis, indicated by a favorable Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) (Supplementary Table S1).

Current literature presents a wide range of clinical definitions and associated electroencephalogram features of post-CA myoclonus, which poses a challenge for treatment decisions and accurate prognostication. Historically, myoclonus persisting for more than 30 minutes has been clinically defined as myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE). The 2015 guidelines from the European Resuscitation Council/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ERC/ESICM) defined myoclonic status/status myoclonus (MyS/SM) similarly, highlighting its strong association with poor outcome. Consequently, Status Myoclonus less than or equal to 72 hours has been included among those poor outcome factors allowing a withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) in the 2021 ERC/ESICM guidelines. Concurrently, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) revised the time criterion for convulsive status epilepticus (CSE), reducing it from 30 to 5 minutes, and for non-CSE to 10 minutes.

### Association of EEG characteristics with outcomes following pediatric ICU cardiac arrest: a secondary analysis of the ICU-RESUScitation trial [^1161qCjM]. Resuscitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There are limited tools available following cardiac arrest to prognosticate neurologic outcomes. Prior retrospective and single center studies have demonstrated early EEG features are associated with neurologic outcome. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of EEG for pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) in a prospective, multicenter study.

Methods

This cohort study is a secondary analysis of the ICU-Resuscitation trial, a multicenter randomized interventional trial conducted at 18 pediatric and pediatric cardiac ICUs in the United States. Patients who achieved return of circulation (ROC) and had post-ROC EEG monitoring were eligible for inclusion. Patients < 90 days old and those with pre-arrest Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) scores > 3 were excluded. EEG features of interest included EEG Background Category, and presence of focal abnormalities, sleep spindles, variability, reactivity, periodic and rhythmic patterns, and seizures. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurologic outcome. Associations between EEG features and outcomes were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Prediction models with and without EEG Background Category were developed and receiver operator characteristic curves compared.

Results

Of the 1129 patients with an index cardiac arrest who achieved ROC in the parent study, 261 had EEG within 24 h of ROC, of which 151 were evaluable. The cohort included 57% males with a median age of 1.1 years (IQR 0.4, 6.8). EEG features including EEG Background Category, sleep spindles, variability, and reactivity were associated with survival with favorable outcome and survival, (all p < 0.001). The addition of EEG Background Category to clinical models including age category, illness category, PRISM score, duration of CPR, first documented rhythm, highest early post-arrest arterial lactate improved the prediction accuracy achieving an AUROC of 0.84 (CI 0.77–0.92), compared to AUROC of 0.76 (CI 0.67–0.85) (p = 0.005) without EEG Background Category.

Conclusion

This multicenter study demonstrates the value of EEG, in the first 24 h following ROC, for predicting survival with favorable outcome after a pediatric IHCA.

### Features, outcome, and treatment of postanoxic status epilepticus: pooled analysis of 3 cohorts [^115KvU4Z]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The prognostic significance and the benefits of antiseizure treatment for definite and possible status epilepticus (SE) after cardiac arrest (CA) remain debated. The study aims to identify clinical and EEG predictors of outcome in definite and possible SE after CA and to determine patient categories in which antiseizure medication is useful.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter pooled analysis of individual patient data from the Treatment of ELectroencephalographic STatus epilepticus After cardiopulmonary Resuscitation trial and 2 local registries (Brussels and Geneva). Patients with EEG patterns fulfilling the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society criteria for definite or possible SE within 72 hours after CA were included. Primary outcome was the cerebral performance category (CPC) at 3 months, dichotomized as good (CPC 1–2) or poor (CPC 3–5). Patients, clinical, EEG, and treatment characteristics were related to outcome using univariate and multivariate analyses in the whole cohort and separate for patients without ≥ 2 poor outcome European Resuscitation Council (ERC)/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) criteria. This latter group of patients was further divided into 2 subgroups: those with definite SE and those with possible SE.

Results

Of 274 patients (median age 66 [interquartile range (IQR) 55–75], 31% female) with definite or possible SE, 24 (8.8%) had good recovery. In multivariate analysis, nonmotor semiology and SE cessation were associated with good recovery. After exclusion of patients with ≥ 2 poor outcome ERC/ESICM criteria (180 patients), we included 94 patients (52 definite SE and 42 possible SE), 25% having good outcome. In definite SE, SE cessation (12 [100%] vs 20 [50%], p = 0.002), higher discharge frequency (3 Hz [IQR 2–3] vs 2 Hz [IQR 2–3], p = 0.024), guideline-recommended SE treatment (12 [100%] vs 28 [70%], p = 0.047), and higher doses of levetiracetam (4,250 [IQR 3,750–4,500] mg vs 2,000 [IQR 2,000–3,000] mg, p = 0.001) and valproic acid (4,800 [IQR 3,600–5,400] mg vs 2,000 [IQR 1,850–2,250] mg, p = 0.032) were associated with favorable outcome. None of the definite or possible SE patients with good outcome had a suppressed/suppression-burst background before SE onset.

Discussion

Patients with postanoxic definite or possible SE have a 25% chance of good outcome in the absence of ≥ 2 poor outcome ERC/ESICM factors. EEG background continuity before SE onset and higher discharge frequency contribute to the identification of patients who may benefit from protracted treatment.

### Myoclonus after cardiac arrest: where Do we Go from here? [^112FWRyL]. Epilepsy Currents (2017). Low credibility.

Prognostication after cardiac arrest often depends primarily on neurological function, and characterizing the extent of neurological injury hinges on neurophysiological testing and clinical neurological examination. The presence of early posthypoxic myoclonus (PHM) following cardiac arrest had been invariably associated with poor outcome, but more recent studies have shown that those with early PHM may survive with good neurological function. Electroencephalographic patterns suggestive of severe brain injury may be more valuable than the presence of PHM itself in portending poor functional status, and phenotyping PHM may also be useful in delineating benign and malignant forms. Patients with early PHM should be evaluated similarly to others who suffer cardiac arrest by using a multimodal approach in determining prognosis until further studies are performed that better characterize early PHM subtypes and their outcomes.

### Predictors and outcomes of seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariable analysis of 2, 578 patients [^117EGGgk]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Limited data exist regarding the epidemiology and prognosis of seizures in adults after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to define preoperative predictors of seizures and impact on postoperative outcomes.

Methods

A prospective database of 2,578 consecutive adults who underwent cardiac surgery at a single institution between April 2007 and December 2009 was retrospectively analyzed to determine risk factors for postoperative seizures and prognostic impact. No patient received tranexamic acid or aprotinin.

Results

Seizures occurred in 31 patients (1%) at a median of 2 days postoperatively (1 patient had a preoperative diagnosis of seizure disorder). Seizures were classified as generalized tonic-clonic (71%), simple/complex partial (26%), or status epilepticus (3%). Incidence differed according to procedure (coronary bypass 0.1%, isolated valve 1%, valve/coronary bypass 3%, aorta 5%; p < 0.001). Patients who experienced seizures had nearly a fivefold higher operative mortality than patients who did not (29% versus 6%, p < 0.001). Head computed tomography was performed in 26 patients (84%), of whom ischemic strokes were identified in 14 cases (53%). These were embolic in 9 patients (34%), and watershed in 3 (12%). Hemorrhagic strokes were observed in 2 patients (8%). The occurrence of a new postoperative stroke in seizure patients did not significantly increase the likelihood of in-hospital death. Thirteen patients (41%) were discharged without neurologic deficit. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified three risk factors for seizure: deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, aortic calcification or atheroma, and critical preoperative state.

Conclusions

Seizures in adults after cardiac surgery are strong independent predictors of permanent neurologic deficit and increased operative mortality. Early head computed tomography may be indicated to identify treatable pathology.

### Sensitivity of continuous electroencephalography to detect ictal activity after cardiac arrest [^114xt3ew]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac arrest affects more than 600 000 individuals in the US each year. Most patients hospitalized after resuscitation from cardiac arrest are initially comatose, and of these, 25% to 50% have electroencephalographic (EEG) activity on the ictal-interictal continuum. Patients who develop epileptiform EEG activity generally have worse clinical outcomes. It remains controversial whether this association reflects a causal relationship mediated by secondary brain injury, as has been observed in other disease states, or if abnormal EEG findings are simply a marker of primary injury severity. Regardless, most clinicians treat convulsive or nonconvulsive status epilepticus when detected. In short, EEG findings have established prognostic value, and detection of EEG abnormalities may alter clinical care. Based on these facts, consensus guidelines strongly recommend that patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest undergo frequent or continuous EEG monitoring.

Because abnormal EEG activity in patients who are comatose and undergo treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is often transient and episodic, 48 hours or more of continuous EEG monitoring may be necessary to achieve reasonable sensitivity. Unfortunately, continuous monitoring is resource intensive and is not available in all settings. To determine the yield over time of EEG monitoring after cardiac arrest, we analyzed a large, multicenter cohort of patients who were continuously monitored after cardiac arrest to determine the time-dependent sensitivity for detecting (1) epileptiform patterns associated with patient outcome, and (2) potentially treatable seizures likely to cause secondary brain injury. We compared the sensitivity and timeliness of detection of continuous EEG with several widely available alternative strategies of brief intermittent monitoring (ie, 20 minutes or less). The objectives of this study were to determine the difference in sensitivity and delay between intermittent and continuous EEG monitoring for epileptiform event detection. We then quantified the outcomes of these differences by incorporating continuous or brief intermittent EEG results into models predicting neurological outcome based in multimodality neurological evaluation. This approach tested the hypothesis that brief intermittent EEG provides less prognostic information than continuous EEG.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^112JapDW]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Future directions in neuroprognostication research — outcomes should be assessed at least 3 months and ideally 6 or more months after cardiac arrest with assessors ideally blinded to the predictor and patient details. Multicenter studies will facilitate recruitment and a larger sample size. Predictors should use standardized definitions with explicit clinical definitions, favor accurate and objective techniques with the least interrater variance, standardize EEG findings based on published criteria and testing parameters, use validated imaging quantification techniques, and measure biomarkers with standardized laboratory techniques at specific time points. All study participants should ideally undergo assessment of the predictor rather than a clinician-selected subpopulation, and studies of clinical prediction models should report model calibration for predicted probabilities.

Main Outcomes and Measures Return of spontaneous circulation for 20 minutes or longer and survival to hospital discharge with a CPC score of 1 or 2. Results. Follow-up was completed in all resuscitated patients. Patients in the VSE group vs patients in the control group had higher probability for ROSC of 20 minutes or longer, improved hemodynamics and central venous oxygen saturation, and less organ dysfunction. Adverse event rates were similar in the 2 groups.

Postresuscitation shock was defined as sustained, new postarrest circulatory failure or postarrest need for 50% or greater increase in any prearrest vasopressor/inotropic support targeted to mean arterial pressure greater than 70 mm Hg. Treatment-refractory shock was defined as having a mean arterial pressure less than 70 mm Hg and being unresponsive to norepinephrine infusions of 0. 5 μg/kg/min or greater, while central venous pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressure, or both exceeded 12 mm Hg. Among survivors for 4 hours or longer, VSE patients with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding controls had lower hazard of poor outcome during follow-up.

### Background frequency can enhance the prognostication power of EEG patterns categories in comatose cardiac arrest survivors: a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study [^115N9ugH]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate neurological prognostication is critically important in cardiac arrest survivors with ischemic/reperfusion brain injury. Late awakening of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients should be distinguished from irreversible brain damage. A multimodal approach involving delayed timing (after > 72 h) of prognostication has been recommended to minimize the possibility of inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) for patients who may otherwise achieve meaningful neurological recovery.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most widely used tool in clinical practice to evaluate cortical brain activity and diagnose seizure. Its use as a neuroprognostic tool is promising, but the inter-rater variability and definitions used to describe specific findings and patterns particularly in post-cardiac arrest patients are limited. The American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) proposed a standardized terminology for critical care EEG. Current ERC guidelines suggest using highly malignant EEG defined as suppressed background with or without periodic discharges and burst-suppression for indicators of a poor prognosis. Westhall et al. proposed three standardized EEG pattern categories ("highly malignant", "malignant", and "benign") for the assessment of neurological outcome. Recently, a sub-study of the Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) trial first validated the "highly malignant" EEG pattern and reported that it accurately predicts poor neurological outcome with high specificity (98–100%) in EEGs recorded at a median time of 77 h (range 53–102) after cardiac arrest. This was confirmed with the findings of a very recent study of 62 patients that the presence of a "highly malignant" EEG pattern was predictive of a poor neurological outcome, with 100% specificity and 42% sensitivity. However, the new American Heart Association guidelines did not include these three EEG patterns, indicating that their prognostic performance needs to be validated in a large cohort. Moreover, the prognostic accuracy of the "malignant" pattern has been questionable, and the prognostic value of these standardized EEG pattern categories based on the timing of EEG has not been determined yet.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic performance of the three standardized EEG pattern categories according to the EEG timing (early vs. late) using a multicenter, prospective registry of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated with TTM. We also determined the EEG features that can improve the predictive power for poor neurologic outcomes at 1 month after cardiac arrest.

### Sensitivity of continuous electroencephalography to detect ictal activity after cardiac arrest [^113waNuw]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

EEG-Related Variables

Two study coauthors (P.J.C. and M.E.B.) jointly annotated EEG recordings. We defined EEG states over time using an adaptation of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society guidelines, as previously described, with specific attention to patterns identified as particularly common or important in prior post–cardiac arrest research. We categorized background activity as suppression (less than 10 µV), suppression burst (also referred to as burst suppression or discontinuous), or continuous (including continuous with periods of attenuation [ie, nearly continuous]). We separately categorized superimposed epileptiform activity as no activity (ie, suppression); nonepileptiform activity; nonperiodic epileptiform discharges; periodic epileptiform discharges (including generalized, lateralized, bilateral independent, and other periodic discharges); polyspike wave discharges, regardless of presence or absences of associated myoclonus; and electrographic seizures (including both evolving seizures and periodic discharges greater than 2.5 Hz).

Not all EEG patterns on the ictal-interictal continuum are believed to have the same prognostic significance, potential to cause secondary brain injury, or responsiveness to treatment with AEDs. For example, occasional epileptiform discharges scattered throughout an otherwise normal recording are likely both less ominous for prognosis and less injurious than electrographic status epilepticus. Some patterns, such as burst suppression with identical bursts, are unique to global anoxic injury — they are important for prognosis but are more likely epiphenomena of devastating injury than treatable mediators of additional injury. For the purposes of this analysis, we categorized EEG patterns as risk factors (ie, less likely to be prognostically or clinically important but instead reflective of epileptiform potential) or events (ie, strongly associated with outcome or likely to cause secondary brain injury). We tested 2 sets of event definitions — 1 designed to detect EEG findings associated with outcome at hospital discharge (prognostic events) and 1 designed to detect potentially treatment responsive classical seizures likely to cause secondary brain injury (potentially treatable seizures) (Table 1). These definitions were selected a priori based on prior studies specific to the cardiac arrest population.,

### Neurological prognostication of outcome in patients in coma after cardiac arrest [^112SmRU1]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Management of coma after cardiac arrest has improved during the past decade, allowing an increasing proportion of patients to survive, thus prognostication has become an integral part of post-resuscitation care. Neurologists are increasingly confronted with raised expectations of next of kin and the necessity to provide early predictions of long-term prognosis. During the past decade, as technology and clinical evidence have evolved, post-cardiac arrest prognostication has moved towards a multimodal paradigm combining clinical examination with additional methods, consisting of electrophysiology, blood biomarkers, and brain imaging, to optimise prognostic accuracy. Prognostication should never be based on a single indicator; although some variables have very low false positive rates for poor outcome, multimodal assessment provides resassurance about the reliability of a prognostic estimate by offering concordant evidence.

### Determination of prognosis after cardiac arrest may be more difficult after introduction of therapeutic hypothermia [^115dzpC9]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old patient had status epilepticus and no adequate reactions nine days after prolonged out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The cause of the arrest was acute myocardial infarction which was treated successfully with percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) and a stent placement. He was treated with therapeutic hypothermia (33 degrees C) for 24h and in intensive care with respiratory support for 42 days. One year later he has fully recovered and is back to normal life and academic work. The previously reported 100% prognosis of a poor neurological outcome in the presence of seizures 72 h post arrest may need to be re-examined after introduction of therapeutic hypothermia.

Prognostication in Anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest

The proportion of individuals surviving cardiac arrest and subsequent coma is increasing, but forecasting neurologic recovery in these patients remains an important challenge. A number of clinical variables are linked to neurologic prognosis, including examination, laboratory, and imaging findings. Several risk scores have been developed to predict neurologic outcome using combinations of these variables, as well as deep learning models, but these have not achieved sufficient evidence for reliable use.

EEG monitoring has proven to be a valuable complement to other modalities in these patients, including those treated with targeted temperature management (therapeutic hypothermia) and especially when considering EEG reactivity (EEG-R) alongside EEG background pattern. More rapid EEG review can be facilitated with an algorithm incorporating serial qEEG measurements, and this automated approach improves with the incorporation of a machine learning-based classifier and an expanded set of qEEG features. Sequential analysis of qEEG features additionally underscores the importance of long-term EEG monitoring, as positive trends in neurophysiologic evolution are associated with good prognosis despite malignant features in early EEG. Among machine learning models predicting neurologic outcomes after cardiac arrest, the most commonly-used EEG features include band power, Shannon entropy, and burst-suppression ratio.

Deep learning models bypass the need for feature extraction, learning flexibly from EEG and predicting post-arrest outcome more accurately than other machine learning architectures and trained experts. Despite increased model complexity, these systems can extract interpretable patterns that align with those utilized in visual analysis. Furthermore, they enable temporal modeling of EEG dynamics such that the algorithm's prognostic accuracy scales with increased monitoring time. In addition to automated prognostication, deep learning can uncover novel modalities for assessing brain function, such as via auditory stimuli, and create insights into the electrophysiologic characteristics of consciousness.

### Prognostication after cardiac arrest [^114B9f5K]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients who are comatose at 72 h or more after ROSC and in whom major confounders have been excluded should undergo prognostication, aimed to detect signs of severe and irreversible HIBI. This can be achieved using four main categories of tests: clinical examination, electrophysiology, biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The timing of these tests varies and may precede the clinical assessment at ≥ 72 h that initiates the prognostication process. Among prognostic tests, ocular reflexes and somatosensory evoked potentials are considered the most robust, while biomarkers, electroencephalography, imaging, and status myoclonus have inconsistencies which suggest using them only in combination. A multimodal approach combining multiple prognostication tests is recommended by current guidelines so that the risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction is minimised.

### Prediction of regaining consciousness despite an early epileptiform EEG after cardiac arrest [^116s87Dq]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

After cardiac arrest (CA), epileptiform EEG, occurring in about 1/3 of patients, often but not invariably heralds poor prognosis. We tested the hypothesis that a combination of specific EEG features identifies patients who may regain consciousness despite early epileptiform patterns.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed a registry of comatose patients post-CA (2 Swiss centers), including those with epileptiform EEG. Background and epileptiform features in EEGs 12–36 hours or 36–72 hours from CA were scored according to the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society nomenclature. Best Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score within 3 months (CPC 1–3 vs 4–5) was the primary outcome. Significant EEG variables were combined in a score assessed with receiver operating characteristic curves, and independently validated in a US cohort; its correlation with serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was also tested.

Results

Of 488 patients, 107 (21.9%) had epileptiform EEG < 72 hours; 18 (17%) reached CPC 1–3. EEG 12–36 hours background continuity ≥ 50%, absence of epileptiform abnormalities (p < 0.00001 each), 12–36 and 36–72 hours reactivity (p < 0.0001 each), 36–72 hours normal background amplitude (p = 0.0004), and stimulus-induced discharges (p = 0.0001) correlated with favorable outcome. The combined 6-point score cutoff ≥ 2 was 100% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI] 78%-100%) and 70% specific (95% CI, 59%-80%) for CPC 1–3 (area under the curve [AUC], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94–1.00). Increasing score correlated with NSE (ρ = -0.46, p = 0.0001). In the validation cohort (41 patients), the score was 100% sensitive (95% CI, 60%-100%) and 88% specific (95% CI, 73%-97%) for CPC 1–3 (AUC, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.91–1.00).

Conclusion

Prognostic value of early epileptiform EEG after CA can be estimated combining timing, continuity, reactivity, and amplitude features in a score that correlates with neuronal damage.

Twelve studies reported the relationship between absence or presence of seizures in children after cardiac arrest and good neurological outcomes at PICU/hospital discharge, 6 months, and 12 months. These studies included 1165 children, and 4 of the 12 studies reported using the ACNS criteria.,

Absence of seizures up to 24 hours after ROC had a sensitivity of 50% to 100% with an FPR of 63% to 98% for predicting good neurological outcome at various time points. Absence of seizure after 24 hours had a sensitivity of 50% to 100% with an FPR of 42% to 100% for predicting good neurological outcome.,

Absence of Status Epilepticus

Absence of status epilepticus was reported in 3 studies. Two of these studies used ACNS criteria to define status epilepticus. Good neurological outcome at PICU/hospital discharge was predicted with a high sensitivity of > 90%, although the FPR remained high at 81% to 91%.

Absence of Myoclonic Epilepsy

On the basis of 2 studies, absence of myoclonic seizures predicted good neurological outcomes with a sensitivity of 100% but a very high FPR of 79% to 83% at PICU/hospital discharge.

### Advanced life support. neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest and ROSC: prediction of good neurological outcome [^117RQuKR]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Red Cross guidelines — For comatose adults after cardiac arrest, the use of a continuous or nearly continuous normal voltage electroencephalogram (EEG) background without periodic discharges or seizures within 72 hours from return of spontaneous circulation, in combination with other indices, may be considered for predicting good outcome. It is suggested to not use heterogeneous, non-American Clinical Electrophysiology Society-defined favorable EEG patterns, or other EEG metrics — including reduced montage or amplitude integrated EEG, and bispectral index or EEG-derived indices — to predict good neurological outcome.

### Neurologic recovery at discharge and long-term survival after cardiac arrest… [^113N4U53]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Compared with patients with CPC 1, there was significantly higher hazard of death for patients with CPC 2 or CPC 3 or 4. Similar associations were seen in the OHCA and IHCA groups. A total of 5214 patients had a shockable rhythm. At discharge, 7374 patients had CPC 1, 1358 patients had CPC 2, and 658 patients had CPC 3 or 4. There were 3808 patients with OHCA and 5582 patients with IHCA, and the proportion of CPC scores were similar in these 2 subgroups. CPC scores, together with other factors, and their association with long-term survival are shown in Figure 4. For all patients, as well as in subgroups of IHCA and OHCA, CPC greater than 1 at discharge was associated with reduced long-term survival, while shockable rhythm, witnessed cardiac arrest, and high income were associated with better long-term survival.

For IHCA, cardiac arrest at all places other than the catheterization laboratory was associated with lower long-term survival, while cardiac arrest location in the OHCA population was not significantly associated with long-term survival. Our findings that neurologic status at discharge was associated with long-term prognosis are consistent with those of previous smaller studies on both OHCA12–15, 17 and IHCA15, 16 and suggest that the CPC score at discharge might be a predictor of long-term survival in patients surviving cardiac arrest beyond 30 days, although further prospective studies are needed to confirm this. Our findings might be useful for clinicians in their discussions with surviving patients and their relatives to give information regarding potential long-term outcomes. The difference in survival between patients assessed as CPC 1 and CPC 2 at discharge is especially interesting, since these 2 categories are often both considered favorable outcomes in studies on cardiac arrest.

Our results further support the importance of postresuscitation care aiming to restore neurologic function, as this potentially leads to extended years of life. One might even argue that only CPC 1, or corresponding levels of other measures of neurologic outcome, should be considered a favorable outcome in studies presenting outcomes after cardiac arrest.

### Post-cardiac arrest syndrome [^1179irgH]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is a multicomponent entity affecting many who survive an initial period of resuscitation following cardiac arrest. This focussed review explores some of the strategies for mitigating the effects of PCAS following the return of spontaneous circulation. We consider the current evidence for controlled oxygenation, strategies for blood-pressure targets, the timing of coronary reperfusion, and the evidence for temperature control and treatment of seizures. Despite several large trials investigating specific strategies to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest, many questions remain unanswered. Results of some studies suggest that interventions may benefit specific subgroups of cardiac arrest patients, but the optimal timing and duration of many interventions remain unknown. The role of intracranial pressure monitoring has been the subject of only a few studies, and its benefits remain unclear. Research aimed at improving the management of PCAS is ongoing.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, electroencephalography, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use the absence of EEG reactivity within 72 hours after cardiac arrest to support the prognosis of unfavorable neurological outcome in adult patients who remain comatose after ROSC.

Neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest — sporadic discharges, seizures, burst suppression, and highly malignant EEG patterns: Sporadic, nonrhythmic/periodic discharges within 24, 48, 48 to 72, or 96 to 120 hours were associated with poor neurological outcome with good specificity and low sensitivity; seizures on EEG within 120 hours were associated with poor neurological outcome from hospital discharge to 6 months with 100% specificity and low sensitivity, and status epilepticus likewise was associated with poor neurological outcome from hospital discharge to 6 months with high specificities and lower sensitivities; burst suppression within 24 hours (one study) and at 24 to 76 hours (four studies) was associated with poor neurological outcome at 6 months with high specificity and low sensitivity; highly malignant EEG patterns within 36 hours in nine studies were associated with poor neurological outcome from hospital discharge to 6 months with specificities ranging from 91% to 100% and sensitivities from 0.4% to 97%, and other studies extended the time to 120 hours.

### Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: an advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^116GDX62]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review and update the evidence on predictors of poor outcome (death, persistent vegetative state or severe neurological disability) in adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, either treated or not treated with controlled temperature, to identify knowledge gaps and to suggest a reliable prognostication strategy.

Methods

GRADE-based systematic review followed by expert consensus achieved using Web-based Delphi methodology, conference calls and face-to-face meetings. Predictors based on clinical examination, electrophysiology, biomarkers and imaging were included.

Results and Conclusions

Evidence from a total of 73 studies was reviewed. The quality of evidence was low or very low for almost all studies. In patients who are comatose with absent or extensor motor response at ≥ 72 h from arrest, either treated or not treated with controlled temperature, bilateral absence of either pupillary and corneal reflexes or N20 wave of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials were identified as the most robust predictors. Early status myoclonus, elevated values of neuron-specific enolase at 48–72 h from arrest, unreactive malignant EEG patterns after rewarming, and presence of diffuse signs of postanoxic injury on either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were identified as useful but less robust predictors. Prolonged observation and repeated assessments should be considered when results of initial assessment are inconclusive. Although no specific combination of predictors is sufficiently supported by available evidence, a multimodal prognostication approach is recommended in all patients.

### Update on the management of status epilepticus [^115nMgUK]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Randomized controlled trials investigating the initial pharmacological treatment of status epilepticus have been recently published. Furthermore, status epilepticus arising in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest has received increasing attention in the last years. This review offers an updated assessment of status epilepticus treatment in these different scenarios.

Recent Findings

Initial benzodiazepines underdosing is common and correlates with development of status epilepticus refractoriness. The recently published ESETT trial provides high-level evidence regarding the equivalence of fosphenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam as a second-line option. Myoclonus or epileptiform transients on electroencephalography occur in up to 1/3 of patients surviving a cardiac arrest. Contrary to previous assumptions regarding an almost invariable association with death, at least 1/10 of them may awaken with reasonably good prognosis, if treated. Multimodal prognostication including clinical examination, EEG, somatosensory evoked potentials, biochemical markers, and neuroimaging help identifying patients with a chance to recover consciousness, in whom a trial with antimyoclonic compounds and at times general anesthetics is indicated.

Summary

There is a continuous, albeit relatively slow progress in knowledge regarding different aspect of status epilepticus; recent findings refine some treatment strategies and help improving patients' outcomes. Further high-quality studies are clearly needed to further improve the management of these patients, especially those with severe, refractory status epilepticus forms.
