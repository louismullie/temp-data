## Question

can chlorpheniramine be given with allegra?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chlorpheniramine can be given with Allegra (fexofenadine), and what evidence and guidelines say about efficacy and safety of that combination. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic classes and expected central nervous system effects. Then, I should verify whether combining a sedating first-generation H1 antihistamine with a non-sedating second-generation agent provides added benefit. Next, I will review safety concerns, especially sedation and anticholinergic burden. After that, I should confirm what current guidelines recommend and what alternatives exist if control is inadequate. I will then check for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions and consider any special populations before giving a clear recommendation [^1129cT5F] [^1147bPmb].

> Let me first confirm the drug classes to ground the reasoning. Chlorpheniramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine with significant central sedation and anticholinergic effects, whereas fexofenadine is a second-generation H1 antihistamine designed to be minimally sedating at labeled doses; this first- versus second-generation distinction drives much of the safety and functional impairment signal we worry about in clinical practice [^111R9Dov] [^115zC7ms].

> Now, I need to check whether there is efficacy evidence for combining a sedating and a non-sedating H1 blocker versus optimizing a single second-generation agent. Guidelines and reviews emphasize that there are no studies demonstrating that a sedating plus non-sedating H1 combination outperforms up-dosing a single second-generation antihistamine, and mechanistically the clinical benefit is probably limited when H1 receptors are already occupied by another H1 antihistamine; moreover, an RCT in chronic spontaneous urticaria showed that adding a nighttime sedating antihistamine (hydroxyzine) to high-dose levocetirizine did not improve efficacy but did increase daytime somnolence, which is highly relevant to the proposed chlorpheniramine–fexofenadine combination [^1129cT5F] [^114eW7b7].

> Hold on, I should verify safety next, because even if efficacy were neutral, harm could tilt the balance. Chlorpheniramine commonly causes sedation, with subjectively reported somnolence in about 40% of users and documented next-day "hangover" impairments in divided attention, vigilance, working memory, and sensory–motor performance; it also disrupts sleep architecture by increasing REM latency and reducing REM duration, and it carries anticholinergic risks important for older adults and those with glaucoma, urinary retention, or COPD, among others [^114vj83Y] [^111SkEGm].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to make sure I'm not missing a recommended scenario. Multiple expert sources endorse second-generation antihistamines as first-line for urticaria and allergic rhinitis, discourage routine use of first-generation agents because of functional impairment, and in urticaria specifically recommend up-dosing the second-generation antihistamine (up to fourfold) rather than combining with a sedating agent; expert consensus surveys similarly highlight the cognitive and psychomotor burdens of first-generation drugs in real-world functioning, further arguing against their routine combination with modern agents [^1129cT5F] [^11484f5i].

> Wait, let me verify a common "nighttime add-on" rationale, since many clinicians consider a sedating antihistamine at bedtime to help sleep. Initially, I was thinking sedation might subjectively improve sleep quality, but the randomized trial adding night-time hydroxyzine to levocetirizine found no superiority in controlling symptoms or improving sleep metrics versus levocetirizine alone, while significantly increasing daytime somnolence; guidelines also caution that first-generation agents worsen REM architecture and can leave residual next-day impairment, so the presumed sleep benefit does not clearly materialize and may backfire in daytime function [^114eW7b7] [^114vj83Y].

> I should consider alternatives when control is inadequate, rather than defaulting to a sedating add-on. For urticaria, the preferred strategy is up-dosing the same second-generation antihistamine to as much as 4x the standard dose, with consideration of adding an H2 antihistamine in selected refractory cases; data for adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist are mixed, with a controlled cutaneous model showing no added benefit of montelukast to fexofenadine, so I need to be cautious and individualize based on phenotype, whereas for allergic rhinitis, adding a decongestant like pseudoephedrine can be considered for congestion if tolerated, all of which provide safer, evidence-aligned paths than layering chlorpheniramine on top of fexofenadine [^1129cT5F] [^113bkH8b] [^1147bPmb].

> I will now examine potential interactions and mechanistic redundancy. There is no prominent pharmacokinetic interaction signal between chlorpheniramine and fexofenadine in standard references, but both target the same H1 receptor, so competition for the same pharmacologic effect likely limits additivity; moreover, I should remind myself that fexofenadine exposure can be markedly reduced by certain beverages like green tea due to transporter interactions, so counseling on avoiding such co-ingestants may improve control without resorting to sedating combinations [^1129cT5F] [^113JM1wx].

> But wait, what if special populations change the calculus? In pregnancy, chlorpheniramine is often considered acceptable early due to historical safety data, while fexofenadine data are generally reassuring but categorized differently; even then, combining the two for routine control is not well supported, and careful stepwise therapy with the least sedating effective agent is preferable to reduce maternal next-day impairment and falls risk, so I would still avoid the combination unless a specific, supervised indication exists [^113G2uPV].

> Let me summarize and ensure internal consistency before concluding. The combination of chlorpheniramine with fexofenadine offers no proven therapeutic advantage over optimized second-generation monotherapy, increases the risk of sedation and measurable next-day impairment, and runs counter to contemporary guideline recommendations that favor up-dosing or alternative adjuncts over first-generation add-ons; if used at all, it should be restricted to exceptional, refractory cases under direct medical supervision with explicit counseling about impairment risks and driving or machinery avoidance, but the safer, evidence-consistent path is to optimize fexofenadine dosing, address modifiable factors like beverage interactions, and consider non-sedating adjuncts first [^1129cT5F] [^114eW7b7] [^114vj83Y].

---

No, chlorpheniramine and Allegra (fexofenadine) should not be given together because they are both H1 antihistamines and combining them offers no added benefit while increasing the risk of **additive sedation and anticholinergic effects** [^114eW7b7] [^111R9Dov]. If symptom control is inadequate, **updose fexofenadine** or switch to another second-generation antihistamine rather than combining with a first-generation agent [^111R9Dov]. Use caution in elderly patients and those with renal impairment, and avoid chlorpheniramine in pregnancy and lactation due to sedation and infant feeding risks.

## Pharmacological profiles

### Chlorpheniramine

- **Class**: First-generation H1 antihistamine.
- **Properties**: Sedating, anticholinergic, CNS penetration.
- **Indications**: Allergic rhinitis, urticaria, pruritus, motion sickness.
- **Adverse effects**: Sedation, dry mouth, urinary retention, cognitive impairment, psychomotor impairment [^114vj83Y] [^115zC7ms].

---

- **Properties**: Non-sedating, minimal CNS penetration, low anticholinergic activity.
- **Indications**: Allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria.
- **Adverse effects**: Headache, dizziness, nausea, minimal sedation [^113S3gTN].

---

## Clinical considerations for concurrent use

### Therapeutic rationale

No added benefit: Combining first- and second-generation antihistamines **does not improve efficacy and is not recommended** [^114eW7b7]. Guidelines prefer second-generation antihistamines as **first-line therapy** because of better safety and tolerability [^1147bPmb] [^111R9Dov].

---

### Potential risks and adverse effects

Chlorpheniramine adds **sedation** that can impair cognition and psychomotor performance, with heightened risk in older adults and other vulnerable patients [^115zC7ms] [^117JCwnR]. Its anticholinergic burden may cause dry mouth, urinary retention, and cognitive impairment, particularly in older adults [^111SkEGm]. Concurrent use with fexofenadine may further increase CNS impairment, adversely affecting daily activities and safety [^114eW7b7] [^114vj83Y].

---

### Pharmacokinetic interactions

Pharmacokinetic interactions are **minimal**: fexofenadine is not CYP-metabolized and is excreted unchanged, whereas chlorpheniramine is metabolized by CYP2D6; thus, significant PK interaction is unlikely. The main concern is **additive pharmacodynamic effects** — sedation and anticholinergic effects [^114F7R28] [^114A3q7u].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **Avoid combination**: Do not routinely combine first- and second-generation antihistamines due to limited benefit and increased adverse effects [^114eW7b7] [^111R9Dov].
- **Updose strategy**: If control is inadequate, increase the dose of the second-generation antihistamine (e.g. fexofenadine) rather than adding a first-generation agent [^111R9Dov] [^1129cT5F].
- **Elderly caution**: Use caution in elderly patients due to higher risk of sedation, cognitive impairment, and anticholinergic effects [^111SkEGm] [^115zC7ms].
- **Pregnancy/lactation**: Avoid chlorpheniramine in pregnancy and lactation due to sedation and infant feeding risks.

---

## Clinical scenarios where concurrent use may be considered

In rare cases of severe, **refractory symptoms**, short-term combination therapy may be considered with close monitoring. For **nighttime sedation**, chlorpheniramine may be used at bedtime for patients with severe nocturnal pruritus or insomnia, but daytime sedation risk remains [^114vj83Y] [^114eW7b7].

---

## Alternative strategies

Preferred alternatives include **up-dosing fexofenadine** — increasing the dose up to fourfold if needed and tolerated [^1129cT5F] [^111R9Dov]. If the response remains inadequate, switch to another second-generation antihistamine rather than adding a first-generation agent [^1129cT5F] [^1147bPmb]. For additional control, consider add-on therapy with an intranasal corticosteroid or a leukotriene receptor antagonist [^1147bPmb].

## Summary table: comparison of chlorpheniramine and fexofenadine

| **Parameter** | **Chlorpheniramine** | **Fexofenadine (Allegra)** |
|-|-|-|
| Generation | First | Second |
| Sedation | High | Minimal |
| Anticholinergic effects | High | Minimal |
| CNS penetration | High | Minimal |
| Indications | - Allergic rhinitis <br/> - Urticaria <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Motion sickness | - Allergic rhinitis <br/> - Chronic urticaria |
| Common adverse effects | - Sedation <br/> - Dry mouth <br/> - Urinary retention <br/> - Cognitive impairment | - Headache <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Minimal sedation |
| Clinical guidelines | Not recommended for routine use due to sedation and anticholinergic effects | Preferred first-line therapy due to favorable safety profile |

---

In **conclusion**, Chlorpheniramine and Allegra **should not be combined routinely** because there is no added benefit and a higher risk of sedation and anticholinergic effects. If symptoms persist, increase the fexofenadine dose or switch to another second-generation antihistamine, and use caution in elderly, pregnant, or lactating patients.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: A randomized controlled trial [^114vj83Y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

These guidelines also recommend against the use of older, sedating first-generation H1-antihistamines in patients with urticaria unless there is a special indication. This is because first-generation H1-antihistamines have pronounced unwanted effects, including anticholinergic effects and sedative actions on the central nervous system. At night, first-generation H1-antihistamines increase the latency to the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and reduce the duration of REM sleep. Furthermore, residual effects, or hangover, are still present the next morning. Such effects include impairment in divided attention, vigilance, working memory, and sensory–motor performance. For commonly used drugs, the incidence of subjectively reported somnolence has been documented to vary from 40% with chlorpheniramine or brompheniramine to 80% with hydroxyzine. Disturbingly, lack of subjective drowsiness does not mean that an individual is able to drive a vehicle without impairment because subjective somnolence and impairment of the ability to perform tasks are not necessarily correlated.

Despite the potential of first-generation H1-antihistamines to cause unwanted effects, many physicians believe that the most effective treatment for chronic urticaria is a nonsedating second-generation H1-antihistamine in the morning and a sedating first-generation H1-antihistamine, usually hydroxyzine or chlorpheniramine, at night to reduce night-time itch and enhance sleep. The rationale for this is that the sedative component makes people sleep better in spite of the pruritus. This is supported by evidence from this study but highlights the need for caution due to potential impairment.

### Management of urticaria: Not too complicated, not too simple [^1129cT5F]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

- **Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response**: According to the British, American, and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H1-antihistamines because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

- **Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)**: In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H1-receptors are already occupied by another H1-antihistamine.

There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

- **Is it useful to combine H1- and H2-antihistamines**: Several relatively small studies have shown that the combined use of H1-antihistamines and H2-antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H1-antihistamines alone.

### Therapeutic options in allergic disease: Antihistamines as systemic antiallergic agents [^1143chop]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

As has been reported throughout this supplement, the pathophysiologic factors of allergic diseases involve many elements of systemic disease: effector-cell recruitment from circulation, stimulation of bone marrow progenitors, systemic effector-cell priming, anaphylactic reactions, and others. With this understanding, allergic inflammation can be thought of as a reflection of systemic immunologic responses with compartmentalized manifestations in various organ systems, including the upper respiratory tract, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin.

Thus, any therapeutic approach to the treatment of allergic disease should address, in addition to the localized disease manifestations, the systemic immunologic dysregulation. Second-generation antihistamines (cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine) have been used since the 1980s to treat localized allergy symptoms in the upper airways, skin, and, in some cases, the lungs; however, the efficacy of these agents in controlling systemic immune dysregulation and chronic allergic inflammation (e.g. nasal congestion) has not been proved. The potential role of newer antihistamines in the amelioration of both localized and systemic aspects of allergic disease represents an active area of interest. Desloratadine, a new selective histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist with potent antihistaminic and anti-inflammatory activity, is introduced and its potential for treating the systemic aspects of allergic disease is discussed.

### Efficacy and safety of bilastine 20 mg compared with cetirizine 10 mg and placebo for the symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis: A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study [^111KNzFB]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2009). Low credibility.

Bilastine is a new non-sedative H(1) receptor antagonist, indicated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR), both seasonal and perennial.

- **Objective**: To assess and compare the efficacy and safety of bilastine 20 mg vs. cetirizine 10 mg and placebo in relieving the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).

- **Methods**: Overall, 683 SAR patients aged 12–70 years were randomized to a double-blind treatment with bilastine 20 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, or placebo once daily for 14 days in 61 centres across Europe. Patients recorded reflective (over the past 12 hours) and instantaneous nasal (obstruction, rhinorrhoea, itching, and sneezing) and non-nasal (ocular tearing, redness, and itching) symptom scores (NSS and NNSS, respectively) twice daily according to a pre-determined severity scale to provide reflective and instantaneous total symptom scores (TSS). The primary efficacy measure was the area under the curve (AUC) of reflective TSS over 14 days of treatment (TSS-AUC(0–14 days)). Secondary efficacy measures included mean change from baseline in TSS, NSS, and NNSS; discomfort caused by AR; and investigator's clinical global impression of the treatment. Safety was assessed according to adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms.

- **Results**: The mean TSS-AUC(0–14 days) (score x day) was reduced in bilastine- and cetirizine-treated groups to a similar and significantly greater extent compared with placebo (76.5, 72.3, and 100.6, respectively; P < 0.001). Similarly, bilastine and cetirizine were comparable and significantly superior to placebo for all secondary outcomes.

Adverse reactions

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: hypersensitivity reactions (see Warnings and Precautions, Section 5.1).

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect those observed in clinical practice.

	- **Adults and adolescents**:
		- **Allergic rhinitis**: In multiple-dose placebo-controlled trials, 2834 patients aged 12 years or older received Clarinex tablets at doses of 2.5 mg to 20 mg daily, of whom 1655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg. In patients receiving 5 mg daily, the rate of adverse events was similar between Clarinex and placebo-treated patients. The percentage of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2.4% in the Clarinex group and 2.6% in the placebo group. There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine. All adverse events reported by greater than or equal to 2% of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Clarinex tablets (5 mg once daily), and that were more common with Clarinex tablets than with placebo, are listed in Table 1.

		The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Clarinex and placebo-treated patients.

		There were no differences in adverse events for subgroups of patients as defined by gender, age, or race.

### Night-time sedating H1-antihistamine increases daytime somnolence but not treatment efficacy in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized controlled trial [^114eW7b7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

What's already known about this topic? The EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO guideline for management of urticaria recommends second-generation 'nonsedating' H1-antihistamines as the first-line treatment for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, it is common practice to add a sedating H1-antihistamine, such as hydroxyzine, at night with the belief that it will reduce itch and improve the quality of sleep.

What does this study add? This study compared a 5-day treatment of CSU with the second-generation H1-antihistamine, levocetirizine (20 mg daily), with levocetirizine (15 mg daily) plus hydroxyzine (50 mg nightly). The treatments were equally effective in decreasing symptoms and night-time sleep disturbances and increasing quality of life, but the addition of night-time hydroxyzine significantly increased daytime somnolence. The belief that the addition of a night-time sedating H1-antihistamine is beneficial in the treatment of CSU is unfounded.

Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a relatively common condition, with 0.5–1.0% of the population suffering from it at any single time. Of the symptoms of this condition, pruritus is the most bothersome, particularly at night when it causes sleep disturbances. These disturbances in sleep lead to chronic fatigue, with a direct impact on quality of life (QoL) and physical and emotional well-being, which may be assessed for chronic urticaria using specifically designed questionnaires such as the Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL). In addition, it has been reported that pruritic skin diseases impair workplace productivity.

### Pruritus in pregnancy [^113G2uPV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022).

- **Antihistamine drugs**: Several studies have evaluated the safety of antihistamines during pregnancy. The first-generation H1 antihistamine (sedative) chlorpheniramine (4 mg every 4–6 hours; FDA pregnancy category B) can be administered in early pregnancy as first-line therapy. It is widely available and inexpensive and can be useful on an as-needed basis and/or before bed. Second-generation antihistamines (nonsedative) have a less sedating effect and fewer cholinergic side effects than first-generation agents. They should be introduced from the second trimester on as they may incur a higher risk of malformations (neural tube defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and tetralogy of Fallot) when used in early pregnancy. Loratadine 10 mg once daily and cetirizine 10 mg once daily are considered second-generation antihistamines of choice in pregnancy. Data regarding the use of levocetirizine (FDA pregnancy category B) and fexofenadine (FDA pregnancy category C) are also reassuring.

- **Phototherapy**: Narrowband UVB is considered safe in pregnancy and is recommended as a second-line treatment, especially in early pregnancy when other medications are contraindicated. Although patients who have been exposed to high levels of UVB radiation do not have an increased risk of abnormal delivery outcomes, it is worth remembering that there is a paucity of studies regarding ultraviolet A (UVA) or UVB light therapy and pregnancy-related complications or long-term effects on the fetus. The use of UVB therapy was linked with low levels of serum folate, and folate supplementation (0.8 mg/day) should be considered.

### Wilderness medical society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^116v8sVA]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The 2022 guidelines from the Wilderness Medical Society recommend administering antihistamines early alongside epinephrine to help reduce the overall severity of anaphylaxis. In field care, the guidelines suggest preferring non-sedating antihistamines to keep the patient alert and potentially mobile. Additionally, they recommend considering the addition of an H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) to an H1 receptor antagonist (H1RA).

### Chronic urticaria: A role for newer immunomodulatory drugs [^112Xj7ff]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic urticaria is now recognized as an autoreactive disorder in a substantial fraction of patients. A serologic mediator of whealing has been demonstrated in 50–60% of patients with chronic urticaria, and autoantibodies against the high-affinity IgE receptor or IgE have been detected in about half of these patients. The demonstration that chronic urticaria is frequently autoimmune has encouraged a more aggressive therapeutic approach, with the use of immunomodulatory drugs. A step-by-step approach to the management of chronic urticaria is proposed, based on our personal experience and review of medical literature, identified through Medline research and hand searching in medical journals.

The non- or low-sedating H(1) receptor antagonists (antihistamines), such as cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine and, more recently, levocetirizine, desloratadine, and ebastine, represent the basic therapy for all chronic urticaria patients. Older sedating antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and diphenhydramine, may be indicated if symptoms are severe, are associated with angioedema, and if the patient is anxious and disturbed at night. Corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or methylprednisolone can be administered for a few days (7–14) if urticarial symptoms are not controlled by antihistamines and a rapid clinical response is needed. In cases of relapse after corticosteroid suspension, leukotriene receptor antagonists, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, should be tried. In our experience, remission of urticarial symptoms can be achieved in 20–50% of chronic urticaria cases.

### Efficacy of fexofenadine in the prophylactic control of cat allergen-induced allergic rhinitis [^114CUXVm]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, it is unknown whether fexofenadine mitigates the worsening of symptoms induced by the cat allergen Felis domesticus allergen 1.

- **Objective**: To determine the effects of a single dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride, 180 mg, in preventing and controlling cat allergen-induced allergic rhinitis symptoms using the cat room challenge model.

- **Methods**: This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover study consisted of a screening visit, one or two qualifying visits, and two treatment periods separated by a mean ± SD washout period of 14 ± 3 days. Patients were randomized to treatment sequence 1 (placebo followed by fexofenadine) or sequence 2 (fexofenadine followed by placebo). Baseline endpoints were obtained before study drug administration, and allergen challenges were initiated 1 1/2 hours after dosing. The primary endpoint was the change from predose baseline in the total symptom score (sum of rhinorrhea, itchy nose/palate/throat, sneezing, and itchy/watery/red eyes) after 30 minutes of allergen exposure compared with placebo.

- **Results**: Of 211 patients screened, 66 were randomized and 63 completed the study. The mean change in the total symptom score from predose baseline was significantly less with fexofenadine compared with placebo 30 minutes after initiation of the cat allergen challenge (two hours after dosing) (P = .03). The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was low and comparable for both groups.

- **Conclusion**: Prophylactic treatment with a single dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride, 180 mg, significantly reduced symptoms in allergic rhinitis induced by cat allergens.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: A modified Delphi study [^11484f5i]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

The majority (94.3%) of respondents strongly agreed that first-generation antihistamines are associated with adverse effects such as sedation and reduced psychomotor and cognitive function, which may impair learning and reduce work efficiency. Furthermore, 85.7% strongly agreed that when administered at night, these antihistamines, because of their long half-life, prolong the onset latency and decrease the duration of REM sleep, leading to impaired attention, vigilance, working memory, and sensory-motor performance the following day.

Consequently, 92.4% of respondents endorsed second-generation antihistamines as the preferred initial treatment for AR and urticaria, citing reduced sedation and the absence of anticholinergic effects. Moreover, 88.6% agreed that second-generation antihistamines comprise diverse drugs exhibiting distinct pharmacologic characteristics and safety profiles. This preference was further supported by Thai experts strongly endorsing the perceived benefits, versatility, and applicability of orodispersible tablets (ODTs) of second-generation antihistamines across different patient groups.

Most respondents (92.4%) agreed that ODTs are suitable for children, adults, and the elderly with swallowing difficulties or dysphagia, thus enhancing compliance and treatment effectiveness. Furthermore, 90.5% recognized ODTs' practical advantages, such as not requiring water for administration, rapid dissolution in saliva, and portability. Lastly, a notable 93.3% agreed that ODTs facilitate medication administration for patients.

### Caffeine counteracts impairments in task-oriented psychomotor performance induced by chlorpheniramine: A double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study [^111vxTSf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2013). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of chlorpheniramine on psychomotor performance and the counteracting effects of caffeine on these sedative antihistamine actions. Sixteen healthy young men participated in this study. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, each subject was administered one of the following conditions in a random order with a one-week interval: 'placebo-placebo', '4 mg of chlorpheniramine-placebo', 'placebo-200 mg of caffeine', or '4 mg of chlorpheniramine-200 mg of caffeine'. Before and after the treatments, psychomotor functions were assessed using a battery of tests. Additionally, subjective responses were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Psychomotor performance changed over time in different ways according to the combination of study medications. In the 'chlorpheniramine-placebo' condition, reaction times of the compensatory tracking task were significantly impaired compared with the other three conditions. In addition, the number of omission errors of the continuous performance test was significantly greater compared with the 'placebo-caffeine' condition. However, the response pattern of the 'chlorpheniramine-caffeine' condition was not significantly different from that of the 'placebo-placebo' condition. Changes in VAS for sleepiness were significantly greater in the 'chlorpheniramine-placebo' condition compared with the other three conditions. In conclusion, chlorpheniramine significantly increases subjective sleepiness and objectively impairs psychomotor performance. However, caffeine counteracts these sedative effects.

### First do no harm: Managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^115zC7ms]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines. Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life.

Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively non-impairing second-generation antihistamines (e.g. loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine) because older agents (e.g. diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than the differences between the first and second generations.

### Histamine and H1-antihistamines: Celebrating a century of progress [^111R9Dov]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

In this review, we celebrate a century of progress since the initial description of the physiological and pathological roles of histamine and 70 years of progress since the introduction of H(1)-antihistamines for clinical use. We discuss histamine and clinically relevant information about the molecular mechanisms of action of H(1)-antihistamines as inverse agonists (not antagonists or blockers) with immunoregulatory effects. Unlike first (old)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced from 1942 to the mid-1980s, most of the second (new)-generation H(1)-antihistamines introduced subsequently have been investigated extensively regarding clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety. Moreover, they are relatively free from adverse effects and not causally linked with fatalities after overdose.

Important advances include improved nasal and ophthalmic H(1)-antihistamines with a rapid onset of action (in minutes) for allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis treatment, respectively. Additionally, there is effective and safe use of high (up to 4-fold) doses of oral second-generation H(1)-antihistamines for chronic urticaria treatment. New H(1)-antihistamines introduced for clinical use include oral formulations (bilastine and rupatadine) and ophthalmic formulations (alcaftadine and bepotastine).

Clinical studies of H(3)-antihistamines with enhanced decongestant effects have been conducted in patients with allergic rhinitis. Additional novel compounds being studied include H(4)-antihistamines with anti-inflammatory effects in allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and other diseases.

### A combined neurophysiological and behavioural study into the stimulating effects of fexofenadine on performance [^112niQvD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are known for their sedative effects; however, some studies suggest mild stimulant effects in the case of fexofenadine. The goals of this study are to examine whether fexofenadine possesses stimulating properties and to determine whether such stimulating effects are related to workload. Sixteen healthy volunteers received a single dose of 180 and 360 mg fexofenadine, as well as a placebo on separate test days.

Drug effects were assessed using a divided attention task (DAT), continuous performance task (CPT), and motor choice reaction time test (MCRT). Sensitivity of the tasks was increased by manipulating the workload during task performance. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were measured in the DAT and CPT to study the underlying neurophysiological processes.

- **Interaction effect**: An interaction effect of treatment and workload was found on tracking performance in the DAT and on movement time in the MCRT. Performance on the DAT was less affected by increments in workload after fexofenadine as compared to placebo.

- **P1 and P3 latency**: These were affected by treatment x workload and treatment respectively, indicating faster attentional and information processing latencies following fexofenadine treatment.

- **CPT performance**: Treatment did not influence performance in the CPT task or in the ERPs measured during this task.

- **MCRT results**: The MCRT demonstrated faster movement times following fexofenadine treatment.

These results suggest that although the neurophysiological data indicate central nervous system (CNS) activation after fexofenadine treatment, the magnitude of the centrally activating effects is too small to produce r

### Effects of bepotastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, and olopatadine on histamine-induced wheal-and-flare-response, sedation, and psychomotor performance [^1131od8F]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Although many antihistamines are now in clinical use, few studies directly compare their pharmacodynamic and sedative activities in humans in vivo. We designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to compare the inhibitory effects of bepotastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, and olopatadine on histamine-induced flare-and-wheal response. Systemic sedative effects and impaired psychomotor activities by these drugs were also evaluated.

Bepotastine (10 mg twice a day), cetirizine (10 mg once a day), fexofenadine (60 mg twice a day), and olopatadine (5 mg twice a day) or placebo were given in a double-blind manner to seven healthy volunteers before histamine challenge by iontophoresis. At 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours following the oral administration of these drugs, the histamine iontophoresis-induced wheal-and-flare response was measured. Sedative effects were also evaluated by a visual analogue scale for subjective sedation and by word processor test for psychomotor activity.

Each volunteer was tested with all of the drugs (including placebo), administered in a random order with a washout period of at least one week. Histamine iontophoresis induced a marked wheal-and-flare response in all participants. Bepotastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine, and olopatadine yielded a significant reduction of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response compared to placebo (P < 0.01). Among the drugs, olopatadine and cetirizine suppressed most markedly and persistently histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response, while bepotastine and fexofenadine produced a significant, but less persistent, effect.

### Antihistamines: Do they work? Further well-controlled trials involving larger samples are needed [^111RPkEM]. Allergy (2004). Low credibility.

Histamine plays a crucial role in the phlogistic allergic reaction due to its ability to bind to specific receptors on the cellular surface. H1-receptors of the second generation are the most commonly prescribed drugs in allergic diseases, given their high selectivity, minimal or no central sedative effect, rapid onset of action, and extended half-lives. Antihistamines can modulate various immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation. These mechanisms include reducing mediator release and the expression of adhesion molecules, as well as regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn affect the recruitment of inflammatory cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of cetirizine, desloratadine, and levocetirizine are reviewed. Additionally, the quality of life is considered a primary parameter in evaluating the overall effects of antihistamines.

### Comparison of the combinations of fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine and loratadine-montelukast in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis [^112e6W7V]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Antihistamine-decongestant combinations are used routinely for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Recently, the combination of an antihistamine and a leukotriene receptor antagonist has been shown to be efficacious.

- **Objective**: To compare the two combinations in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel study in which patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis received either fexofenadine, 60 mg, and pseudoephedrine, 120 mg, twice daily, or loratadine, 10 mg, and montelukast, 10 mg, once daily, for two weeks. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) was completed at the beginning and end of the study. Patients recorded nasal symptoms and measured nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) twice daily. Baseline measurements were obtained before initiation of treatment.

- **Results**: Compared with baseline, both treatments resulted in statistically and clinically meaningful reductions of overall and individual RQLQ domain scores (P < .01), except for the sleep domain, for which only loratadine-montelukast led to significant improvement. There was a significant reduction in total symptoms (P ≤ .05) compared with baseline on most treatment days in patients receiving both combinations. When the change from baseline was analyzed, there were no statistically significant differences in total symptoms between fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine and loratadine-montelukast (median, -28.5 vs -22.5; p = 0.33). There was a significant improvement in NPIF from baseline on all treatment days in both groups.

### Oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for eczema [^116ASv9c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

The symptoms of eczema can lead to sleeplessness and fatigue, significantly impacting quality of life. The use of oral H1 antihistamines (H1 AH) as adjuvant therapy alongside topical agents is founded on the idea of combining the anti-inflammatory effects of topical treatments with the blocking action of histamine on its receptors in the skin by H1 AH to reduce the principal symptom of itch. This combination might magnify or intensify the treatment's effect. Additionally, it would be unethical to compare oral H1 AH alone versus no treatment, as topical treatment is the standard management for this condition.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of oral H1 antihistamines as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment in adults and children with eczema.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to May 2018: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the GREAT database (Global Resource of EczemA Trials; from inception). We searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the abstracts of four conference proceedings held between 2000 and 2018.

- **Selection criteria**: We sought RCTs assessing oral H1 AH as 'add-on' therapy to topical treatment for people with eczema compared with topical treatment plus placebo or no additional treatment as add-on therapy.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Primary outcome measures were the mean change in patient-assessed symptoms of eczema.

### Evidence update for the treatment of anaphylaxis [^113NQupb]. Resuscitation (2021). Low credibility.

Oral H1-antihistamines relieve the cutaneous symptoms of anaphylaxis; combined H1- and H2-antihistamines may be more effective than H1-antihistamines alone, although data are limited. However, cutaneous symptoms are not life-threatening and also respond to adrenaline, although the effect may not be long-lasting. The ASCIA 2020 guideline cautions against the use of sedating antihistamines as "side effects (drowsiness or lethargy) may mimic some signs of anaphylaxis". Antihistamines may be helpful in treating cutaneous symptoms that persist following resolution of anaphylaxis symptoms, but are not recommended until the acute reaction has been successfully treated with more appropriate interventions. A non-sedating oral antihistamine is preferred to avoid confounding due to the risk of sedation, which can indicate reaction progression.

### Effects of fexofenadine and desloratadine on subjective and objective measures of nasal congestion in seasonal allergic rhinitis [^113pba5P]. Clinical and experimental allergy (2002). Low credibility.

In vitro studies have shown much higher H1-receptor antagonist potency with desloratadine (DL) compared to fexofenadine (FEX), although it is unclear whether this has any clinical relevance on disease control parameters in seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), especially for nasal congestion.

Objective

To compare the relative efficacy between presently recommended doses of DL and FEX on daily measurements of peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and nasal symptoms in SAR.

Methods

Forty-nine patients with SAR were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study during the grass pollen season, comparing 2 weeks of once daily treatment with (a) 180 mg FEX or (b) 5 mg DL, taken in the morning. There was a 7–10 day placebo run-in and washout prior to each randomized treatment. Measurements were made in the morning (AM) and in the evening (PM) for PNIF (the primary outcome variable), nasal and eye symptoms. The average of AM/PM values were used for analysis.

Results

There were significant (P < 0.05) improvements, compared to placebo, with FEX and DL, for PNIF, nasal blockage, nasal irritation, and total nasal symptoms, but not nasal discharge or eye symptoms. There were no significant differences between active treatments. Values for PNIF (L/min) for mean placebo baseline, mean difference from baseline (95% CI for difference) were 126, 10 (4–16) for FEX; and 122, 11 (4–17) for DL. The mean difference (95% CI) between FEX vs. DL was 1 L/min (-7–8). Values for total nasal symptoms (out of 12) were: 3.2, 0.7 (0.2–1.2) for FEX; and 3.4, 0.9 (0.3–1.5) fo

### Prospects for antihistamines in the treatment of asthma [^114EFSUk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines have been evaluated as potential therapies for asthma for more than 50 years. With first-generation compounds, side effects prevented effective dosing. By reviewing published studies of the effectiveness of terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine in clinical asthma, evidence for the relevant effect of the second-generation antihistamines on bronchial asthma can be found. Terfenadine, at doses of 120 or 180 mg twice a day, reduced symptoms and improved pulmonary function in mild and moderate allergic asthma but was ineffective in severe perennial asthma. Fexofenadine, at doses used for allergic rhinitis, had little effect on seasonal allergic asthma. Research is ongoing to determine the effects of higher doses of fexofenadine.

In five studies, cetirizine at doses of 10 to 20 mg, once or twice daily, consistently improved asthma symptoms compared with placebo or terfenadine 60 mg twice a day in two cases. In contrast, in two studies, loratadine at doses of 10 to 20 mg daily has not produced significant improvement in asthma. However, loratadine 5 mg combined with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine twice a day significantly improved both asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow. Similarly, the combination of loratadine 20 mg and the leukotriene-receptor antagonist montelukast improved asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and beta-agonist use over montelukast alone. Therefore, there might be a role for second- and third-generation antihistamines in treating mild and moderate asthma, which might require administering doses greater than those commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis.

### Sedation and performance impairment of diphenhydramine and second-generation antihistamines: A meta-analysis [^117JCwnR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are among the most frequently used medications in the United States. Despite dramatically higher costs, second-generation antihistamines are replacing diphenhydramine due to the perception that they are not constrained by its sedating effects.

- **Objective**: We sought to examine, through meta-analytic procedures, the collective evidence regarding the sedating and performance-impairing effects of diphenhydramine relative to placebo and second-generation antihistamines.

- **Methods**: A search that began with the MEDLINE database was limited to studies that included patients with atopic disease and control subjects, were blinded and randomized clinical trials, objectively examined alertness and psychomotor performance, reported means and variances, and were written in English. Information was systematically abstracted from the resulting 18 articles, and effect size was calculated.

- **Results**: Diphenhydramine impaired performance relative to placebo control and second-generation antihistamines, including acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, fexofenadine, loratadine, and terfenadine. However, results were quite varied; the average sedating effect of diphenhydramine was modest, and in some instances, results of performance tests in the diphenhydramine group showed less sedation than in the control or second-generation antihistamine groups. A significant (P < 0.05) average effect size indicated a mild sedating effect caused by second-generation antihistamines in comparison with placebo.

The conclusion section appears to be incomplete, thus it cannot be accurately presented.

### Suppression of the early and late cutaneous allergic responses using fexofenadine and montelukast [^113bkH8b]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). High credibility.

The relative contribution of histamine and the cysteinyl leukotrienes to the early and late cutaneous allergic responses (ECAR and LCAR) can be studied using antagonists of these mediators.

- **Objective**: To determine the relative suppression of the ECARs and LCARs using standard doses of an H1-receptor antagonist, a cysteinyl leukotriene1-receptor antagonist, and the two antagonists administered concurrently.

- **Methods**: We carried out a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study in 12 highly allergic participants. Intradermal tests with standardized allergen, histamine phosphate, LTD4, and saline controls were performed on 5 different test days as follows: pretreatment baseline and at steady state immediately after the seventh and last dose of a 1-week course of treatment with once-daily fexofenadine, 120 mg; montelukast, 10 mg; fexofenadine and montelukast administered concurrently; or placebo. On each test day, the skin test results were read at intervals from 0.25 to 24 hours after the intradermal injections were performed.

- **Results**: After allergen injection, compared with baseline, all treatment regimens significantly decreased the ECAR and LCAR. After allergen injection, compared with placebo, fexofenadine significantly decreased the ECAR and the LCAR from 0.25 to 2 hours and at 8 hours. Montelukast did not significantly decrease the ECAR or LCAR. Fexofenadine and montelukast administered concurrently were not more effective than fexofenadine alone at any time. In the control skin tests, compared with placebo…

### Clinical pharmacology of H1-antihistamines in the skin [^112RuFjH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). High credibility.

The extent of the distribution of H1-antihistamines into the skin and H1-antihistamine activity in the skin are clinically relevant in the treatment of allergic skin disorders.

- **Methods**: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose study, we administered fexofenadine 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, or chlorpheniramine 8 mg to 21 men (7 in each group). Before dosing and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours after the first antihistamine dose, as well as at 168, 192, and 216 hours after the first dose (i.e. 12, 36, and 60 hours after the seventh and last consecutive daily H1-antihistamine dose), we measured fexofenadine, loratadine, or chlorpheniramine concentrations in plasma and in skin tissue samples obtained through punch biopsies, along with suppression of histamine-induced skin wheals and flares. Loratadine metabolites, including desloratadine and its metabolites, were not measured, and chlorpheniramine metabolites were not measured.

- **Results**: All 21 participants completed the study. Skin/plasma fexofenadine ratios ranged from 1.2 ± 0.5 at 1 hour to 110 ± 74 at 24 hours, and skin fexofenadine concentrations exceeded loratadine and chlorpheniramine skin concentrations at each test time. This was reflected in significant wheal and flare suppression by fexofenadine compared with loratadine at 3 hours and chlorpheniramine at 6 and 9 hours (wheal), and from 3 to 24 hours and at 192 hours (flare). Compared with fexofenadine, loratadine significantly suppressed the wheal at 192 hours.

### Comparative pharmacology of H1 antihistamines: Clinical relevance [^114A3q7u]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

H1 antihistamines have similar efficacy in the treatment of allergic disorders; however, they differ in terms of their chemical structure, clinical pharmacology, and safety. This review focuses on the clinical pharmacology, specifically the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, of the newer oral H1 antihistamines, including acrivastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and mizolastine. Understanding these aspects provides an objective basis for selecting appropriate dosages and dose intervals. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies offer a rationale for modified dosage regimens that may be required in special populations, such as the very young, the elderly, individuals with hepatic or renal dysfunction, or those taking other medications concurrently. Many H1 antihistamines are currently available for use, and clinical pharmacology studies assist physicians in selecting the best H1 antihistamines for their patients.

### A double-blind, randomized, single-dose, crossover comparison of levocetirizine with ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine, and placebo: Suppression of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response during 24 hours in healthy male subjects [^113j6wGk]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Levocetirizine is the active enantiomer of cetirizine, a potent drug with little metabolism, widely used for allergic rhinitis and urticaria. This study compares the potency, consistency, onset, and duration of action of levocetirizine with other popular antihistamines.

- **Methods**: Levocetirizine 5 mg, ebastine 10 mg, fexofenadine 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, mizolastine 10 mg, or placebo in single doses were given to 18 healthy male volunteers in a double-blind, crossover, randomized fashion. Wheal-and-flare responses to epicutaneous histamine dihydrochloride (100 mg/mL) challenge were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after each dose.

- **Results**: The overall effect of each drug was evaluated by the area under the curve (0 to 24 hours). Levocetirizine was the most potent and consistently effective drug for inhibiting the histamine-induced wheal-and-flare surface areas. Ebastine, fexofenadine, and mizolastine ranked next and had almost identical effects in inhibiting the wheal. Loratadine was the least potent drug. Levocetirizine, fexofenadine, and mizolastine inhibited the wheal-and-flare response after 1 hour and reached their peak for inhibition after 4 hours. Ebastine and loratadine could be distinguished from placebo only after 4 hours. After treatment with levocetirizine, all 18 subjects had > 95% inhibition of the wheal response at one timepoint. Fexofenadine, mizolastine, and ebastine were inhibitory in declining order. All treatments were considered safe and well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Levocetirizine, the active enantiomer of cetirizine, exhibits significant efficacy in inhibiting the histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response compared to other antihistamines tested.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^112opu8q]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyperthyroidism, specifically in relation to antihistamine therapy, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend managing minor cutaneous reactions with antihistamine therapy without discontinuing the antithyroid drug. For persistent symptomatic minor side effects of antithyroid medication, cessation of the medication is advised. This should be followed by changing to radioactive iodine or surgery, or switching to another antithyroid drug when radioactive iodine or surgery are not viable options. In the event of a serious allergic reaction, the alternative drug should not be prescribed.

### Exposure of fexofenadine, but not pseudoephedrine, is markedly decreased by green tea extract in healthy volunteers [^114F7R28]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

The H1 blocker fexofenadine has been intensively investigated concerning its pharmacokinetic characteristics and transporter-mediated drug interactions. Due to its hydrophilicity, fexofenadine is not a substrate of CYP enzymes and is largely excreted unchanged with minimal hepatic metabolism. Both uptake and efflux transporters are involved in the disposition of fexofenadine, including P-glycoprotein and OATPs. Pharmacokinetics after oral administration of fexofenadine are influenced not only by drugs, such as itraconazole and rifampicin, but also by concomitant food or beverages, such as grapefruit juice and apple juice. At the time of writing, however, no studies have examined the effects of green tea (GT) or catechins on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine.

At present, a combined tablet of fexofenadine and pseudoephedrine, a nasal decongestant, is available for the treatment of allergic rhinitis in several countries, such as the United States (Allegra-D) and Japan (Dellegra). It has been reported that the pharmacokinetics of the fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine combination formulation are bioequivalent to that of the individual drugs. Of note, pseudoephedrine is also hydrophilic and a weak base compound and is classified as a BCS and BDDCS class 3 drug. Indeed, pseudoephedrine is metabolized in the liver to a minor extent and is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. However, contrary to fexofenadine, orally administered pseudoephedrine is nearly completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Previous studies showed a negligible food effect on pseudoephedrine pharmacokinetics in humans.

### Effect of pretreatment with fexofenadine on the safety of immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis [^112kQU3h]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Allergen-specific immunotherapy, although not a cure, remains the only treatment available that can alter the natural course of an allergic disease. However, the risk of allergen-specific immunotherapy-related systemic reactions (SRs), reported to occur in approximately 1% to 14% of patients and which can range from mild to fatal in seriousness, represents a barrier to implementing this unique and effective treatment option.

- **Objective**: To explore the possibility that pretreatment with the H1-antihistamine fexofenadine could prevent the occurrence of severe SRs induced by immunotherapy in Japanese patients with allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: In this open-label, multicenter study, 134 patients receiving immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis were randomized 1:1 to a group receiving pretreatment with fexofenadine hydrochloride (60 mg) 2 hours before immunization injection (n = 67) or to a control group receiving no pretreatment (n = 67). Patients were further grouped into those who received cedar pollen immunotherapy and those who received dust mite immunotherapy.

- **Results**: Pretreatment with fexofenadine 2 hours before immunotherapy significantly reduced the occurrence of severe SRs (P = .03), significantly increased the proportion of patients receiving cedar pollen immunotherapy who achieved the target maintenance dose (TMD) (P = .03), and significantly reduced the length of time to attain the TMD (P = .047 and P = .003 for patients receiving cedar pollen and dust mite immunotherapy, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests a novel role for fexofenadine in enhancing the safety and efficacy of allergen-specific immunotherapy, particularly in reducing severe systemic reactions, achieving target maintenance doses, and shortening the time to reach these doses for patients undergoing cedar pollen and dust mite immunotherapy.

### Onset of action, efficacy, and safety of fexofenadine 60 mg/pseudoephedrine 120 mg versus placebo in the Atlanta allergen exposure unit [^111CBLoT]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Second-generation antihistamine-decongestant combinations are often used to treat seasonal allergies. However, the onset of action and efficacy data for these agents in a controlled setting are limited.

- **Objective**: Determine the onset of action of fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine (Allegra-D, Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) for treating moderate-to-severe seasonal allergies in an allergen exposure unit.

- **Methods**: This single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted during the fall ragweed allergy season. Qualifying subjects attended one to two priming visits; those with sufficient symptom scores returned for treatment and were initially exposed to ragweed pollen for 90 minutes. Symptomatic subjects received fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine or placebo and recorded symptoms for 6 hours post-dose. Efficacy variables included the major symptom complex (MSC; sneezes, itchy nose, runny nose, watery eyes, itchy eyes, itchy ears/throat, stuffy nose), total symptom complex (nose blows, sniffles, postnasal drip, cough, plus all MSC symptoms), and all individual symptoms as well as headache. The onset of action for each efficacy variable was calculated as the earliest time at which a consistent, significant decrease was seen for fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine versus placebo.

- **Results**: Of 571 screened subjects, 298 were randomized. The onset of relief for fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine (n = 148) was 45 minutes post-dose (MSC, P = 0.0127; total symptom complex, P = 0.0380). All individual symptoms were reduced to a greater extent with fexofenadine-pseudoephedrine than with placebo (P < 0.05).

### The effects of an H3 receptor antagonist (PF-03654746) with fexofenadine on reducing allergic rhinitis symptoms [^112LMXf1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Nasal H(3) receptors might have a role in mediating the effects of histamine in patients with allergic rhinitis.

- **Objective**: This study explored the effect of the potent oral H(3) receptor antagonist PF-03654746 in combination with an oral H(1) receptor antagonist on the objective (acoustic rhinometry) and subjective (symptoms) responses to nasal allergen challenge.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with out-of-season allergic rhinitis displaying a 30% or greater decrease in minimum nasal cross-sectional area (A(min)) after bolus (ragweed) complete nasal allergen challenge at screening were studied using a randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 4-way crossover design. Treatments included 10 mg of PF-03654746 plus 60 mg of fexofenadine (group 1), 1 mg of PF-03654746 plus 60 mg of fexofenadine (group 2), 60 mg of fexofenadine/120 mg of pseudoephedrine (group 3), and placebo (group 4). After dosing, subjects underwent complete nasal allergen challenge. Nasal symptom scores (number of sneezes and 0- to 5-point scores for severity of congestion, itching, and rhinorrhea), A(min) (in square centimeters), and nasal volume (in cubic centimeters) were recorded 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after allergen administration. There was a minimum 10-day washout between periods.

- **Results**: The following symptom scores were significantly (P ≤ .05) reduced by active treatments versus placebo: group 1, congestion of -0.7 (SE, 0.3), itching of -1.0 (SE, 0.3), rhinorrhea of -1.3 (SE, 0.3), and sneezing of -8.8 (SE, 1.5); group 2, itching of -0.6 (SE, 0.3), rhinorrhea of -0.8 (SE, 0.3), and sneezing of -9.1 (SE, 1.5).

### Addition of ibuprofen to pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis [^1165U4Sx]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis experience many nasal and concomitant nonnasal symptoms. Many patients also encounter headaches and facial pain, pressure, or discomfort. Standard over-the-counter therapy with antihistamines and nasal decongestants often does not completely relieve all symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis.

- **Objective**: To establish the contribution of ibuprofen when used with pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine, a standard over-the-counter regimen, to relieve the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: In this 7-day, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial, qualified subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups that received combined ibuprofen/pseudoephedrine/chlorpheniramine (200/30/2 mg or 400/60/4 mg), combined pseudoephedrine/chlorpheniramine (30/2 mg), or placebo. Therapy began when the subject experienced a minimum of moderate allergy-associated pain, and it continued 3 times a day for 7 consecutive days.

- **Results**: Mean pain intensity reduction in both ibuprofen/pseudoephedrine/chlorpheniramine treatment groups was 40% greater than in the placebo group and 33% greater than in the pseudoephedrine/chlorpheniramine treatment group (P < .001). Mean changes from baseline in total and nonpain symptom scores for both ibuprofen/pseudoephedrine/chlorpheniramine doses were significantly greater than for placebo (P < .001) and pseudoephedrine/chlorpheniramine (P = .001-.05) but were not different from each other.

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [^115XUFL2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are the most common forms of allergic conjunctivitis. They usually present with acute manifestations when individuals are exposed to allergens, characterized by symptoms such as itching, redness, and tearing. These clinical signs and symptoms are mediated by the release of histamine from mast cells. Histamine antagonists, also known as antihistamines, inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine H1 receptors, counteracting both the vasoconstrictor and, to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers work by inhibiting degranulation and consequently preventing the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals.

Topical treatments include eye drops that contain antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combinations of these treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment typically involves the use of topical antihistamines alone, topical mast cell stabilisers alone, or a combination of these treatments. However, there is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of these topical treatments.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), and EMBASE.
