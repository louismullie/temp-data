## Question

Thiamine for hereditary angioedema acute attacks

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thiamine (vitamin B1) is indicated for treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the evidence-based standard of care for acute HAE attacks. Then, I should verify whether any guideline or trial supports thiamine for on-demand treatment. Next, I need to check the mechanistic plausibility of thiamine in the bradykinin-driven HAE pathway. After that, I should review any safety signals linking thiamine to angioedema. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and ensure it aligns with major guidelines and regulatory data.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for acute HAE attacks: on-demand, HAE-specific therapies include intravenous plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), subcutaneous icatibant (a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist), and subcutaneous ecallantide (a plasma kallikrein inhibitor), with the overarching principle to treat as early as possible; more recently, an oral on-demand kallikrein inhibitor (sebetralstat) has labeled dosing for acute HAE, but thiamine is not part of any acute algorithm or approval, and airway evaluation is prioritized in upper airway involvement [^114cyf2r] [^112D3rp3] [^111VixqE] [^111wyud5] [^116VGmZX] [^113ZQZXx].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology to assess plausibility: HAE swelling is mediated by excess bradykinin generated from unregulated plasma kallikrein activity due to C1-INH deficiency or dysfunction, so effective acute agents either replace C1-INH or block bradykinin or kallikrein; thiamine's known biology as a cofactor in carbohydrate metabolism does not intersect with the contact system, kallikrein, or bradykinin signaling, making a mechanistic role for B1 in aborting HAE attacks implausible [^112x8tmA] [^113QvGRj].

> Next, I should review whether any guideline or clinical study endorses thiamine for acute HAE; hold on, I should double-check across WAO/EAACI and US HAEA guidance and trial literature: there are no recommendations, trials, or case series supporting thiamine for HAE attacks, and guidelines explicitly focus on HAE-specific on-demand agents while advising against non–bradykinin-directed acute therapies such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines, with thiamine nowhere mentioned as a treatment option [^114cyf2r] [^111rp1m4].

> But wait, what if thiamine has ancillary benefits or is at least harmless during an attack; hmm, wait a minute, I need to check safety data: the thiamine hydrochloride label lists angioneurotic edema as a reported adverse reaction, and there is a case report of angioneurotic edema temporally related to oral thiamine with recurrence on rechallenge, so beyond lacking efficacy, thiamine can itself trigger angioedema in susceptible individuals, which is the opposite of what we want in HAE [^111kh42a] [^116jmZmu].

> I briefly wondered whether thiamine could indirectly modulate bradykinin generation via metabolic effects on the contact pathway enzymes; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because there is no mechanistic or clinical evidence that thiamine affects C1-INH activity, plasma kallikrein, factor XIIa, or bradykinin receptors, and the documented risk of angioedema with thiamine further argues against any exploratory use in acute HAE [^112x8tmA] [^111kh42a].

> I will now synthesize the risk–benefit and guideline consistency: there is no efficacy signal, no pathophysiologic plausibility, and a credible safety concern for provocation of angioedema with thiamine, whereas effective, guideline-endorsed, bradykinin-targeted on-demand therapies are available and should be used promptly according to established care pathways [^114cyf2r] [^116iocJR].

> Therefore, my clinical recommendation is clear: thiamine (vitamin B1) is not indicated for the treatment of acute HAE attacks and should not be used for this purpose; instead, manage attacks early with HAE-specific on-demand therapy (pdC1-INH, icatibant, ecallantide, or oral sebetralstat where available), prioritize airway management for upper airway swelling, ensure patients carry on-demand medication for at least two attacks, avoid non–bradykinin-directed agents such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines in HAE, and consider FFP only when HAE-specific agents are unavailable, with caution due to potential exacerbation [^115nrdpe] [^116VGmZX] [^111XT8eJ] [^111rp1m4] [^1111aioS].

> Let me also clarify, to prevent confusion, that long-term prophylaxis agents like lanadelumab, berotralstat, or emerging FXIIa inhibitors prevent future attacks but are not acute rescue therapies; in the acute setting, they do not substitute for on-demand treatment and should be considered separately within a comprehensive HAE management plan [^112X3JqN] [^1113H6ZZ] [^115Weq16].

---

Thiamine is **not recommended for acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks** because it does not target the bradykinin-mediated pathway that causes HAE symptoms [^112x8tmA]. There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** [^114cyf2r] for thiamine in HAE, and standard acute treatments are C1-inhibitor replacement, icatibant [^112D3rp3], or ecallantide [^111VixqE] [^115x2Zst]. Thiamine should not be used for acute HAE attacks, and patients should have access to approved on-demand therapies [^115E1nd1].

---

## Pathophysiology of hereditary angioedema

HAE is caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction [^1137JuhP], leading to unregulated kallikrein–kinin activation and excess bradykinin [^112x8tmA], which increases vascular permeability and causes edema [^113QvGRj]. Bradykinin is the **primary mediator** of HAE attacks [^112x8tmA], and therapies that block this pathway are effective [^1179GzxG].

---

## Current standard treatments for acute HAE attacks

Current guidelines recommend the following **first-line therapies** for acute HAE attacks:

- **C1-inhibitor replacement therapy**: Intravenous plasma-derived or recombinant C1-inhibitor rapidly restores C1-INH levels and controls attacks [^114cyf2r].

- **Bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist (icatibant)**: Subcutaneous icatibant blocks bradykinin B2 receptors, providing rapid symptom relief [^112D3rp3].

- **Plasma kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide)**: Subcutaneous ecallantide inhibits plasma kallikrein, reducing bradykinin production and alleviating symptoms [^111VixqE].

These therapies are **supported by robust clinical evidence** and are recommended by international guidelines for acute HAE attacks [^115x2Zst].

---

## Thiamine (vitamin B1): pharmacological properties and clinical uses

Thiamine is a **water-soluble vitamin** essential for carbohydrate metabolism and neural function. It is primarily used to treat thiamine deficiency conditions such as beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Thiamine supplementation restores normal metabolic function in deficient states.

---

## Evidence regarding thiamine use in acute HAE attacks

A comprehensive review of the medical literature reveals **no clinical evidence** [^116iocJR] supporting the use of thiamine in acute HAE attacks, and no clinical trials, case reports, or observational studies have demonstrated any efficacy of thiamine in managing acute HAE episodes.

---

## Mechanistic considerations: thiamine and HAE pathophysiology

Thiamine **does not influence the bradykinin-mediated pathway** responsible for HAE attacks [^112x8tmA]. It does not affect C1-inhibitor levels, plasma kallikrein activity, or bradykinin production. Therefore, there is no plausible biological mechanism by which thiamine could alleviate acute HAE symptoms [^1137JuhP].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

International guidelines explicitly **recommend against using non-specific therapies** such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines for acute HAE attacks [^111rp1m4] [^114cyf2r]. Thiamine is not mentioned in any guideline or expert consensus statement as a treatment option for acute HAE attacks.

---

## Safety considerations

While thiamine is generally safe, **rare hypersensitivity reactions**, including anaphylaxis, have been reported [^111kh42a], particularly with parenteral administration [^116jmZmu]. Given the lack of efficacy evidence and potential for adverse reactions, thiamine should not be used for acute HAE attacks.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Thiamine is not recommended for acute HAE attacks because it does not target the **bradykinin pathway**, and there is no **clinical evidence or guideline support** for its use. Patients should have access to approved on-demand therapies [^114cyf2r] such as C1-inhibitor replacement, icatibant, or ecallantide, which are effective and supported by clinical evidence and guidelines [^115x2Zst].

To review the available evidence on the pathophysiologic mechanism of episodes of edema in hereditary angioedema (HAE), a thorough search was conducted using MEDLINE and PubMed with the keywords: hereditary angioedema, C1 inhibitor, complement system, contact system, and bradykinin.

Studies were selected based on their relevance to the pathophysiologic features of HAE. Early studies from the 1970s and 1980s disagreed regarding whether symptoms in HAE were mediated via complement or contact system activation. However, recent studies have shown that in vitro, in C1 inhibitor (C1-INH)-deficient plasma, only contact system activation results in the generation of a vascular permeability enhancing factor. Individuals with a variant C1-INH, which functions as a normal inhibitor of contact system proteases but is deficient in inactivating complement system proteases, do not develop angioedema. During attacks, the blood of HAE patients contains elevated levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen and bradykinin. Additionally, C1-INH-deficient mice exhibit increased vascular permeability mediated by contact system activation.

In conclusion, HAE attacks are mediated by bradykinin generated via contact system activation. However, the specific factors triggering such attacks remain unclear.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for hereditary angioedema, particularly concerning pathogenesis, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend recognizing that:

- **Inheritability**: HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and most patients with HAE have a positive family history of angioedema.

- **Cause**: HAE is caused by mutations in the serine protease inhibitor C1, resulting in a serine protease inhibitor C1 functional deficiency.

- **Prevalence**: Most cases of HAE result from a deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor C1 inhibitor.

- **Mechanism of swelling**: The primary mediator of swelling in patients with HAE is bradykinin.

### C1-inhibitor concentrate home therapy for hereditary angioedema: a viable, effective treatment option [^117R9wmv]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of hereditary angioedema**: Frequent or severe hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks can be disabling for patients. Consequently, such attacks indicate the need for regular prophylaxis, typically with attenuated androgens like danazol, which increase hepatic production of C1-INH. However, attenuated androgens may cause unacceptable side effects such as virilization or hepatic abnormalities. They may also be contraindicated, for instance, in women wishing to become pregnant.

	- Fibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid serve as alternative prophylactic agents, although the evidence base for their use is less certain. Despite prophylaxis, many patients continue to experience intermittent severe attacks that disrupt daily activities and may be life-threatening. These attacks are treated with C1-INH concentrate, which often brings about a response within 30–90 minutes.

	- Licensed C1-INH products are available in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Hungary, Argentina, Japan (Berinert P®, ZLB Behring, Marburg, Germany), and the Netherlands (Cetor®, CLB, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). In other European countries, including the United Kingdom, and in the United States, C1-INH is used on a named-patient basis or is completely unavailable.

### Treatment of acute edema attacks in hereditary angioedema with a bradykinin receptor-2 antagonist (Icatibant) [^1179GzxG]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). High credibility.

In hereditary angioedema, bradykinin is assumed to be the most important mediator of edema formation. The objective was to assess whether the selective bradykinin receptor-2 antagonist Icatibant is effective in acute edema attacks of hereditary angioedema.

- **Methods**: In this uncontrolled pilot study, 15 patients with 20 attacks were treated with Icatibant. The attacks were analyzed by using a standardized and validated visual analog scale measurement and compared with historical data of untreated attacks. Plasma bradykinin concentration was measured before and 4 hours after intravenous Icatibant treatment.

- **Results**: Symptom intensity decreased within 4 hours after administration of Icatibant; the median time to onset of symptom relief was 1.50, 1.42, and 1.13 hours in the intravenous groups and 0.58 and 0.45 hours in the subcutaneous groups, respectively. The median difference in the 10-cm visual analog scale 4 hours after the start of treatment was 4.11 cm (95% CI, 1.72–6.07). Compared with untreated attacks, Icatibant treatment reduced the mean (SD) time to onset of symptom relief by 97% from 42 ± 14 to 1.16 ± 0.95 hours (all groups combined). Median bradykinin concentration was 7-fold above the norm during acute attacks at 48.5 pmol/L and decreased to 18.0 pmol/L 4 hours after Icatibant infusion or injection.

- **Conclusion**: Icatibant was effective in treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema.

- **Clinical implications**: This is the first report demonstrating the clinical usefulness of antagonizing bradykinin binding to bradykinin receptor-2 in hereditary angioedema.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of garadacimab for preventing hereditary angioedema attacks: Phase 3 open-label extension study [^115y7jDL]. Allergy (2025). High credibility.

- **Reduction in attack rate**: The proportion of patients with reductions of ≥ 50%, ≥ 90%, and 100% (attack-free) in hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack rates was analyzed during the treatment period compared with the run-in period. This analysis focused on the overall population, rollover patients, and newly enrolled patients.

- **Attack-free period analysis**: In the treatment period, patients were assessed by 3-month windows for attack-free status.

- **Timeline of attacks**: A timeline of HAE attacks was constructed for both the run-in and treatment periods, categorizing patients as either rollover or newly enrolled. Each horizontal block in the timeline represents the progression of an individual patient, sorted from those with the highest number of HAE attacks during the treatment period to those with none.

The mean (95% CI) number of HAE attacks per month requiring on-demand treatment (ODT) during the open-label extension (OLE) was 0.14 (0.09–0.20) for the overall population, 0.11 (0.04–0.18) for rollover patients, and 0.19 (0.09–0.28) for newly enrolled patients. Treatment with garadacimab significantly reduced the mean (95% CI) number of moderate or severe attacks per month from 2.59 (2.26–2.92) during the run-in period to 0.11 (0.07–0.15) during the treatment phase in the overall population. For rollover and newly enrolled patients, the mean (95% CI) number of moderate or severe attacks per month decreased from 2.63 (2.21–3.04) to 0.08 (0.03–0.13) and from 2.55 (2.01–3.09) to 0.15 (0.08–0.23), respectively.

### Long-term prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks with lanadelumab: The HELP OLE study [^1113H6ZZ]. Allergy (2022). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease primarily caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, leading to C1‐inhibitor (C1‐INH) deficiency and/or dysfunction (HAE type 1 or 2 [HAE‐1/2]). Symptoms manifest as recurrent, often painful attacks characterized by swelling of subcutaneous or submucosal tissues. Abdominal attacks can be severely debilitating, and laryngeal attacks can be fatal owing to the risk of asphyxiation.

The chronic and unpredictable nature of HAE, coupled with the risk of severe attacks and temporary disfigurement, contributes to restrictions on daily activities, reduced productivity at work or school, emotional impairment, and a fear of future attacks that continues to affect patients even during attack‐free periods. Importantly, the frequency of attacks does not correlate with their severity (even the first laryngeal edema attack can be fatal), and the historical anatomical location of attacks does not predict future attack sites. Long‐term prophylaxis (LTP) aims to reduce the heavy physical and psychological burden of this disease; the quest to achieve prolonged attack‐free periods or attain complete control and normalize patients' daily lives is a continuing goal.

Enhanced understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of HAE, including the critical role plasma kallikrein plays in its pathogenesis, has substantially broadened the treatment armamentarium of targeted agents for this disease. Lanadelumab is a subcutaneously administered fully human monoclonal antibody that acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of active plasma kallikrein.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1173m7ES]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. These attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for the treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. However, only one medication is approved for the treatment of children under 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for the treatment of young children in the United States.

The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to aid in the recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^114NVTXe]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder; most cases are associated with mutations in the SERPING1 gene that codes for C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Two types of HAE are associated with a dysfunction in plasma C1-INH. Type I HAE, which accounts for approximately 85% of cases, is characterized by low plasma levels of C1-INH. Type II HAE, which accounts for the remaining 15% of cases, is characterized by normal levels of C1-INH protein that are dysfunctional. Hereditary angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency is characterized by unpredictable, acute episodes of nonpruritic swelling. Swelling can affect tissues of the face, trunk, limbs, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be disfiguring, disabling, painful, and even life-threatening if laryngeal swelling occurs. These episodes may occur spontaneously or in response to triggers such as trauma, psychological stress, or infections. This disease is a result of overproduction of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin secondary to C1-INH levels that are insufficient to inhibit the enzymes plasma kallikrein and activated Factor XII.

Symptoms of HAE generally manifest in childhood, with the age of symptom onset ranging from 4.4 to 18 years. While on rare occasions, attacks may occur in the first year of life, there has been a single documented case of an HAE attack occurring in utero in a mother who had a facial attack while in active labor. The mean age of the first HAE episode is 10 years, and approximately 40% of patients experience their first episode by age 10.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^113pVh9H]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of C1-INH concentrate have been demonstrated in clinical use for more than 30 years, involving over 400,000 treatments in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE); this evidence is based mainly upon the treatment of acute abdominal and facial attacks using a fixed dose of C1-INH concentrate. Information on the efficacy of C1-INH concentrate in the emergency treatment of laryngeal edema is limited.

We report data obtained from 39 laryngeal attacks in 16 patients with HAE, treated with C1-INH concentrate (Berinert; CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) in a prospective, open-label clinical study (International Multicenter Prospective Angioedema, C1-INH Trial 2 [I.M.P. A.C.T.2]). This highly purified C1-INH concentrate is produced from human plasma obtained in the United States and rendered free of detectable viruses through two independent steps of virus inactivation and removal.

The I.M.P. A.C.T.2 study is an extension of the placebo-controlled I.M.P. A.C.T.1 study, which previously established 20 U/kg as an effective dose of C1-INH concentrate in the treatment of acute HAE attacks. While only single abdominal and facial HAE attacks were treated in I.M.P. A.C.T.1, repeated attacks in all body locations were treated in I.M.P. A.C.T.2. Here, we analyze the treatment of the laryngeal attacks that occurred in I.M.P. A.C.T.2, focusing on whether C1-INH concentrate given at the weight-based dose of 20 U/kg, which demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo against abdominal and facial attacks in I.M.P. A.C.T.1, is also effective at providing rapid relief from the laryngeal attacks.

### A focused parameter update: Hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^111x4rRH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hereditary angioedema, specifically with respect to avoidance of triggers, the AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend offering adjunctive strategies such as avoiding ACE inhibitors and estrogen therapy when feasible, along with stress reduction, to decrease the frequency and severity of HAE attacks.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^116okqbE]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Our results indicate that C1-INH concentrate at the recommended weight-based dose of 20 U/kg is a highly effective and safe emergency treatment for potentially life-threatening laryngeal attacks in patients with HAE by providing rapid symptom relief in all treated patients. Persistence of efficacy with repeated administration was demonstrated because our study as a whole assessed the use of C1-INH concentrate in the treatment of successive HAE attacks (also for attacks at other body locations). Thus, our findings provide reassurance that C1-INH concentrate administered at a dose of 20 U/kg is a reliable, long-term option for the emergency treatment of laryngeal attacks, reducing the risk of asphyxiation should this rare type of HAE attack occur.

### Kalbitor [^111VixqE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Kalbitor to treat acute attacks of hereditary angioedema in adolescents and adults were evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (EDEMA4 and EDEMA3) involving 168 patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE). Patients experiencing an attack of hereditary angioedema in any anatomic location, with at least one moderate or severe symptom, were treated with 30 mg subcutaneous Kalbitor or placebo. As patients could participate in both trials, a total of 143 unique patients were involved. Among these, 94 were female, 123 were Caucasian, and the mean age was 36 years (range 11–77). There were 64 patients with abdominal attacks, 55 with peripheral attacks, and 24 with laryngeal attacks.

In both trials, the effects of Kalbitor were evaluated using the Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score and the Treatment Outcome Score (TOS). These endpoints evaluated attack severity (MSCS) and patient response to treatment (TOS) for an acute HAE attack.

MSCS score is a point-in-time measure of symptom severity. At baseline, and post-dosing at 4 hours and 24 hours, patients rated the severity of each affected symptom on a categorical scale (0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patient-reported severity was based on each patient's assessment of symptom impact on their ability to perform routine activities. Ratings were averaged to obtain the MSCS score. The endpoint was reported as the change in MSCS score from baseline, with a decrease in MSCS score reflecting an improvement in symptom severity.

### A focused parameter update: Hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^115t3L9J]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hereditary angioedema, specifically with respect to managing acute attacks, AAAAI/EAACI 2013 guidelines recommend not using anabolic androgens or antifibrinolytic drugs for the management of acute attacks of angioedema.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^113Z5VMq]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients were eligible for treatment if they had previously been enrolled in the I.M.P. A.C.T.1 study, irrespective of their treatment in the study. The total sample size in this extension study was therefore limited by the number of patients who had been screened and found eligible for participation in I.M.P. A.C.T.1.

Other inclusion criteria included being at least 6 years of age with laboratory and historically confirmed C1-INH deficiency (type I or II HAE) and having a documented history of abdominal or facial attacks. Relevant exclusion criteria included a history of hypersensitivity to C1-INH concentrate, acquired angioedema due to C1-INH deficiency, all other types of angioedema not associated with C1-INH deficiency, use of any C1-INH concentrate within 24 hours before the start of treatment in I.M.P. A.C.T.2, and use of fresh frozen plasma or native plasma within 7 days before the start of treatment.

The primary endpoint was the time from start of treatment to onset of symptom relief, as determined by the patient's responses to a standard question posed at predetermined intervals for up to 24 hours after the start of treatment. This type of endpoint has been widely used in the evaluation of HAE therapies. In addition, for the preceding I.M.P. A.C.T.1 study, we retrospectively validated this primary endpoint by correlation with the course of the associated HAE symptoms. Secondary endpoints included time to complete resolution of all symptoms (patient's assessment), proportion of patients with at least one attack.

### Effectiveness of lanadelumab for preventing hereditary angioedema attacks: Subgroup analyses from the HELP study [^112HHHaw]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease affecting 1 in 50,000 people and is characterized by unpredictable attacks of angioedema affecting the skin and submucosal tissue. Patients with HAE must have medication readily available to treat attacks and may use long-term prophylaxis (LTP) to prevent attacks. Approved therapeutics for LTP include plasma kallikrein inhibitors like lanadelumab and berotralstat; C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) replacement; as well as androgens.

Lanadelumab is approved in numerous countries for the prevention of HAE attacks in patients aged 12 years and older. The recommended starting dose is 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w), but this may be reduced to 300 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) if patients are attack-free for 6 months or more. Lanadelumab inhibits plasma kallikrein, thereby preventing the formation of bradykinin and the development of attacks. In the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled hereditary angioedema long-term prophylaxis (HELP) Study (NCT02586805), lanadelumab significantly reduced the occurrence of attacks over a 6-month treatment period in patients aged 12 years and older with HAE type 1 or 2. Mean attack rates in patients treated with subcutaneous lanadelumab 300 mg q2w and 300 mg q4w decreased by 86.9% and 73.3%, respectively, versus placebo.

Given the wide heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of HAE, we evaluated the efficacy of lanadelumab in HELP in prespecified subgroup categories (age, sex, race, weight, body mass index (BMI), run-in attack rate, HAE type, geographic region, prior LTP use, and history of laryngeal attacks).

### Deucrictibant for angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency: A randomized-controlled trial [^112kggi8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency is a very rare but serious disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 500,000 persons. There are no approved therapies to treat or prevent angioedema swelling in patients with this condition. Deucrictibant is a specific, orally bioavailable, competitive antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor currently under investigation for hereditary angioedema.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of deucrictibant as an acute and prophylactic treatment for angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency.

- **Methods**: A 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted. In Part 1, four consecutive angioedema attacks were treated with three doses of deucrictibant (10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg) or placebo. In Part 2, deucrictibant, 20 mg, or placebo was administered twice daily for two treatment periods of eight weeks.

- **Results**: Three patients were enrolled; of those three patients, one completed both study parts, and two completed only Part 2. In Part 1, a reduction in attack severity was observed in the three attacks treated with deucrictibant as opposed to an increase in severity of the attack treated with placebo. In Part 2, the individual mean monthly attack rates were 2.0, 0.6, and 1.0 during the placebo period and 0.0 across all patients during treatment with deucrictibant. There were no severe adverse events and one self-limiting treatment-emergent adverse event (abdominal pain).

- **Conclusions**: Deucrictibant has the potential to effectively and safely treat and prevent angioedema attacks due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency.

### Lanadelumab demonstrates rapid and sustained prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks [^1124FoUV]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

The investigator-confirmed hereditary angioedema attack rate during the treatment period (days 0–69) is shown in several figures. Figure 1 details the monthly rate of all attacks, the primary endpoint; the monthly rate of attacks requiring acute treatment; and the monthly rate of moderate/severe attacks. Figure 2 examines the rate of hereditary angioedema attacks during days 0–69 of treatment and during the steady-state period. Attack rates are based on attacks occurring within two weeks prior to each time point, with a month defined as 28 days. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.

The maximum attack severity was observed to be lower in patients receiving lanadelumab compared to those receiving a placebo during days 0–69. Figure 3 highlights that 37.9% to 48.1% of patients in the lanadelumab-treated groups were attack-free through day 69 of treatment, contrasted with 7.3% of placebo-treated patients. Additionally, as depicted in Figure 4, a higher proportion of patients treated with lanadelumab during days 0–69 were classified as responders (achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of attacks relative to the run-in period) compared to patients receiving placebo.

- **Figure 3**: Attacks by maximum severity, days 0–69 of treatment. Note that due to rounding, some bars may not total 100%.

- **Figure 4**: Proportion of patients achieving a 50% to 90% reduction in attack rate during days 0–69 relative to the run-in period. Responders are defined as patients who achieved a 50% reduction in the number of attacks relative to the run-in period. For each patient, the percentage reduction is calculated as the run-in period attack rate minus the treatment period attack rate, divided by the run-in period attack rate, then multiplied by 100.

### Effect of lanadelumab on attack frequency and QoL in Japanese patients with hereditary angioedema: Report of five cases [^112CJJ57]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Lanadelumab, a recombinant human anti-kallikrein monoclonal antibody, is recommended as the first-line option for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) in hereditary angioedema (HAE). However, the efficacy of lanadelumab and its effects on the quality of life (QoL) in Japanese HAE patients using real-world data have not been reported. Herein, we report the outcomes of five HAE patients who were treated with lanadelumab at two Japanese institutions. We retrospectively collected data on attack frequency and on-demand treatment frequency using an angioedema quality of life (AE-QoL) questionnaire.

Our data corresponded to five Japanese HAE patients who started lanadelumab treatment: four with HAE due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (HAE-1) and one with HAE with a normal C1-inhibitor (HAE-nC1-INH). Two HAE-1 patients showed a reduction in both attacks and number of on-demand treatments. The other HAE-1 patients had an increase in the number of on-demand treatments, although there was no apparent reduction in attacks. The HAE-nC1-INH patient showed a slight increase in both attacks and number of on-demand treatments. Only one HAE-1 patient discontinued treatment after 1 month owing to side effects, including dizziness and headache. All four who continued treatment showed improved AE-QoL total and domain scores.

Therefore, in this study, using real-world data, we demonstrated that lanadelumab reduced attack frequency and improved QoL in Japanese HAE patients.

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^113mobCS]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder. Most cases are characterized by low plasma levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Clinical manifestations of HAE due to C1-INH deficiency include unpredictable, acute episodes of nonpruritic swelling that can affect the face, trunk, limbs, and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Attacks can be disfiguring, disabling, painful, and even life-threatening if laryngeal swelling occurs. Symptoms of HAE generally manifest in childhood.

Effective medications are available and approved to treat HAE in children; however, evidence informing the use of these medications in pediatric clinical practice is limited. Hereditary angioedema management plans are critical to optimize outcomes and should address on-demand treatment for acute attacks and plans to prevent potentially fatal laryngeal attacks. The plan should also comprise a holistic approach to address nonclinical aspects of HAE, including quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues. This article provides an overview of HAE management principles that health care providers can apply to treat pediatric patients to improve their QoL.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^115toqpb]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized by an inherited functional deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), leading to unpredictable episodes of edema at various body locations. C1-INH is a critical control protein of the complement and kallikrein-kinin cascade systems. During HAE attacks, these plasma proteolytic cascades are activated, and due to either the complete lack of C1-INH (type I HAE) or the presence of dysfunctional C1-INH (type II HAE), result in enhanced vascular permeability. This leads to local subcutaneous or submucous swelling.

The most frequent symptoms of HAE are acute episodes of skin swellings or abdominal pain, which can be inconvenient and painful but are not life-threatening. In contrast, the rare but potentially life-threatening episodes of laryngeal edema (approximately 1% of HAE attacks) are associated with a risk of asphyxiation. This is the primary symptom of concern for patients with HAE. Clinical manifestations of laryngeal attacks include hoarseness, stridor, dyspnea, the sensation of a lump in the larynx, dysphagia, and voice change.

The first-line therapy for acute HAE attacks is replacement therapy with C1-INH concentrate, as recommended in the 2007 International Consensus Algorithm for the Management of HAE. Before the availability of effective treatments, up to 25% to 30% of patients with HAE died from laryngeal edema, with an even higher mortality rate of approximately 50% reported for patients with undiagnosed HAE.

### Recurrent episodes of skin angioedema and severe attacks of abdominal pain induced by oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy [^111SN7qY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

ReAngioedema is characterized by skin swelling, colicky attacks of abdominal pain, and life-threatening laryngeal edema, which can be either hereditary or acquired. According to anecdotal reports, it may be associated with the use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. We investigated potential interactions between these medications and various types of reAngioedema in a large cohort of women.

- **Methods**: Women with reAngioedema (n = 516) underwent a thorough medical evaluation and were classified by type of angioedema using standard criteria.

- **Results**: Of the 516 women, 228 (44%) had used oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, including 103 (45%) with urticaria-related angioedema, 50 (22%) with idiopathic angioedema, 39 (17%) with hereditary angioedema type III, 32 (14%) with hereditary angioedema type I, and 4 (2%) with angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy led to angioedema attacks in 46 women (20%), including 20 (63%) with hereditary angioedema type I, 24 (62%) with hereditary angioedema type III, and 2 (4%) with idiopathic angioedema. These 46 women included 26 in whom symptoms occurred for the first time after using these medications, and 20 in whom pre-existing reAngioedema worsened considerably.

- **Conclusion**: Oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy can either induce or exacerbate symptoms of hereditary angioedema type I or type III, or idiopathic angioedema.

### Hereditary angioedema: Increased number of attacks after frequent treatments with C1 inhibitor concentrate [^113mWFYo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

C1 inhibitor concentrate is regarded as effective and safe in treating acute attacks of hereditary angioedema caused by C1 inhibitor deficiency. This study investigated the course of disease in three women treated frequently with C1 inhibitor concentrate.

- **Methods**: Three women are described who received C1 inhibitor concentrate for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema and experienced an increase in the frequency of attacks during that treatment period. In a control group of 24 patients aged more than 60 years with hereditary angioedema, the natural course of disease was determined.

- **Results**: The three women (ages 50, 69, and 72 years) had received C1 inhibitor concentrate for 27, 18, and 22 years, respectively, for acute abdominal and skin attacks. Before this treatment, all attacks were severe. The treatment was always effective: the attacks were mild, and the duration of the attacks was shortened. During the treatment period, the number of attacks increased slowly but continuously, starting at the onset of treatment and paralleling the course of treatment. At the end of the observation period, the number of attacks increased by 4-fold, 12-fold, and 5-fold in the three women, respectively. No factors known to increase the frequency of attacks in hereditary angioedema were found in these patients. The control group did not show a similar increase in attacks during a comparable period of time.

- **Conclusion**: A possible explanation for the increase in the frequency of attacks may lie in the large number of injections of C1 inhibitor concentrate.

To provide context for understanding the opportunity for novel therapeutic modalities to transform the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE), studies involving the treatment of HAE in the United States were identified through MEDLINE and PubMed.

Studies were selected based on their relevance to HAE treatment. The current HAE treatment strategy is insufficient, highlighting an unmet clinical need. Prophylactic treatment carries significant risks of adverse effects, and its efficacy, although generally good, is not perfect.

There is no specific treatment in the United States for acute HAE attacks that is reliably effective, underscoring a critical unmet clinical need. The development of several promising drugs for treating HAE attacks represents a highly significant advancement in the management of these patients.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^115v47xf]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Untreated laryngeal attacks can progress for 8 to 12 hours, after which the symptoms persist for 12 to 24 hours and slowly subside thereafter, with a mean overall duration of 103 hours having been reported for 342 untreated attacks. In the one controlled study in which laryngeal attacks were treated with placebo (four attacks in four patients), the mean time between treatment and onset of relief was 8.5 hours.

The symptoms of laryngeal attacks treated with C1-INH concentrate in our study started to subside rapidly by 6 to 78 minutes after treatment and were relatively short in duration with complete resolution following a mean of 13.9 hours after treatment (median of 8.3 hours). Thus, despite the unavoidable limitation of our study being uncontrolled, the comparison with these historical data for untreated or placebo-treated attacks nevertheless indicates the efficacy of C1-INH at the recommended dose of 20 U/kg in the treatment of laryngeal edema attacks. There was no evidence in our study for rebound edema after treatment of laryngeal attacks with C1-INH concentrate, as indicated by no new attacks having occurred before complete resolution of the previous attack.

Compared to acute HAE attacks at other body locations, laryngeal attacks show the most rapid response to infusion of C1-INH concentrate, which was supported by our results for abdominal, facial, and peripheral attacks treated with the same weight-based dose of C1-INH concentrate in the I.M.P. A.C.T.2 study. The median time to onset of symptom relief was 20 minutes for abdominal attacks, 28 minutes for facial attacks, and 31 minutes for peripheral attacks.

### Prospective study of rapid relief provided by C1 esterase inhibitor in emergency treatment of acute laryngeal attacks in hereditary angioedema [^112pCJux]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder characterized by C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency, resulting in periodic attacks of acute edema that can be life-threatening if they occur in the laryngeal region. We assessed the efficacy of C1-INH concentrate in the emergency treatment of rarely occurring acute laryngeal HAE attacks in a prospective, open-label clinical study.

- **Methods**: Acute laryngeal attacks were each treated with C1-INH concentrate (Berinert) at a single dose of 20 U/kg body weight. Efficacy endpoints included time to onset of symptom relief and time to complete resolution of all symptoms, each based on the patient's assessment.

- **Results**: All 39 laryngeal attacks in 16 patients were treated successfully. The median time to onset of symptom relief was 15 min. The median time to complete resolution of all symptoms was 8.25 h. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred, and the treatment was well tolerated. The administration of C1-INH concentrate was not associated with any viral infections.

- **Conclusion**: C1-INH concentrate is an effective and safe emergency treatment for providing reliable and rapid relief from the potentially life-threatening symptoms of laryngeal HAE attacks.

### Efficacy and safety of garadacimab, a factor XIIa inhibitor for hereditary angioedema prevention (VANGUARD): A global, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^115Weq16]. Lancet (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic disease associated with kallikrein-kinin system dysregulation. Garadacimab (CSL312), a novel, fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits activated factor XII (FXIIa), is being studied for the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-monthly subcutaneous administrations of garadacimab as prophylaxis for hereditary angioedema.

VANGUARD was a pivotal, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial recruiting patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with type I or type II hereditary angioedema across seven countries: Canada, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United States. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (3:2) to receive garadacimab or placebo for 6 months (182 days) via an interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomisation was stratified by age (≤ 17 years vs > 17 years) and baseline attack rate (1 to < 3 attacks per month vs ≥ 3 attacks per month) for the adult group. The randomisation list and code were kept by the IRT provider during the study, with no access by site staff and funding representatives. All patients, investigational site staff, and representatives from the funder (or their delegates) with direct interaction with the study sites or patients were masked to treatment assignment in a double-blind fashion. Randomly assigned patients received a 400-mg loading dose of subcutaneous garadacimab as two 200-mg injections or a volume-matched placebo.

### The Icatibant outcome survey: 10 years of experience with icatibant for patients with hereditary angioedema [^112D3rp3]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). High credibility.

In patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), bradykinin causes swelling episodes by activating bradykinin B2 receptors. Icatibant, a selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, is approved for on-demand treatment of HAE attacks. The Icatibant Outcome Survey (IOS; NCT01034969) is an ongoing observational registry initiated in 2009 to monitor the effectiveness and safety of icatibant in routine clinical practice. As of March 2019, 549 patients with HAE type 1 or 2 from the IOS registry had been treated for 5995 total attacks.

This article reviews data published from IOS over time, demonstrating that the effectiveness of icatibant in a real-world setting is comparable to its efficacy in clinical trials. One dose is effective for the majority of attacks, and early treatment, facilitated by self-administration, leads to faster resolution and shorter attack duration. The effectiveness and safety of icatibant have been shown across a broad range of patient subgroups, including children, adolescents, and patients with HAE with normal C1 inhibitor levels. Tolerability has been demonstrated in patients aged ≥ 65 years.

Additionally, this review highlights how IOS data have provided valuable insights into patients' diagnostic journeys and treatment behaviors across individual countries. Such findings have helped to inform clinical strategies and guidelines to optimize HAE management and limit disease burden.

### Outcome measures in randomized controlled studies of acute therapy for hereditary angioedema: A systematic review [^117NWsmx]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

The applied methods for this systematic review are described in the supplementary materials. Eleven papers describing 13 eligible trials were identified [supplementary references]. The definitions of all outcome measurement instruments used in the included trials are shown in Table S1. The 13 unique primary outcomes were consolidated into nine standardized outcome terms, representing outcomes with the same meaning but differing wording. Table 2 displays the standardized outcome terms used as secondary outcomes in the trials. The majority (81%) of these standardized outcomes were not used as a secondary outcome in more than one trial. Exploratory outcomes are summarized in Table S2. Two outcome measures planned in the trial protocol were not mentioned in the full paper or supplementary material (refer to Table S3).

- **Standardized primary outcomes**: We identified 72 standardized efficacy outcome terms reported in studies evaluating on-demand treatment of acute attacks in HAE patients, of which nine were used as a primary outcome measure. No outcome measure was reported consistently in all 13 trials.

- **Outcome instrument utilization**: Eleven instruments were utilized by 74% of the standardized outcomes. These can be broadly divided into instruments evaluating location-specific symptoms and instruments providing a general classification of overall attack severity. Outcomes measuring treatment response were predominantly either time-based (e.g. time to symptom relief) or symptom-based (e.g. change in severity at a predefined time).

### A comprehensive management approach in pediatric and adolescent patients with hereditary angioedema [^116ySmwM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Early identification of hereditary angioedema (HAE) is critical to reducing mortality and morbidity and to developing an appropriate management plan. The first HAE episode may be a laryngeal attack, which can be fatal. An analysis of 70 patients with HAE who had asphyxiated during a laryngeal attack showed that mortality was higher in patients with undiagnosed HAE (63 cases) than in patients with diagnosed HAE (7 cases). Upper airway swelling is also more severe in pediatric patients due to the smaller diameter of the airway, which increases the risk of asphyxiation.

Barriers to early diagnosis include poor recognition of HAE symptoms by healthcare professionals, a lack of appropriate family screening tools, and a lack of access to simple laboratory tests to help establish a diagnosis. Symptoms typically present in childhood, and delays in diagnosis can subject patients to inappropriate treatment and unnecessary medical interventions.

Despite its familial association, many family members of patients with HAE are not screened for the disorder. A survey of patients with HAE found that only 48% of immediate family members and 26% of extended family members had been tested for the condition. With the availability of effective therapies, screening of family members has increasingly been emphasized as a way to reduce the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with HAE. Each child of a parent with HAE has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder; therefore, all infants with a family history of HAE should be considered to have the disorder until the diagnosis is ruled out.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^1139jtD5]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

The baseline requirements for expert‐confirmed attack rate had two additional requirements not applied to the entire dosing period on‐study attacks: (1) attacks had to be unique, and (2) require treatment, medical attention, or cause functional impairment. To allow for a more direct comparison of angioedema attack rates occurring during the baseline and dosing periods, the two additional requirements for expert‐confirmed baseline attacks were applied programmatically to the on‐study expert‐confirmed attacks occurring during the dosing period, resulting in an adjusted expert‐confirmed attack rate. Adjusted expert‐confirmed attack rates were used to compare on‐study attack rates to baseline attack rates for the exploratory ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, and ≥ 90% responder endpoints.

Primary and secondary endpoints were tested hierarchically, with the type 1 error rate controlled at the study level using a combination of hierarchical testing and the Hochberg procedure. For the primary endpoint, the two berotralstat doses were tested at the α = .05 level, comparing active treatment to placebo. If the maximum of the two p-values was ≤ .05, the null hypothesis of no difference between the attack rate for patients on active and placebo treatment was rejected for both doses, and testing proceeded to the next endpoint in the hierarchy with α = .05. If the maximum of the two p-values was > .05 but the minimum of the two p-values was < .025, the null hypothesis for the dose with p < .025 was rejected, and testing for only that dose proceeded to the next endpoint in the hierarchy with α = .025.

### Hereditary angioedema: Children should be considered for training in self-administration [^111MHWZ3]. Pediatric Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is an inherited disease that causes periodic swelling attacks, which can be life-threatening and have a major effect on a patient's life. Studies have shown that home therapy for angioedema reduces disease severity, leads to faster relief of symptoms, and improves quality of life. Most studies have been conducted in adults. We report a 13-year-old boy who quickly learned self-administration, which resulted in reduced frequency and severity of attacks. The aim of this report is to emphasize that children should be considered for self-administration training and that the process does not have to be long or complicated.

### Successful C1 inhibitor short-term prophylaxis during redo mitral valve replacement in a patient with hereditary angioedema [^114U5E7h]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is characterized by sudden episodes of nonpitting edema that cause discomfort and pain. Typically, the extremities, genitalia, trunk, gastrointestinal tract, face, and larynx are affected by attacks of swelling. Laryngeal swelling carries significant risk for asphyxiation. The disease results from mutations in the C1 esterase inhibitor gene that cause C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.

Attacks of hereditary angioedema result from contact, complement, and fibrinolytic plasma cascade activation, where C1 esterase inhibitor irreversibly binds substrates. Patients with hereditary angioedema cannot replenish C1 esterase inhibitor levels on pace with its binding. When C1 esterase inhibitor is depleted in these patients, vasoactive plasma cascade products cause swelling attacks.

Trauma is a known trigger for hereditary angioedema attacks, and patients have been denied surgical procedures because of this risk. However, uncomplicated surgeries have been reported. Appropriate prophylaxis can reduce peri-operative morbidity in these patients, despite proteolytic cascade and complement activation during surgical trauma. We report a case of successful short-term prophylaxis with C1 esterase inhibitor in a 51-year-old man with hereditary angioedema who underwent redo mitral valve reconstructive surgery.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^111pR1zs]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, chronic disease characterized by unpredictable angioedema attacks primarily mediated by uncontrolled plasma kallikrein activity and overproduction of bradykinin. Excess bradykinin leads to vasodilation, vascular leakage, and consequent swelling. HAE attacks most commonly affect the extremities, face, abdomen, and larynx. Although less frequent, laryngeal attacks are potentially life-threatening because of the risk of rapid onset of respiratory obstruction and asphyxiation. For this reason, international guidelines recommend that all patients should have access to on-demand medication for treatment of acute attacks.

The clinical manifestations of HAE and the unpredictability of attacks can result in significant physical, emotional, and economic burdens for patients and families, including higher levels of anxiety and depression, inability to perform daily activities, and high direct and indirect care costs. Therefore, it is important that management of HAE focuses on reducing the frequency and severity of future attacks with prophylactic treatment in addition to on-demand therapies.

### Kalbitor [^113QvGRj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations to C1-esterase-inhibitor (C1-INH) located on Chromosome 11q and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It is characterized by low levels of C1-INH activity and low levels of C4. C1-INH functions to regulate the activation of the complement and intrinsic coagulation (contact system pathway) and is a major endogenous inhibitor of plasma kallikrein.

The kallikrein-kinin system is a complex proteolytic cascade involved in the initiation of both inflammatory and coagulation pathways. One critical aspect of this pathway is the conversion of high molecular weight (HMW) kininogen to bradykinin by the protease plasma kallikrein. In HAE, normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity and the classical complement cascade is therefore not present. During attacks, unregulated activity of plasma kallikrein results in excessive bradykinin generation. Bradykinin is a vasodilator, which is thought to be responsible for the characteristic HAE symptoms of localized swelling, inflammation, and pain.

Kalbitor is a potent (Ki = 25 pM), selective, reversible inhibitor of plasma kallikrein. It binds to plasma kallikrein and blocks its binding site, inhibiting the conversion of HMW kininogen to bradykinin. By directly inhibiting plasma kallikrein, Kalbitor reduces the conversion of HMW kininogen to bradykinin and thereby treats symptoms of the disease during acute episodic attacks of HAE.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^1141X6Hn]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

As the primary endpoint did not meet statistical significance for the 110 mg dose, inferential statistical testing was not performed on the secondary efficacy endpoints for this dose. The result for the first secondary endpoint, proportion of days with angioedema symptoms, was not statistically significant for the 150 mg dose; therefore, statistical testing on the remaining secondary endpoints was stopped. The reported p-values for descending secondary endpoints are nominal.

Reductions in expert-confirmed HAE attack rates over the effective treatment period (steady state, day 8 to week 24) relative to placebo were 25% (nominal p = .188) and 48% (nominal p = .005) for the 110 mg and 150 mg groups, respectively. These reductions were similar to those observed over the entire treatment period.

In exploratory responder analyses:

- **150 mg group**: 57% of patients (p = .070) experienced a ≥ 50% reduction in adjusted HAE attack rate relative to baseline compared with 0% of patients in the placebo group.
- **110 mg group**: 33% of patients (p = .455) experienced a ≥ 50% reduction in adjusted HAE attack rate relative to baseline compared with 0% of patients in the placebo group.
- **Reduction of ≥ 70%**: Observed in 29% of patients in the 150 mg dose group compared with 0% of patients in the 110 mg and placebo groups (p = .462 for 150 mg group vs. placebo).

No patients in any treatment group achieved a ≥ 90% reduction.

Scientific and clinical progress, together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options, has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence.

- **Classification, diagnosis, and treatment**: Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, and prophylactic treatment.
- **Special considerations**: Recommendations include special considerations for women and children.
- **Comprehensive management**: The development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan is discussed.
- **Burden of illness assessment**: Assessing the burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor is included.

Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### Factors associated with hospital admission in hereditary angioedema attacks: a multicenter prospective study [^111GURd4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Acute attacks of hereditary angioedema are characterized by localized edema. These attacks can be life-threatening and are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

- **Objective**: To determine factors associated with hospital admission of patients with an acute attack of hereditary angioedema presenting at the emergency department.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter prospective observational study of consecutive patients (January 2011 through December 2013) experiencing an acute hereditary angioedema attack and presenting at the emergency department at one of four French reference centers for bradykinin-mediated angioedema. Attacks requiring hospital admission were compared with those not requiring admission.

- **Results**: Of 57 attacks in 29 patients, 17 (30%) led to hospital admission. In multivariate analysis, laryngeal and facial involvements were associated with hospital admission (odds ratio 18.6, 95% confidence interval 3.9–88; odds ratio 7.7, 95% confidence interval 1.4–43.4, respectively). Self-injection of icatibant at home was associated with non-admission (odds ratio 0.06, 95% confidence interval 0.01–0.61). The course was favorable in all 57 cases. No upper airway management was required.

- **Conclusion**: Most patients attended the emergency department because they were running out of medication and did not know that emergency treatment could be self-administered. Risk factors associated with hospital admission were laryngeal and facial involvement, whereas self-injection of icatibant was associated with a return home.

### Impact of lanadelumab on health-related quality of life in patients with hereditary angioedema in the HELP study [^114ukmWn]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

The HELP Study was a randomized, double-blind pivotal trial in which lanadelumab was well tolerated and significantly reduced angioedema attacks in patients with HAE-1/2. It assessed angioedema-specific patient-reported quality of life (QoL) using the AE-QoL. The analyses reported here show that treatment with lanadelumab, as compared with placebo, significantly improves mean AE-QoL total scores and all four domain scores, particularly in the functioning domain. Mean AE-QoL scores per study visit indicated that although health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improved by week 8 in all treatment groups, the improvements were maintained for the duration of the study only in the lanadelumab groups. The 4-week recall period for AE-QoL and schedule of data collection preclude conclusions on the precise timings for HRQoL improvement.

Clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL with lanadelumab treatment were observed through the use of the well-established minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 6 points in AE-QoL total score. Higher proportions of patients in all lanadelumab groups achieved the MCID by the end of the treatment period compared with the placebo group, with the highest proportion, 81%, in the 300 mg every 2 weeks group. Patients in this group were seven times more likely to reach the MCID threshold than placebo-treated patients. Interestingly, there appeared to be a placebo effect during the first two assessments (at weeks 4 and 8) that disappeared over subsequent timepoints. It should be noted that the mean monthly hereditary angioedema (HAE) attack rate (primary endpoint) in the placebo group during the HELP Study treatment period was 1.97.

### Analysis of disease burden in patients with hereditary angioedema from Japan by patient-reported outcomes [^115JUfCh]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Eight patients reported an attack within 24 hours of the survey and were, therefore, asked to complete the Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) part of the survey. The mean total AAS score of the respondents was 7.6. The AAS score tended to be higher, suggesting greater angioedema activity in patients who reported their attack frequency as weekly, compared to those who reported their attack frequency as monthly or annual.

- **Angioedema activity score (AAS)**: Scores by frequency of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks were classified into annual, monthly, and weekly. Scores of AAS were collected from eight patients who reported an attack in the 24 hours prior to answering the questionnaire.

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) results are shown in Figure 5 and Figure S3. The mean anxiety and depression subscale scores in all patients were 5.8 and 4.2, respectively. No apparent relationship was observed between HADS subscale scores and attack frequency. Seventeen of 54 (31.5%) patients had a HADS anxiety subscale score of ≥ 8, and nine of 54 (16.7%) patients had a HADS depression subscale score of ≥ 8, suggesting mild or moderate to severe anxiety or depression, respectively. Furthermore, nine of 54 (16.7%) patients reported a HADS anxiety subscale score of ≥ 11, suggestive of moderate to severe anxiety, and two of 54 (3.7%) patients reported a HADS depression subscale score of ≥ 11, suggestive of moderate to severe depression.

- **Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)**: (a) HADS anxiety and depression subscale scores by frequency of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks were classified into annual, monthly, and weekly.

### Prodromes predict attacks of hereditary angioedema: Results of a prospective study [^115MLiC2]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Prodromal symptoms can accurately predict attacks of hereditary angioedema. A recent prospective study examined the reliability of these symptoms in forecasting attacks and aimed to improve preemptive treatment. The study found that patients could actively manage their condition if they were able to identify prodromal signs early. Successful intervention during these early stages is shown to potentially mitigate the severity of the attacks, thereby enhancing the quality of life for those affected by hereditary angioedema. Further research is encouraged to solidify these findings and develop precise guidelines for patients and healthcare providers.

### Specialist advice support for management of severe hereditary angioedema attacks: A multicenter cluster-randomized controlled trial [^112N2biu]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease associated with unpredictable, potentially life-threatening edema attacks. Management of severe attacks is currently suboptimal because emergency medical teams are often unaware of new specific treatments. This trial aims to test whether a dedicated national telephone care-management strategy would reduce resource use during severe hereditary angioedema attacks.

We conducted a cluster-randomized multicenter prospective trial involving patients with a documented diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (type I, II, or FXII hereditary angioedema). Participants were enrolled between March 2013 and June 2014 at eight participating reference centers. The randomized units were the reference centers (clusters). Patients in the intervention arm were given a national free telephone number to call in the event of a severe attack. Emergency physicians in the SOS-hereditary angioedema (SOS-HAE) call center were trained to advise or prescribe specific treatments. The primary outcome was the number of admissions for angioedema attacks, and an economic evaluation was also performed.

We included 100 patients in the SOS-HAE group and another 100 in the control group. Over two years, there were 2,368 hereditary angioedema attacks among 169 patients (85%). The mean number of hospital admissions per patient during this period was significantly greater in the usual-practice group (mean 0.16 [range 0 to 2] versus 0.03 [range 0 to 1]); the patient risk difference was significant: -0.13 (95% confidence interval -0.22 to -0.04; p = 0.02).

### Hereditary angioedema: Current and emerging treatment options [^116EfGJo]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Angioedema can result from allergic, hereditary, and acquired conditions. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks are disabling at the time of occurrence and can be life threatening; they often result in hospitalization and intensive care unit admission. Although there are several variants of HAE, they share a final common pathway: unopposed activation of multiple kinins and mediators, including kallikrein and bradykinin. This leads to increased vascular permeability, which in turn produces the edema after which the condition is named.

Older treatment options licensed in the United States, such as anabolic steroids and antifibrinolytics, have troublesome side effect profiles and may not reverse a severe acute attack. In Europe, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrates have been used since 1974 for both preventing and terminating attacks. Two of these have now been licensed in the United States for use in HAE patients, one for prophylaxis and the other for treating acute abdominal and facial HAE attacks. The first kinin pathway modulator, ecallantide, has also been licensed recently in the United States for treating HAE attacks.

The objective of this article is to describe HAE and review the available options for managing patients, as well as different drugs currently under investigation. Specific attention is given to the perioperative management of patients with HAE.

### Outcome measures in randomized controlled studies of acute therapy for hereditary angioedema: A systematic review [^115Wwr1E]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is characterized by swellings of subcutaneous and mucosal tissue. Access to effective on-demand medication to treat acute attacks is vital for every HAE patient. Clinical trials investigating new acute treatment options focus on increased efficacy, easier routes of administration, and reduced side effects. The outcome measures that have been reported in these studies have been varied. The existence of this range of efficacy outcomes is, at least partly, caused by the difficulty in developing a unique uniform outcome measure that captures the heterogeneity in attack location, symptoms, severity, and temporal patterns.

In addition, these efficacy outcomes heavily depend on patient-reported outcomes, since sensations such as relief of discomfort, disability, and pain cannot be measured objectively by clinicians. The heterogeneity in outcome measures hinders trial comparison, leads to selective outcome reporting bias, and the large quantity of outcome measures used in a single trial puts a significant burden on participants. It is unclear which primary outcome parameters best reflect the efficacy of the investigated acute treatment options. These issues can be addressed with a Core Outcome Set (COS): "an agreed standardized collection of outcomes which should be measured and reported, as a minimum, in all trials for a specific clinical area". This systematic review aims to summarize the efficacy outcome measures reported in studies evaluating acute treatment in HAE patients as a first step in the development of a COS.

### Successful treatment of acute hereditary angioedema attacks with self-administered icatibant in patients with venous access problems [^114Jwjx9]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare and potentially fatal autosomal dominant disorder characterized by unpredictable skin, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract edema. Plasma-derived C1-esterase inhibitors are effective in the prophylaxis or treatment of hereditary angioedema type I and II attacks, but they must be administered intravenously. This may be problematic in patients with venous access difficulties. Icatibant, a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, can be administered subcutaneously.

In July 2008, icatibant received approval for healthcare professional-administered treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks in adults. In 2011, it received European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration licenses for patient-administered treatment of hereditary angioedema attacks. Given these approvals, and with the appropriate training, icatibant could provide the opportunity for patients to self-administer treatment. This is one of the first long-term follow-up reports of patients with hereditary angioedema using self-administered icatibant. During follow-up, icatibant remained effective, and patient satisfaction was high.

### Oral berotralstat for the prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema attacks in patients in Japan: A phase 3 randomized trial [^116pXyE2]. Allergy (2021). High credibility.

- **Statistical analysis**: The sample size considered feasible for enrollment in Japan had limited statistical power. Assuming an angioedema attack rate for placebo patients of 3.6 attacks per month and a common standard deviation of 2.0 attacks per month for berotralstat and placebo, a sample size of 8 patients in each treatment group was anticipated to have 61% power to detect a ≥ 67% reduction in angioedema attack rate (from 3.6 to 1.2 attacks per month), comparing berotralstat with placebo.

Analyses included all patients randomized to study drug (intent-to-treat population). Comparisons between each berotralstat dose group and placebo in the rate of expert-confirmed angioedema attacks during the entire dosing period were made using a negative binomial regression model. The number of expert-confirmed angioedema attacks was included as the dependent variable, treatment was a fixed effect, baseline monthly angioedema attack rate was a covariate, and the logarithm of duration on treatment was an offset variable.

The analysis of the rate of expert-confirmed attacks during the effective dosing period was similarly conducted, as was the number of attacks requiring treatment with on-demand medication. The proportion of days with angioedema symptoms was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model with baseline attack rate as a covariate and treatment included as a fixed effect. Changes from baseline in AE-QoL scores were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures with fixed effects for treatment, baseline attack rate, baseline AE-QoL, visit, a visit-by-treatment interaction effect, and…

### Successful C1 inhibitor short-term prophylaxis during redo mitral valve replacement in a patient with hereditary angioedema [^113pF4TR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is characterized by sudden episodes of nonpitting edema that cause discomfort and pain. Typically, the extremities, genitalia, trunk, gastrointestinal tract, face, and larynx are affected by attacks of swelling. Laryngeal swelling carries a significant risk for asphyxiation. The disease results from mutations in the C1 esterase inhibitor gene, causing C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Attacks of hereditary angioedema result from contact, complement, and fibrinolytic plasma cascade activation, where C1 esterase inhibitor irreversibly binds substrates.

Patients with hereditary angioedema cannot replenish C1 esterase inhibitor levels on pace with its binding. When C1 esterase inhibitor is depleted in these patients, vasoactive plasma cascade products cause swelling attacks. Trauma is a known trigger for hereditary angioedema attacks, and patients have been denied surgical procedures because of this risk. However, uncomplicated surgeries have been reported. Appropriate prophylaxis can reduce peri-operative morbidity in these patients, despite proteolytic cascade and complement activation during surgical trauma. We report a case of successful short-term prophylaxis with C1 esterase inhibitor in a 51-year-old man with hereditary angioedema who underwent redo mitral valve reconstructive surgery.

### Oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor for prophylaxis in hereditary angioedema [^1114YScT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a life-threatening illness caused by mutations in the gene encoding C1 inhibitor (also called C1 esterase inhibitor), leading to overactivation of the kallikrein-bradykinin cascade. BCX7353 is a potent oral small-molecule inhibitor of plasma kallikrein with a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile that may help prevent angioedema attacks.

- **Methods**: In this international, three-part, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated four doses of BCX7353 (62.5 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg, and 350 mg once daily) for the prevention of angioedema attacks over a 28-day period. Patients with type I or II hereditary angioedema with a history of at least two angioedema attacks per month were randomly assigned to BCX7353 or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the number of confirmed angioedema attacks. Key secondary endpoints included angioedema attacks according to anatomical location and quality of life.

- **Results**: A total of 77 patients underwent randomization, 75 received BCX7353 or placebo, and 72 completed the trial. The rate of confirmed angioedema attacks was significantly lower among patients who received BCX7353 at daily doses of 125 mg or more than among those who received placebo, with a 73.8% difference at 125 mg (P < 0.001). Significant benefits with respect to quality-of-life scores were observed in the 125-mg and 250-mg dose groups (P < 0.05). Gastrointestinal adverse events, predominantly of grade 1, were the most commonly reported adverse events, particularly in the two highest BCX7353 dose groups.

- **Conclusions**: Once-daily oral administration of BCX7353 at doses of 125 mg or more effectively reduced the frequency of angioedema attacks and improved quality of life, although gastrointestinal adverse events were common at higher doses.

### Hereditary angioedema [^117Gno1R]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder that usually results from a decreased level of functional C1-INH. It clinically manifests with intermittent attacks of swelling of the subcutaneous tissue or submucosal layers of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts. Laboratory studies and radiographic imaging have limited roles in the evaluation of patients with acute attacks of HAE, except when the diagnosis is uncertain and other processes must be ruled out. Treatment begins with the assessment of the airway to determine the need for immediate intervention. Emergency physicians should understand the pathophysiology of HAE to help guide management decisions.

### Hereditary angioedema: Diagnosis and management-a perspective for the dermatologist [^1149KeUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a relatively rare but potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by marked, diffuse mucosal edema that, in extreme cases, can affect the airway, leading to asphyxiation. The clinical picture is similar to that of other forms of angioedema; therefore, misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is common. HAE is caused by a deficiency in or a dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor, which has a wide variety of physiologic functions, among which regulation of the contact (kallikrein-kinin) system is most relevant to this condition.

Effective management of HAE must consider routine or long-term prophylaxis, short-term prophylaxis (in advance of predicted trauma, such as surgical or dental procedures), and treatment of acute attacks. Historically, treatment options have been limited to controlling symptoms. However, progress in understanding the pathophysiology of HAE has facilitated the development of treatments such as C1 inhibitor therapy or drugs targeted at the bradykinin pathway, which address the underlying pathologic process.
