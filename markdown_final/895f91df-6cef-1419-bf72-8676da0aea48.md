## Question

What is c/w cld

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "c/w cld" means in a medical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely expansion of the abbreviation. Then, I should verify whether the phrase is used in a specific clinical context that changes its meaning. Next, I will consider alternative interpretations and why they might be less likely. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded definition and note any nuances that depend on context.

> Let me first confirm the abbreviation mapping. "c/w" commonly stands for "consistent with", and "cld" most plausibly stands for "chronic lung disease", so "c/w cld" likely means "consistent with chronic lung disease" in charting or documentation, which signals that the clinical findings match a chronic lung disease process rather than confirming a specific diagnosis like COPD or ILD outright [^319ce992].

> Wait, let me verify the context dependency before concluding. In some settings, "CLD" can refer to "chronic liver disease", but in respiratory notes, imaging reports, or pulmonary consultations, "chronic lung disease" is the more natural fit, whereas "chronic liver disease" would typically be written as "c/w CLD (liver)" or similar to avoid ambiguity, so I should keep the clinical context front and center when interpreting this shorthand.

> Hold on, I should also consider pediatric contexts. In neonatology, "CLD" often denotes bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease of prematurity, so "c/w CLD" in a NICU or follow-up note would imply findings consistent with that neonatal chronic lung disease rather than adult COPD or ILD, reinforcing that the meaning is context-specific and should be read alongside the patient's age and history [^3b192336] [^916f86b0].

> I need to ensure I'm not missing other plausible expansions. "CLD" could theoretically mean "chronic lower-extremity disease" or other entities, but those are not standard abbreviations in common medical usage, and they would be unlikely to appear without clarifying parentheses, so "chronic lung disease" remains the most clinically coherent interpretation in general medical documentation unless the note explicitly indicates otherwise [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a precise, clinically useful definition. "c/w cld" means the clinical, laboratory, or imaging findings are consistent with a chronic lung disease process, which includes entities such as COPD, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, chronic bronchitis, and chronic lung disease of prematurity, among others; it suggests alignment with a chronic respiratory disorder but does not, by itself, establish a specific etiologic diagnosis without further data such as spirometry, imaging, or exposure history [^d71f950f] [^322f0f1f] [^3b192336].

> But wait, what if the phrase appears in a note where the author is hedging or awaiting confirmatory testing? I should double-check for that nuance. Clinicians often write "c/w" when the pattern is suggestive but not definitive, so "c/w cld" may signal a working impression pending spirometry, CT, or specialist input, and the reader should interpret it as a probabilistic statement rather than a final diagnosis until corroborated by objective testing and clinical correlation [^notfound].

---

"c/w cld" means "consistent with chronic lung disease". This shorthand is used when clinical findings — such as symptoms, imaging, or spirometry — align with a chronic lung process like COPD, bronchiectasis, or interstitial lung disease, but **does not confirm a specific diagnosis**. It signals that the pattern matches chronic lung disease and that further evaluation is needed to establish the exact cause and guide management [^d71f950f] [^322f0f1f].

---

## Common chronic lung diseases encompassed by "c/w cld"

Several **chronic lung diseases** are commonly implied by "c/w cld", including:

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Characterized by persistent, often progressive airflow obstruction due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, with chronic respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, sputum production, and exacerbations [^322f0f1f] [^e6f9657b].

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic airway dilation with recurrent infections and productive cough.

- **Interstitial lung disease (ILD)**: A group of disorders causing lung parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis, leading to restrictive physiology and progressive dyspnea.

- **Chronic bronchitis**: Persistent productive cough for at least three months in two consecutive years, often associated with smoking or other irritant exposures.

- **Asthma**: Chronic airway inflammation with variable airflow obstruction and symptoms such as wheezing, cough, and dyspnea.

---

## Clinical scenarios where "c/w cld" is commonly used

The abbreviation "c/w cld" is **frequently used** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Radiology reports**: Chest X-rays or CT scans showing hyperinflation, bronchiectasis, interstitial changes, or emphysema may be described as "c/w cld", indicating findings consistent with chronic lung disease [^60ccee04].

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Spirometry demonstrating obstructive or restrictive patterns may be interpreted as "c/w cld", suggesting underlying chronic lung pathology [^notfound].

- **Clinical notes**: Physicians may document "c/w cld" when patients present with chronic respiratory symptoms, smoking history, or occupational exposures, indicating that the clinical picture aligns with chronic lung disease.

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical features associated with "c/w cld"

While "c/w cld" is a general descriptor, **specific chronic lung diseases have distinct diagnostic criteria and clinical features**:

| **Disease** | **Diagnostic criteria** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| COPD | - Post-bronchodilator FEV₁/FVC < 0.70 <br/> - Chronic respiratory symptoms | - Dyspnea <br/> - Chronic cough <br/> - Sputum production <br/> - Exacerbations [^322f0f1f] |
| Bronchiectasis | - Clinical symptoms <br/> - CT evidence of airway dilation | - Chronic productive cough <br/> - Recurrent infections <br/> - Hemoptysis |
| Interstitial lung disease | - Clinical symptoms <br/> - Imaging evidence of interstitial changes <br/> - Exclusion of other causes | - Progressive dyspnea <br/> - Dry cough <br/> - Crackles on exam |
| Asthma | - Variable airflow obstruction <br/> - Reversibility on bronchodilator testing | - Wheezing <br/> - Cough <br/> - Dyspnea <br/> - Allergic history |

---

## Limitations and ambiguities of "c/w cld"

The abbreviation "c/w cld" has several **limitations and ambiguities**:

- **Lack of specificity**: It does not specify the exact type of chronic lung disease, necessitating further diagnostic workup to confirm the diagnosis [^notfound].

- **Subjectivity**: Interpretation of clinical findings as "consistent with" chronic lung disease may vary among clinicians, leading to potential diagnostic uncertainty.

- **Need for further evaluation**: Additional tests, such as spirometry, imaging studies, and laboratory tests, are often required to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide management [^322f0f1f].

---

## Clinical implications and next steps

When "c/w cld" is documented, **clinicians should**:

- **Confirm the diagnosis**: Perform appropriate diagnostic tests, such as spirometry, chest imaging, and laboratory studies, to identify the specific chronic lung disease [^322f0f1f].

- **Assess disease severity**: Evaluate the severity and stage of the disease to guide treatment decisions and prognosis [^5fd70c73].

- **Identify underlying causes**: Investigate potential etiologies, such as smoking, occupational exposures, or genetic factors, to address modifiable risk factors [^322f0f1f].

- **Initiate appropriate management**: Develop individualized treatment plans, including pharmacologic therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and lifestyle modifications, to optimize patient outcomes [^38c2fc16].

---

"c/w cld" means "consistent with chronic lung disease", indicating that clinical findings align with a chronic lung process but **do not confirm a specific diagnosis**. Further evaluation is needed to identify the exact disease and guide management.

### Is disease stability an attainable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treatment goal? [^14f249cf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive airflow obstruction. Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, the disease burden remains high; although clinical trials have shown improvements in outcomes such as exacerbations, quality of life, and lung function, improvement may not be attainable for many patients. For patients who do experience improvement, it is challenging to set management goals given the progressive nature of COPD. We therefore propose disease stability as an appropriate and attainable treatment goal. Other disease areas have developed definitions of no disease activity or remission, which provide relevant information for defining and achieving stability for patients with COPD. Disease stability builds on related concepts already defined in COPD, such as clinical control and clinically important deterioration. Current components that could form part of a disease stability definition include exacerbations, health status (including quality of life and symptoms), and lung function. Considerations should be given to intervals over which stability is defined and assessed, appropriate thresholds, and defining a composite. Ensuring a holistic approach, objective measurements, and harmonious, clear communication between patients and physicians can further support establishing disease stability. Here we propose a preliminary definition of disease stability, informed by existing research in COPD. Further research will be needed to validate the framework for use in clinical and research settings. Exploring disease stability as a goal, however, is an opportunity to develop and validate an attainable treatment target to advance the standard of care for patients with COPD.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was developed recently to unify international efforts in the management of the disease. The most important GOLD objective is raising awareness that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is an increasing health problem. The first step in the GOLD program was to prepare a consensus report, named "Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD", based on best-validated evidence and current pathogenetic and clinical knowledge. It encourages implementation of effective strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease in all countries, and emphasizes the importance of renewed research initiatives.

Background

Chronic respiratory diseases are disorders of the airways and other structures of the lung, and include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. Through this article we take a broad view of chronic lung disease while highlighting (1) the complex interactions of lung diseases with environmental factors (e.g. climate change, smoking and vaping) and multimorbidity and (2) proposed areas to strengthen for better global patient outcomes.

Conclusion

We suggest new directions for the research agenda in high-priority populations and those experiencing health disparities. We call for lung disease to be made a research priority with greater funding allocation globally.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) vitamin D guidance — recommendation strength and evidence scope are outlined as follows: "Conclusion statements supporting both recommendations are Grade II, Fair". For the COPD exacerbation assessment recommendation, "synthesis of the results was challenging due to lack of consistency in vitamin D dosing, dosing frequency and delivery routes, length of intervention and baseline serum 25(OH)D levels". The supporting evidence was developed from specified questions: "What associations exist between serum 25(OH)D levels and mortality, lung function and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD?" and "Does vitamin D supplementation improve lung function and exacerbation outcomes in adults with COPD?"

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society research statement on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease outlines that the goal is to describe evidence related to diagnosis, assessment, and management; identify gaps in knowledge; and make recommendations for future research, and it is not intended to provide clinical practice recommendations on COPD diagnosis and management. Methods state that clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates with expertise in COPD were invited to participate; a literature search of Medline was performed; the search was not a systematic review of the evidence; and existing evidence was appraised and summarized, and then salient knowledge gaps were identified. Recommendations for research that addresses important gaps in the evidence in all areas of COPD were formulated via discussion and consensus. The introduction summarizes disease burden, noting Global Burden of Disease estimates that COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and in the United States, caused more than 3 million deaths in 2010 alone, is the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years lost, that COPD-related mortality more than doubled among women over a 20-year observation period, and that exacerbations account for 50 to 75% of the cost associated with COPD.

### Asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome [^f0bec0be]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overlap of asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (ACO) in patients with obstructive lung disease is growing in recognition, though there is no consistent agreement on the diagnostic criteria for the disease process. Patients with ACO have distinct clinical characteristics and trajectories, which are representative of a heterogenous, multifactorial, and incompletely understood inflammatory pathophysiology. Current treatment strategies are focused on titration of inhaled therapies such as long-acting bronchodilators, with increasing interest in the use of targeted biologic therapies aimed at the underlying inflammatory mechanisms. Future directions for research will focus on elucidating the varied inflammatory signatures leading to ACO, the development of consistent diagnostic criteria and biomarkers of disease, and improving the clinical management with an eye toward targeted therapies.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease definition and key features — The ATS and ERS define COPD as a preventable and treatable disease state characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, with airflow limitation usually progressive and associated with a chronic inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases; cigarette smoking is the most common risk factor, dyspnea and exacerbations are the most prominent respiratory manifestations, and COPD is particularly common among the elderly and associated with risk factors such as smoking, pollution, aging, inactivity, and diet.

### The importance of balanced pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in diffuse lung disease [^78f98873]. Respiratory Research (2002). Low credibility.

The lung responds to a variety of insults in a remarkably consistent fashion but with inconsistent outcomes that vary from complete resolution and return to normal to the destruction of normal architecture and progressive fibrosis. Increasing evidence indicates that diffuse lung disease results from an imbalance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, with a persistent imbalance that favors pro-inflammatory mediators dictating the development of chronic diffuse lung disease. This review focuses on the mediators that influence this imbalance.

### Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^3572cb80]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician summary — screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) states: Do not screen asymptomatic adults for COPD (Grade D), and this recommendation applies to adults who do not recognize or report respiratory symptoms; it does not apply to persons with symptoms such as chronic cough, sputum production, difficulty breathing, or wheezing, nor to populations at very high risk for COPD such as persons with α₁ antitrypsin deficiency or workers exposed to certain toxins at their job. Implementation notes specify: Do not screen for COPD in patients with no symptoms, and clinicians can help reduce patients' risk for COPD by supporting them in not starting to smoke and helping them quit if they do. The recommendation is consistent with the 2016 USPSTF recommendation, and contextual points note that cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD and that chronic lower respiratory disease, composed mainly of COPD, is the sixth leading cause of death in the US; the reduction of airflow in the lungs from COPD is irreversible, and progression to severe disease can prevent participation in normal activities because of deteriorating lung function.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^78872a31]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) disease activity — Activity of a disease relates to the level of activation of the biological processes that drive disease progression and Disease activity is a different concept than disease severity. Disease progression in established COPD is heterogeneous, ranging from rapid progression to stable or even improved lung function, suggesting that disease activity is also variable. We recommend: Studies that relate potential biomarkers of disease activity to patient-centered outcomes to validate the biomarkers as clinically useful measures of disease activity. We recommend: Studies that evaluate the impact of disease activity on treatment response and, conversely, the effects of treatment on disease activity.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^e6f9657b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New Definition of COPD

The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases. Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents, focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own.

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes: the future of COPD [^adb9799e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Significant heterogeneity of clinical presentation and disease progression exists within chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although FEV₁ inadequately describes this heterogeneity, a clear alternative has not emerged. The goal of phenotyping is to identify patient groups with unique prognostic or therapeutic characteristics, but significant variation and confusion surrounds use of the term "phenotype" in COPD. Phenotype classically refers to any observable characteristic of an organism, and up until now, multiple disease characteristics have been termed COPD phenotypes. We, however, propose the following variation on this definition: "a single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". This more focused definition allows for classification of patients into distinct prognostic and therapeutic subgroups for both clinical and research purposes. Ideally, individuals sharing a unique phenotype would also ultimately be determined to have a similar underlying biologic or physiologic mechanism(s) to guide the development of therapy where possible. It follows that any proposed phenotype, whether defined by symptoms, radiography, physiology, or cellular or molecular fingerprint will require an iterative validation process in which "candidate" phenotypes are identified before their relevance to clinical outcome is determined. Although this schema represents an ideal construct, we acknowledge any phenotype may be etiologically heterogeneous and that any one individual may manifest multiple phenotypes. We have much yet to learn, but establishing a common language for future research will facilitate our understanding and management of the complexity implicit to this disease.

### Anaemia and iron dysregulation: untapped therapeutic targets in chronic lung disease? [^3e45d574]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Given the experience with ESAs, there may be reservations about targeting Hb levels > 11 g/dL; however, considering physiological and clinical differences, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate considerations from other populations to patients with chronic lung disease. As with CKD, patients with chronic lung disease are predisposed to increased CV morbidity and mortality. The current limits (to not start rhEPO unless Hb < 10 g/dL) with rhEPO treatment in CKD where there is not a primary driver for hypoxia beyond the anaemia itself make development of rhEPO in the chronic lung disease population challenging given that most of the population are not anaemic. In this regard, it is relevant that the benefit:risk considerations in chronic lung disease are different from CKD, given the key synergistic impacts of impaired pulmonary gas exchange and O₂ carriage in this population where there is no established treatment option for anaemia of chronic disease. Clinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with HIF-PHIs is associated with plasma EPO levels that remain within the physiological range for the CKD patient population, and hence risks associated with supraphysiological EPO levels may be significantly lower. Improved O₂ content through improved Hb may improve cardiovascular outcomes in chronic lung disease at higher Hb levels, given the increased cardiac risk, especially during periods of strain such as hospitalisations that are associated with hypoxia and an increased risk of anaemia. Consistent with the variable impact of impaired O₂ delivery through reduced Hb in different populations, despite potential safety concerns in CKD, a meta-analysis has demonstrated a reduction in hospitalisations in chronic heart failurein the absence of any mortality benefit with rhEPO in this population.

In conclusion, anaemia and dysregulated iron metabolism are prevalent in chronic lung disease, and in the setting of impaired O 2 delivery in patients who have a limited ability to compensate, there is associated morbidity and mortality. Therapies used in other disease areas may have particular benefits in this population. Given changes in standards of care, clinical features in chronic lung disease are evolving and newer therapies may provide opportunities to deliver improved outcomes in chronic lung disease. Given differences in populations and the ongoing morbidity and mortality burden, studies in chronic lung disease are warranted to confirm any benefit to treating anaemia and dysregulated iron metabolism and to mitigate any theoretical safety risks that extend from the literature and other populations.

### The respiratory microbiota α-diversity in chronic lung diseases: first systematic review and meta-analysis [^e7052a2b]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While there seems to be a consensus that a decrease in gut microbiome diversity is related to a decline in health status, the associations between respiratory microbiome diversity and chronic lung disease remain a matter of debate. We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining lung microbiota alpha-diversity in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchiectasis (NCFB), in which a control group based on disease status or healthy subjects is provided for comparison.

Results

We reviewed 351 articles on title and abstract, of which 27 met our inclusion criteria for systematic review. Data from 24 of these studies were used in the meta-analysis. We observed a trend that CF patients have a less diverse respiratory microbiota than healthy individuals. However, substantial heterogeneity was present and detailed using random-effects models, which limits the comparison between studies.

Conclusions

Knowledge on respiratory microbiota is under construction, and for the moment, it seems that alpha-diversity measurements are not enough documented to fully understand the link between microbiota and health, excepted in CF context which represents the most studied chronic respiratory disease with consistent published data to link alpha-diversity and lung function. Whether differences in respiratory microbiota profiles have an impact on chronic respiratory disease symptoms and/or evolution deserves further exploration.

Palliative care in chronic lung diseases

As is similar for the under-utilisation of pulmonary rehabilitation, there is low access to and implementation of palliative care for chronic lung diseases, despite its effectiveness. Patients who are dying from COPD experience a progressive decline in health, increasing symptoms and reduced autonomy. However, the majority of patients with advanced COPD are not offered palliative care. National and international guidelines, over the past 20 years, have tried to emphasise its value and adoption into practice. Despite this, even in high income countries, among the general population, there is minimal evidence of palliative care being offered to patients with COPD, compared to those with lung cancer, despite the symptoms being potentially just as distressing.

Palliative care for lung diseases in low resource settings is likely to be non-existent or minimal. It is profoundly affected by low access to health services and social and cultural beliefs around sharing a terminal diagnosis with the patient. Palliative care services demand a high degree of networks between multiple disciplines and organisations, and unified standards of ethical care may be missing in LMIC. The infrastructure investment within LMIC may need intensive investment for this to occur, but none-the-less this area needs to be highlighted for future research.

### Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^011efcbc]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacts a heavy toll on society, yet its prevention, diagnosis and treatment receives inadequate attention from both the medical community and from society at large. Guidelines released in 2001 from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) are aimed at redressing this inequity. In this review, we integrate information from the GOLD guidelines with recent updates on the prevention, treatment and management as related specifically to the most severe form of this disease. In order to help distinguish COPD from other disorders that may mimic or confound its treatment, we place particular emphasis on the definition, underlying pathophysiology and diagnosis of COPD. In addition, we discuss future directions in pharmacotherapy.

### COPD: to be or not to Be, that is the question [^e1f6929f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

As our knowledge on the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progresses, a conceptual model simply based on an accelerated decline of lung function in adult life in response to smoking has become inadequate to capture the complexity of this disease, and increasing attention is being given to possible contributions from events or alterations of developmental processes that take place earlier in life. In addition, a remarkable heterogeneity has emerged among the pathobiological mechanisms that are involved in different phenotypes of COPD, suggesting that an effective disease management will require individualized treatment approaches largely based on the underlying biological mechanisms (endotypes). In this review, we will discuss the many faces of COPD from an epidemiological, pathobiological, and clinical standpoint and argue that airflow limitation encompasses a number of manifestations that are too diverse to be still clustered under the same diagnostic label.

### Diagnosis and outpatient management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a review [^ea0a6663]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:

- **Definition**: COPD is a chronic lung disease characterized by non-reversible airflow obstruction and persistent symptoms of dyspnea and productive cough.
- **Pathophysiology**: COPD is caused by airway inflammation and remodeling due to environmental exposures, primarily tobacco smoke. Inflammation and oxidative stress in the airway, alveoli, and pulmonary microvasculature causes destruction of lung parenchyma, and loss of elastic recoil in the lung tissue.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of the COPD is estimated at approximately 12,000 persons per 100,000 population.
- **Disease course**: These pathologic changes lead to manifestations of irreversible airflow obstruction, as well as a progressive decline in lung function, which can progress to chronic respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The standardized mortality rate of patients with COPD is estimated at 2.7 (95% CI, 2.5–3.0) in men and 4.8 (95% CI, 4.2–5.4) in women, respectively.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indices and comorbid conditions — Concomitant chronic diseases may contribute to severity in COPD, and We recommend: Studies that determine which index or indices best stratify patients for the purpose of determining disease severity or recommending treatment. Studies that determine if short-term changes in these indices or other measures (e.g., lung function, CT findings, biomarkers) are useful surrogate markers of medium- or long-term patient-centered outcomes, thus shortening the time needed to complete therapeutic trials. Studies that contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis, impact, prevention, and treatment of concomitant diseases in patients with COPD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^322f0f1f]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction

- COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over the lifetime of the individual that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes

- the main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental and host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging) can also contribute

- the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α₁ antitrypsin deficiency; a number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

Follow-up of Patients with COPD Who Developed COVID-19

Approximately 30% of patients with SARS or MERS had persistent lung abnormalities and abnormal radiology that were consistent with fibrotic lung disease after their acute illness. There are not yet long-term studies on the follow-up of patients with COVID-19, nor recommendations for monitoring these patients, thus the follow up of patients with COPD who developed COVID-19 is still based on expert opinion and consensus. The intensity of the monitoring obviously depends on the severity of the COVID-19 episode.

Patients who developed mild COVID-19 should be followed with the usual protocols used for patients with COPD. Patients who developed moderate COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia but no respiratory failure, should be monitored more frequently and accurately than the usual patients with COPD, with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

If chest X-ray abnormalities have not resolved at hospital discharge, a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan should be considered at 6 months to 1 year. Complications occurring during/after the COVID-19 episode should also be monitored.

Patients with COPD are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and multimorbid survivors frequently have required prolonged ICU stays. Until we have evidence from prospective studies, survivors of severe COVID-19 with COPD should be considered at a high risk of developing a "critical illness" or a "chronic critical illness", a severe heterogeneous condition linked not only to the acute infectious episode but also to the underlying conditions before they became severely ill.

There are informative candidate models for the comprehensive management of complex care delivery that are already published and undergoing study in a primary care setting, and these may be adapted for application after COVID-19.

### American Thoracic Society / National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap workshop report [^3b6e32f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic obstructive lung diseases with an associated high burden of disease. Asthma, which is often allergic in origin, frequently begins in infancy or childhood with variable airflow obstruction and intermittent wheezing, cough, and dyspnea. Patients with COPD, in contrast, are usually current or former smokers who present after the age of 40 years with symptoms (often persistent) including dyspnea and a productive cough. On the basis of age and smoking history, it is often easy to distinguish between asthma and COPD. However, some patients have features compatible with both diseases. Because clinical studies typically exclude these patients, their underlying disease mechanisms and appropriate treatment remain largely uncertain. To explore the status of and opportunities for research in this area, the NHLBI, in partnership with the American Thoracic Society, convened a workshop of investigators in San Francisco, California on May 14, 2016. At the workshop, current understanding of asthma-COPD overlap was discussed among clinicians, pathologists, radiologists, epidemiologists, and investigators with expertise in asthma and COPD. They considered knowledge gaps in our understanding of asthma-COPD overlap and identified strategies and research priorities that will advance its understanding. This report summarizes those discussions.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotyping — A phenotype is the observable properties (i.e., phenotypic traits) of an organism, which are determined by its genotype and modulated by its environment. A clinical COPD phenotype has been defined as "A single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g., symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". Only a few COPD phenotypes have been validated, including α₁-antitrypsin deficiency, frequent (two or more per year) exacerbations, chronic bronchitis, and upper lobe emphysema with poor exercise tolerance after rehabilitation in patients with severe airflow limitation.

### The challenges of defining early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the general population [^ec50fa4f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a huge global health burden that is projected to become the third-leading cause of mortality by 2030. Established COPD is highly heterogeneous with a lack of disease-modifying treatments. A clearer understanding of the condition is often impeded by the high rate of comorbidities that patients typically exhibit at the point of diagnosis. It is now apparent that there are a range of subpopulations at risk for accelerated disease progression. The mechanisms underpinning these varying trajectories that lead to the development of COPD are highly complex but are significantly influenced by early life exposures. Furthermore, it is now understood that at the point of diagnosis, individuals with COPD have been symptomatic for at least 5 years, underlining the critical need for detection of the disease and efficacious interventions at the early stage.

To date, the majority of COPD studies attempting to examine the concept of early COPD have included populations with mean ages older than 60 years. As Martinez and colleagues highlight in a recent review, these studies therefore inform on late "mild disease" as opposed to "early disease". Although the initial events responsible for ultimate development of pathology currently cannot be described, this expert group proposed an operational definition for early COPD based on surrogate end points that encompasses lung pathology unequivocally associated with subsequent accelerated lung function decline leading to objectively confirmed incompletely reversible airflow obstruction and other COPD-related manifestations (Table 1).

Table 1.
The Operational Criteria for Early Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Characterizing the mechanisms underpinning pathogenesis is a pivotal step toward understanding individuals at risk of COPD and will hopefully lead to novel targets for treatment. However, to validate this hypothesis requires serial sampling in well-powered, long-lasting prospective cohorts.

In this issue of the Journal, Çolak and colleagues (pp.) investigate the relationship between early COPD and subsequent development of clinical COPD. This well-designed Danish study leveraged the large contemporary Copenhagen General Population Cohort to investigate lung function changes in 20- to 50-year-olds over a 10-year period. The authors identified those with early COPD by applying age and spirometric criteria (FEV₁/FVC ratio less than lower limit of normal), in line with the operational definition proposed by Martinez and colleagues in 2017, to investigate the risk of subsequent clinical disease.

### Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the overlap syndrome [^7063d76d]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are highly prevalent chronic diseases in the general population. Both are characterized by heterogeneous chronic airway inflammation and airway obstruction. In both conditions, chronic inflammation affects the whole respiratory tract, from central to peripheral airways, with different inflammatory cells recruited, different mediators produced, and thus differing responses to therapy. Airway obstruction is typically intermittent and reversible in asthma but is progressive and largely irreversible in COPD. However, there is a considerable pathologic and functional overlap between these 2 heterogeneous disorders, particularly among the elderly, who may have components of both diseases (asthma-COPD overlap syndrome). The definitions for asthma and COPD recommended by current guidelines are useful but limited because they do not illustrate the full spectrum of obstructive airway diseases that is encountered in clinical practice. Defining asthma and COPD as separate entities neglects a considerable proportion of patients with overlapping features and is largely based on expert opinion rather than on the best current evidence. The presence of different phenotypes or components of obstructive airway diseases, therefore, needs to be addressed to individualize and optimize treatment to achieve the best effect with the fewest side effects for the patient. Although specific interventions vary by disease, the treatment goals of obstructive airway diseases are similar and driven primarily by the need to control symptoms, optimize health status, and prevent exacerbations.

### Navigating the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^babededc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

We have a critical gap in our understanding of disease progression. Much of the recent insights is driven by population-based lifecourse studies and the identification of trajectories of respiratory health. These trajectories, however, lack the resolution of data to inform the interplay of disease-specific features, which, as the authors suggest, may be most important for targeted interventions. Unlike the prize of 1714, the multiple data "chronometers" described in the literature, including EPGA, should not be considered part of a competition for truth. Each provides new analytic strategies, reinforcing concepts, and leverage existing data that push us to think in new directions. Most important, these efforts highlight the need for ongoing investment in observational studies of participants at risk for COPD to truly understand COPD evolution.

### Cardiovascular limitations in chronic pulmonary disease [^0002a434]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic lung disease has significant impact on cardiovascular function. Much of this effect is because of increased right ventricular afterload caused by increased pulmonary vascular resistance resulting from structural changes in the pulmonary circulation, and because of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. In the case of chronic obstructive diseases, there may be additional increases in afterload resulting from dynamic hyperinflation. These processes can lead to structural changes in the heart (cor pulmonale), including right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, to maintain right ventricular output. In most ambulatory patients with chronic obstructive disease, it appears that cardiac output may be maintained at levels that are similar to normal both at rest and during exercise, with no consistent improvement in maximal exercise function afforded by interventions that increase blood flow. In contrast, diseases characterized by fibrosis or infiltration of the lung parenchyma may be associated with a disproportionate increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and more pronounced cardiovascular impairment, particularly with exercise.

### Characterizing undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^528dc849]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disorder that is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and associated with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Patients with COPD generally seek medical attention when they experience respiratory symptoms, most notably dyspnea that is persistent and progressive. However, owing to under-utilization of lung function measurements and non-specific nature of the symptoms, COPD is often not recognized until late in the disease process. Indeed, many patients do not receive a diagnosis of COPD until after being hospitalized due to a severe exacerbation.

Lamprecht et al. reported an average underdiagnosis rate of 81% in a prevalence study that included 30,874 participants across 44 countries. Reducing risk factors such as smoking and occupational risk factors while the disease is early in its progression is an important component of treatment for COPD. As such, late diagnosis of COPD represents a missed opportunity to modify the course of the disease through evidence-informed risk factor management and treatment. The extent of this missed opportunity is a function of the number of COPD patients who are undiagnosed, and the burden of disease (e.g. symptom burden, lung function status) in this population.

Quantifying the true burden of undiagnosed COPD and the benefit of screening and case detection can be informed by a comparative assessment of patient- and disease-factors between diagnosed and undiagnosed patients. Numerous studies have compared the characteristics of patients with undiagnosed and diagnosed COPD, but to the best of our knowledge, these studies have never been systematically compiled and pooled. We hypothesized that the characteristics of patients, their risk factors, respiratory symptoms, and disease stage influence the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of COPD.

### Refining the concept of disease stability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: bridging complexity and clinical practice [^956b2107]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with great interest the article titled, "Is Disease Stability an Attainable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Treatment Goal?" by Singh and colleagues, which proposes a thoughtful framework for defining disease stability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The integration of symptom stability, lung function, and exacerbation frequency mirrors approaches in chronic diseases such as no evidence of disease activity in multiple sclerosis and remission models in asthma. Although commendable, several aspects merit further discussion to refine its clinical applicability and precision.

Symptom stability is undoubtedly a critical component of disease stability. However, patient-reported outcomes, such as the COPD Assessment Test or St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores, may be influenced by factors beyond disease activity, including comorbidities and psychosocial conditions. Measures to account for such variability or combining these assessments with objective biomarkers could improve the robustness of symptom evaluation.

The temporal variability of lung function presents another challenge. Day-to-day fluctuations in FEV 1 complicate stability assessments. In addition, age-related declines in lung function and small airway dysfunction (SAD) blur the line between natural progression and disease instability, because trajectories of lung function decline vary among individuals and are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Noninvasive tools, such as parametric response mapping and impulse oscillometry, offer valuable insights into SAD progression and lung tissue changes, serving as potential early indicators of disease activity and stability. Clearer definitions of clinically meaningful changes in FEV 1, together with the integration of SAD assessments across different time frames and severities, could greatly improve stability assessments in COPD.

Including exacerbation severity in defining disease stability is crucial, because exacerbations reflect disease activity and severity. Although zero exacerbations in a year is ideal, focusing on reducing severity or achieving "no clinically significant exacerbations" offers a practical target. Moreover, mechanisms driving exacerbations and treatment responses vary across COPD phenotypes, such as type 2 inflammation, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis, necessitating phenotype-specific approaches to advance precise disease assessment and management. In addition, dynamic lung microbiome changes may impact disease activity and exacerbation risk. Microbiome dysbiosis, implicated in COPD progression and exacerbations, underscores the importance of microbe–host interactions in shaping disease activity.

### Prevalence and attributable health burden of chronic respiratory diseases, 1990–2017: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^94cc21e5]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

By sex, chronic respiratory disease prevalence was highest for both males and females in the high-income region (figure 1). At the country level, the UK had the highest rates in both 1990 and 2017 (country estimates, overall and by sex, are provided in appendix 2).

The age-sex-specific prevalence of each chronic respiratory disease in 2017 was highly variable (figure 2). Asthma prevalence peaked at 5–9 years of age among boys and girls, and was greater among boys than among girls up to 9 years of age. However, from age 10 years onwards, asthma prevalence was consistently higher among females than males. From the onset of adulthood to old age, COPD increased monotonically, while the contributions of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary sarcoidosis, and other chronic respiratory diseases decreased relative to all chronic respiratory diseases (figure 2). Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary sarcoidosis were more prevalent among males than among females (appendix 2).

### Refining the concept of disease stability in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: bridging complexity and clinical practice [^305f4284]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, the stability of these domains over time remains a key challenge. Symptom control, lung function preservation, and absence of exacerbations may define stability but do not always indicate low disease activity. Some patients, despite regular monitoring of lung function, exacerbations, and symptoms in clinical practice, exhibit an "exacerbation-prone" phenotype with persistent high disease activity. Although the proposed definition aims for universal applicability, it may oversimplify COPD's complexity. Tailored criteria for different phenotypes, such as type 2 inflammation or overlapping conditions such as asthma and bronchiectasis, could improve precision. Incorporating biomarkers and "invisible" outcomes, such as lung microbiome profiling, inflammation biomarkers, and radiological markers, could help identify high-risk populations and better assess disease progression, bridging the gap between clinical stability and underlying disease activity for more personalized management in COPD.

In conclusion, the proposal by Singh and colleagues to adopt disease stability as a treatment target represents a significant step forward in COPD management. To refine and validate this concept, future studies should address the temporal variability of lung function, the multidimensional nature of symptoms, and the prognostic implications of exacerbation severity. Identifying biomarkers and trigger factors for high-risk populations is another crucial perspective. These advancements will help establish stability as a meaningful and achievable goal for patients with COPD.

There are currently no peer-reviewed studies that have evaluated the effect of smoking on the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, but studies suggest that smoking is associated with increased severity of disease and risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

In summary, on current evidence, patients with COPD do not seem to be at a greatly increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, but this may reflect the effect of protective strategies. They are at an increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and may be at increased risk of developing severe disease and death.

### Patient pathways for four major chronic respiratory diseases in england between 2008 and 2021 [^1a93fbcb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Background

Chronic respiratory diseases contribute significantly to global mortality (7% of all-cause mortality) and account for 4.5% of disability-adjusted life-years. The UK has worse respiratory disease outcomes than other European countries, including greater mortality, with respiratory diseases accounting for 24% of all deaths, and 6.5% of hospitalisations in the UK. While the burden of respiratory diseases becomes evident after diagnosis has occurred, less is known about events leading up to diagnosis, missed opportunities for diagnosis and immediate management following diagnosis, particularly for less common respiratory diseases.

The UK Office of Life Sciences, the Taskforce for Lung Healthand people with chronic respiratory diseaseshave all called for strategies to tackle poor outcomes (morbidity and mortality) and unclear diagnostic pathways in chronic respiratory diseases. UK-based research has demonstrated that late diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for example, was associated with shorter time to first exacerbation, higher rate and risk of exacerbation and higher rate of COPD-related hospitalisations, compared with early diagnosis. Therefore, timely and accurate diagnoses are critical for streamlining patients to appropriate treatment practices to prevent illness progression and improve outcomes. However, while the National Health Service (NHS) has set out specific guidelines on the events and timelines that the healthcare system should adhere to during the diagnostic process for diseases such as cancer, no such guidelines exist for chronic respiratory diseases.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 6: the aetiology of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^398a6820]. Thorax (2003). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of COPD are thought to be caused by interactions between host factors, bacteria, viruses, and changes in air quality to produce increased inflammation in the lower airway. The evidence for this and the potential mechanisms by which they result in the characteristic symptoms of exacerbations is reviewed. A better understanding of the causes and processes is needed for the appropriate use of existing treatments and the development of new ones. Future studies need to define populations clearly, stratify for known confounding factors, and should aim to identify clinical correlates so that clinical practice can be modified appropriately.

Imaging in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicates that chest radiography is generally performed initially to exclude other diseases and establish concomitant respiratory diseases, is frequently normal in early COPD, shows lung hyperinflation and hyperlucent areas with peripheral trimming of vascular markings when abnormal, and is not performed during routine follow-up of a stable patient; computed tomography (CT) can estimate the degree and distribution of emphysema and identify bronchial wall thickening and gas trapping, correlates with lung function but has substantial interpreter variability, and quantitative techniques have not become routine clinical practice due to analytic complexity, software/algorithm differences, segmentation requirements, and lack of standardized protocols or agreement on complex measurements; CT can also help differentiate structural causes of airflow limitation, identify phenotype-associated abnormalities, and detect pulmonary and nonpulmonary comorbidities including lung cancer, with lung cancer risk increased in COPD but inversely related to the degree of airflow obstruction, and the presence of airflow obstruction should raise awareness of this risk and patients with COPD are considered good candidates to be screened for lung cancer.

### Systems biology coupled with label-free high-throughput detection as a novel approach for diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^6aafef1c]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a treatable and preventable condition characterised by progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. COPD is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. This is primarily caused by tobacco smoking but there is gathering evidence that additional factors predispose patients to COPD, such as genetic susceptibility, air pollution and other airborne irritants. There may well be a genetic predisposition and also some food preservatives have also been implicated indicating that the underlying causality of the disease may not just reside in lung insult from the atmosphere. COPD is projected to have a major effect on human health and worldwide by 2020 it is predicted to be the third most frequent cause of death.

COPD consists of three main respiratory pathologies; emphysema, respiratory bronchiolitis and chronic bronchitis. These separate and distinct pathologies illustrate the heterogeneity of COPD and the importance of well defined COPD phenotypes. Although COPD is primarily a disease of the lungs there is now an appreciation that many of the manifestations of disease are outside the lung, such as cachexia, skeletal muscle dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, depression and osteoporosis, leading to the concept that COPD is a systemic disease.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^dd39cba1]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST pediatric chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) — recommendations: For children aged ≤ 14-years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease, we recommend that treatment(s) for GERD should NOT be used when there are no clinical features of gastroesophageal reflux such as recurrent regurgitation, dystonic neck posturing in infants, or heartburn/epigastric pain in older children (Grade 1B). For children aged ≤ 14-years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease but who have symptoms and signs or tests consistent with gastroesophageal pathological reflux, we recommend that they be treated for GERD in accordance to evidence-based GERD-specific guidelines (Grade 1B). For children aged ≤ 14-years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease but who have symptoms and signs or tests consistent with gastroesophageal pathological reflux, we recommend that acid suppressive therapy should not be used solely for their chronic cough (Grade 1C). For children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) who do not have an underlying lung disease but with gastrointestinal GER symptoms, we suggest that they be treated for GERD in accordance to evidence-based GERD-specific guidelines for 4–8 weeks and their response reevaluated (Ungraded Consensus–based Statement). For children with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) and without an underlying disease, if GERD is suspected as the cause based on GER symptoms, we suggest following the GERD guidelines for investigating children suspected for GERD (Ungraded Consensus–based Statement). The agent used for the "trial of treatment" approach is dependent on the child's age, feeding regimen, and symptoms; PPIs and H₂ receptor antagonists should not be used for longer than 4 to 8 weeks without further evaluation; and in most situations, endoscopy is suggested before pHmetry or pH-MII.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a need for action [^a5714eb5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with exacerbations contributing strongly to the overall severity and burden of disease at the individual level. Many patients with COPD are managed predominantly in the primary care setting; therefore, primary care physicians (PCPs) must be aware of and understand the causes, effects, and management of COPD exacerbations. This review offers practical information about how exacerbations are defined in the treatment setting, pathogenic and environmental causes, options for exacerbation treatment and prevention, and suggestions for improving care in the clinic. Exacerbations have a strong negative effect on patients and are associated with an increased risk of further exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Thus, it is important that exacerbations not requiring hospitalization be identified and confidently managed in the clinical setting. Understanding treatment options for acute exacerbations and maintenance treatment to prevent future exacerbations may help PCPs better understand what they can do to support their patients. This review aims to provide useful guidance for PCPs to identify exacerbations and adjust their practice for optimal management of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It also aims to encourage PCPs that they have an important task in integrating effective COPD management into the primary care setting.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^32ef3871]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills more than 3 million people worldwide every year. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or affect mortality. A better understanding of the complex disease mechanisms resulting in COPD is needed. Smoking cessation programmes, increasing physical activity, and early detection and treatment of comorbidities are further key components to reduce the burden of the disease. However, without a global political and economic effort to reduce tobacco use, to regulate environmental exposure, and to find alternatives to the massive use of biomass fuel, COPD will remain a major health-care problem for decades to come.

### COPD heterogeneity: what this will mean in practice [^d311ff0c]. Respiratory Care (2011). Low credibility.

COPD is a complex collection of conditions. All share the feature of limited expiratory air flow. It is a "disease" in the same sense as is "chronic renal failure". Like most other chronic organ failure "diseases", COPD has disparate causes, and patients are heterogeneous in their prognosis and response to treatment. Unlike many other diseases, the heterogeneity of COPD is just beginning to be described. A number of large trials funded by the National Institutes of Health and industry promise to refine the classification of COPD. Based on accurate diagnosis of COPD subtypes, novel treatments can be more effectively developed and implemented. The clinical implications of improved understanding of COPD heterogeneity will be better care and outcomes for COPD patients, which will depend on increased diagnostic accuracy and selective administration of treatments.

### Strategies for prevention of neonatal chronic lung disease [^a5870f83]. Seminars in Perinatology (2000). Low credibility.

Chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity remains a substantial problem despite modern perinatal and neonatal care. CLD remains related to gestational age and lung immaturity, although it has become clear that severe initial lung disease is not a prerequisite for CLD to develop. Attempts to prevent CLD to date have not adequately addressed the multifactorial nature of the complex pathophysiology that leads to CLD. Thus, results have been modest at best. Prevention of CLD will require a multifaceted approach with specific interventions and care practices focused on different aspects of the pathway that leads to CLD. This review considers new information related to causation of CLD and the magnitude of the effect of prevention strategies tested to date. This article also advances the hypothesis that CLD is preventable with a global strategy of minimizing inciting events, optimizing management, and specific therapies aimed at intrinsic vulnerabilities.

### Genetics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: understanding the pathobiology and heterogeneity of a complex disorder [^6fc016f2]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a deadly and highly morbid disease. Susceptibility to and heterogeneity of COPD are incompletely explained by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking. Family-based and population-based studies have shown that a substantial proportion of COPD risk is related to genetic variation. Genetic association studies have identified hundreds of genetic variants that affect risk for COPD, decreased lung function, and other COPD-related traits. These genetic variants are associated with other pulmonary and non-pulmonary traits, demonstrate a genetic basis for at least part of COPD heterogeneity, have a substantial effect on COPD risk in aggregate, implicate early-life events in COPD pathogenesis, and often involve genes not previously suspected to have a role in COPD. Additional progress will require larger genetic studies with more ancestral diversity, improved profiling of rare variants, and better statistical methods. Through integration of genetic data with other omics data and comprehensive COPD phenotypes, as well as functional description of causal mechanisms for genetic risk variants, COPD genetics will continue to inform novel approaches to understanding the pathobiology of COPD and developing new strategies for management and treatment.

### The complex beginnings of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^591bce2c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last decades, an accelerated decline of lung function in response to cigarette smoking was considered the central hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This conceptual model of the natural history of COPD placed major emphasis on exposures and clinical manifestations that occur in the middle to late adult years, generating the misleading assumption that the trajectories of this disease can be characterized and effective strategies of prevention implemented by simply focusing on adulthood.

More recently, this assumption has been challenged at multiple levels. It has been conclusively shown that in a significant proportion of cases, COPD can develop as a result of lung function deficits that are established by young adult life, with no accelerated decline of lung function thereafter. In addition, growing evidence indicates that airway diseases, developmental processes, and exposures that take place in early life (or even in utero) can have long-lasting effects on susceptibility to COPD.

This new evidence has redefined and expanded the scope of COPD research, leading to efforts to characterize risk factors in age spans that traditionally have been left out of COPD studies. In this issue of the Journal, Çolak and colleagues (pp.) used the rich dataset of the Copenhagen adult cohort to study the prevalence and prognosis of "early" COPD in the general population. As previously proposed, they defined early COPD as having a FEV₁/FVC ratio less than the lower limit of normal in individuals < 50 years of age with at least 10 pack-years of tobacco consumption. In this relatively young population of smokers, early COPD had a striking prevalence of 15%, although it should be noted that this estimate was based on pre- (rather than post-) bronchodilator spirometric data. In addition, compared with their smoker peers without COPD, individuals with early COPD had an increased risk for acute obstructive lung disease and pneumonia hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality during follow-up. Interestingly, not only was the risk for hospitalizations largely dependent on the presence of respiratory symptoms among individuals with early COPD, but even among participants without COPD the presence of chronic respiratory symptoms was associated with an increased risk for hospitalizations. These data are in line with previous observations that chronic respiratory symptoms in individuals with normal lung function are an independent risk factor for developing airflow limitation and for having respiratory exacerbations and imaging-assessed airway disease. Taken together, the evidence from this and previous studies indicates that airflow limitation among smokers below age 50 is not an uncommon finding, highlights the substantial morbidity and mortality burden of early COPD, and identifies symptomatic individuals as a target population for early interventions.

### Managing chronic cough as a symptom in children and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^6f4ec7c8]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

GERD-related management for chronic cough without underlying lung disease — For children aged ≤ 14 years with chronic cough (> 4 weeks duration) without an underlying lung disease, we recommend that treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no GI clinical features of gastroesophageal reflux such as recurrent regurgitation, dystonic neck posturing in infants or heartburn/epigastric pain in older children (Grade 1B), and for those who have symptoms and signs or tests consistent with gastroesophageal pathology reflux, we recommend that (a) they be treated for GERD in accordance to evidence-based GERD-specific guidelines (Grade 1B) and (b) acid suppressive therapy should not be used solely for their chronic cough (Grade 1C).

### Disease progression modeling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^d06ed324]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: The decades-long progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) renders identifying different trajectories of disease progression challenging. Objectives: To identify subtypes of patients with COPD with distinct longitudinal progression patterns using a novel machine-learning tool called "Subtype and Stage Inference" (SuStaIn) and to evaluate the utility of SuStaIn for patient stratification in COPD. Methods: We applied SuStaIn to cross-sectional computed tomography imaging markers in 3,698 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 1–4 patients and 3,479 controls from the COPDGene (COPD Genetic Epidemiology) study to identify subtypes of patients with COPD. We confirmed the identified subtypes and progression patterns using ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) data. We assessed the utility of SuStaIn for patient stratification by comparing SuStaIn subtypes and stages at baseline with longitudinal follow-up data. Measurements and Main Results: We identified two trajectories of disease progression in COPD: a "Tissue→Airway" subtype (n = 2,354, 70.4%), in which small airway dysfunction and emphysema precede large airway wall abnormalities, and an "Airway→Tissue" subtype (n = 988, 29.6%), in which large airway wall abnormalities precede emphysema and small airway dysfunction. Subtypes were reproducible in ECLIPSE. Baseline stage in both subtypes correlated with future FEV₁/FVC decline (r = -0.16 [P < 0.001] in the Tissue→Airway group; r = -0.14 [P = 0.011] in the Airway→Tissue group). SuStaIn placed 30% of smokers with normal lung function at elevated stages, suggesting imaging changes consistent with early COPD. Individuals with early changes were 2.5 times more likely to meet COPD diagnostic criteria at follow-up. Conclusions: We demonstrate two distinct patterns of disease progression in COPD using SuStaIn, likely representing different endotypes. One third of healthy smokers have detectable imaging changes, suggesting a new biomarker of "early COPD".

### Lifetime burden of disease due to incident tuberculosis: a global reappraisal including post-tuberculosis sequelae [^ec3e080e]. The Lancet: Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis was estimated to cause 1.4 million deaths in 2019. Individuals who develop tuberculosis experience a range of symptoms, including fever, wasting, and cough. Although successful treatment prevents death, many tuberculosis survivors experience ongoing health problems following the disease episode, and there is increasing evidence of long-term disability and elevated mortality risks in this population.

The term post-tuberculosis describes the range of pathological conditions experienced by tuberculosis survivors. Pulmonary tuberculosis, the commonest disease presentation, causes progressive destruction of lung tissue, and this damage might not fully resolve after treatment. Although prompt treatment can minimise lung damage, many tuberculosis survivors experience residual lung pathology, with cross-sectional studies consistently demonstrating substantial pulmonary impairment — including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), spirometric restriction, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary hypertension, as well as secondary non-tuberculosis lung infections — among tuberculosis survivors. These results are consistent with longitudinal evidence comparing lung function before and after the tuberculosis episode. Individuals with chronic respiratory disease experience lower quality of life, higher health-care use, and reduced economic productivity compared with healthy individuals. Individuals with chronic respiratory disease additionally face higher all-cause mortality, even with only mild lung impairment. In addition to pulmonary damage, extrapulmonary tuberculosis disease and drug toxicity can cause permanent damage to other organ systems, as well as social and psychological sequelae.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

A growing number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have described chronic lung disease, long-term disability, and elevated mortality among individuals surviving tuberculosis disease. However, these post-tuberculosis sequelae are omitted from disease burden estimations and policy analyses that quantify the health losses caused by tuberculosis.

Added value of this study

We quantified the global burden of disease caused by incident tuberculosis in 2019, inclusive of post-tuberculosis morbidity and mortality over the lifetime of tuberculosis survivors. The results of this analysis demonstrate that post-tuberculosis burden adds considerably to the health losses caused by incident tuberculosis — globally, we estimated 122 (95% uncertainty interval 98–151) million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) due to tuberculosis occurring in 2019, with 58 (38–83) million DALYs attributed to post-tuberculosis sequelae, representing 47% (37–57) of the total burden estimate.

### Incorporating coexisting chronic illness into decisions about patient selection for lung cancer screening. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^0d77a5bf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society research statement on incorporating coexisting chronic illness into lung cancer screening (LCS) patient selection — states that LCS has potential benefits but that the impact of coexisting chronic illnesses on LCS outcomes is not well defined, and that balancing lung cancer risk, treatment-related harms, and competing causes of death is crucial; outlines objectives to summarize evidence, identify knowledge and research gaps, prioritize topics, and propose methods for research on incorporating comorbidities into LCS decisions; describes a multidisciplinary review focusing on juxtaposing lung cancer risk and competing risks of death, consideration of benefits and risks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), communication of risk, and treatment of screen-detected lung cancer; reports that gaps were identified and questions developed to guide research informing patient selection, education, and implementation; and concludes there is an urgent need for further research to guide clinical decision-making for patients who may not benefit from LCS owing to coexisting chronic illness, establishing a research framework to address incorporation and communication of comorbidity risks in LCS decisions.

### Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^e73c2543]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

CHEST guideline — chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in children: In children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease, a meta-analysis of two randomized controlled trials found no significant difference in cough resolution between any intervention for GERD and placebo (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45–2.93; P = 0.78), and proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. The panelists endorsed that treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD and that pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations; qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines.

### Randomised vitamin E supplementation and risk of chronic lung disease in the women's health study [^7664ddc7]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The oxidant/antioxidant balance in lung tissue is hypothesised to contribute to the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Observational studies consistently report higher antioxidant status associated with lower COPD risk, but few randomised studies have been reported.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of 38,597 women without chronic lung disease at baseline was conducted in the Women's Health Study (WHS) to test the effect of vitamin E on the risk of incident chronic lung disease. The WHS is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled factorial trial of vitamin E (600 IU every other day) and aspirin (100 mg every other day) in female health professionals aged ≥ 45 years. Using Cox proportional hazards models, the effect of randomised vitamin E assignment on self-reported physician-diagnosed chronic lung disease was evaluated.

Results

During 10 years of follow-up (376,710 person-years), 760 first occurrences of chronic lung disease were reported in the vitamin E arm compared with 846 in the placebo arm (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99; p = 0.029). This 10% reduction in the risk of incident chronic lung disease was not modified by cigarette smoking, age, randomised aspirin assignment, multivitamin use or dietary vitamin E intake (minimum p for interaction = 0.19). Current cigarette smoking was a strong predictor of chronic lung disease risk (HR 4.17; 95% CI 3.70 to 4.70; vs. never smokers).

Conclusions

In this large randomised trial, assignment to 600 IU vitamin E led to a 10% reduction in the risk of chronic lung disease in women.

Morbidity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — Morbidity measures traditionally include physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations; studies indicate that morbidity due to COPD increases with age, and in patients with COPD the development of comorbidities is seen at an earlier age; morbidity in COPD may also be influenced by concomitant chronic conditions related to smoking, aging and/or COPD.

### Identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from integrative omics and clustering in lung tissue [^13441b3c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and progressively worsening disease characterized by airflow limitation and unrelenting respiratory symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, and sputum production. Additionally, COPD is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for 3.17 million deaths in 2015. One of the primary difficulties in treating persons with COPD is the clinical heterogeneity of the disease. Although COPD is diagnosed using spirometry, two patients with similar lung function impairment may have vastly different clinical features. Some COPD therapies are only effective (or indicated) in patients with specific clinical features. The development of new therapies and improved prognostication in COPD may depend on the identification of specific subtypes or sub-phenotypes in COPD. Clinical clustering is one way to identify previously unrealized subtypes of COPD, and these clinically similar subtypes may be enriched for specific biologic processes, as evidenced by differential COPD genetic risk loci enrichment within clinical COPD subtypes. Clustering using omics data may lead to the description of endotypes (biologically-based subtypes) of COPD patients sharing common dysregulated pathways. Clustering of single omics, particularly with biologic and clinical constraints, such as the clustering of blood gene expression data selected based on lung function and constrained on the protein-protein interaction network via network-based stratification, is one alternative to clustering on clinical features alone.

### Military inhalational exposures outside the theater of conflict and chronic respiratory symptoms [^b5ede918]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cross-sectional study shows that military occupational exposures from heavy equipment maintenance and aircraft maintenance are associated with an increased odds of chronic respiratory symptoms that may lead to the development of chronic lung disease. Although further research is needed, consistent with the precautionary principle, our findings suggest that policy interventions to reduce certain inhalational exposures may improve the long-term respiratory health of military personnel. For individual patients, clinicians should inquire about inhalational exposures during military service as part of their assessment of risk factors for the development of chronic lung disease.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: diagnosis and management of beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease [^f71430c4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic beryllium disease (CBD) — diagnostic criteria emphasize that a diagnosis of CBD is based on confirmation of an immune response to beryllium and granulomatous lung inflammation on lung biopsy. Depending on clinical context, probable CBD can be diagnosed using combinations of clinical presentation, exposure history, evidence of BeS, radiographic findings, lung histology, BAL findings, and PFT abnormalities; when BeS is confirmed but biopsy is not done or not possible, imaging consistent with sarcoidosis or a BAL lymphocytosis can support a probable diagnosis. Certain findings such as an abnormal BeLPT or lung granulomas confer greater diagnostic certainty than nonspecific interstitial changes or pulmonary function deficits. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has specific diagnostic criteria for current or former DOE workers applying for compensation due to CBD.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^3c8f4211]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV1 (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

### Restoring the epigenetic landscape of lung microbiome: potential therapeutic approach for chronic respiratory diseases [^a54308f3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis, present significant threats to global health. Recent studies have revealed the crucial role of the lung microbiome in the development of these diseases. Pathogens have evolved complex strategies to evade the immune response, with the manipulation of host cellular epigenetic mechanisms playing a pivotal role. There is existing evidence regarding the effects of Pseudomonas on epigenetic modifications and their association with pulmonary diseases. Therefore, this study aims to directly assess the connection between Pseudomonas abundance and chronic respiratory diseases. We hope that our findings will shed light on the molecular mechanisms behind lung pathogen infections.

Methods

We analyzed data from 366 participants, including individuals with COPD, acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), bronchiectasis, and healthy individuals. Previous studies have given limited attention to the impact of Pseudomonas on these groups and their comparison with healthy individuals. Two independent datasets from different ethnic backgrounds were used for external validation. Each dataset separately analyzed bacteria at the genus level.

Results

The study reveals that Pseudomonas, a bacterium, was consistently found in high concentrations in all chronic lung disease datasets but it was present in very low abundance in the healthy datasets. This suggests that Pseudomonas may influence cellular mechanisms through epigenetics, contributing to the development and progression of chronic respiratory diseases.

Conclusions

This study emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between the lung microbiome, epigenetics, and the onset of chronic pulmonary disease. Enhanced recognition of molecular mechanisms and the impact of the microbiome on cellular functions, along with a better understanding of these concepts, can lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.

### Postnatal corticosteroids to prevent or treat chronic lung disease following preterm birth [^ee580955]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Postnatal corticosteroids (PCSs) — recommendations for chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm infants state: Routine use of PCSs cannot be recommended. The decision to use PCSs to prevent or treat CLD should be individualized and made together with the parents, and the discussions should be documented in the patient's medical record. If a decision is made to administer a PCS, a low dose provided for a short, predefined duration (eg, extubation) is recommended. If the infant does not show a clinical response to the PCS within 72 hours of initiation, continued treatment is not recommended. High-dose PCSs are not recommended to prevent or treat CLD in preterm infants.

COPD as part of multi-morbidity should be recognized since an increasing number of people in any aging population will suffer from multi-morbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions, and COPD is present in most multi-morbid patients; multi-morbid patients have symptoms from multiple diseases and thus symptoms and signs are complex and most often attributable to several causes in the chronic state as well as during acute events; there is no evidence that COPD should be treated differently when part of multi-morbidity, but it should be kept in mind that most evidence comes from trials in people with COPD as the only significant disease; treatments should be kept simple in the light of the unbearable polypharmacy that these patients are often exposed to.

Results

Section 1: The PANACEA Framework for Multidimensional Evaluation of Home-based Monitoring in Chronic Lung Disease

The PANACEA framework consists of seven domains with a total of 7 essential and 21 desirable items (Figure 2 and Table 1). The domains are test performance, disease management, cost, patient experience, clinician experience, researcher experience, and access. Each domain includes one or more items that could be used to evaluate the device for remote monitoring. The domains and items are categorized as essential when they are strongly recommended across all settings, or desirable when they are suggested depending on local resources and the purpose of testing.

### Transforming growth factor-beta signaling across ages: from distorted lung development to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^beff9469]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2009). Low credibility.

The transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of secreted growth factors consists of more than 40 members, including the TGF-beta isoforms themselves, bone morphogenetic proteins, and activins. Most of these factors have been shown to be essential for proper organ development, a process often recapitulated in chronic diseases. Importantly, TGF-beta superfamily members are key regulators of extracellular matrix composition and alveolar epithelial cell and fibroblast function in the lung. Both during lung development and disease, TGF-betas therefore control lung homeostasis by providing the structural requirements and functional micromilieu needed for physiological epithelial cell function and proper gas exchange. Prolonged alterations of TGF-beta signaling have been shown to result in structural changes in the lung that compromise gas exchange and lung function, as seen in arrested lung development, a feature of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, lung fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All these syndromes share a loss of functional alveolar structures, which ultimately leads to a decreased life expectancy. In this review, we cover our current understanding of the impact of TGF-beta signaling on chronic lung disease. We focus on distorted TGF-beta signaling in bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as prototype diseases of the premature and matured lung, respectively, which are both characterized by functional and structural loss of alveolar units.

### Postnatal corticosteroids to prevent or treat chronic lung disease following preterm birth [^9bded307]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hydrocortisone (HC) for prevention of chronic lung disease (CLD): The 2010 AAP policy statement found data insufficient to recommend HC to prevent CLD but noted evidence suggesting HC in the first 2 weeks of life might increase survival without CLD, and subsequent trials included two small feasibility studies in ELGANs with low blood pressure and the PREMILOC multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) of low-dose HC for the first 10 postnatal days, which reported increased survival without CLD at 36 weeks' gestation (60% vs 51%; RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.59; P = 0.04) but, in infants 24 to 25 weeks, a higher rate of late-onset sepsis in the HC group (40% vs 23%; RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.70; P = 0.02), with mortality not significantly different; incorporating these studies, a 2017 Cochrane meta-analysis showed a small but statistically significant increase in survival without CLD at 36 weeks' gestation (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99), similar to trials using DEX (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92), and a predefined secondary analysis found no predictive value of baseline cortisol for CLD while high early cortisol was associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage and spontaneous intestinal perforation in HC-treated infants; additionally, a separate meta-analysis of 4 RCTs testing HC for prophylaxis against relative adrenal insufficiency analyzed individual patient data from 982 infants.

### Uptake of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in relation to preexisting chronic conditions in the European countries [^04e80457]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the association between vaccination and the preexisting chronic conditions, we found that participants with high blood pressure, chronic bronchitis and chronic lung disease were less likely to report taking COVID-19 vaccine. In contrast, participants with high blood cholesterol were more likely to report taking the COVID-19 vaccine than participants without those conditions. The likelihood of taking influenza vaccine was also lower among participants with high blood pressure, but lower among those with high blood cholesterol, chronic bronchitis and asthma. Of the six preexisting conditions, only high blood pressure and chronic lung disease were found be consistently associated with lower likelihood of taking both of the vaccines. However, with regard to the likelihood of taking both of the vaccines, only high blood pressure was found to be inversely associated but not chronic lung disease. In the sex-stratified models, the likelihood of not taking each of the vaccine was relatively lower among diabetic and hypertensive women compared to their male counterparts. In short, the current findings reveal a dissimilar vaccination pattern among individuals in different disease groups, with high blood pressure and chronic lung disease showing a consistently negative association with the uptake of both of the vaccines. The underlying mechanism behind this difference is hard to decode from the current analysis, and therefore offers opportunities for further research. Vaccines are an important tool in preventing disease and promoting public health, yet the present analysis uncovers notable disparities in the rates of vaccination among countries, and between men and women in the EU. Vaccination is particularly important for protecting vulnerable populations living with chronic diseases, and understanding why some disease groups may be less vaccinated than others can help public health programs to better target preventive measures.

### Prevalence and mechanisms of mucus accumulation in COVID-19 lung disease [^83e0a08c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The principal lower respiratory features of severe phase COVID-19 include dry cough, pneumonia, and hypoxemia. Although there are case reports suggesting airway mucus hypersecretion is also a feature of COVID-19, there are no comprehensive datasets describing the time course and sites of mucus hypersecretion/accumulation or mechanisms that trigger mucin hypersecretion in COVID-19 lungs.

Studies of proximal airway epithelia in COVID-19 autopsy lungs by RNA-ISH detected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA coding for the spike protein in airway epithelia in acute phase disease but not in subacute to chronic phase disease (Figure 2E), consistent with patterns from other COVID-19 autopsy studies. Goblet cell metaplasia, characterized by MUC5B -dominated and more variable MUC5AC mucin expression, was observed in chronic phase COVID-19 tracheobronchial samples, consistent with previous reports of proximal airway mucin induction and endotracheal tube mucus obstruction in subjects with COVID-19 with prolonged ICU stays.

### Identifying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from integrative omics and clustering in lung tissue [^78375c59]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite these limitations, our study again illustrates that spirometry-defined COPD is clinically heterogenous. Gene expression and DNA methylation reflect active molecular processes in the lung. A substantial portion of COPD cases may have reduced maximal lung function early in life with normal lung function decline over time. Gene expression in these participants with reduced lung growth and normal decline may be more like gene expression in participants with normal spirometry than like participants with active disease contributing to rapid lung function decline. Our findings of clusters enriched for inflammatory signatures further emphasizes the role of differential activation of these pathways in former smokers, some of whom develop COPD.

The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

General contraindications — Lung transplantation remains a complex therapy with a significant risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality; therefore, the overall sum of contraindications and comorbidities must be considered. Absolute contraindications include malignancy in the last 2 years (except cutaneous squamous and basal cell tumors), for which a 5-year disease-free interval is prudent; untreatable advanced dysfunction of another major organ system, with coronary artery disease not amenable to percutaneous intervention or bypass grafting or with significant impairment of left ventricular function being an absolute contraindication to lung transplantation, although heart-lung transplantation could be considered in highly selected cases; non-curable chronic extrapulmonary infection including chronic active viral hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus; significant chest wall/spinal deformity; documented nonadherence or inability to follow through with medical therapy or office follow-up; untreatable psychiatric or psychologic conditions that impair cooperation with therapy; absence of a consistent or reliable social support system; and substance addiction that is active or within the last 6 months. Relative contraindications include age older than 65 years.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^af87d860]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Kidney transplant candidates — pulmonary disease exclusion criteria and specialist involvement state that candidates with underlying pulmonary disease should be assessed and evaluated in collaboration with a pulmonary specialist, and given the poor prognosis, patients with the following conditions should not be candidates for kidney transplantation: lung disease requiring home oxygen therapy; uncontrolled asthma; irreversible moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension; and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis or restrictive disease. Consistent with this, we recommend excluding patients with severe irreversible obstructive or restrictive lung disease from kidney transplantation (1C). Patients with underlying bronchiectasis and previously treated pulmonary TB may need additional pulmonary assessments for consideration of impact of long-term immunosuppression on these diseases.

### Chronic lung disease in adolescents with delayed diagnosis of vertically acquired HIV infection [^1c6534b8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term survivors of vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are reaching adolescence in large numbers in Africa and are at high risk of delayed diagnosis and chronic complications of untreated HIV infection. Chronic respiratory symptoms are more common than would be anticipated based on the HIV literature.

Methods

Consecutive adolescents with presumed vertically acquired HIV attending 2 HIV care clinics in Harare, Zimbabwe, were recruited and assessed with clinical history and examination, CD4 count, pulmonary function tests, Doppler echocardiography, and chest radiography (CXR). Those with suspected nontuberculous chronic lung disease (CLD) were scanned using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).

Results

Of 116 participants (43% male; mean age, 14 ± 2.6 years, mean age at HIV diagnosis, 12 years), 69% were receiving antiretroviral therapy. Chronic cough and reduced exercise tolerance were reported by 66% and 21% of participants, respectively; 41% reported multiple respiratory tract infections in the previous year, and 10% were clubbed. More than 40% had hypoxemia at rest (13%) or on exercise (29%), with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25 mm Hg) in 7%. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) was < 80% predicted in 45%, and 47% had subtle CXR abnormalities. The predominant HRCT pattern was decreased attenuation as part of a mosaic attenuation pattern (31 of 56 [55%]), consistent with small airway disease and associated with bronchiectasis (Spearman correlation coefficient (r² = 0.8) and reduced FEV₁ (r² = -0.26).

Conclusions

Long-term survivors of vertically acquired HIV in Africa are at high risk of a previously undescribed small airway disease, with > 40% of unselected adolescent clinic attendees meeting criteria for severe hypoxic CLD. This condition is not obvious at rest. Etiology, prognosis, and response to treatment are currently unknown.

### Type-2 inflammation and lung function decline in chronic airway disease in the general population [^e819399e]. Thorax (2024). Medium credibility.

Strengths of this study include a large-scale population-based cohort with randomly selected individuals who were followed for a sufficiently long time in order to estimate lung function decline.

Yet, our study also has some potential limitations. Although we could distinguish between different types of chronic airway disease, our definitions may be subject to discussion. We had data to differentiate between reversible and irreversible airflow limitation in many of the participants, yet asthma and COPD are complex diseases that may be difficult to define as many patients show similar clinical presentation and have common risk factors. We relied on self-reported asthma and in the absence of supporting physiology, we cannot be certain that a sizeable number of these individuals do not have asthma. A potential limitation is that more than one-third of individuals with pre-bronchodilator airflow limitation were not willing to perform reversibility test. We assigned them to a category of not classifiable airflow limitation. These individuals could have COPD or asthma. Clinicians often encounter patients with airflow limitations that are difficult to label and must proceed with empiric therapy, which sometimes can lead to a more specific diagnosis. We believe that our findings that individuals with not classifiable airflow limitation also displayed accelerated lung function decline in the presence of type-2 inflammation could be seen as supportive of the concept of treatable clinical or physiological traits rather than the concept of pursuing a diagnostic label.

### Complexity in clinical diagnoses of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^bfa577f7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost. The 2022 GOLD guidelines define AECOPD as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. However, it is increasingly recognized that AECOPD is heterogenous. Exacerbations have a range of underlying etiologies and clinicopathological processes manifesting with similar syndromic phenotypes, each of which could have different prognosis and response to therapy. A diagnosis of AECOPD relies on subjective symptoms, and non-specific clinical features, which can be confounded by several associated comorbidities that are highly prevalent in the COPD population. It is not uncommon that COPD patients presenting with dyspnea receive a diagnosis of AECOPD, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure all in one setting. This ambiguity leads to a broad, complex, and potentially unnecessary treatment regimen.

We aimed to identify clinical, radiographic, and laboratory characteristics that might help distinguish AECOPD from symptoms secondary to another dominant disease in patients with a history of COPD.

### Treatment of tobacco use in lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^ebc09126]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Tobacco dependence management — prescribing, counseling, and chronic care approach includes that "pharmacotherapy recommendations should be accompanied by a written prescription in all cases", and "patients should still be referred to a specialized tobacco treatment service, or to their state quit line, to augment the effectiveness of the prescribed medication". Coverage details note that "Coverage for these treatments may require prior authorization or, in some cases, certification that the patient is receiving counseling". Consistent with a chronic disease model, "Tobacco dependence is a disease that requires repeated intervention over time", and for individuals "currently unwilling to make a quit attempt, or in those expressing a desire to proceed unassisted, the focus should be on motivational maneuvers that may increase the likelihood of future quit attempts, including nicotine sampling, patch pretreatment, and extended varenicline treatment prior to quit day". The page also emphasizes that "The highest quit rates are achieved by combining pharmacotherapy with counseling".

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^91e3af19]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to routine immunizations, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to offer the following routine immunizations in patients with stable COPD:

- annual influenza vaccination

- SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to WHO and CDC updated recommendations

- either one dose of PCV21 or one dose of PCV20, as recommended by the CDC, to reduce the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia and COPD exacerbations

- RSV vaccination in patients aged ≥ 60 years and/or with chronic heart or lung disease, as recommended by the CDC

- dTaP/dTPa vaccination to protect against pertussis in patients who were not vaccinated in adolescence, as recommended by the CDC

- zoster vaccine to protect against shingles in patients aged > 50 years, as recommended by the CDC.

Figure 6
Capillaritis in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. (A) The presence of capillaritis is one of the few medical emergencies in pulmonary pathology. Capillaritis is distinctive but can be quite focal in the biopsy specimen. Here a "pseudo-bronchopneumonia" pattern is present, with shed neutrophils filling alveolar spaces. (B) Here the neutrophils are still within the alveolar walls. (A, B) H&E stain; (A) 40× original magnification; (B) 400× original magnification.

Serological studies are essential in documenting an immunological mechanism and providing information on the presence of a specific haemorrhage syndrome (eg, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies). We do not perform tissue immunofluorescence studies routinely in biopsy material, mainly because the serological data are more consistent, quite reliable, and preferred for treatment selection by many clinical experts today. Sometimes the pigmented alveolar macrophages of smokers can simulate the siderophages of pulmonary haemorrhage. The fine granularity of the brown pigment in these cells and the consistent presence of dot-like black pigment particles in the cytoplasm helps in their proper identification.

1e: acute lung injury with background fibrosis (acute on chronic disease)

Acute lung injury can occur as a natural escalation of an underlying chronic lung disease, such as acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Alternatively, a patient may have a stable chronic lung disease on which community-acquired pneumonia or drug toxicity is now superimposed. I refer to this combination of histopathology as "acute on chronic lung disease" and always append a comment regarding the diagnostic possibilities in this scenario (one disease versus two or more).

### Involvement of endothelial apoptosis underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-like phenotype in adiponectin-null mice: implications for therapy [^ae4dff0f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is frequently complicated with comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and body weight loss, but the causal link remains unclear.

Objectives

To investigate the role of adiponectin in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and its potential use in therapy.

Methods

Adiponectin localization and dynamics in the lung were analyzed in an elastase-induced emphysema model. Next, the lung of adiponectin-knockout mice, extrapulmonary effects, and the underlying mechanism were investigated. Finally, we tested whether exogenous adiponectin could ameliorate the emphysematous change in adiponectin-knockout mice.

Measurements and Main Results

Adiponectin expression in lung vasculature and plasma concentration of adiponectin were reduced after elastase-instillation. Notably, adiponectin-knockout mice showed progressive alveolar enlargement and increased lung compliance. They further exhibited not only systemic inflammation, but also extrapulmonary phenotype, such as body weight loss, fat atrophy, and osteoporosis. Moreover, endothelial apoptosis was enhanced in the lungs of adiponectin-knockout mice, as evidenced by caspase-3 activity. Consistent with this, expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells were decreased in the adiponectin-knockout mice. Finally, adenovirus-mediated adiponectin supplementation ameliorated the emphysematous phenotype.

Conclusions

Adiponectin-knockout mice develop progressive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-like phenotype with systemic inflammation and extrapulmonary phenotypes. Hypoadiponectinemia could thus play a critical role in the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and concomitant comorbidities through endothelial dysfunction. Together, adiponectin could be a novel target for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy.

### Pulmonary sarcoid-like granulomatous disease in an 11-month-old girl [^0ac3779e]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology. It is extremely rare in children, especially the early onset form, presenting with eye, skin and joint symptoms but no lung involvement. We report an 11-month-old girl with granulomatous disease restricted to the lungs consistent with sarcoidosis. This unusual presentation has never been described in the paediatric literature so far.

### Postnatal corticosteroids to prevent or treat chronic lung disease following preterm birth [^2be94bb8]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy on postnatal corticosteroids — position updates and high-risk subgroup: In 2002 the AAP concluded that routine use of dexamethasone (DEX) could not be recommended, and after this the use of postnatal corticosteroids (PCSs) declined with an associated increase in the incidence and severity of chronic lung disease (CLD); in 2010 the AAP continued not to recommend routine PCS use and noted that infants at higher risk of CLD (birth weight < 1500 g and who remained on mechanical ventilation beyond 1 week of age) could benefit from a short course, with most reviewed studies administering a tapering course for 7 to 14 days, and emphasized clinician judgment and shared decision-making with parents.

### Postnatal corticosteroids to prevent or treat chronic lung disease following preterm birth [^965828db]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

A complex interplay of factors — Although cumulative data suggest that PCSs may increase survival without CLD among ELGANs, the interaction of various factors in determining the risk and benefit profile has made it difficult to determine the optimal approach, and type, dose, route, and duration of PCSs all seem to be important modulators of response and the risk of both short-term and long-term adverse effects.
