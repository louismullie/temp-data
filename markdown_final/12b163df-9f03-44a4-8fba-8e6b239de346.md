## Question

Conjunctivitis treatment for kids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for conjunctivitis in children. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology in children. Then, I should verify how to differentiate bacterial from viral etiologies. Next, I will review the evidence for topical antibiotics versus supportive care, including delayed prescribing. After that, I need to consider special populations and stewardship. Finally, I will synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations and a decision pathway, making sure I double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and burden. Conjunctivitis is common in children, with estimates around 1 in 8 school-aged children affected annually, and it drives substantial primary care and urgent care utilization, parental work loss, and school absenteeism, which together create a large societal cost burden even though permanent visual loss is rare [^111nRExV] [^115fsC6p]. Hold on, I should verify the etiologic distribution in pediatrics: unlike adults, where viral disease predominates, children more often have bacterial conjunctivitis, with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae leading, and Moraxella catarrhalis also common, which supports a higher pretest probability of bacterial disease in this age group [^114Gxx2a] [^112Hw1t1] [^112ByJSW].

> Next, I should review how to differentiate bacterial from viral conjunctivitis at the bedside. Wait, let me verify the discriminators: mucopurulent discharge with eyelids matted or glued on waking, absence of itching, and concurrent otitis media increase the likelihood of bacterial disease, whereas watery discharge, itching, preauricular nodes, and recent upper respiratory symptoms favor viral etiology. However, no single sign is definitive, and misclassification is common, so I need to be cautious about overcalling bacterial disease based on discharge alone [^115mqPVn] [^112ByJSW] [^114ZswsT]. I should double-check that the presence of mucopurulent discharge has only a modest positive likelihood ratio, reinforcing the need to integrate history and exam rather than rely on a single feature [^112ByJSW].

> Now, I will examine the evidence for topical antibiotics in children. The most recent pediatric RCT showed moxifloxacin shortened time to clinical cure versus no treatment (about 3.8 vs 5.7 days), but wait, I initially thought it also beat placebo; hold on, I should verify that detail — on re-reading, moxifloxacin did not significantly outperform placebo, suggesting a meaningful washout or lubrication effect from placebo drops themselves, which is a key nuance for counseling and expectation setting [^116NpHJ8] [^114fa6yD]. Let me consider the meta-analysis: pooled pediatric data show fewer children remain symptomatic on days 3–6 with antibiotics versus placebo, indicating modest early clinical benefit, though absolute differences attenuate by days 6–10 as many cases resolve spontaneously, which aligns with broader Cochrane findings of early but modest benefits of antibiotics over placebo in acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^1177nUqX] [^116vUc9B]. But wait, what if antibiotics don't help at all in some settings? The large Lancet pediatric trial found no significant difference between chloramphenicol and placebo at day 7, reminding me that effect sizes are small and context matters, including the composition of placebo and patient selection [^111UTuzu].

> I need to ensure I weigh benefits against harms and stewardship. Benefits include faster symptom resolution and potentially reduced transmission, while harms include local irritation, rare systemic effects, cost, and, more importantly, contribution to antimicrobial resistance. Given high rates of overtreatment and misdiagnosis, guidelines emphasize avoiding indiscriminate antibiotics and tailoring use to likely bacterial cases or to situations where faster recovery is prioritized [^114aP5sv] [^1112KZBq] [^117E7fSP]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of overuse: observational and modeling studies suggest roughly 80% of conjunctivitis encounters receive antibiotics despite many being viral or self-limited, underscoring the need for stewardship and shared decision-making with families [^117E7fSP] [^115KBDLm].

> Let me consider delayed prescribing as a pragmatic middle ground. Delayed antibiotic strategies reduce antibiotic consumption by about half without worsening symptom control or increasing complications, and they align with family preferences when the self-limited nature is explained; this approach is particularly useful when the diagnosis is uncertain or when school policies pressure early treatment, and it is supported by RCTs and primary care guidance [^113JyVu3] [^115WeUv1]. I should confirm that delayed prescribing is endorsed in contemporary family medicine guidance for pediatric bacterial conjunctivitis, which it is, reinforcing its role in routine practice [^115WeUv1].

> Next, I should review special populations and high-risk scenarios. For neonates and infants under 2 months, I need to ensure urgent ophthalmology referral and systemic evaluation because of risks like gonococcal or chlamydial infection and potential for systemic involvement. Gonococcal disease requires immediate systemic therapy and topical coverage if cornea is involved, while chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum needs systemic macrolide therapy and careful follow-up given recurrence and nasopharyngeal carriage risks [^111ZZNqp] [^114gBPaB] [^1124hbVt]. For hyperacute conjunctivitis with copious purulent discharge, I should suspect Neisseria gonorrhoeae and treat emergently with systemic ceftriaxone and local care to prevent corneal compromise, with partner management and consideration of abuse in children [^114gBPaB] [^113WmGbR]. For immunocompromised hosts or severe disease with pain, vision changes, or corneal involvement, I should escalate evaluation and consider cultures and broader therapy rather than routine empiric drops alone [^113ttBcu] [^117Pgase].

> I will now examine antibiotic selection and dosing practicality. Wait, I should confirm guideline direction here: there is no proven superiority among topical antibiotics for routine pediatric bacterial conjunctivitis, so the most convenient, least expensive, or locally available option is reasonable; typical choices include trimethoprim-polymyxin B, aminoglycosides, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones, with short 5–7 day courses generally sufficient, and azithromycin 1.5% twice daily for 3 days offering comparable efficacy with improved convenience in pediatric trials, which may aid adherence [^112ZYxCy] [^111aQkt2]. I should double-check that moxifloxacin's pediatric data support short-course efficacy as well, which FDA summaries corroborate for clinical cure by days 5–6 in mixed-age populations, though microbiologic eradication does not always map to clinical outcomes, so I should avoid overinterpreting culture clearance as clinical success [^1112jod9] [^113XthBs].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. For mild, nonpurulent conjunctivitis with watery discharge and itching, I should favor supportive care and avoid antibiotics, emphasizing hygiene and return precautions. For moderate mucopurulent discharge with classic bacterial features or concurrent otitis, I can offer either immediate topical antibiotics or a delayed prescription after counseling. For severe hyperacute disease, marked pain, vision change, or systemic symptoms, I should refer urgently and treat presumptively for gonococcus or other serious infection. And for neonates or infants under 2 months, I should not delay ophthalmology referral and systemic evaluation, given the risk of STI-related etiologies and systemic complications [^114ZswsT] [^114aP5sv] [^111ZZNqp]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with AAO and AAFP guidance, which it does, and I should document shared decision-making when using delayed prescribing to align with family preferences and school realities [^114aP5sv] [^115WeUv1].

> But wait, what about school and childcare return policies driving overtreatment? I need to ensure I address this explicitly. Many programs exclude children until antibiotics are started, which pressures clinicians to prescribe; however, modeling suggests that allowing children without systemic symptoms to attend and avoiding routine antibiotics can substantially reduce costs and antibiotic use without meaningful quality-of-life loss, supporting advocacy for policy alignment with evidence-based care and the use of delayed prescriptions when families anticipate school barriers [^111nRExV] [^1171pBaT]. Hold on, I should verify that primary care guidance acknowledges this barrier and supports delayed strategies, which it does, reinforcing the need to counsel families and, when necessary, provide a safety-net delayed script [^115WeUv1].

> Finally, I should double-check supportive care elements and follow-up. For viral or mild bacterial cases, artificial tears, cold compresses, and strict hygiene reduce discomfort and transmission. For allergic conjunctivitis, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are first-line, with consideration of allergen immunotherapy in persistent cases, particularly in children. And for any case not improving within 48–72 hours or worsening, I should reassess for alternate diagnoses, consider cultures in recurrent or atypical disease, and refer to ophthalmology as indicated [^114ZswsT] [^113QTJnB] [^117Pgase]. I need to ensure I also remind families that adenoviral conjunctivitis is contagious for 10–14 days and reinforce hand hygiene and avoidance of close contact during that period to limit spread, which is consistent with AAO infection control guidance [^116ReYNy].

---

For pediatric conjunctivitis, **supportive care is first-line** [^114ZswsT] for mild cases, including warm compresses, artificial tears, and strict hygiene to reduce transmission [^116ReYNy]. Topical antibiotics are indicated for **moderate-to-severe bacterial disease** [^1177nUqX] or if symptoms persist beyond 3–5 days; a 5–7 day course of a broad-spectrum agent (e.g. trimethoprim-polymyxin B, aminoglycoside, or fluoroquinolone) is appropriate, with azithromycin 1.5% twice daily for 3 days as a convenient alternative [^111aQkt2]. Avoid **routine antibiotics for viral conjunctivitis** [^114aP5sv]; use antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizers for allergic cases [^115mqPVn] and refer urgently for neonatal conjunctivitis, severe pain, vision changes, or immunocompromise [^114ZswsT]. Educate families on hygiene and return-to-school policies to limit spread and unnecessary antibiotic use [^111nRExV].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis guides therapy; **history and examination** should distinguish bacterial, viral, allergic, and other causes [^112ByJSW]. Key features include:

- **Bacterial conjunctivitis**: mucopurulent discharge, eyelid matting, mild irritation, often unilateral initially [^111SPWAS].
- **Viral conjunctivitis**: watery discharge, bilateral involvement, concurrent URI symptoms, preauricular nodes [^112ByJSW].
- **Allergic conjunctivitis**: intense itching, watery discharge, bilateral, seasonal/atopic history [^114ZswsT].

Testing is generally unnecessary; reserve cultures for severe, recurrent, or unresponsive cases [^117Pgase].

---

## General supportive care

Supportive care is foundational for all types and helps **symptoms and transmission**:

- **Warm compresses**: Apply to closed lids to soften crusts and relieve discomfort [^114Gxx2a].
- **Artificial tears**: Lubricate and soothe irritation; preservative-free preferred [^116UHwaU].
- **Hygiene measures**: Frequent handwashing, avoid eye rubbing, separate towels, no contact lenses during infection [^111YPUq8].

---

## Pharmacological treatment by etiology

### Bacterial conjunctivitis

- **Mild cases**: Often self-limited; consider delayed prescribing or observation [^111UTuzu] [^115WeUv1].
- **Moderate-to-severe or persistent (> 3–5 days)**: Topical antibiotics shorten symptoms and reduce transmission [^1177nUqX] [^116vUc9B].

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage regimen** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Trimethoprim-polymyxin B | 1–2 drops every 4–6 hours for 5–7 days | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Well tolerated |
| Aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin) | 1–2 drops every 4–6 hours for 5–7 days | - Effective against common pathogens <br/> - Monitor for local irritation |
| Fluoroquinolones (e.g. moxifloxacin) | 1–2 drops every 6–8 hours for 5–7 days | - Reserved for severe or refractory cases due to resistance concerns |

---

Azithromycin 1.5% ophthalmic solution is a **short-course option** (twice daily for 3 days) with comparable efficacy and improved adherence [^111aQkt2].

---

### Viral conjunctivitis

Viral conjunctivitis is **self-limited**; **no antibiotics are indicated** [^114aP5sv]. Management is supportive — artificial tears, cold compresses, and strict hygiene — and symptoms typically resolve in 7–14 days [^116UHwaU].

---

### Allergic conjunctivitis

Treatment focuses on **symptom control** and allergen avoidance:

- **Topical antihistamines**: Olopatadine, ketotifen, or azelastine reduce itching and tearing [^notfound].
- **Mast cell stabilizers**: Cromolyn or nedocromil for chronic or seasonal cases [^notfound].
- **Short-course topical corticosteroids**: For severe flares only, with close follow-up [^116UHwaU].

---

## Special considerations

- **Neonatal conjunctivitis**: Hospital evaluation and systemic therapy are mandatory; treat gonococcal disease with ceftriaxone and chlamydial disease with oral macrolides [^111YPUq8] [^1124hbVt].
- **Immunocompromised children**: Lower threshold for antibiotics and urgent ophthalmology referral [^114ZswsT].
- **Contact lens wearers**: Discontinue lenses until infection clears; consider Pseudomonas coverage if severe [^116UHwaU].

---

## Prevention of transmission

Education on hygiene and return-to-school policies reduces spread; **most children can return** to school or childcare once they are clinically improving and can maintain hygiene, even if discharge persists, unless policies require otherwise [^111YPUq8] [^116ReYNy].

---

## Follow-up and referral

Routine follow-up is unnecessary for mild cases; **refer to ophthalmology** for:

- **Severe pain, vision changes, or corneal involvement** [^113ttBcu].
- **No improvement after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy** [^notfound].
- **Neonatal conjunctivitis or immunocompromised patients** [^114ZswsT].

---

Pediatric conjunctivitis management is **primarily supportive**, with antibiotics reserved for moderate-to-severe bacterial cases or when symptoms persist. Accurate diagnosis, hygiene, and targeted therapy optimize outcomes and limit unnecessary antibiotic use [^114aP5sv].

### Characterization of polybacterial versus monobacterial conjunctivitis infections in pediatric subjects across multiple studies and microbiological outcomes with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6 [^115gY1pB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The choice of empiric therapy for bacterial conjunctivitis should be guided by an awareness of typical causative pathogen distributions. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be polybacterial, although pediatric-specific data are lacking.

Methods

This was a post-hoc analysis of data in pediatric subjects (1–17 years) from five bacterial conjunctivitis trials evaluating besifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.6%.

Results

Of the 730 pediatric subjects with culture-confirmed conjunctivitis, nearly one-fourth (23.6%) had polybacterial infections and three-fourths (76.4%) had monobacterial infections at baseline. In both polybacterial and monobacterial infections, the most prevalent organisms were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mitis /S. mitis group. In polybacterial versus monobacterial infections, S. mitis /S. mitis group (8.7% vs 4.3%; P = 0.032) and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.7% vs 0.5%; P < 0.001) were identified more frequently, whereas S. pneumoniae (14.0% vs 28.1%; P < 0.001) was identified less frequently, as the dominant infecting species. MICs for individual species were similar for tested antibiotics regardless of polybacterial or monobacterial infection, except Staphylococcus epidermidis for which fluoroquinolone MICs were ≥ 3 dilutions higher for isolates of this species sourced from polybacterial compared to monobacterial infections. Treatment with besifloxacin resulted in microbial eradication in 79.1% of polybacterial and 92.3% of monobacterial infections (P ≤ 0.005 vs vehicle).

Discussion

One in four pediatric bacterial conjunctivitis infections is polybacterial, highlighting the need for a broad-spectrum antibiotic when choosing empiric therapy.

### Clinical features of bacterial conjunctivitis in children [^116Zw2zC]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Conjunctivitis is a common cause of primary care and emergency department (ED) visits. There is a paucity of data in recent literature on the prevalence of pediatric bacterial conjunctivitis, and there are no evidence-based clinical guidelines for empirical treatment. The study objective was to describe clinical features most predictive of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a prospective study in a children's hospital ED. Conjunctival swabs for bacterial culture were obtained from patients aged 1 month to 18 years presenting with red or pink eye and/or the diagnosis of conjunctivitis.

Results

A total of 111 patients were enrolled over one year. Patients had a mean (± SD) age of 33.2 (± 37.5) months, and 55% were male. Eighty-seven patients (78%) had positive bacterial cultures. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae accounted for 82% (71/87), Streptococcus pneumoniae for 16% (14/87), and Staphylococcus aureus for 2.2% (2/87). Five clinical variables were significantly associated with a positive bacterial culture. Regression analysis revealed that the combination of a history of gluey or sticky eyelids and the physical finding of mucoid or purulent discharge had a posttest probability of 96% (95% confidence interval = 90% to 99%). Subjective scoring by physicians for a positive culture was 50.6%.

Conclusions

Conjunctivitis in children is predominantly bacterial, with nontypeable H. influenzae being the most common organism. A history of gluey or sticky eyelids and physical findings of mucoid or purulent discharge are highly predictive of bacterial infection. Based on the above data, empirical ophthalmic antibiotic therapy may be appropriate in children presenting with conjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117YHkXb]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Allergic conjunctivitis prevention — protective measures and immunotherapy note that individuals can protect against some chemical and toxin exposures by using adequate eye protection, contact lens wearers can be instructed in appropriate lens care and frequent lens replacement to reduce the risk or severity of giant papillary conjunctivitis, allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis and is more so in children than adults, both subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy have been found to reduce symptoms and medication requirements in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and a multidisciplinary approach with pediatricians, internists, and allergists is essential in managing ocular hypersensitivity disorders.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^116W8CtG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Dupilumab blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin ‐4 and‐13. It is approved in the U.S. A. for patients aged ≥ 12 years with moderate‐to‐severeuncontrolled by topical prescription medicines or who cannot use topical medicines, for patients in Japan whoseis uncontrolled with existing therapies, for patients with moderate‐to‐severein Europe who are candidates for systemic therapy and for patients aged ≥ 12 years for maintenance treatment of moderate‐to‐severe asthma uncontrolled with their current medicines.trials have reported increased incidence of conjunctivitis for dupilumab vs. placebo.

Objectives

To characterize further the occurrence and risk factors of conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials.

Methods

We evaluated randomized placebo‐controlled trials of dupilumab in(n = 2629), asthma (n = 2876), chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (w) (n = 60) and eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) (n = 47).

Results

In mosttrials, dupilumab‐treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than placebo controls. Higher baselineseverity and previous history of conjunctivitis were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence. Conjunctivitis was mostly mild to moderate. Most cases recovered or resolved during the treatment period; two patients permanently discontinued dupilumab due to conjunctivitis or keratitis. Common treatments included ophthalmic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Most cases were diagnosed by the investigators. In asthma andwtrials, the incidence of conjunctivitis was lower for both dupilumab and placebo than intrials; dupilumab did not increase the incidence compared with placebo. In the EoE trial, no patients had conjunctivitis.

Conclusions

Conjunctivitis was more frequent with dupilumab treatment in mosttrials. In dupilumab trials in other type 2 diseases, incidence of conjunctivitis was overall very low, and was similar for dupilumab and placebo. In, the incidence of conjunctivitis was associated withseverity and prior history of conjunctivitis. The aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab‐treated patients require further study.

What's already known about this topic?

Ocular disorders, including allergic conjunctivitis, are common in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD).
In most dupilumab AD trials, dupilumab‐treated patients had higher conjunctivitis incidence than those receiving placebo.
Most cases were mild to moderate and recovered or were recovering during study treatment; study treatment discontinuation due to conjunctivitis was rare.
Conjunctivitis incidence was very low and similar for dupilumab and placebo in clinical trials in asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic oesophagitis.

What does this study add?

This analysis confirms and extends the results of the individual clinical trials.
Baseline disease‐related factors, including AD severity, prior conjunctivitis history and certain biomarkers (thymus and activation‐regulated chemokine, IgE, eosinophils), were associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis.
Patients who responded well to dupilumab had reduced incidence of conjunctivitis.
Further study is needed to elucidate the aetiology and treatment of conjunctivitis in dupilumab‐treated patients with AD.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^113uMPWa]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern — conjunctivitis is an inflammation that affects the conjunctiva primarily. The patient population includes individuals of all ages who present with symptoms and signs suggestive of conjunctivitis, such as red eye or discharge. Clinical objectives are to establish the diagnosis of conjunctivitis, differentiating it from other causes of red eye; identify the cause(s) of conjunctivitis; establish appropriate therapy; relieve discomfort and pain; prevent complications; prevent the spread of communicable diseases; and educate and engage both the patient and the referring healthcare providers on conjunctivitis management.

### Moxifloxacin ophthalmic (moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution) [^111zweGP]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter, controlled clinical trials in which patients were dosed 3 times a day for 4 days, moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution produced clinical cures on Day 5 to 6 in 66% to 69% of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis. Microbiological success rates for the eradication of baseline pathogens ranged from 84% to 94%.

In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis between birth and 31 days of age, patients were dosed with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution or another anti-infective agent. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80% at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 92% at Day 9.

Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114FCLg3]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this RCT, use of topical antibiotics reduced the time to clinical cure, and in the meta-analysis of combined data from the present trial and previous RCTs, the use of topical antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of children who had symptoms of conjunctivitis on days 3 to 6 compared with those receiving a placebo. The present RCT results also suggest that lubricating eye drops may have some benefits for the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in children.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^111aQkt2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of azithromycin 1.5% versus tobramycin 0.3% eyedrops on clinical ocular signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis in children and to assess the parents' satisfaction regarding the dosing regimen.

Patients and methods

An international, multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked, controlled clinical trial conducted in children (1 day to 18 years old) with bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and purulent discharge. Azithromycin 1.5% was administered as 1 drop twice daily for 3 days, and tobramycin 0.3% as 1 drop every 2 hours for 2 days, then 4 times daily for 5 days.

Results

A total of 286 patients (mean age: 3.2 years) were enrolled. In children with bacteriologically positive cultures (N = 203), azithromycin produced a significantly greater improvement in conjunctival discharge (P < 0.01) and a trend (P = 0.054) toward improvement in conjunctival hyperemia at day 7 than did tobramycin. Complete resolution of conjunctival discharge was significantly more frequent at day 3 on azithromycin than tobramycin (P = 0.005). More parents found azithromycin easier to use (in terms of treatment duration, total number of instillations, instilling drops during the day, and difficulty in performing daily activities) than tobramycin.

Conclusion

The azithromycin 1.5% regimen produced a rapid resolution of cardinal signs of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis with a more convenient dosage regimen. Such improved convenience is likely to improve compliance and lessen the burden of illness for patients and carers.

### Treatment of viral conjunctivitis in children… [^115wRLGS]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

to the editor: I am a new practicing physician in northern Wisconsin and would like some guidance on the correct treatment of conjunctivitis. During my training in family medicine, both visiting with ophthalmologists and pediatricians, it became apparent that all cases of conjunctivitis were treated with topical antibiotics regardless of whether the suspected cause was viral or bacterial. A recent Cochrane review in American Family Physician 1 suggests that we should prescribe topical antibiotics for all affected patients because of the low risk from treatment. However, what should be done about the more common viral pink eye. It is frustrating as a physician to convince parents and day care staff that an antibiotic is not helpful in these cases and should not be used. I would welcome your advice and direction.

1 of British general practitioners found that 95 percent of them prescribed topical antibiotics despite their belief that at least one half of the cases they saw were of a viral origin. Unfortunately, evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of viral conjunctivitis either provide no recommendation or recommend supportive treatment for viral conjunctivitis. The American Optometric Society recommends the use of cold compresses, lubricants, and ocular decongestants. 2 However, the guidelines of the American Academy of Ophthalmology 3 and the British Public Health Laboratory Service 4 do not offer specific recommendations for treatment of presumptive nonherpetic viral conjunctivitis. Considering the practical realities of parent expectations of antibiotic treatment for all cases of conjunctivitis among children in day care, the low risk of treatment with topical antibiotics, and unclear policy guidelines, it would seem reasonable to pursue one of the following options.

One option would be to provide parents with information about the self-limited nature of most cases of conjunctivitis without treatment and the lack of evidence for benefit from topical antibiotics in cases of viral conjunctivitis, and then allow the parents to choose. This is a reasonable option for practical reasons and because a large proportion of primary care physicians are uncertain about whether low-risk cases are viral or bacterial in origin.

1. A second option would be to offer a delayed prescription approach by prescribing antibiotics only for those cases that have not resolved by day
5. 5 In one qualitative study 6 of adult patients with conjunctivitis, most patients preferred to wait a few days for treatment once they were made aware of the self-limiting nature of conjunctivitis. However, it is unclear whether parents would take the same attitude toward their children in day care who could not return to day care without having begun antibiotics.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^114DEtT2]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Chlamydial conjunctivitis — treatment and follow-up guidance note that systemic therapy is indicated in infants because more than 50% may have infection at other sites, empiric antibiotic therapy can be considered when signs strongly suggest chlamydia, there are no data supporting topical therapy in addition to systemic therapy, treatment failure can be as high as 19% so patients should be reevaluated, follow-up should include interval history, visual acuity measurement, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, adults usually respond to systemic therapy and sexual contacts should be treated concurrently, patients and sexual contacts should be informed about possible concomitant disease, sexual abuse should be considered in children, and in low- to middle-income settings povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution can be used.

### Pediatric ocular inflammation [^1154koTE]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Pediatric conjunctivitis often has a benign etiology and a self-limited course. It is common in childhood and may be infectious or noninfectious in nature and acute or chronic in presentation. Infectious causes include bacterial and viral conjunctivitis. Noninfectious causes include congenital nasolacrimal obstruction, ocular allergies, congenital glaucoma, and uveitis. This article reviews the etiology, clinical features, and treatment for pediatric conjunctivitis.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^1112KZBq]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis pharmacotherapy stewardship: Indiscriminate use of topical antibiotics or corticosteroids should be avoided, because viral conjunctivitis will not respond to antibacterial agents and mild bacterial conjunctivitis is likely to be self-limited; for acute exacerbations of vernal conjunctivitis, topical corticosteroids are usually necessary, and no evidence exists demonstrating the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks-2022 [^113QTJnB]. AAO (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for allergic conjunctivitis, more specifically with respect to specific immunotherapy, AAO 2022 guidelines recommend to offer allergen-specific immunotherapy in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, recognizing that it is more effective in pediatric than adult patients.

---

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^117Pgase]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Diagnostic tests for conjunctivitis are selectively used; some cases can be diagnosed on the basis of history and examination, but in other cases additional diagnostic tests may be helpful. Cultures for routine conjunctivitis in the absence of listed risk factors are rarely cost-effective or helpful in deciding on the treatment course, and cultures of the conjunctiva are indicated in all cases of suspected infectious neonatal conjunctivitis. Bacterial cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing may be helpful for recurrent, severe, or chronic purulent conjunctivitis in any age group and in cases where the conjunctivitis has not responded to medication. Viral diagnostic tests are not routinely used in practice to establish the diagnosis of adenovirus, but they may prevent misdiagnosis, disease spread, unnecessary antibiotic use, increased health care costs, and lost productivity.

### Conjunctivitis (bacterial) [^116E3SJr]. COP (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for infectious conjunctivitis, more specifically with respect to topical antibiotics, CO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering topical antibiotics to modestly improve short-term clinical remission and reduce the patient's infectiousness to others, while balancing the potential benefit of antibiotics against the risk of antibiotic resistance.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112Etouf]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2)/Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) conjunctivitis more often presents with unilateral than bilateral conjunctival injection, with a typical follicular reaction that may include chemosis, watery discharge, superficial keratitis, and pseudomembranes. Associated factors include SARS‑CoV‑2 exposure, unprotected eye exposure, significant travel history, or respiratory symptoms. The natural history is that it usually occurs early in disease with mild inflammation and disappearance of symptoms within a few days of treatment, has relatively low incidence/prevalence compared with other systemic manifestations and is more common in children, and may be isolated or associated with systemic symptoms. Potential sequelae are that conjunctival symptoms appear self‑limited with variable duration (5–21 days), and typically there is no effect on visual acuity and no short‑term complications.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials for adolescents with atopic dermatitis or asthma [^115ZJh58]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Consistent with findings in adults, we observed a higher incidence of conjunctivitis among adolescent patients with AD overall and in dupilumab treatment groups compared with placebo in the AD clinical trials, whereas incidence rates in adolescent patients in the asthma trial were comparatively lower and similar between dupilumab and placebo. Conjunctivitis cases across all conditions and trials were predominantly mild or moderate and resolved during the treatment period, and none resulted in permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Further research is currently ongoing to explore the underlying association of conjunctivitis with AD, and with dupilumab treatment in patients with AD.

### Ocular medicines in children: the regulatory situation related to clinical research [^117B6u9C]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Moreover, the available guidelines on the pharmacological management of eye diseases in the paediatric population often recommend the use of medications not licensed or investigated in children, especially for the management of glaucoma (such as prostagliandin analogs) or acute bacterial conjunctivitis (such as steroids and antibiotics combinations). An effort to stimulate research and clinical development is therefore needed also for them, in order to guarantee medicines that have been proven to be of benefit also in paediatric patients.

Many good ethical and economical reasons exist for limiting paediatric clinical trials, while guaranteeing appropriate conclusions. Because of the characteristics of the paediatric population, limited information is also available regarding the side effects related to ocular medication use in children. As the number and variety of ocular medications has increased and the number of clinicians involved in their prescription has grown, the risk of systemic adverse reactions may also increase. When prescribing ocular medications in children, physicians should therefore carefully consider their risk/benefit profile, referring to details of labelling for paediatric use, such as the age of the child for whom the drug is approved, and be aware of their potentially serious systemic side effects.

### The epidemiology and treatment of conjunctivitis at urgent care centres in Israel [^114yiNd8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While previous research has described the epidemiology of conjunctivitis in hospital-based ED, this is the first time this issue has been addressed at a community-based UCC. This study demonstrates that 0.8% of patients in Israel presenting to UCC are diagnosed with conjunctivitis. These patients are significantly younger than patients in UCC or ED, the majority are male and arrive on the weekend. The overwhelming majority (96.7%) were treated at UCC and released home. Most (82%) of the patient received a prescription for topical antibiotics, while few (7.6%) had fever.

There are differences between ED and UCC conjunctivitis patients, particularly the age distribution, with UCC having a much younger cohort than ED. The age distribution at UCC in Israel resembles that found in ED in the USAand Canadawith a bimodal distribution and peak with young children. The USA studyspeculates that the peak in young children is caused by first-time inexperienced parents who bring their children to the ED for non-emergent conditions, such as conjunctivitis. The age distribution of conjunctivitis in Israeli ED suggest a different phenomenon. Perhaps parents of young children are less likely to want to expose their children to ED and thus use the UCC preferentially. Moreover, parents might want immediate treatment for their children, so their children can attend day care. Use of UCC for conjunctivitis is significantly higher on the weekends, supporting this notion. However, an interview-based study would be needed to know if this is the case.

b Specific viral etiology not known

None of the conjunctivitis events were considered related to the study drug, and all events were mild or moderate in severity; all were resolved during the treatment period (ESM 2 – Table S6). No event was an SAE, and no patients temporarily or permanently discontinued study treatment because of conjunctivitis. There were too few events to calculate a median time to the first conjunctivitis event. Hazard ratios did not show any differences between dupilumab and placebo in adolescents or adults (ESM 2 — Table S5). Treatments for conjunctivitis included a systemic antihistamine (loratadine) and oxymetazoline hydrochloride.

### Why do general practitioners prescribe antibiotics for acute infective conjunctivitis in children? Qualitative interviews with GPs and a questionnaire survey of parents and teachers [^1171pBaT]. Family Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute infective conjunctivitis in children is a common presentation in primary care. Treatment is usually with antibiotics and prescribing may be affected by non-clinical factors.

Aims

To investigate the non-clinical determinants of the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in children.

Design

Qualitative interviews with GPs and a questionnaire survey of parents of children with acute infective conjunctivitis and teachers.

Setting

GPs in Sheffield and Berkshire and parents of children with acute infective conjunctivitis and schools in Oxfordshire.

Methods

Semi-structured telephone interviews of 39 GPs. Questionnaire survey of 326 parents of children enrolled into a trial of acute infective conjunctivitis treatment. Questionnaire survey of 223 nurseries and primary schools in Oxfordshire.

Results

All three groups agreed that acute infective conjunctivitis was a mild condition. Parents were certain about the benefits of antibiotic treatment and sought early consultations with their GP in a desire to get their child back to school. GPs sometimes collude with a parent's request to prescribe to enable school attendance. Despite this 54.2% (95%CI 48.5–59.8%) children missed a mean of 1.85 days from school and 28.6% of parents (95%CI 23.5–33.7%) missed a mean of 1.5 days off work.

Conclusion

Social factors, including the need for children to attend day care or school and parents to go to work, contribute to the decision to prescribe antibiotics for children with acute infective conjunctivitis. Understanding these issues and changing school policies in line with national guidance may reduce pressure on GPs to prescribe for this condition.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^111iQWVn]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Statistics

Ocular signs, ocular symptoms, and global efficacy assessments were analyzed for both eyes in randomized patients with bacterial conjunctivitis confirmed by positive microbiological samples (microbiologically positive full analysis set [MFAS]). The acceptability criteria (ease of treatment use and impact on daily life) were assessed in the FAS (all randomized patients who instilled at least one drop of treatment). Descriptive statistics were provided overall and by age category (expressed as mean values ± standard deviation [SD]). Missing data were handled using a last available assessment carried forward approach. For treatment group comparison, ordinal variables were analyzed using the exact Cochran–Mantel–Haenzel test, stratified by age group. Analysis of the total symptom score was performed using a mixed model for repeated measures. Comparisons were performed two-sided at the 5% α level of significance.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^111MZ8HC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The bacteriological and clinical findings from this study have previously been reported, and the present results extend those findings. Clinical cure rate was reduced more rapidly by azithromycin than by tobramycin (41% vs 28.7% respectively on day 3, P = 0.013) and was noninferior at the end of the study (89.2% vs 78.2% respectively at day 7). Resolution of bacterial pathogens, including resistant species, was similar with the two treatments. As in the present study, the results were broadly equivalent in the sub-24 months of age subgroup.

Although bacterial conjunctivitis generally resolves without treatment, there are benefits to be gained, particularly in moderate to severe cases, by the more rapid improvements that can be achieved with topical antibiotic treatment. As well as the clinical benefits of avoidance of complications (particularly in younger children), earlier resolution of symptoms, and a reduction in the chance of contagion, nonclinical benefits such as an earlier return to school (and less loss of curriculum) and less disrupted work life for parents should be taken into account. A survey of 326 parents of children estimated that 54.2% of children missed 1.9 days of school and 28.6% of parents missed a mean of 1.5 days of work during a bout of infective conjunctivitis.

Despite the significant literature on topical antibiotic use in infective conjunctivitis, until relatively recently, there have been few studies on the use of topical ocular antibiotics in children, particularly newborns and infants who are at particular risk of bacterial conjunctivitis and who can suffer the most serious complications such as ophthalmia neonatorum. The current study recruited patients from hospitals rather than from general practice; since bacterial conjunctivitis in older children is generally managed in a community setting, this study included a significant population of newborns and infants. Because the study included a large population of these younger children (a population frequently underrepresented in similar clinical studies), the results in this group of patients are particularly noteworthy. Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and purulent discharge were lower in azithromycin- than in tobramycin-treated patients at both day 3 (by 14% for bulbar hyperemia and 20% purulent discharge respectively) and day 7 (by 20% for bulbar hyperemia and 18% for purulent discharge respectively); such differences are likely to be of clinical significance.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^116MLSh6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy of azithromycin 1.5% versus tobramycin 0.3% eyedrops on clinical ocular signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis in children and to assess the parents' satisfaction regarding the dosing regimen.

Patients and Methods

An international, multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked, controlled clinical trial conducted in children (1 day to 18 years old) with bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and purulent discharge. Azithromycin 1.5% was administered as 1 drop twice daily for 3 days, and tobramycin 0.3% as 1 drop every 2 hours for 2 days, then 4 times daily for 5 days.

Results

A total of 286 patients (mean age: 3.2 years) were enrolled. In children with bacteriologically positive cultures (N = 203), azithromycin produced a significantly greater improvement in conjunctival discharge (P < 0.01) and a trend (P = 0.054) toward improvement in conjunctival hyperemia at day 7 than did tobramycin. Complete resolution of conjunctival discharge was significantly more frequent at day 3 on azithromycin than tobramycin (P = 0.005). More parents found azithromycin easier to use (in terms of treatment duration, total number of instillations, instilling drops during the day, and difficulty in performing daily activities) than tobramycin.

Conclusion

The azithromycin 1.5% regimen produced a rapid resolution of cardinal signs of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis with a more convenient dosage regimen. Such improved convenience is likely to improve compliance and lessen the burden of illness for patients and carers.

### A randomised controlled trial of management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis in general practice [^113JyVu3]. BMJ (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess different management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis.

Design

Open, factorial, randomised controlled trial.

Setting

30 general practices in southern England.

Participants

307 adults and children with acute infective conjunctivitis.

Intervention

One of three antibiotic prescribing strategies-immediate antibiotics (chloramphenicol eye drops; n = 104), no antibiotics (controls; n = 94), or delayed antibiotics (n = 109); a patient information leaflet or not; and an eye swab or not.

Main Outcome Measures

Severity of symptoms on days 1–3 after consultation, duration of symptoms, and belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics for eye infections.

Results

Prescribing strategies did not affect the severity of symptoms but duration of moderate symptoms was less with antibiotics: no antibiotics (controls) 4.8 days, immediate antibiotics 3.3 days (risk ratio 0.7, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 0.8), delayed antibiotics 3.9 days (0.8, 0.7 to 0.9). Compared with no initial offer of antibiotics, antibiotic use was higher in the immediate antibiotic group: controls 30%, immediate antibiotics 99% (odds ratio 185.4, 23.9 to 1439.2), delayed antibiotics 53% (2.9, 1.4 to 5.7), as was belief in the effectiveness of antibiotics: controls 47%, immediate antibiotics 67% (odds ratio 2.4, 1.1 to 5.0), delayed antibiotics 55% (1.4, 0.7 to 3.0), and intention to reattend for eye infections: controls 40%, immediate antibiotics 68% (3.2, 1.6 to 6.4), delayed antibiotics 41% (1.0, 0.5 to 2.0). A patient information leaflet or eye swab had no effect on the main outcomes. Reattendance within two weeks was less in the delayed compared with immediate antibiotic group: 0.3 (0.1 to 1.0) v 0.7 (0.3 to 1.6).

Conclusions

Delayed prescribing of antibiotics is probably the most appropriate strategy for managing acute conjunctivitis in primary care. It reduces antibiotic use, shows no evidence of medicalisation, provides similar duration and severity of symptoms to immediate prescribing, and reduces reattendance for eye infections.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^112ZYxCy]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Mild bacterial conjunctivitis — treatment approach: Mild bacterial conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, and it typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immune-competent adults. Use of topical antibacterial therapy is associated with earlier clinical and microbiological remission compared with placebo in days 2 to 5 of treatment, and these advantages persist over days 6 to 10, but the extent of benefit over placebo lessens over time. Because a 5- to 7-day course of a broad-spectrum topical antibiotic is usually effective, the most convenient or least expensive option can be selected; there is no clinical evidence supporting the superiority of any particular antibiotic. Povidone-iodine 1.25% ophthalmic solution may be as effective as topical antibiotic therapy for treating bacterial conjunctivitis and could be considered when access to antibiotics is limited, such as in low- to middle-income countries, and although there are no data supporting the cost-effectiveness of using antibiotics in mild bacterial conjunctivitis, the shortened morbidity associated with their use makes choice of therapy an individual decision.

### The safety data of dupilumab for the treatment of moderate ‑ to ‑ severe atopic dermatitis in infants, children, adolescents, and adults [^112tJvSm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis of all etiologies and phenotypes with or without eyelid or corneal involvement was dominant among all ocular TEAEs reported in dupilumab clinical trials in AD. In the present analysis, conjunctivitis events were generally mild to moderate in severity, were more common with dupilumab treatment than placebo, and most cases recovered or resolved during the treatment period, consistent with previous analyses. The majority of conjunctivitis cases did not result in permanent discontinuation of study drug. In the adult OLE, the incidence of conjunctivitis decreased throughout the up to 5-year course of treatment, and the EAIR of conjunctivitis was lower than in the 52-week CHRONOS trial, suggesting that conjunctivitis incidence is not increased with continued long-term dupilumab treatment. It is important to note that conjunctivitis events reported here are the sum of incidences of events for the cluster of conjunctivitis PTs (i.e. all PTs with the word "conjunctivitis" in the term [Table 1 of the ESM]), as opposed to the single PT "conjunctivitis". Across trials, these diagnoses were made by study investigators, mainly dermatologists and allergists, and most cases were not referred for ophthalmologic or laboratory evaluation. Therefore, it can be difficult to make definitive conclusions related to the incidence of conjunctivitis compared with other therapies.

Ocular surface conditions are common in patients with severe AD, with incidence rates ranging from 32 to 56%. The increased incidence of conjunctivitis seen in patients with AD treated with dupilumab may reflect the increased prevalence of ocular disorders in AD, as well as interactions between dupilumab and AD. Of note, keratitis cluster events were uncommon, and few events were severe or ongoing at the end of treatment. In previous analyses, higher baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis were associated with increased conjunctivitis incidence in dupilumab clinical trials in patients with AD. Notably, a slight increased incidence of conjunctivitis was also reported in dupilumab recipients in clinical trials in prurigo nodularis and CRSwNP but was not observed in dupilumab trials of other type 2 inflammatory conditions such as asthma and eosinophilic esophagitis. The pathogenesis of conjunctivitis during dupilumab treatment is still unknown. Evaluations of dupilumab-associated conjunctivitis events have been investigated in a dedicated trial (NCT04287608), where most cases resolved with ocular local treatments and did not require dupilumab treatment discontinuation.

Most patients can be treated as outpatients, and in children with acute bacterial conjunctivitis "consideration might be given to referral for an internal ear exam". It states that "Hospitalization may be necessary to administer parenteral therapy for severe gonococcal conjunctivitis and is mandatory for neonatal conjunctivitis". For infection control, "Counseling is imperative for all contagious varieties of conjunctivitis", transmission includes "eye-hand contact, sexual contact, exposure to contaminated droplets, and exposure to airborne pathogens", and "Hand washing is important to reduce the risk of transmission of infection". "Return to school or work depends on the age of the patient, occupation, and type and severity of conjunctivitis". When sexually transmitted disease is involved, "treatment of sexual partners is essential" and "Patients as well as their sexual partners should be referred to an appropriate medical specialist". Clinicians "must remain alert to the possibility of child abuse", and "sexually transmitted diseases and suspected child abuse must be reported to local health authorities or other state agencies". For neonates, "In cases of ophthalmia neonatorum due to gonococcus, chlamydia, and HSV, the infant should be referred to an appropriate specialist", infants needing systemic treatment "are best managed in conjunction with a pediatrician", and when systemic disease is suspected, "patients should be referred to an appropriate medical specialist for evaluation".

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116NpHJ8]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Although topical antibiotics are often prescribed for treating acute infective conjunctivitis in children, their efficacy is uncertain.

Objective

To assess the efficacy of topical antibiotic therapy for acute infective conjunctivitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial was conducted in primary health care in Oulu, Finland, from October 15, 2014, to February 7, 2020. Children aged 6 months to 7 years with acute infective conjunctivitis were eligible for enrollment. The participants were followed up for 14 days. A subsequent meta-analysis included the present trial and 3 previous randomized clinical trials enrolling pediatric patients aged 1 month to 18 years with acute infective conjunctivitis.

Interventions

Participants in the present randomized clinical trial were randomized to moxifloxacin eye drops, placebo eye drops, or no intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome in the present randomized clinical trial was time to clinical cure (in days); in the meta-analysis, the primary outcome was the proportion of participants with conjunctival symptoms on days 3 to 6.

Results

The randomized clinical trial included 88 participants (46 [52%] girls), of whom 30 were randomized to moxifloxacin eye drops (mean [SD] age, 2.8 [1.6] years), 27 to placebo eye drops (mean [SD], age 3.0 [1.3] years), and 31 to no intervention (mean [SD] age, 3.2 [1.8] years). The time to clinical cure was significantly shorter in the moxifloxacin eye drop group than in the no intervention group (3.8 vs 5.7 days; difference, -1.9 days; 95% CI, -3.7 to -0.1 days; p = 0.04), while in the survival analysis both moxifloxacin and placebo eye drops significantly shortened the time to clinical cure relative to no intervention. In the meta-analysis, a total of 584 children were randomized (300 to topical antibiotics and 284 to a placebo), and the use of topical antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of children who had symptoms of conjunctivitis on days 3 to 6 compared with placebo eye drops (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.91).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial and systematic review and meta-analysis, topical antibiotics were associated with significantly shorter durations of conjunctival symptoms in children with acute infective conjunctivitis.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aRAcq]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis of combined data from the present trial and 3 previous studies, found that the use of topical antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of children who had symptoms of conjunctivitis on days 3 to 6 compared with cases receiving a placebo. The evidence for this has previously been conflicting. Gigliotti et alshowed in the early 1980s that treatment with polymyxin-bacitracin eye drops resulted in higher clinical cure rates on days 2 to 5 than treatment with a placebo, but when Rose and colleaguesconducted a large trial consisting of 326 outpatient children with acute infective conjunctivitis in 2005, they found no significant difference in the cure rates at 1 week between the children treated with chloramphenicol eye drops and those treated with placebo eye drops. The present study, which was designed to address current inconsistencies, found that topical antibiotics were effective when used to treat acute infectious conjunctivitis in children.

An acknowledged weakness of previous RCTs, has been that none of the trials have included a control group without an intervention. It has been suggested that placebo eye drops alone may be of benefit in the management of acute infective conjunctivitis because of their washout effect. Moreover, the largest trial of which we are aware found no difference in cure times between antibiotic eye drops and a placebo, but it included a placebo solution that contained preservatives with antiseptic properties. To avoid the bias caused by washout or anti-infective effects of a placebo, groups with no intervention at all and a placebo solution that did not contain any preservatives were included in the present RCT. As a result, the placebo eye drops significantly reduced the time to clinical cure in the present time-to-event analysis by comparison with no treatment, although the difference in the mean times to clinical cure between the groups was not statistically significant. These findings do suggest, however, that lubricating eye drops may make some contribution to the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in children.

### Common childhood bacterial infections [^114HbRiq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2011). Low credibility.

Children with infectious diseases are commonly encountered in primary care settings. Identification of the subset of patients with bacterial infections is key in guiding the best possible management. Clinicians frequently care for children with infections of the upper respiratory tract, including acute otitis media, otitis externa, sinusitis, and pharyngitis. Conjunctivitis is not an uncommon reason for office visits. Bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis are regularly seen. Over the last decade, a growing number of children have had infections of the skin and soft tissue, driven by the increased prevalence of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The following review addresses the epidemiology and risk factors for specific infections and examines the clinical presentation and selection of appropriate diagnostic methods in such conditions. Methods to prevent these bacterial infections and recommendations for follow-up are suggested. Management of these infections requires that antimicrobial agents be used in a judicious manner in the outpatient setting. Such antibiotic therapy is recommended using both available clinical evidence and review of disease-specific treatment guidelines.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1177nUqX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are topical antibiotics effective for the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in children?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial with 88 participants, use of topical antibiotics reduced the time to clinical cure, and in the meta-analysis with 584 participants, the use of topical antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of children who had symptoms of conjunctivitis on days 3 to 6 compared with those receiving a placebo.

Meaning

These findings suggest that topical antibiotic therapy should be considered for acute infective conjunctivitis in children because antibiotics were associated with significantly shorter recovery times.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117P4FoD]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

The protocol was found ethically acceptable by the Finnish Medical Agency and the Ethical Committee of the North Ostrobothnia's Hospital District, Oulu, Finland. Only children whose parents or legal representatives provided written informed consent were included in the trial. The RCT followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guideline. The systematic review and meta-analysis were registered with Prospero and were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline. The study protocol and statistical analysis plan are shown in Supplement 1.

Trial Design

The RCT was first conducted to investigate the efficacy of moxifloxacin eye drops in the treatment of acute infective conjunctivitis in children compared with placebo and no intervention. Both placebo and no intervention controls were chosen to evaluate the potential washout effect of placebo eye drops. The trial was conducted at 2 pediatric outpatient clinics in the city of Oulu and at the pediatric emergency department of Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland, from October 15, 2014, to February 7, 2020. Second, a systematic review and meta-analysis of the results of the present and previous RCTs was conducted to assess whether the evidence favors topical antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acute infective conjunctivitis.

### Cost-effectiveness of pediatric conjunctivitis management and return to childcare and school strategies: a comparative study [^111nRExV]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infectious conjunctivitis affects 1 in 8 children annually, resulting in high ophthalmic antibiotic prescribing and absenteeism from childcare and school. We aimed to quantify the cost-effectiveness and annual savings of 3 evidence-based approaches to conjunctivitis management and return to childcare and school compared to usual care.

Methods

Using a decision analytic model from a societal perspective over a 1-year time horizon, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of 3 management strategies for children aged 6 months to 17 years with non-severe conjunctivitis compared to usual care in the United States. Strategies accounted for rate of transmission. Strategies included (1) refraining from prescribing ophthalmic antibiotics for non-severe conjunctivitis, (2) allowing children without systemic symptoms to attend childcare and school, (3) and the combined approach of refraining from prescribing ophthalmic antibiotics and allowing children without systemic symptoms to attend childcare and school.

Results

The estimated annual expenditure for pediatric conjunctivitis was $1.95 billion. Usual care was the most expensive ($212.73/episode), followed by refraining from ophthalmic antibiotic prescribing ($199.92) and allowing children without systemic symptoms to attend childcare and school ($140.18). The combined approach was the least costly ($127.38). Disutility was similar between approaches (quality-adjusted life days 0.271 vs 0.274). Refraining from antibiotic prescribing and the combination approach were dominant compared to usual care. The combined approach resulted in an estimated $783 million annual savings and 1.6 million ophthalmic antibiotic courses averted.

Conclusions

Conjunctivitis poses an economic burden that could be reduced by refraining from ophthalmic antibiotic use and allowing children without systemic symptoms to remain at school or childcare.

### Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Gk6kb]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception date to July 14, 2017. The search strategy included keywords and text words for chlamydia, ON, conjunctivitis, and the drug names. We did not impose language or study type restrictions. We also reviewed the reference lists of relevant study, guideline, and systematic review reports (see "Search Strategy" in Supplementary Material). Two investigators (A. Z. and N. S.) independently screened citations according to title and abstract and screened the full text of the relevant articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consulting with a third investigator.

We included primary studies on the effects of oral erythromycin, azithromycin, or trimethoprim in treating neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis. Although other oral and topical antimicrobial agents are available, these 3 antimicrobials were chosen by the WHO guideline panel as a high priority for review, because they are used more widely in lower- and middle-income countries, and there is an outstanding question about which of them should be used in practice. We included any dosing regimen but were particularly interested in the effects of doses commonly used in lower- and middle-income countries, that is, erythromycin in 4 daily divided doses orally for 14 days at 20, 30, or 50 mg/kg body weight per day, azithromycin at 20 mg/kg per day orally (1 dose or for 3 days), and trimethoprim at 40 mg plus sulfa at 200 mg orally, twice daily for 14 days. We allowed randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies, including before–after studies, that followed 1 or 2 groups of neonates who underwent an eligible treatment. We included studies if more than 90% of the neonates were younger than 2 months at disease onset and diagnosed with chlamydial conjunctivitis on the basis of clinical symptoms and microbiological confirmation of C trachomatis using culture, a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, or nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). The WHO guideline panel of experts identified critically important outcomes to include in the review by using methods for prioritizing outcomes. Outcomes included clinical cure, microbiological cure, adverse effects (including pyloric stenosis), complications, antimicrobial resistance, and compliance. We also recorded data regarding treatment relapse, nasopharyngeal infection, and pneumonia. Clinical cure was defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis, including erythema and edema of the eyelids or conjunctiva and ocular discharge. Microbiological cure was recorded when the results of chlamydial follow-up tests determined by culture, a DFA, or NAAT were negative.

### Conjunctivitis: diagnosis and management [^114ZswsT]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses, bacteria, or allergies is one of the most common eye conditions in primary care. There is no single sign or symptom that accurately differentiates viral from bacterial conjunctivitis. A comprehensive history and physical examination can guide diagnosis. Viral and allergic conjunctivitis are more common in adults and typically present with watery discharge. Supportive care options for viral conjunctivitis include artificial tears, cold compresses, and antihistamine eye drops. Strict personal hygiene, including frequent handwashing, is essential to decrease the risk of transmission. Topical antihistamines with mast cell-stabilizing activity are the treatment of choice for allergic conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is more common in children and typically presents as mucopurulent discharge with the eyelids matted shut. Delayed antibiotic prescribing has been found to have similar symptom control as immediate prescribing. Ophthalmology referral is indicated for conjunctivitis in a neonate or patients with severe pain, decreased vision, recent ocular surgery, vesicular rash on the eyelids or nose, history of rheumatologic disease, or immunocompromised state.

### Drug use in children: cohort study in three European countries [^111W48gn]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Although patterns of drug use and labelling status can inform decisions on prioritisation of research, these data inform also us about suboptimal use and might even uncover undesirable prescribing practices. For example, fusidic acid and chloramphenicol are often used and often off label (tables 4–6). In the Netherlands, fusidic acid is prescribed for the treatment of conjunctivitis, similar to chloramphenicol in the UK. The beneficial effect of antibiotics in the treatment of this condition, however, has not been proved. Indeed acute bacterial conjunctivitis is often a self limiting condition, and topical antibiotic use offers only marginal benefit in improving clinical outcomes; hence the emphasis should be on educating clinicians not to prescribe such treatment rather than a call for more research. Another example underlining the need for education rather than research is the cough and cold medications. These drugs are not only available over the counter but are also often prescribed, which should be strongly discouraged because of reports of death and lack of efficacy.

### Bacterial conjunctivitis [^114Gxx2a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Most cases of conjunctivitis in adults are probably due to viral infection, but children are more likely to develop bacterial conjunctivitis than they are viral forms. The main bacterial pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults and children, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. Contact lens wearers may be more likely to develop gram-negative infections. Bacterial keratitis occurs in up to 30 per 100,000 contact lens wearers.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment in adults and children with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with bacteriologically confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis? What are the effects of treatment in adults and children with clinically confirmed gonococcal conjunctivitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 44 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ocular decongestants, oral antibiotics, parenteral antibiotics, saline, topical antibiotics, and warm compresses.

### The epidemiology and treatment of conjunctivitis at urgent care centres in Israel [^115KBDLm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients (82%) received a prescription for topical antibiotics. This finding is similar to previous studies. In the Netherlands, 80% of patients with conjunctivitis under the care of general practitioners received topical antibiotics. In a survey carried out in Great Britain, 95% of general care practitioners report prescribing topical antibiotics for conjunctivitis. A study in the USA found that 68% of patients diagnosed with conjunctivitis at UCC filled their prescription for topical antibiotics, although the actual prescription rate is likely to be higher.

The high rate of antibiotic prescription for conjunctivitis may suggest overuse, since most conjunctivitis is viral. However, in this study, 31% of the cohort presenting at UCC with conjunctivitis are younger than 6 years of age. Since bacterial pathogens are the most common cause of acute pediatric conjunctivitis, and 78% of these children had purulent ocular discharge, they are most likely to have suffered from bacterial conjunctivitis. While bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve by itself, antimicrobials can be prescribed to shorten the duration of illness. Furthermore, many child care providers exclude children with conjunctivitis until antibiotic treatment is provided and this has been shown to impact the decision to prescribe antibiotics. Moreover, it is difficult clinically to differentiate viral from bacterial conjunctivitis, so providers tend to "err on the side of safety" and prescribe antibiotics "just in case".

The high number of cases found in a desert condition is interesting. This may be due to the association between desert dust and conjunctivitis.

The finding that most of the patients did not have fever and when fever was present, it was usually in the presence of another condition, further emphasizes that conjunctivitis is not a systemic disease and does not need to be referred to ED.

The main limitation of the paper is that the medical records do not specifically distinguish between viral, bacterial and allergic conjunctivitis. This is likely to have led to the overuse of antibiotics, which can have negative consequences. However, it is difficult to clinically differentiate bacterial from viral conjunctivitis. For example, in Great Britain, only 36% of general care physicians believed that they could discriminate between bacterial and viral infection.

Another limitation is that patients were not followed-up after release from UCC. Patients who were sent home might not have improved and went to a primary care physician and/or ophthalmologist for further treatment. However, these patients are not adding to ED burden.

### Moxifloxacin [^1144kyyf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter, controlled clinical trials in which patients were dosed 3 times a day for 4 days, moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution produced clinical cures on Day 5–6 in 66% to 69% of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis. Microbiological success rates for the eradication of baseline pathogens ranged from 84% to 94%.

In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis between birth and 31 days of age, patients were dosed with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution or another anti-infective agent. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80% at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 92% at Day 9.

Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^113PBcU1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis is complicated because of the signs and symptoms that overlap with other inflammatory conjunctival conditions; therefore, likelihood for misdiagnosis remains high. Misdiagnosis of viral conjunctivitis as bacterial conjunctivitis may result in inappropriate use of antibiotics, which in turn contributes to increased antibiotic resistance. Additionally, misdiagnosis may lead to impaired quality of life and lost productivity due to poor outcomes. Adherence to the American Academy of Ophthalmology evidence-based treatment guidelines and greater educational efforts directed at both patients and physicians could improve the management of acute infectious conjunctivitis. Prescription of antibiotics should be delayed until a bacterial etiology is confirmed, and educational pamphlets should be distributed to general and emergency care practitioners. Development of novel agents with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity may offer potential new approaches without the drawback of resistance.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113G68QL]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute conjunctivitis is a common infection in children and is usually caused by bacteria. Physicians often prescribe antibiotics for this ailment, although the evidence for their effectiveness in pediatric patients is limited and conflicting. Gigliotti et alreported in the first randomized trial of acute conjunctivitis in children that we know of that treatment with topical antibiotics resulted in a greater cure rate than that among those receiving placebo eye drops, whereas a trial conducted by Rose et alfound that there was no difference in the clinical recovery between children treated with chloramphenicol eye drops and those treated with a placebo. However, since the placebo eye drops used by Rose et alcontained antiseptic agents as preservatives, both groups may have received anti-infective therapy. Finally, to our knowledge, all previous meta-analyses showing modest beneficial effects of topical antibiotics have combined pediatric and adult patients.

In this randomized clinical trial (RCT), children with acute infective conjunctivitis receiving topical antibiotics were compared with control participants receiving a placebo, while an additional control group that received no intervention was included because placebo eye drops alone may be beneficial due to their washout effect. The study was then continued by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of data extracted from the present trial and previous RCTs.

### Chloramphenicol treatment for acute infective conjunctivitis in children in primary care: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^111UTuzu]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

One in eight schoolchildren have an episode of acute infective conjunctivitis every year. Standard clinical practice is to prescribe a topical antibiotic, although the evidence to support this practice is scarce. We undertook a randomised double-blind trial to compare the effectiveness of chloramphenicol eye drops with placebo in children with infective conjunctivitis in primary care.

Methods

Our study included 326 children aged 6 months to 12 years with a clinical diagnosis of conjunctivitis who were recruited from 12 general medical practices in the UK. We assigned 163 children to receive chloramphenicol eye drops and 163 to receive placebo eye drops. Eye swabs were taken for bacterial and viral analysis. The primary outcome was clinical cure at day 7, which was assessed from diaries completed by parents. All children were followed up for 6 weeks to identify relapse. Survival statistics were used for comparison, and analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

Nine children were lost to follow-up (one in chloramphenicol group; eight in placebo group). Clinical cure by day 7 occurred in 128 (83%) of 155 children with placebo compared with 140 (86%) of 162 with chloramphenicol (risk difference 3.8%, 95% CI -4.1% to 11.8%). Seven (4%) children with chloramphenicol and five (3%) with placebo had further conjunctivitis episodes within 6 weeks (1.2%, -2.9% to 5.3%). Adverse events were rare and evenly distributed between each group.

Interpretation

Most children presenting with acute infective conjunctivitis in primary care will get better by themselves and do not need treatment with an antibiotic.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^116vUc9B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999; updated in 2006 and again in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included double-masked randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies. We graded the included RCTs for methodological quality using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardised manner. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan.

Main Results

We identified 11 eligible RCTs which randomised a total of 3673 participants. One further trial, which was published in abstract form in 1990 but has yet to be reported fully, is currently 'awaiting assessment'. Six of the 11 included studies have been included for the first time in this latest (2012) update. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality and graded the remainder as poor quality. Meta-analyses of data on clinical and microbiological remission rates revealed that topical antibiotics were of benefit in improving 'early' (days two to five) clinical (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) and microbiological (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) remission rates. At the 'late' time point (days six to 10), antibiotics were found to still confer modest benefits in clinical remission (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). By days six to 10, 41% (95% CI 38 to 43) of cases had resolved in those receiving placebo. We found no data on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, suggesting that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence.

Authors' Conclusions

Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Zar2H]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Participants, Randomization, and Blinding in the RCT

Children aged 6 months to 7 years with a clinical diagnosis of acute infective conjunctivitis were eligible for enrollment. Acute infective conjunctivitis was defined as the presence of conjunctival inflammation (erythema), discharge, or soreness or swelling of the eyelids. The exclusion criteria were allergy to fluoroquinolones, antibiotic therapy 7 days prior to the study, severe infection, allergic conjunctivitis, a trauma, or a foreign body in the eye. All the children were from Finnish-speaking families.

The eligible children were randomized to receive moxifloxacin eye drops, placebo eye drops, or no intervention in a 1:1:1 ratio. A biostatistician created a randomization list in permuted blocks of 6 in a random order, and the results were enclosed in sealed, numbered opaque envelopes containing either a code for the study group or the words no treatment. After informed consent had been obtained, the study physician opened the envelope and revealed a code (A or B) or no treatment.

The participating children, their parents, and the physicians and nurses were blinded to the assignment of the moxifloxacin and placebo eye drop groups, while the study design for the no intervention group was randomized but unblinded. The pharmacy distributed the eye drops and instructions to the families in opaque cardboard boxes in which the moxifloxacin eye drops were packed in plastic bottles and the placebo eye drops in single-dose vials. Both the bottles and the vials were transparent and did not have labels.

RCT Procedures

Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal specimens subjected to respiratory pathogen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and bacterial culture were obtained from the participants, and detailed descriptions of these microbiological samples are available in the study protocol (Supplement 1). The participants in the eye drop groups received either moxifloxacin eye drops (5 mg/mL [Novartis Finland]) or placebo eye drops (carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 1.0% [Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland]) administered as 1 drop in each affected eye 3 times daily until conjunctival symptoms were absent for at least 24 hours. The maximum duration of treatment was 7 days. The placebo eye drops used in the trial did not contain preservatives. All parents, including those in the no intervention group, were advised to remove any discharge from the child's eyes at least 3 times a day. Moxifloxacin eye drops were started in a nonblinded manner as a rescue treatment if needed.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Q6fN6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chlamydia is the cause of 1.8–5.6% of all acute conjunctivitis cases. Chlamydial conjunctivitis primarily has a unilateral presentation with concurrent genital infectionand presents with conjunctival redness, lymphoid follicle formation, or mild purulent discharge. A distinctive sign of this infection in adults is bulbar conjunctival follicles, which are absent in neonates/infants. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is typically spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with 1,708,569 cases reported in 2017. From 2013 to 2017, the number of reported cases of chlamydia in the United States increased by 22%. In neonates, the eyes can be infected after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes oral azithromycin or oral doxycycline in adults, and erythromycin in neonates.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

Most cases of allergic conjunctivitis are attributable to seasonal allergies and present with bilateral symptoms. Mild to severe itching and redness are the key symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which can present with a watery or mucoid discharge. Treatment includes supportive measures (cold compress, artificial tears), topical or oral antihistamines, and mast cell inhibitors. A short course of topical corticosteroids can be used in select cases in which corneal involvement and herpetic infection have been ruled out; both conditions could worsen with steroid use.

Differential Diagnosis

To satisfy the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines that treatment of conjunctivitis is directed at the root cause, physicians should manage patients by taking a systematic approach (Figure 2), considering the epidemiologic spectrum of infectious conjunctivitis, patient history, clinical exam, and — if needed — diagnostic tests.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^112Ch28x]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye infections in childhood and a common cause of paediatric primary care visits and ocular complaints in paediatric emergency departments. Bacterial infection accounts for up to 50% of all conjunctivitis cases in adults and as many as 70–80% of cases in children.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is characterised by mucopurulent discharge and conjunctival hyperaemia. It is an extremely contagious disease caused by one or more bacterial species and affects both sexes, all ages, ethnicities and countries. It can also cause epidemics among people in close quarters, including nursery, school and student populations. Mild cases are generally considered to be self-limiting, resolving in 5–10 days. However, current consensus supports the use of topical antibiotics as they provide significantly better rates of early clinical cure and microbiological resolution compared with artificial tears. Topical antibiotics are also known to reduce the rate of reinfection and prevent infection spread.

There are only a few available options for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis with topical antibiotics in childrenas most available topical antibiotics have been approved based on clinical studies performed only in adults. Although regulatory health authorities worldwide encourage paediatric clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of topical antibiotics are yet to be formally tested in this population. Thus, specific clinical data are still required for children with this indication.

In this study, azithromycin 1.5% ophthalmic solution, a topical antibiotic option recently approved in Europe for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and trachomatous conjunctivitis, was tested in children as young as a few days old. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops and also its rapidity of action (from say [D] 3) in order to support its indication in children, notably in those younger than 2 years old. Secondary objectives included determination of infection bacteriological profiles and microbiological resolution rates.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops for purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in pediatric patients [^112YjPs8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Purulent bacterial conjunctivitis affects all ages with high frequency in newborns and children. In a subset of 150 children included in a large study having enrolled 1043 patients, our aim was to analyze in children, the efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye-drops in the treatment of this disease.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked, parallel-group study, included 150 children and adolescents to study safety and compare azithromycin 1.5% eye drops twice daily for 3 days and tobramycin 0.3% 1 drop every 2 hours for 2 days then 4 times daily for 5 days. Out of 150 patients included, 58 had positive cultures and were studied for efficacy. Signs and symptoms were evaluated and cultures obtained at baseline, Days 3 and 9. Primary efficacy variable was the clinical cure (score 0 for bulbar conjunctival injection and purulent discharge) at the test of cure visit (day 9).

Results

Both treatments were effective with a clinical and microbiologic cure of more than 80% of children on day 9. Azithromycin therapy provided a greater bacteriologic cure on day 3 than did tobramycin (P < 0.001) and eradicated bacteria that were defined as resistant, using classical antibiogram. No adverse effects were noted on the ocular surface.

Conclusions

Azithromycin 1.5% eye drops leads to a rapid clinical and microbiological cure.

### Systemic treatment for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children [^113kPkoW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC) is a type of inflammation of the surface of the eye and eyelids which can affect children and adults. BKC involves changes of the eyelids, dysfunction of the meibomian glands, and inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea. Chronic inflammation of the cornea can lead to scarring, vascularisation and opacity. BKC in children can cause significant symptoms which include irritation, watering, photophobia and loss of vision. Loss of vision in children with BKC may be due to corneal opacity, refractive error or amblyopia.BKC treatment is directed towards the obstruction of meibomian gland openings, the bacterial flora of lid margin and conjunctiva, and ocular surface inflammation. Dietary modifications that involve increased intake in essential fatty acids (EFAs) may also be beneficial. Both topical and systemic treatments are used; this Cochrane review focuses on systemic treatments.

Objectives

To assess and compare data on the efficacy and safety of systemic treatments (including antibiotics, nutritional supplements and immunosuppressants), alone or in combination, for BKC in children aged between zero to 16 years.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 3), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to April 2016), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 21 April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials that involved systemic treatments in children aged between zero to 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of BKC. We planned to include studies that evaluated a single systemic medication versus placebo, and studies that compared two or multiple active treatments. We planned to include studies in which participants receive additional treatments, such as topical antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and lubricants, warm lid compresses and lid margin cleaning.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the literature search results (titles and abstracts) to identify studies that possibly met the inclusion criteria of the review. We divided studies into 'definitely include', 'definitely exclude' and 'possibly include' categories. We made a final judgement as to the inclusion or exclusion of studies in the 'possibly include' category after we obtained the full text of each article.

Main Results

No report or trial met the inclusion criteria of this Cochrane review; no randomised controlled trials have been carried out on this topic. There is a lack of standardised outcome measures.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from clinical trials regarding the safety and efficacy of systemic treatments for BKC. Trials are required to test efficacy and safety of current and future treatments. Outcome measures need to be developed which can capture both objective clinical and patient-reported aspects of the condition and treatments.

### Topical treatments for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children [^115BqCLd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (BKC) is a type of inflammation of the surface of the eye and eyelids that involves changes of the eyelids, dysfunction of the meibomian glands, and inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea. Chronic inflammation of the cornea can lead to scarring, vascularisation and opacity. BKC in children can cause significant symptoms including irritation, watering, photophobia and loss of vision from corneal opacity, refractive error or amblyopia. Treatment of BKC is directed towards modification of meibomian gland disease and the bacterial flora of lid margin and conjunctiva, and control of ocular surface inflammation. Although both topical and systemic treatments are used to treat people with BKC, this Cochrane review focuses on topical treatments.

Objectives

To assess and compare data on the efficacy and safety of topical treatments (including antibiotics, steroids, immunosuppressants and lubricants), alone or in combination, for BKC in children from birth to 16 years.

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2016, Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to 11 July 2016), Embase (January 1980 to 11 July 2016), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 11 July 2016. We searched the reference lists of identified reports and the Science Citation Index to identify any additional reports of studies that met the inclusion criteria.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials that involved topical treatments in children up to 16 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of BKC. We planned to include studies that evaluated a single topical medication versus placebo, a combination of treatments versus placebo, and those that compared two or multiple active treatments. We planned to include studies in which participants received additional treatments, such as oral antibiotics, oral anti-inflammatories, warm lid compresses and lid margin cleaning.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the results of the literature search (titles and abstracts) to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria of the review and applied standards as expected for Cochrane reviews. We graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included one study from the USA that met the inclusion criteria. In the study, 137 children aged zero to six years old with blepharoconjunctivitis were randomised to treatment in one of four trial arms (loteprednol etabonate/tobramycin combination, loteprednol etabonate alone, tobramycin alone or placebo) for 15 days, with assessments on days 1, 3, 7 and 15. We judged the study to be at high risk of attrition bias and bias due to selective outcome reporting. The study did not report the number of children with improvement in symptoms nor with total or partial success as measured by changes in clinical symptoms. All children showed a reduction in blepharoconjunctivitis grade score, but there was no evidence of important differences between groups. Visual acuity was not fully reported but the authors stated that there was no change in visual acuity in any of the treatment groups. The study reported ocular and non ocular adverse events but was underpowered to detect differences between the groups. Ocular adverse events were as follows: loteprednol/tobramycin 1/34 (eye pain); loteprednol 4/35 (eye pain, conjunctivitis, eye discharge, eye inflammation); tobramycin 0/34; placebo (vehicle) 0/34. The evidence was limited for all these outcomes and we judged it to be very low certainty. There was no information on clinical signs (aside from grade score), disease progression or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no high-quality evidence of the safety and efficacy of topical treatments for BKC, which resulted in uncertainty about the indications and effectiveness of topical treatment. Clinical trials are required to test efficacy and safety of current and any future treatments. Outcome measures need to be developed which can capture both objective clinical and patient-reported aspects of the condition and treatments.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^116UHwaU]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis management — care management emphasizes that the majority of cases in the adult population are viral and self-limited and do not require antimicrobial treatment, and there is no proven effective treatment for eradication of adenoviral infection; symptomatic measures such as artificial tears, topical antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, oral analgesics or cold compresses may mitigate symptoms, and the use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential adverse treatment effects. Allergen-specific immunotherapy is beneficial in reducing allergic conjunctivitis, more so in children than in adults. Treatment for vernal conjunctivitis includes environmental modification with cold compresses and ocular lubricants, and for acute exacerbations, topical corticosteroids are usually needed to control severe symptoms (I+, MQ, SR). For contact lens-related keratoconjunctivitis, discontinue contact lens wear until the cornea returns to normal, and in mild cases a brief course of topical corticosteroids in addition to longer-term topical cyclosporine can be considered. Use systemic antibiotic treatment for conjunctivitis due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis; treat sexual partners when conjunctivitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and refer patients and their sexual partners to an appropriate medical specialist; refer patients with manifestation of a systemic disease to an appropriate medical specialist.

Regarding medical management for infectious conjunctivitis, more specifically with respect to topical antibiotics, AAO 2019 guidelines recommend to avoid prescribing topical antibiotics indiscriminately, as viral conjunctivitis will not respond to antibacterial agents, and mild bacterial conjunctivitis is likely to be self-limited and typically resolves spontaneously without specific treatment in immunocompetent adults.

### Conjunctivitis in dupilumab clinical trials [^116gnHhN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, the higher incidence of conjunctivitis in dupilumab‐treated patients with AD appears to be associated with several disease‐based factors, including baseline AD severity and previous history of conjunctivitis. Dupilumab treatment was not associated with increased incidence of conjunctivitis in asthma, CRSwNP and EoE trials. In most cases, conjunctivitis AEs were mild to moderate. Most cases resolved or were resolving while patients continued their dupilumab treatment, but the data do not allow for determination of the proportion of patients who required continued or intermittent ongoing therapy for conjunctivitis. For timely appropriate intervention, we recommend referral for a detailed eye examination in patients who develop this complication while on dupilumab treatment. Further studies, including mechanistic investigations of ocular or conjunctival samples, are needed to characterize clinical phenotypes and understand the aetiology of the observed conjunctivitis AEs in the setting of dupilumab treatment, and to develop guidance for prevention and management.

Outcomes of the Trial

The time to clinical cure was shorter in participants who received moxifloxacin eye drops than in those who did not receive any intervention (3.8 vs 5.7 days; difference, –1.9 days; 95% CI, –3.7 to –0.1 days; p = 0.04) (Table). When the children receiving moxifloxacin eye drops were compared with those receiving placebo eye drops, there was no difference in the time to clinical cure (3.8 vs 4.0 days; difference, 0.2 days; 95% CI, –2.2 to 1.6 days; p = 0.94). Similarly, when the children receiving placebo eye drops were compared with those who did not receive any intervention, there was no significant difference in the time to clinical cure (4.0 vs 5.7 days; difference, 1.7 days; 95% CI, –0.2 to 3.5 days; p = 0.10). In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, both moxifloxacin and placebo eye drops significantly shortened the time to clinical cure relative to no intervention (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively) (Figure 2).

Bacterial Conjunctivitis

Approximately 32% of acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are caused by bacteria, according to an evaluation of the prevalence of positive bacterial culture in adult patients who presented to their general practitioner with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelids. Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral but can sometimes affect both eyes. The staphylococcal species are the most common pathogens for bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In children, the bacterial disease is responsible for 50–75% of conjunctivitis cases, often caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. The hyperacute form of bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by a rapid onset of conjunctival redness and mucopurulent discharge. Symptoms may also include burning and itching, though these are less common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limiting, resolving within 7–10 days. Use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be delayed, and no evidence demonstrates the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) conjunctivitis is the cause of an estimated 3–64% of ocular staphylococcal infectionsand requires management by an ophthalmologist with antibiotics that are active against MRSA, such as besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension.

The rapid onset and progression of hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (often caused by N. gonorrhoeae) warrants immediate ophthalmic management to prevent corneal involvement and potentially perforation. Symptoms include purulent discharge, diminished visual acuity, eye tenderness, and swollen lymph nodes. The increasing incidence of gonorrhea infection was recognized in 2015 as an urgent public health threat in the United States. From 2013 to 2017 the rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased by 67% (555,608 cases in 2017), with an 18.6% increase between 2016 and 2017. Gonococcal ocular infection can present in neonates after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes intramuscular ceftriaxone for adults, children, and neonates, and oral azithromycin or doxycycline for adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines changed in 2015 to support the use of dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to the increased resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to the antimicrobials previously used for treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis lasting more than 4 weeks is considered chronic.

### Pediatricians' knowledge, attitude and practice on treating children with red eye disease [^117LKZ5u]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Red eye is defined as sudden redness that appears on the conjunctiva, eyelids, or adjacent structures. It is one of the most common complaints among children. This symptom is usually perceived by pediatricians as resulting from conjunctivitis, but it is not always associated only with eye disorders. Red eye might be a clinical indication of several systemic diseases that might be evidence of a grave condition. Pediatricians are often the first specialists that meet the children suffering from "red eye".

The pediatrician has a crucial role in reaching decisions that involve examining the severity of eye conditions. A single episode of acute conjunctivitis can cause corneal scars that might affect vision or lead to changes in the conjunctiva that result in a chronic degenerative problem or even blindness. Hence, taking an accurate and extensive anamnesis that includes ruling out trauma, a medical history of previous eye surgery, proper pupil testing, and the child's alertness, helps diagnose the cause that requires treatment.

In such cases involving children, the directives of the American Association of Pediatrics recommend beginning with conservative treatment. Sheikh et al. however, proved that use of topical antibiotics versus placebo hastened microbiological and clinical recovery in the first days of the illness, but noted that in most cases the illness disappeared on its own in any case. Furthermore, use of topical antibiotics was found related to a rise in resistance to antibiotics, discomfort to the patient, higher costs for the parents, and an increase in unnecessary use of medications. Moreover, use of topical antibiotics might result in side effects such as allergic reactions and even anaphylactic reactions, aplastic anemia, urticaria, and many others.

The current recommendations of pediatric ophthalmologists for the treatment of conjunctivitis begin with eyelid hygiene and cleaning the discharge, use of artificial tears, and monitoring. However, according to the literature, pediatricians do not often follow this course and tend to prescribe antibiotics.

### Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment [^115mqPVn]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Conjunctivitis is a common problem.

Objective

To examine the diagnosis, management, and treatment of conjunctivitis, including various antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotic use in infectious conjunctivitis and use of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers in allergic conjunctivitis.

Evidence Review

A search of the literature published through March 2013, using PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge database, and the Cochrane Library was performed. Eligible articles were selected after review of titles, abstracts, and references.

Findings

Viral conjunctivitis is the most common overall cause of infectious conjunctivitis and usually does not require treatment; the signs and symptoms at presentation are variable. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the second most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, with most uncomplicated cases resolving in 1 to 2 weeks. Mattering and adherence of the eyelids on waking, lack of itching, and absence of a history of conjunctivitis are the strongest factors associated with bacterial conjunctivitis. Topical antibiotics decrease the duration of bacterial conjunctivitis and allow earlier return to school or work. Conjunctivitis secondary to sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia and gonorrhea requires systemic treatment in addition to topical antibiotic therapy. Allergic conjunctivitis is encountered in up to 40% of the population, but only a small proportion of these individuals seek medical help; itching is the most consistent sign in allergic conjunctivitis, and treatment consists of topical antihistamines and mast cell inhibitors.

Conclusions and Relevance

The majority of cases in bacterial conjunctivitis are self-limiting and no treatment is necessary in uncomplicated cases. However, conjunctivitis caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia and conjunctivitis in contact lens wearers should be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for viral conjunctivitis is supportive. Treatment with antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers alleviates the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

Introduction

Conjunctivitis is a collective term for a diverse group of diseases that are characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. The most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis is viral infection (~80% of cases), followed by bacterial. The noninfectious forms are allergic, mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic. Of noninfectious conjunctivitis, the allergic form is the most common, affecting approximately 40% of the US population. Conjunctivitis can also be classified as acute, chronic, or recurrent, according to the mode of onset and severity of the clinical response. Most cases of viral and bacterial conjunctivitis are considered acute and, less frequently, as hyperacute. The mechanical/irritative/toxic, immune-mediated, and neoplastic forms are typically associated with chronic inflammation, and the toxic form can have an acute onset. Allergic conjunctivitis can be chronic, with possible onset in childhood, and present with acute exacerbations related to seasonal factors or contact lens use, for example.

Conjunctivitis is a highly common presentation in the primary care setting. It is responsible for ~2% of all medical consultations in the United Statesand countless self-referrals to community pharmacies. It is difficult to accurately capture the true epidemiology of conjunctivitis because of the high numbers of patients who may self-medicate or delay or decline to seek medical care, and because of inaccurate diagnosis in the primary medical care setting. Approximately 70% of all patients with acute red eye present to primary care and urgent care, posing a large economic and social burden.–The pharmacoeconomic impact of infectious conjunctivitis is noteworthy and includes the cost of repeat diagnoses, referrals, insurance copays, patient medications, and lost productivity associated with absence from work or school. In the United States, acute conjunctivitis affects an estimated 6 million people per year, and bacterial conjunctivitis treatment alone costs the United States $377–857 million annually. To the best of our knowledge, no health-related quality-of-life studies of patients with acute infectious conjunctivitis have been published.

The purpose of this narrative review is to provide practical guidance on the differentiation of acute infectious conjunctivitis in the primary care setting and to highlight disconnects between diagnosis and treatment.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113brFQi]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The Cochrane collaboration conducted a systematic review and meta-analysisof the management of acute infective conjunctivitis in 2012 that led the authors to conclude that topical antibiotics can be of benefit for the treatment of conjunctivitis in that they improved the clinical cure rates both on days 2 to 5 and on days 6 to 10. That meta-analysis, however, included both adults and children, so that the results cannot be directly generalized to pediatric populations. To our knowledge, the present meta-analysis is the first to date to be based on data from pediatric patient populations alone.

Previous research into the etiology of acute infective conjunctivitis in children has found that approximately 80% of cases are caused by pathogenic bacteria. Accordingly, more than 80% of the children in this RCT had a positive bacterial conjunctival culture. Although most of the present children with acute infective conjunctivitis presented with respiratory tract symptoms, respiratory viruses were only detected in the conjunctivae of 12%, which is in accordance with previous observations.

The strengths of this trial include a randomized, placebo-controlled study design with the inclusion of a control group receiving no treatment, which mimics a clinical situation. We then conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all RCTs we could find that were carried out with pediatric patient populations, including the RCT presented here. The results are directly applicable to primary care settings.

Limitations

This study has limitations. We were not able to compare topical antibiotic therapy with no intervention in the meta-analysis because the present RCT was, to our knowledge, the only trial that had included a control group without an intervention. Moreover, the placebo solutions used in the 4 trials included in the meta-analysis varied, so that we could not assess possible differences between them. Furthermore, we could not compare the efficacy of topical antibiotic therapy separately in children with bacterial and viral conjunctivitis.

### The epidemiology and treatment of conjunctivitis at urgent care centres in Israel [^116oCdmU]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

The weekend in Israel is Friday and Saturday, with Friday being a short workday in some industries. Community health clinics typically have limited hours on Friday morning and are closed from Friday noon to Sunday morning. One would expect more UCC visits during the weekend and this is indeed the case (Table 4). However, the conjunctivitis cohort had a significantly higher percentage of patients during the weekend when compared to UCC (52% vs 34%, p < 0.01).

Table 4
Patients presenting with conjunctivitis and total UCC by day of the week

Distribution of conjunctivitis among different branches of UCC showed the highest prevalence of conjunctivitis in Eilat, the southernmost city of Israel, which is located in the desert (4% vs 1.5%, Z = 14.45, p < 0.01).

Conjunctivitis can present alone or as part of a systematic adenoviral infection involving fever and other symptoms. Fever of ≥ 38.0°C was detected in 7.6% (95% CI 6.9–8.3%) of patients presenting with conjunctivitis. Most of the patients with fever (94.8%, 95% CI 92.6–97.0%) were between 1 and 15 years of age. For the subjects without fever (n = 4661), most had a single diagnosis (conjunctivitis or eye disorder) with only 18.4% (95% CI 17.3–19.5%) having multiple diagnoses. In contrast, significantly more subjects with conjunctivitis presenting with fever (79.4%, 95% CI 75.4–83.5%, p < 0.001) had an additional diagnosis such as pneumonia or upper respiratory infection.

We assessed whether a prescription was given to the patients presenting with conjunctivitis. Most conjunctivitis patients (81.9%, 95% CI 80.9–83.0%) received a prescription for topical antibiotics. For young pediatric patients aged 0–5 (who comprised 31% [95% CI 29.5–32.1%] of the total cohort), 88.9% (95% CI 87.4–90.5%) received topical antibiotics. Of these, 78.0% (95% CI 75.8–80.2%) suffered from purulent ocular discharge.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^117SpSi8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis can be difficult. Clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Also, discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms contributes to a high rate of misdiagnosis and overuse of antibiotic treatment. Therefore, in order to effectively treat acute infectious conjunctivitis, physicians must be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms and available diagnostic tests that can provide a more accurate differential diagnosis.

Challenges of Acute Infectious Conjunctivitis Management and Diagnosis

Eye care professionals tend to evaluate acute infectious conjunctivitis cases at secondary care visits. Patients with infectious conjunctivitis are suboptimally managed in primary care due to an underappreciation of the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis, as well as frequent antibiotic prescriptions (~80%) for infectious conjunctivitis, despite guidelines that discourage antibiotic use for minor self-limiting illnesses. Antibiotic prescription is a measure of presumed diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis, but the rate of clinical accuracy in diagnosing viral conjunctivitis may be < 50%. Observational evidence indicates that laboratory confirmation isolates bacterial pathogens in just 30–50% of suspected cases.

Misdiagnoses expose patients to unnecessary and ineffective antibiotic treatment. In the Antibiotic Resistance Monitoring in Ocular Microorganisms (ARMOR) surveillance study of 3237 ocular isolates collected from patients with bacterial eye infections (from 72 US centers from 2009 to 2013), nearly one-half had methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Although the contribution of topical antibiotics to antibiotic resistance is not easily confirmed, current resistance trends should be considered before treating common eye infections with antibiotics. Furthermore, prescribing antibiotics in cases of unconfirmed bacterial infection is not compliant with Antibiotic Stewardship initiatives, which are part of primary care and pediatric practice protocols. In addition to the risk of antibiotic resistance, misdiagnosis can result in recurrent cases of infectious conjunctivitis, particularly among pediatric patients, or in cases that progress to serious ocular and extra-ocular complications.

There are several challenges to accurately diagnosing acute infectious conjunctivitis. First, clinical ambiguity exists between the acute viral and bacterial as well as the allergic forms, which can confound diagnosis. Discrimination between viral or bacterial origins of infectious conjunctivitis based on historical, nonspecific, clinical signs and symptoms, such as type of discharge, is difficult and not supported by evidence-based diagnostic criteria. Routine bacteriologic examinations are neither typically performed nor practical in the management of clinically suspected acute bacterial conjunctivitis, except in neonates. Culturing should also be considered for immunocompromised patients or for patients with hyperacute cases of infectious conjunctivitis. The misdiagnosis of infectious conjunctivitis is compounded by the view that all cases should be treated with topical ophthalmic antibiotics, even though most are self-limiting. Social factors, such as school policies or pressure to reduce absence from work, may also influence general practitioners to prescribe topical antibiotics. Lastly, the level at which patients enter the health care system can impact the accuracy of the diagnosis.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Qqqrs]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Primary and Secondary Outcomes of the RCT

The primary outcome was time (days) to clinical cure, defined as resolution of all conjunctival symptoms without relapse for 2 days. The secondary outcome was a relapse of conjunctivitis within 14 days of randomization. The outcomes were identified from the daily symptom sheet diaries that the parents completed for 14 days. In addition, the physician contacted the parents after the 14-day follow-up to ensure a clinical cure.

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis

RCTs were considered eligible if they compared topical or systemic antibiotics for the management of acute conjunctivitis in children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years with a control group without antibiotic therapy. We identified the literature in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus from database inception up to November 9, 2021, using the Medical Subjects Headings terms conjunctivitis, bacterial NOT trachoma for the literature search. Two investigators (M.H. and U.K.) independently screened the titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies according to the given inclusion criteria. After that, 3 investigators (M.H. U.K. and T.T.) reviewed the full manuscripts to determine those to be included and excluded. Data for all variables were extracted independently by 3 investigators (M.H. U.K. and T.T.).

The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was the proportion of participants who had conjunctival symptoms on days 3 to 6, while secondary outcomes were the proportion of participants who had conjunctival symptoms on days 7 to 10 and the proportion without a microbiological cure on days 7 to 10. The trials were assessed for the risk of bias independently by 3 investigators (M.H. U.K. and T.T.) using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials, and consensus was reached by discussion.

### Efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in paediatric population with purulent bacterial conjunctivitis [^1176UJyc]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Randomised controlled studies with, when possible, stratification by age group (ie, neonates, infants, children and adolescent) and designed to establish the efficacy and safety of medicinal products in the paediatric population are strongly encouraged by regulatory health authorities. Most currently licensed topical antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis have been approved based on clinical studies conducted mainly in adults, with insufficient clinical data in newborns and infants (ie, < 24 months). This study has now established the efficacy and safety of azithromycin 1.5% eye drops in children with an average age of 3 years old. Patients were mainly recruited in hospital centres where usually only very young children are seen for treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. This enabled recruitment of a large proportion (> 50%) of patients younger than 24 months old compared with other studies that mostly involved children in an older age range.

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter, controlled clinical trials in which patients were dosed 3 times a day for 4 days, moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution produced clinical cures on Day 5–6 in 66% to 69% of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis. Microbiological success rates for the eradication of baseline pathogens ranged from 84% to 94%.

In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis between birth and 31 days of age, patients were dosed with moxifloxacin or another anti-infective agent. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80% at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 92% at Day 9.

Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.

Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment

We created and piloted a data-extraction form. One investigator extracted the data, and a second investigator verified the data. We extracted data to determine the characteristics of the study, the effects of treatments, and the risk of bias, and the risk of bias. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies, because the articles we found reported the effects of only 1 treatment with no comparison. For before–after studies of 1 treatment, we did not answer the question of comparability of the groups. We resolved disagreements by discussion between the 2 investigators

Analysis and Assessment of the Evidence

We conducted a meta-analysis of dichotomous outcomes by using a random-effects generic inverse-variance method to calculate pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in Review Manager 5.1 (Nordic Cochrane Center and the Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). Two investigators evaluated the certainty of evidence for each outcome by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach and resolved any discrepancies. We assessed all GRADE domains, that is, risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias, large effect, presence of a dose response, and plausible opposing confounders. According to the GRADE, we present the certainty of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^111EfRJx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

This multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial was specifically conducted in children and included a large proportion of neonates and infants (55.9% and 54.5% of the azithromycin and tobramycin groups, respectively, were less than 2 years old); azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops produced a statistically superior clinical cure rate compared with tobramycin 0.3% at day 3 (47.1% vs 28.7% respectively, P = 0.013), a statistically noninferior clinical cure rate at day 7 (89.2% vs 78.2% respectively), and similar bacteriological resolution rates at day 7 (89.8% vs 87.2% respectively).

In addition to bacteriology and cure rates, the aforementioned study collected data on disease outcome, in terms of clinical signs and ocular symptoms, and the satisfaction and acceptability of treatment with topical antibiotics. Since there is currently almost no data on the burden of the disease and its management from a patient and parent perspective, the objective of the current report is to present this previously unreported data on the comparison of azithromycin eyedrops with tobramycin eyedrops on these parameters.

### Tratamiento de la conjuntivitis… [^112zLTt3]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Tratamiento En ocasiones, es importante buscar atención médica para la conjuntivitis. Sin embargo, no siempre es necesaria. Para ayudar a aliviar algo de la inflamación y sequedad causadas por la conjuntivitis, puede usar compresas frías y lágrimas artificiales. Estas se pueden comprar sin receta. También debe dejar de usar sus lentes de contacto hasta que el médico de los ojos le diga que puede volver a usarlos. Si no fue necesario consultar al médico, no use sus lentes de contacto hasta que ya no tenga síntomas de la conjuntivitis. Un médico puede recetar un medicamento antiviral para tratar formas más graves de conjuntivitis. Por ejemplo, la conjuntivitis causada por el herpes simple o la causada por el virus de la varicela-zóster. Los antibióticos no mejorarán la conjuntivitis viral, ya que estos medicamentos no son eficaces contra los virus.

Conjuntivitis bacteriana Los casos leves de conjuntivitis bacteriana pueden mejorar sin la necesidad de tratamiento con antibióticos y sin que causen ninguna complicación. Suelen mejorar en un lapso de 2 a 5 días sin tratamiento, pero pueden tardar 2 semanas en desaparecer por completo. Si la conjuntivitis es bacteriana, el médico podría recetarle antibióticos, que generalmente son gotas o pomada de administración tópica. Los antibióticos pueden ayudar a reducir la duración de la infección, las complicaciones y la transmisión a otras personas. Podrían ser necesarios:

- Cuando hay secreciones
- Cuando la conjuntivitis ocurre en una persona que tiene el sistema inmunitario debilitado
- Cuando se presume la presencia de ciertas bacterias Hable con el médico sobre las mejores opciones de tratamiento para su infección.

Conjuntivitis alérgica La conjuntivitis causada por alérgenos generalmente mejora cuando se elimina el alérgeno del ambiente de la persona. Los medicamentos para la alergia y ciertas gotas para los ojos, incluidas algunas gotas para los ojos que requieren receta médica, pueden también aliviar la conjuntivitis alérgica. En algunos casos, el médico puede recomendar una combinación de medicamentos para mejorar los síntomas. Si tiene conjuntivitis causada por una alergia, el médico puede ayudarlo.

### Does this patient with acute infectious conjunctivitis have a bacterial infection? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^112ByJSW]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute infectious conjunctivitis is characterized by ocular redness and discharge, and is a common clinical entity. Evidence-based tools to aid the clinical diagnosis of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis are lacking and may contribute to overprescribing of topical antibiotics.

Objective

To determine the relative prevalence of viral vs bacterial conjunctivitis in adults and children, and to determine which symptoms or signs are suggestive of a viral vs bacterial etiology.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (January 1946-March 2022) yielded 1891 articles. Included articles were rated using a quality score based on a modified Rational Clinical Examination grading system. Methodological quality levels 1 through 4 required a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis, whereas quality level 5 (the lowest quality) used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Study Selection

Consecutive series of patients presenting with acute infectious conjunctivitis and case series of viral or bacterial conjunctivitis alone. Thirty-two studies were included in a meta-analysis to determine prevalence and diagnostic accuracy measures; 27 used a microbiological reference standard for diagnosis and 5 used a clinical reference standard for diagnosis.

Results

In studies involving children (5 studies; 881 patients; mean age, 4.7 years [age range, 1 month-18 years]), the prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was higher than viral conjunctivitis (71% vs 16%, respectively, P = 0.01). In the only study of adults (n = 207 patients; mean age, 25.7 years), the prevalence of viral conjunctivitis was higher than bacterial conjunctivitis (78% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001). For the primary analysis of level 1 (n = 6) and level 2 (n = 5) studies (1725 patients total), the clinical findings that best distinguished a viral etiology for conjunctivitis from a bacterial etiology included pharyngitis (sensitivity range, 0.55–0.58; specificity range, 0.89–0.94; positive likelihood ratio [LR] range, 5.4–9.9), preauricular lymphadenopathy (sensitivity range, 0.17–0.31; specificity range, 0.93–0.94; positive LR range, 2.5–5.6), and contact with another person with red eye (sensitivity, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.14–0.22]; specificity, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.90–0.95]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.6–3.7]). Mucopurulent ocular discharge (sensitivity, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.87); specificity, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.58–0.73]; positive LR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.7–2.6]) and otitis media (sensitivity, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.20–0.29]; specificity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85–0.94]; positive LR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5–4.4]) were associated with the presence of bacterial conjunctivitis.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this review, bacterial conjunctivitis was more common than viral conjunctivitis in children and viral conjunctivitis was more common than bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, although the prevalence estimates were based on limited evidence. Symptoms and signs associated with a higher likelihood of viral conjunctivitis in adults and children included concomitant pharyngitis, an enlarged preauricular node, and contact with another person with red eye, and signs associated with a higher likelihood of bacterial conjunctivitis included the presence of mucopurulent discharge and otitis media, but no single symptom or sign differentiated the 2 conditions with high certainty.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^116X875N]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye infections, accounting for 70%–80% of all cases of infectious conjunctivitis in children.–It is mainly characterized by purulent discharge, moderate diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, and burning or stinging sensations. Follicular reaction of palpebral conjunctiva, eyelid erythema, and swelling are also common clinical signs. In preschool- and school-age children, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common pathogens, and thus quite different from the bacteriological profile in adults in whom Staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and S. aureus pathogens are predominantly found.–

Although bacterial conjunctivitis generally resolves spontaneously in a few days, there is broad agreement that topical antibiotics are worthwhile, particularly in moderate to severe infection, to shorten the course of the illness and allow the child to return to school and other daily activities. Choice of antibiotic is usually informed predominantly by the clinician's judgment since the results of microbial tests are generally not available at the initial consultation.

Azithromycin 1.5% ocular solution is approved for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in adults as well as in children (including infants and neonates) and has a shorter and less frequent therapeutic scheme than conventional antibiotic eyedrops. The 3-day twice-daily regimen with azithromycin 1.5% ocular solution is much shorter and requires less frequent daily administrations. In addition, azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops have been recently shown to provide a more rapid clinical cure than tobramycin 0.3% eyedrops in the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in the pediatric population. Although several topical antibiotics are employed in this indication in children, tobramycin 0.3% was chosen as comparator because it can be considered a standard of care and has been widely investigated.–Although other twice-daily preparations such as fusidic acid are available, they are generally formulated as an ophthalmic gel that is somewhat less convenient for use in young children. Moreover, tobramycin has been used as comparator in other similar studies.
