## Question

Guidelines for line associated thrombus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for line-associated thrombus, including diagnosis, anticoagulation, catheter management, special populations, and prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entity and scope. Then, I should verify diagnostic thresholds and imaging. Next, I will examine anticoagulation choices and durations across adult and pediatric populations. After that, I need to check catheter removal strategies and timing. I will then consider special scenarios like thrombolysis, infection, and right-atrial thrombi. Finally, I should review prevention and synthesize a practical algorithm with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and scope. Line-associated thrombus, also called catheter-related thrombosis, refers to venous thrombosis linked to central venous catheters, including PICCs, tunneled lines, and implanted ports, and it is a common noninfectious complication in oncology, critical care, and pediatrics, with incidence estimates around 1–5% per catheter and higher in certain populations, though figures vary by device, vein, and patient factors [^114SBjfz] [^113WMEsm].

> I need to verify diagnostic thresholds and imaging. Clinically, patients may present with swelling, erythema, collateral veins, pain, or catheter malfunction; however, many thromboses are asymptomatic, so duplex ultrasound is the first-line modality to confirm thrombus and assess extent, with D-dimer having limited standalone utility and CT venography reserved for equivocal cases or when ultrasound is limited by body habitus or edema [^114SBjfz].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation choices and durations in adults with cancer. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on LMWH as preferred initial therapy for at least 3 months, and as long as the catheter remains in place, with VKAs or DOACs as alternatives when LMWH is not feasible; DOACs are increasingly acceptable for short-term treatment in selected patients, though data in CRT are less robust and bleeding risk must be weighed carefully, especially in gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignancies [^111DiCD1] [^112juAb1] [^116Jv2gY] [^116Jv2gY] [^112TB7nP].

> Hold on, I should verify catheter management principles. If the catheter is functional, well-positioned, and not infected, guidelines favor keeping it in place with therapeutic anticoagulation and close surveillance; if it is nonfunctional, no longer needed, infected, or if symptoms persist despite anticoagulation, removal is indicated, ideally after 3–5 days of therapeutic anticoagulation to mitigate embolic risk, though the optimal timing remains uncertain and should be individualized [^1113AQUw] [^114sJiSB] [^113qEEeH].

> Let me consider special scenarios. Thrombolysis is not first-line for CRT but may be considered case-by-case for extensive, limb- or life-threatening thrombosis or refractory symptoms after catheter removal; catheter-directed approaches are preferred over systemic lysis when feasible, and low-dose intraluminal tPA can restore patency for occluded lines without addressing extraluminal thrombus [^112a7hNX] [^113x9sEH] [^1117nvhd] [^111MDzjS].

> I should double-check pediatric guidance because it differs. In children with symptomatic CVAD-related thrombosis, anticoagulation for at least 3 months and as long as the line remains is recommended, with LMWH or UFH as acceptable options; for nonfunctioning or unneeded CVADs, removal is favored, and if removed, many guidelines advise 3–5 days of anticoagulation beforehand, though evidence certainty is low and some updated pediatric guidance allows flexibility based on clot burden and shunt physiology [^117RKTHH] [^111RHaC6] [^111wnze9] [^1176USFo].

> But wait, what about neonates and infants. In this group, spontaneous resolution of nonocclusive clots is common, so a watchful waiting approach with serial ultrasound is reasonable for low-risk thrombi; anticoagulation is indicated for occlusive clots, organ- or limb-threatening disease, or progression, and thrombolysis is generally avoided unless there is critical compromise, with management often extrapolated from limited pediatric data [^111C37mH] [^112vd93r] [^115RAatm].

> Next, I should review prevention, and I need to ensure I do not overstate prophylaxis. Routine pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis solely for the presence of a CVC is not recommended in adults or children with cancer; instead, emphasis is on optimal catheter selection and positioning, with implanted ports favored over PICCs when feasible, and meticulous maintenance practices including routine flushing to reduce fibrin buildup [^117PBB9Z] [^113TseDv] [^116iUqz1] [^1148aWi4].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm while acknowledging uncertainties. Confirm diagnosis with duplex ultrasound and assess catheter function and infection status; if the catheter is functional and not infected, start therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH for at least 3 months and as long as the line remains, reassessing periodically; if the catheter is nonfunctional, infected, or no longer needed, plan removal after 3–5 days of anticoagulation when feasible; reserve thrombolysis for extensive or refractory cases with careful bleeding risk assessment; in pediatrics, apply the same principles with greater caution and tailor to developmental hemostasis and access needs [^111DiCD1] [^1113AQUw] [^112a7hNX] [^117RKTHH].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats. Evidence quality for many CRT decisions is low or very low, especially around catheter timing and pediatric management, so shared decision-making and individualized risk–benefit assessment are essential; DOACs are reasonable in select adults but not yet standard for CRT; and ongoing vigilance for bleeding, infection, and catheter malfunction should guide adjustments over time [^1176USFo] [^116SRMPg] [^111HNgDK].

---

Line-associated thrombus (LAT) is best managed with **LMWH for at least 3 months** [^111DiCD1] and as long as the catheter remains in place [^112juAb1], keeping the catheter if it is functional, well-positioned, and not infected [^1113AQUw]. Remove the catheter if it is nonfunctional, infected, or if symptoms persist despite anticoagulation [^114sJiSB]; if removed, give 3–5 days of anticoagulation before removal to reduce embolic risk [^113qEEeH]. Thrombolysis is reserved for **life- or limb-threatening cases** [^112a7hNX] [^1179vxBg]. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended [^117PBB9Z]; prefer implanted ports over PICCs when feasible [^116iUqz1] [^112fbnmb].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Clinical suspicion**: LAT should be suspected with unilateral limb swelling, erythema, pain, or catheter malfunction [^114SBjfz].

- **Imaging**: Duplex ultrasound is first-line to confirm thrombosis and assess extent [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: D-dimer may aid diagnosis but is nonspecific; use with clinical assessment [^114SBjfz].

---

## General management principles

- **Anticoagulation**: Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation promptly to prevent thrombus extension and embolization [^111DiCD1].

- **Catheter management**: Decide to keep or remove based on function, position, infection, and response to therapy [^1113AQUw].

- **Monitoring**: Use serial ultrasounds to track thrombus resolution and detect complications [^notfound].

---

## Anticoagulation therapy

### Initial anticoagulation

LMWH is **first-line** (e.g. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg once daily) [^117VFxLB] for at least 3 months [^111DiCD1] and as long as the catheter remains [^112juAb1]. UFH is an alternative when LMWH is contraindicated (e.g. severe renal impairment) [^notfound]. DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban) may be considered in select patients, though evidence in LAT is limited [^116SRMPg] [^113AhLwo].

---

### Duration of anticoagulation

A **minimum of 3 months** is recommended for all patients with LAT [^111DiCD1] [^116Jv2gY]. If the catheter remains in place, continue anticoagulation as long as the catheter is present [^112juAb1] [^111WvEaC]. Individualize duration based on clot resolution, ongoing need for the catheter, and bleeding risk [^117D8kc6].

---

## Catheter management

### Indications for catheter removal

- **Nonfunctional catheter**: Remove if no longer needed or not working [^114sJiSB].

- **Infection**: Remove if catheter-related infection is present [^notfound].

- **Persistent symptoms**: Remove if symptoms persist despite adequate anticoagulation [^114sJiSB].

- **Patient preference**: Remove if requested and clinically feasible [^notfound].

---

### Timing of catheter removal

Delay removal for **3–5 days of therapeutic anticoagulation** to reduce embolic risk [^113qEEeH] [^112nF3ff]. Immediate removal without anticoagulation is reserved for cases with contraindications to anticoagulation [^113rEF1N].

---

## Special considerations

### Thrombolysis

Thrombolysis is reserved for **life- or limb-threatening thrombosis** with careful bleeding risk assessment [^112a7hNX] [^1179vxBg]. Agents such as alteplase may be used locally or systemically depending on severity and access [^111MDzjS].

---

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **anticoagulation** should follow adult principles, with LMWH or UFH for at least 3 months and as long as the catheter remains [^117RKTHH]. Catheter removal should be delayed until after 3–5 days of anticoagulation when feasible [^116jW6NR] [^112nF3ff].

---

## Prevention strategies

Routine prophylaxis is **not recommended** for patients with central venous catheters [^117PBB9Z] [^113TseDv]. Catheter selection favors implanted ports over PICCs when feasible to reduce thrombosis risk [^116iUqz1] [^112fbnmb]. Optimal catheter positioning places the tip at the SVC–right atrium junction to minimize thrombosis [^111DFQS8] [^112P5NUk].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Imaging with **serial ultrasounds** should assess thrombus resolution and detect complications [^notfound]. Clinical assessment should monitor for recurrent thrombosis, bleeding, and catheter-related issues [^111HNgDK].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic LAT | - LMWH for ≥ 3 months [^111DiCD1] <br/> - Keep catheter if functional and uninfected [^1113AQUw] |

### NEOnatal central-venous line observational study on thrombosis (NEOCLOT): evaluation of a national guideline on management of neonatal catheter-related thrombosis [^111yjyFR]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In critically ill (preterm) neonates, central venous catheters (CVCs) are increasingly used for administration of medication or parenteral nutrition. A serious complication, however, is the development of catheter-related thrombosis (CVC-thrombosis), which may resolve by itself or cause severe complications. Due to lack of evidence, management of neonatal CVC-thrombosis varies among neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). In the Netherlands an expert-based national management guideline has been developed which is implemented in all 10 NICUs in 2014.

Methods

The NEOCLOT study is a multicentre prospective observational cohort study, including 150 preterm and term infants (0–6 months) admitted to one of the 10 NICUs, developing CVC-thrombosis. Patient characteristics, thrombosis characteristics, risk factors, treatment strategies and outcome measures will be collected in a web-based database. Management of CVC-thrombosis will be performed as recommended in the protocol. Violations of the protocol will be noted. Primary outcome measures are a composite efficacy outcome consisting of death due to CVC-thrombosis and recurrent thrombosis, and a safety outcome consisting of the incidence of major bleedings during therapy. Secondary outcomes include individual components of primary efficacy outcome, clinically relevant non-major and minor bleedings and the frequency of risk factors, protocol variations, residual thrombosis and post thrombotic syndrome.

Discussion

The NEOCLOT study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new, national, neonatal CVC-thrombosis guideline. Furthermore, risk factors as well as long-term consequences of CVC-thrombosis will be analysed.

CVAD-related thrombosis — timing of removal for nonfunctioning or unneeded CVAD: The ASH guideline panel suggests delayed removal of a CVAD until after initiation of anticoagulation (days), rather than immediate removal, in pediatric patients with symptomatic central venous line–related thrombosis who no longer require venous access or in whom the CVAD is nonfunctioning (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks highlight avoiding potential emboli leading to PE or paradoxical stroke by a few days of anticoagulation, with small risk of infection and bleeding before removal.

### Clinical challenges in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis: Canadian expert consensus recommendations [^111E5qwe]. Current Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for catheter-related thrombosis, more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, CCG-CAT 2015 guidelines recommend to treat catheter-related cancer-associated DVT if the thrombus involves the deep veins, such as the axillary and subclavian, or more proximal veins. Consider obtaining close clinical surveillance (symptom resolution, serial ultrasound) alternative to treatment for thrombosis involving the brachial deep vein or the basilic and cephalic superficial veins.

### Updated American College of Chest Physicians guideline… [^1167MBZy]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line The guideline covers a lot of ground. Key updates include a clear preference for direct oral anti-coagulants, including in patients with cancer, and low-dose apixaban or rivaroxaban for extended-phase anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked VTE. There is greater leeway for observation only of selected patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism or isolated distal lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and outpatient treatment of selected patients with PE. Synopsis The latest update to the American College of Chest Physicians guideline regarding antithrombotic therapy for VTE adds four new recommendations and updates eight others. The authors identified an initiation phase when anticoagulants are first given, a treatment phase of three months, and an extended phase for selected patients beyond three months.

For patients with acute isolated distal DVT, the guidelines recommend two weeks of serial imaging, with anticoagulation only if the DVT extends or the patient has severe symptoms or risk factors for extension. A direct oral anticoagulant is recommended as first-line therapy. An exception should be made for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, for whom warfarin is recommended during the treatment phase. Extended-phase low-dose anticoagulation with apixaban, 2. 5 mg twice daily, or rivaroxaban, 10 mg once daily, is recommended for all patients with unprovoked VTE. This has only been studied for two to four years, so extending anticoagulation beyond that is of uncertain benefit. Aspirin is recommended when patients discontinue extended-phase anticoagulation.

For patients with PE, thrombolytics are recommended only for patients with hypotension initially or who deteriorate clinically, assuming they do not have high bleeding risk. For those with a high bleeding risk or for those whom thrombolysis was ineffective, catheter-assisted thrombus removal is recommended. Inferior vena cava filters are recommended only for patients with DVT who have a contraindication to anticoagulation. For patients with cerebral vein or venous sinus thrombosis, anticoagulation is recommended. Compression stockings are not recommended for patients with acute DVT.

### From prevention to treatment: comprehensive strategies for the management of Staphylococcus aureus induced catheter-related bloodstream infections [^116Tq7cj]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a prominent pathogen that frequently causes catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in hemodialysis patients with tunneled central lines. The guidelines' key recommendation for managing SA-induced CRBSIs is to remove the infected catheter. In real life, however, this may be hindered by logistical or clinical problems (e.g. unavailability of surgical rooms, incarcerated catheters, catheter-associated thrombosis). Furthermore, an interventional approach may expose patients to complications, such as those related to the procedure itself or the development of central vein stenoses. Prospective observational studies seem to support the possibility of preserving the infected line in case of early pathogen identification and CRBSI management with empirical large-spectrum antibiotics, followed by targeted treatment once the antibiogram is available. Further options for the treatment and prevention of SA-induced infections are becoming available, leading to a rapidly evolving therapeutic scenario. This review aims to perform a multidisciplinary revision of the available evidence and current unsolved problems, focusing on future perspectives for the management and prevention of SA-induced CRBSIs in hemodialysis patients.

### Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) in patients with solid tumors: a narrative review and clinical guidance for daily care [^113WMEsm]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Central venous access devices (CVADs) including central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are essential in the treatment of cancer. Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is the most frequent non-infectious complication associated with the use of central lines. The development of CRT may cause to delays in oncologic treatment and increase morbidity leading to potentially life-threatening complications. Several local and systemic risk factors are associated with the development of CRT and should be taken into account to prevent CRT by standardizing appropriate catheter placement and maintenance. The use of primary pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in order to avoid CRT is not routinely recommended, although it can be considered in selected cases. Recommendations for the management of established CRT are based on the extrapolation of anticoagulation for lower limb venous thrombosis. The present review summarizes the current evidence and recommendations for the prevention and management of CRT and identifies areas that require further research.

### Hemodialysis catheter-related central venous thrombosis: clinical approach to evaluation and management [^111Cd73o]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Central venous catheter (CVC) use is common among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Catheter-related vascular thrombosis is a frequent complication, which results in catheter dysfunction. This may eliminate the affected vein as a potential route of vascular access and leads to significant morbidity of the limbs involved. Despite increasing prevalence, there is a dearth of evidence-based guidelines for managing such catheter-related thrombi, often leading to treatment dilemmas in clinical practice. Minimizing the use of CVCs for hemodialysis remains the best approach in preventing such adverse complications. Furthermore, meticulous planning and care when using such catheters in unavoidable circumstances along with vigilant surveillance to identify complications early will allow to avoid associated morbidity.

Central venous access device (CVAD)-related superficial vein thrombosis in pediatric patients — anticoagulation choice: The ASH guideline panel suggests using either anticoagulation or no anticoagulation in pediatric patients with CVAD-related superficial vein thrombosis (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), with very little direct or indirect data. Panel remarks indicated that, in most patients, no anticoagulation will be appropriate; however, anticoagulation seems appropriate for patients who have a CVAD line that is still functioning and who continue to need venous access, as well as in those whose symptoms progress. Evidence summaries note no pediatric studies, no pediatric data to assess major outcomes or adverse events with significant imprecision in indirect data, a panel survey suggesting no difference in major outcomes with treatment compared with no treatment, and that there was no major bleeding if no anticoagulation was given. The panel judged that no anticoagulation was appropriate but specified exceptions for patients with progressive symptoms, particularly difficult vascular access, or strong preferences, and concluded there is very low certainty in evidence for a net health benefit or harm so individual patient factors will alter the decision.

### International clinical practice guidelines including guidance for direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^111UbkNa]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the second leading cause of death in patients with cancer. These patients are at an increased risk of developing VTE and are more likely to have a recurrence of VTE and bleeding while taking anticoagulants. Management of VTE in patients with cancer is a major therapeutic challenge and remains suboptimal worldwide. In 2013, the International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer (ITAC-CME), established to reduce the global burden of VTE in patients with cancer, published international guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE and central venous catheter-associated thrombosis. The rapid global adoption of direct oral anticoagulants for management of VTE in patients with cancer is an emerging treatment trend that needs to be addressed based on the current level of evidence. In this Review, we provide an update of the ITAC-CME consensus recommendations based on a systematic review of the literature ranked according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation scale. These guidelines aim to address in-hospital and outpatient cancer-associated VTE in specific subgroups of patients with cancer.

National guideline

How to choose between the four therapeutic options in neonates with thrombosis? The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based guideline of 2012 recommends either to treat neonatal CVC-thrombosis with anticoagulants and/or to monitor it with ultrasonography. Anticoagulant agents should be administered if extension of thrombosis occurs. The ACCP guideline discourages thrombolytic therapy for neonatal CVC-thrombosis unless major vein occlusion is causing critical comprise of organs or limbs. Yang et al. tried to outline high-risk right atrial thrombosis in a literature review of 122 neonates and children (41% were preterm infants). They defined right atrial thrombosis as high-risk if thrombosis was large, pedunculated, mobile, or snake-shaped and mobile. A significant difference in mortality was found between the high-risk group (16,7%; 3 of 18) and the low-risk group (0%; 0 of 32).

The NEOCLOT working group has refined the ACCP recommendations into a more detailed guideline based on the scarce data and expert opinion in order to standardize treatment of neonatal CVC-thrombosis nationally. For the management of neonatal CVC-thrombosis a distinction was made between CVC-thrombosis located in a blood vein (non-occlusive versus occlusive) and CVC-thrombosis located in the right atrium. Furthermore, high-risk (life-threatening) thrombosis was defined (Figs. 1 and 2). In the NEOCLOT study, evaluation of this new guideline will be performed. This article describes the study protocol of the NEOCLOT study.

### 2008 SOR guidelines for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis associated with central venous catheters in patients with cancer: report from the working group [^111DFQS8]. Annals of Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In view of the lack of recommendations on central venous catheter (CVC)-associated thrombosis in cancer patients, we established guidelines according to the well-standardized Standards, Options and Recommendations methodology.

Material and Methods

A literature review (1990–2007) on CVC-associated thrombosis was carried out. The guidelines were developed on the basis of the corresponding levels of evidence derived from analysis of the 36 of 175 publications selected. They were then peer reviewed by 65 independent experts.

Results

For the prevention of CVC-associated thrombosis, the distal tip of the CVC should be placed at the junction between the superior cava vein and right atrium; anticoagulants are not recommended. Treatment of CVC-associated thrombosis should be based on the prolonged use of low-molecular weight heparins. Maintenance of the catheter is justified if it is mandatory, functional, in the right position, and not infected, with a favorable clinical evolution under close monitoring; anticoagulant treatment should then be continued as long as the catheter is present.

Conclusions

Several rigorous studies do not support the use of anticoagulants for the prevention of CVC-associated thrombosis. Treatment of CVC-associated thrombosis relies on the same principles as those applied in the treatment of established thrombosis in cancer patients.

### NEOnatal central-venous line observational study on thrombosis (NEOCLOT): evaluation of a national guideline on management of neonatal catheter-related thrombosis [^112JeX5N]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Methods/design

Aim of the study

The primary aim of the NEOCLOT study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the management of CVC-thrombosis in neonates as advised in the national guideline for neonatal CVC-thrombosis. Secondary aims include the evaluation of risk factors for neonatal CVC-thrombosis, the adherence to the guideline and the frequency of chronic complications of neonatal CVC-thrombosis after 1 year of follow-up.

Study design and setting

The NEOCLOT study is a multi-center prospective observational cohort study conducted in all 10 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the Netherlands. The inclusion period will be at least 5 years. All patients will be followed for a minimum of 1 year. The Medical Ethics Review Committee confirmed that official approval of this study was not required as the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act did not apply to the NEOCLOT study. (#14.17.0121).

Study population

Inclusion criteria

All preterm and term infants (0–6 months) admitted on one of the NICUs with CVC-thrombosis will be included.

Diagnosis of CVC-thrombosis

Symptoms of neonatal CVC-thrombosis include swelling, erythema, skin discoloration, increased warmth, pain, and/or tenderness of the affected arm or leg, venous distension, presence of subcutaneous collateral veins, superior vena cava syndrome, loss of central venous catheter patency, prolonged catheter-related septicaemia, unexplained thrombocytopenia, arrhythmia and hemodynamic instability. Symptomatic CVC-thrombosis has to be confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography. CVC-thrombosis is diagnosed via ultrasonography if a non-compressible segment of a vein, absence of flow, or an echogenic intraluminal thrombus is present.

CVC-thrombosis in a vein is defined as a non-obstructive clot if blood flow is still present and as an obstructive clot if blood flow is absent. High-risk CVC-thrombosis in veins is defined as thrombosis which compromises an organ or limb. High-risk thrombosis in the right atrium is defined as thrombosis, which 1) restricts the outflow from the right atrium via the tricuspid valve, 2) extends via the tricuspid valve or patent foramen ovale, 3) causes severe arrhythmias, 4) causes hemodynamic instability, 5) is pedunculated, mobile, or snake-shaped and mobile, and 6) grows despite adequate therapeutic heparin levels.

### Tunnelled dialysis catheter tract haemorrhage during mechanical thrombectomy of right atrial line-associated thrombus and line removal: a case report [^114y55ga]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We describe a rare combination of catheter related complications. We are unaware of any previous published examples of tract haemorrhage shown fluoroscopically. Although mechanical thrombectomy can be a valuable intervention for removing thrombi in the right atrium, particularly in context of infected clot, further good quality evidence is needed to support its use.

This case underscores the need for further research into paediatric-specific guidelines for thrombectomy and catheter management to minimise complications and improve patient outcomes.

### NEOnatal central-venous line observational study on thrombosis (NEOCLOT): evaluation of a national guideline on management of neonatal catheter-related thrombosis [^115RAatm]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Advances in medical and surgical management has improved survival of sick (preterm) neonates, but has caused an increased incidence of thrombo-embolic complications. Lack of prospective clinical trials of antithrombotic treatment in (preterm) neonates leads to extrapolation of results of adult management studies to children. However, extrapolation of adult results to (preterm) neonates is difficult due to differences between neonatal and adult hemostasis and the presence of severe underlying medical conditions increasing the risk of bleeding complications in these vulnerable infants.

Furthermore, natural history of neonatal thrombosis seems to differ from that of adult thrombosis, as about 50% of neonatal thrombi appears to vanish without anticoagulant therapy. Determination of the natural history of neonatal thrombosis and identification of these "non-risky" thrombi is important to safely withhold anticoagulation in future patients.

As result of the national guideline, antithrombotic treatment of neonatal CVC-thrombosis has become identical on all NICUs in the Netherlands. Prospective collection of the neonates treated according to the protocol will enable evaluation of the used management strategy and generate data that can be used in follow-up treatment studies. For example, the NEOCLOT study allows investigating the natural history of specific neonatal catheter-related clots. In the current guideline "non-risky" thrombi were defined as non-obstructive thrombi in veins and thrombi filling less than 50% of the right atrium. Wait and see policy is applied to these thrombi. Results of the NEOCLOT study will show whether it will be safe to withhold anticoagulation in neonates with these thrombi.

### NEOnatal central-venous line observational study on thrombosis (NEOCLOT): evaluation of a national guideline on management of neonatal catheter-related thrombosis [^117F8sK7]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In critically ill (preterm) neonates, central venous catheters (CVCs) are increasingly used for administering medication or parenteral nutrition. These catheters are inserted in umbilical veins, major central veins or in smaller peripheral veins. CVCs are one of the stepping stones in improvement of care for critically ill neonates. However, one of the complications associated with CVC usage is venous thrombosis. The prevalence of neonatal CVC-related thrombosis (CVC-thrombosis) varies from 0.7% to 67% and is dependent on the type of catheter inserted, the diagnostic tests used, the study method and the index of suspicion of thrombosis.

Evidence in literature on optimal management of neonates with CVC-thrombosis is lacking. Only case-series and case reports are available. Therapeutic options include 1) a "wait and see" policy (an expectative policy monitored with ultrasonography), 2) anticoagulant treatment, 3) thrombolysis, and 4) thrombectomy.

The "wait and see" policy

The "wait and see" policy might be an option as spontaneous regression of CVC-thrombosis has been described. Butler-O'Hara et al. reported spontaneous regression in 13 of 24 children with umbilical venous catheter thrombosis after a median duration of 28 days, without anticoagulation. Small retrospective studies confirmed this observation. In addition, Kim et al. prospectively studied the incidence of neonatal portal venous thrombosis associated with catheterization of the umbilical vein. Ultrasonography demonstrated asymptomatic portal venous thrombosis in 43 of 100 neonates. Follow-up ultrasonography showed complete or partial resolution in 20 (56%) of 36 neonates without treatment. A significant negative relationship was found between the initial size of thrombosis and spontaneous clot resolution.

On the other hand, CVC-thrombosis may increase in size and cause potential life-threatening acute and/or chronic complications. CVC-thrombosis in the right atrium may lead to tricuspid valve obstruction, pulmonary embolism with severe respiratory insufficiency and heart failure. Cerebral embolism via a patent foramen ovale may cause stroke. The exact prevalence of these complications remains unknown. However, the potential life threatening character of these complications warrant the use of antithrombotic measures, including anticoagulants, thrombolysis and thrombectomy.

Other EtD criteria and considerations

In pediatric patients diagnosed with a symptomatic CVAD-related thrombosis whose CVAD is no longer needed or functional, determining the need for anticoagulation before removal of the line to potentially decrease the risk of PE or embolic stroke is an important factor. The panel did highlight that most patients do not routinely receive a screening ultrasound to identify asymptomatic thrombosis or bubble studies to look for right-to-left shunting before CVAD removal. The panel does acknowledge that some patients, such as those with a known right-to-left cardiac shunt or large clot burden, may benefit from > 48 hours of anticoagulation before line removal. The panel recognizes that the immediate removal of an unnecessary or nonfunctioning CVAD may not be feasible because of the stability or the patient or the availability of a surgical team and operating suite. The guideline panel did not think that there were feasibility or acceptability considerations that would impair implementation of this recommendation. Evidence profiles with the characteristics of all included studies and the complete EtD framework are online for recommendation 16.

Conclusions and research needs for this recommendation

The guideline panel determined that there is a low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit or harm from either immediate or delayed removal of a CVAD in pediatric patients diagnosed with a CVAD-related VTE whose CVAD is no longer functioning or necessary. Based on the updated evidence, the panel determined the data do not conclusively demonstrate whether > 48 hours of anticoagulation decrease the risk of a PE or embolic stroke in pediatric patients with a CVAD-related thrombosis. There is low certainty that there is an effect of delayed or immediate CVAD removal on other outcomes. However, because of low certainty in the evidence or no published information about other outcomes, the absence of evidence of an effect on these outcomes does not imply that such an effect does not exist.

Central venous access device (CVAD)–associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) — device removal and timing: If the CVAD is not functional or no longer required, the panel "agreed to make a strong recommendation for removal of the CVAD", while noting that "the optimal timing of removal was deemed uncertain". Prior literature "recommended delaying removal until after 3 to 5 days of anticoagulation", but "there are no outcome data to support an optimal timing of CVAD removal", and decisions may need to be individualized when thrombosis extends/embolizes despite adequate anticoagulation. Identified research needs include establishing "the optimal timing of CVAD removal" and assessing subgroups in whom approach may vary, including risk of CVAD-associated sepsis.

### Update on guidelines for the management of cancer-associated thrombosis [^111LDtRE]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Over the past 2 decades, enormous advances have been made in the management of CAT. The growing evidence base informing practice has led to the publication of a number of guidelines and guidance documents on the diagnosis and treatment of CAT. The goal of this review is to examine the latest versions of evidence-based guidelines, highlighting the differences and similarities in their methodology, their disease-specific content, and recommendations for management. Our analysis shows that for most clinical topics, the different guidelines provide roughly similar management advice. However, there are a number of important clinical topics in CAT that are not currently covered by the existing guidelines. We think inclusion of these topics in future versions of the guidelines will facilitate ongoing efforts to optimize the care of patients with CAT. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is a common complication in patients with cancer. This review examines the differences and similarities of the current CAT guidelines methods and recommendations. Current guidelines largely agree on many aspects of CAT management. However, there are a number of topics in CAT that are not currently included in guidelines where evidence-based guidance would be very helpful for clinicians. Coverage of these topics in future guidelines is encouraged to optimize clinical practice.

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of thrombosis associated with central venous catheters in patients with cancer [^112P5NUk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although long-term indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) and loss of the CVC, there is lack of consensus on management of CVC-related thrombosis (CRT) in cancer patients and heterogeneity in clinical practices worldwide.

Objectives

To establish common international Good Clinical Practices Guidelines (GCPG) for the management of CRT in cancer patients.

Methods

An international working group of experts was set up to develop GCPG according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system.

Results

For the treatment of established CRT in cancer patients, we found no prospective randomized studies, two non-randomized prospective studies and one retrospective study examining the efficacy and safety of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) plus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). One retrospective study evaluated the benefit of CVC removal and two small retrospective studies were on thrombolytic drugs. For the treatment of symptomatic CRT, anticoagulant treatment (AC) is recommended for a minimum of 3 months; in this setting, LMWHs are suggested. VKAs can also be used, in the absence of direct comparisons of these two types of anticoagulants in this setting [Guidance]. The CVC can be kept in place if it is functional, well-positioned and non-infected and there is good resolution under close surveillance; whether the CVC is kept or removed, no standard approach in terms of AC duration has been established [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of CRT in cancer patients, we found six randomized studies investigating the efficacy and safety of VKA vs. placebo or no treatment, one on the efficacy and safety of unfractionnated heparin, six on the value of LMWH, one double-blind randomized and one non randomized study on thrombolytic drugs and six meta-analyses of AC and CVC thromboprophylaxis. Type of catheter (open-ended like the Hickman(®) catheter vs. closed-ended catheter with a valve like the Groshong(®) catheter), its position (above, below or at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium) and method of placement may influence the onset of CRT on the basis of six retrospective trials, four prospective non-randomized trials, three randomized trials and one meta-analysis. In light of these data: use of AC for routine prophylaxis of CRT is not recommended [1A]; a CVC should be inserted on the right side, in the jugular vein, and distal extremity of the CVC should be located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium [1A].

Conclusion

Dissemination and implementation of these international GCPG for the prevention and treatment of CRT in cancer patients at each national level is a major public health priority, needing worldwide collaboration.

### Prophylaxis of catheter-related venous thrombosis in cancer patients [^113hciwZ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The use of indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) for chemotherapy delivery is common practice in cancer patients. Central venous lines facilitate ease of blood drawing along with administration of blood products and various other therapies. Significant risks, however, include infection and catheter-related thrombosis. Several attempts have been investigated to reduce CVC-associated thrombosis, in particular anticoagulation strategies. Given the lack of clear efficacy, there is at present no recommendation for the use of prophylactic anti-coagulation in patients with solid malignancy and an indwelling CVC.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents… [^113H3Jt7]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

In general, persons who have less than 500 CD4+ T cells per mm3 should be offered therapy; however, the strength of the recommendation to treat should be based on the patient's willingness to accept therapy as well as the prognosis for AIDS-free survival as determined by the HIV RNA copy per mL of plasma and the CD4+ T cell count. Thus, recommendations based on data from clinical trials with clinical endpoints are differentiated from recommendations based on data derived from clinical trials with laboratory endpoints; when clinical trial data are not available, recommendations are based on the opinions of experts familiar with the relevant scientific literature.

USE OF TESTING FOR PLASMA HIV RNA LEVELS AND CD4+ T CELL COUNT IN GUIDING DECISIONS FOR THERAPY Decisions regarding either initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy should be guided by monitoring the laboratory parameters of both plasma HIV RNA and CD4+ T cell count and by assessing the clinical condition of the patient. However, before initiating therapy in any patient, the following evaluation should be performed: prevention of OIs, if not already performed, and other tests as clinically indicated.

The factors that must be considered in this decision include the following: 1) the willingness of the individual to begin therapy; 2) the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; 3) the risk for disease progression as determined by the level of plasma HIV RNA; 4) the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in asymptomatic persons, as discussed above; and 5) the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. The more conservative approach to the initiation of therapy in the asymptomatic person would delay treatment of the patient who has less than 500 CD4+ T cells/mm3 and low levels of viremia and who has a low risk for rapid disease progression; careful observation and monitoring would continue.

Patients who have CD4+ T cell counts greater than 500/mm3 would also be observed, except those who are at substantial risk for rapid disease progression because of a high viral load.

Based on the body of available evidence, it is likely that anticoagulation reduces the complication rate of SVT in pediatric patients, but the panel recognized the need for improvement in the characterization of SVT phenotypes, differentiating cases with a likely more benign course in comparison with the typical adult non–line-associated lower limb SVT. The relationship between patient, SVT location/extension, and line-associated variables could not be assessed in the available pediatric published data.

The panel identified the following additional research needs:
1 Further studies evaluating the natural history of SVT resolution/progression, as well as DVT/PE complication according to patient (ie, age and underlying condition) and SVT characteristics (SVT location/extension and line dependence), as well as venous bed health (ie, varicosity/ectasia status, chronic venous hypertension)
2 Further studies assessing ideal diagnostic methods and imaging protocols in subgroups with SVT
3 Further studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of anticoagulation of different intensities of pediatric SVT
4 Further studies to evaluate the role of antiplatelet/NSAID compared with anticoagulation in pediatric SVT

For pediatric patients with proximal DVT, should thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone be used?

Recommendation 13

For pediatric patients with proximal DVT, the ASH/ISTH guideline panel suggests using anticoagulation alone rather than thrombolysis followed by anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⨁◯◯◯).

Remarks: The panel considered characteristics, such as the extent and clinical impact of VTE, as important in determining the RR benefit ratio of thrombolysis. In most cases, the risks seem higher than the potential benefit; however, there may be individuals for whom the opposite is true. In this clinical scenario, extrapolation from adult data was difficult. There are insufficient data to address the RR benefit of local thrombolysis via interventional radiology compared with systemic thrombolysis, and the panel noted that the centers with access to pediatric interventional radiology were often stronger advocates of thrombolysis.

Central venous access device (CVAD)–related thrombosis — evidence on timing of removal and anticoagulation: We identified 2 multicenter, observational studies including 663 hospitalized children aged 0 to 21 years and 115 neonates and infants aged ≤ 6 months that compared immediate CVAD removal (< 48 hours of anticoagulation or without anticoagulation) with delayed removal (≥ 48 hours or median of 4 days of anticoagulation). Combining results, the incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism was 0.2% (1/485) with immediate removal versus 0% (0/241) with delayed removal, and overall certainty of effect estimates was low. The panel highlighted that most patients do not routinely receive screening ultrasound or bubble studies before CVAD removal and recognized that some with a known right-to-left cardiac shunt or large clot burden may benefit from > 48 hours of anticoagulation before line removal, while determining that the data do not conclusively demonstrate whether > 48 hours of anticoagulation decreases the risk of pulmonary embolism or embolic stroke.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of pediatric venous thromboembolism [^117Ad4Zb]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Despite an increasing incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pediatric patients in tertiary care settings, relatively few pediatric physicians have experience with antithrombotic interventions.

Objective

These guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), based on the best available evidence, are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about management of pediatric VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 2 patient representatives and was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline-development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews (up to April of 2017). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including GRADE Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 30 recommendations, covering symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis, with specific focus on management of central venous access device-associated VTE. The panel also addressed renal and portal vein thrombosis, cerebral sino venous thrombosis, and homozygous protein C deficiency.

Conclusions

Although the panel offered many recommendations, additional research is required. Priorities include understanding the natural history of asymptomatic thrombosis, determining subgroup boundaries that enable risk stratification of children for escalation of treatment, and appropriate study of newer anticoagulant agents in children.

Intravascular catheters are inserted into almost all critically ill patients. This review provides up-to-date insight into available knowledge on epidemiology and diagnosis of complications of central vein and arterial catheters in ICU. It discusses the optimal therapy of catheter-related infections and thrombosis. Prevention of complications is a multidisciplinary task that combines both improvement of the process of care and introduction of new technologies. We emphasize the main component of the prevention strategies that should be used in critical care and propose areas of future investigation in this field.

### PICC line management among patients with chronic kidney disease [^111RDE5Y]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

More than 1million peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are placed annually in the US and are used to provide convenient vascular access for a variety of reasons including long term antibiotic treatment, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and blood draws. Although they are relatively easy to place and inexpensive, PICC line use is associated with many complications such as phlebitis/thrombophlebitis, venous thrombosis, catheter-related infection, wound infection, and central vein stenosis. These complications are far more deleterious for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) whose lives depend on a functioning hemodialysis access once they reach end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Despite recent guidelines to avoid PICC lines in CKD and ESKD patients, clinical use remains high. There is an ongoing urgency to educate and inform health care providers and the CKD patients themselves in preserving their venous real estate. In this article, we review AV access and PICC line background, complications associated with PICC lines in the CKD population, and recommendations for alternatives to placing a PICC line in this vulnerable patient population.

### Thrombotic complications in children from short-term percutaneous central venous catheters: what can we do? [^112frTc4]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

The reported incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in children has increased dramatically over the past decade, and the primary risk factor for VTE in neonates and infants is the presence of a central venous catheter (CVC). Although the associated morbidity and mortality are significant, very few trials have been conducted in children to guide clinicians in the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of CVC-related VTE. Furthermore, pediatric guidelines for prophylaxis and management of VTE are largely extrapolated from adult data. How then should the anesthesiologist approach central access in children of different ages to lessen the risk of CVC-related VTE or in children with prior thrombosis and vessel occlusion? A comprehensive review of the pediatric and adult literature is presented with the goal of assisting anesthesiologists with point-of-care decision-making regarding the risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of CVC-related VTE. Illustrative cases are also provided to highlight decision-making in varying situations. The only risk factor strongly associated with CVC-related VTE formation in children is the duration of the indwelling CVC. Several other factors show a trend toward altering the incidence of CVC-related VTE formation and may be under the control of the anesthesiologist placing and managing the catheter. In particular, because children with VTE may live decades with its sequelae and chronic vein thrombosis, careful consideration of lessening the risk of VTE is warranted in every child. Further studies are needed to form a clearer understanding of the risk factors, prophylaxis, and management of CVC-related VTE in children and to guide the anesthesiologist in lessening the risk of VTE.

### Epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of catheter-related thrombosis in children and adults [^114SBjfz]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

In this narrative review, the epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention strategies, and management of catheter-related thrombosis are outlined. Central venous catheters have significantly improved the quality of life of patients requiring chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and chronic transfusions. Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) complicates between 1–5% of inserted catheters, with incidence varying between patient population, catheter type, and vein cannulated. Strategies to prevent CRT, including anticoagulation and locking solutions, have largely been ineffective. Using clinical decision tools and D-dimer testing can limit radiographic testing for patients with suspected CRT. Although most patients with CRT are treated with anticoagulation, the most effective type and duration of treatment have not been established for adults or children. Many unanswered questions remain concerning risk stratification, prevention, and management of CRT. National and international collaborative research networks could be harnessed to perform these much needed studies.

### Central catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis in cancer: clinical course, prophylaxis, treatment [^113AhLwo]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for VTE in patients with cancer recommend anticoagulation for at least 3 months or for as long as the catheter is maintained. There are no specific drug recommendations from the NCCN. The CVC should be removed in case of persistent thrombosis symptoms, infection, dysfunctional line or when the line is no longer needed.

Generally, treatments for these patients may include LMWH bridged to warfarin or LMWH monotherapy, generally without line removal unless it is no longer required, it is defective or infection has been detected.

A retrospective analysis limited to 83 patients with CVC-associated DVT treated with rivaroxaban showed a line failure rate of 3.6% and a major bleeding rate of only 2.4% leading the authors to conclude that rivaroxaban was a safe and effective option.

In a prospective study of rivaroxaban for CVC-associated UEDVT in patients with cancer, the authors demonstrated in 70 patients that preservation of line function was 100% at 12 weeks. The risk of recurrent VTE at 12 weeks was 1.43%, with one episode of fatal PE, and nine patients (12.9%) experienced 11 total bleeding episodes. They concluded that rivaroxaban showed promise in treating CVC-UEDVT in patients with cancer, resulting in preserved line function. However, bleeding rates and a fatal PE on treatment are concerning safety outcomes necessitating further study before rivaroxaban can be recommended.

Another study compared the efficacy and safety profile of rivaroxaban (20 mg/day) with LMWH and VKAs in the treatment of PICC-associated UEDVT. Rivaroxaban led to faster resolution of PICC-associated UEDVT than LMWH/VKAs without any increase in bleeding.

### Thrombosis-related complications and mortality in cancer patients with central venous devices: an observational study on the effect of antithrombotic prophylaxis [^116XtRT2]. Annals of Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines do not recommend antithrombotic prophylaxis (AP) to prevent catheter-related thrombosis in cancer patients with a central line.

Patients and Methods

This study assessed the management of central lines in cancer patients, current attitude towards AP, catheter-related and systemic venous thromboses, and survival.

Results

Of 1410 patients enrolled, 1390 were seen at least once in the 6-month median follow-up. Continuous AP, mainly low-dose warfarin, was given to 451 (32.4%); they were older, with a more frequent history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and more advanced cancer. There was no difference in catheter-related thrombosis in patients given AP or not (2.8% and 2.2%, odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval 0.64–2.6). The median time to first catheter-related complication was 120 days. Systemic VTE including deep and superficial thromboses and pulmonary embolism, were less frequent with AP (4% versus 8.2%, P = 0.005). Mortality was also lower (25% versus 44%, P = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis found only advanced cancer and no AP significantly associated with mortality. No major bleeding was recorded with AP.

Conclusions

Current AP schedules do not appear to prevent catheter-related thrombosis. Systemic VTE and mortality, however, appeared lower after prophylaxis.

### Overview of VTE treatment in cancer according to clinical guidelines [^116z11dP]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are available to provide guidance to clinicians in managing patients living with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). While most are developed using rigorous methods and grounded by systematic reviews of the literature, their recommendations do differ because of differences in their grading criteria and interpretation of the data. This can be confusing to practicing clinicians. Also, guidelines are often out of date and cannot keep pace with publications because of the lengthy processes and extensive resources required for completion. The most recent updates of major guidelines in the management of cancer-associated VTE were published in 2015–2016. They broadened the topics addressed in earlier versions but, similar to that in earlier documents, the quality of evidence remains weak in many important clinical scenarios, such as management of recurrent VTE, choice of anticoagulants for long-term and extended treatment, and duration of anticoagulant therapy. Consequently, many recommendations continue to reflect expert opinion and extrapolation from indirect data in non-cancer populations. This review summarizes and comments on the most recent guideline updates from the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the International Initiative on Thrombosis and Cancer. A new round of revisions is expected to incorporate the emerging data on the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE.

Treatment of intraluminal thrombosis

Intraluminal thrombotic complications constitute a drastically different scenario than the previously discussed extraluminal thrombosis, both in presentation and therapeutic approach. A common cause of CVC dysfunction, intraluminal thrombosis usually manifests as total occlusion with failure to infuse into the CVC and absence of blood return. Fibrin sheath formation is a closely related phenomenon that generates a partial ball-valve effect. Thrombotic occlusion is usually managed with the administration of a thrombolytic agent, after exclusion of other causes of CVC dysfunction. Thrombolysis is considered a safe and simple procedure capable of restoring the CVC patency and avoiding unnecessary line replacement. Several different thrombolytic agents have been studied, urokinase being the most widely used. A recent meta-analysis reviewed the existing literature on the interventions to obstructive events in long-term CVCs in patients with cancer; the most common agents used were urokinase and alteplase. The overall restoration frequency was 84%; the drugs analysed, with their respective restoration frequencies, consisted of urokinase (84%), alteplase (92%) and tenecteplase (84%). The ASCO guidelines currently recommend the instillation of 2 mg of tissue plasminogen activator for the management of catheter-related occlusions.

Factors relating to the underlying pathology and patient history

Infection

Catheter infection is highly associated with intraluminal thrombosis and catheter-related venous thrombosis. An Australian study evaluated the rate of CVC-related complications showed that thrombosis occurred in 15.1% of all cases, exit-site infection in 1.9% and CVC-related bloodstream infection in 7.5 per 1000 CVC-days.

A case–control study reported an association between VTE and any recent infection in patients with cancer, with an OR of 1.7.

General guidelines for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections suggest the use of the subclavian vein, rather than a jugular or a femoral site, in adult patients to minimise infection risk for non-tunnelled CVC placement. No recommendation can be made for a preferred site of insertion to minimise infection risk for a tunnelled CVC. Also, the use of a CVC with the minimum number of ports or lumens is essential for the management of the patient.

CVAD-related thrombosis — nonfunctioning or unneeded CVAD: The ASH guideline panel recommends removal rather than no removal of a nonfunctioning or unneeded CVAD in pediatric patients with symptomatic CVAD-related thrombosis (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks state that if care can be delivered without central venous access, removing the thrombosis stimulus is appropriate, and any central access device should be removed as soon as feasible within the child's overall treatment plan; the strong recommendation reflects high evidence of harm or high cost despite very low certainty in benefits.

### Executive summary: antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116fmMsi]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

CVAD-related thrombosis — functioning CVAD with ongoing access needs: The ASH guideline panel suggests no removal rather than removal of a functioning central venous access device (CVAD) in pediatric patients with symptomatic CVAD-related thrombosis who continue to require venous access (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Remarks note a high value on avoiding insertion of another CVAD and that treatment with anticoagulation likely leads to minimal complications.
