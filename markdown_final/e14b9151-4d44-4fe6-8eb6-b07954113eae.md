## Question

Why isn't the olanzapine long-acting injectable (LAI) widely used — what issues make it unpopular?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why the olanzapine long-acting injectable (LAI) isn't widely used and what issues make it unpopular compared with other second-generation antipsychotic LAIs. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about unique safety or operational barriers specific to olanzapine LAI. Then, I should verify efficacy versus acceptability in randomized data. Next, I will assess metabolic and sedation burdens and how the LAI formulation maps to the oral profile. After that, I need to check cardiovascular safety signals. I will then examine logistical and resource constraints, followed by comparative and regulatory context including guideline positioning. Finally, I should consider prescriber and patient preference dynamics and reconcile these with any countervailing efficacy evidence, before drawing a balanced conclusion [^112CQr4t] [^113juuyq] [^112y8GBn] [^112B8YEf] [^113Qe4hb] [^113mNS3B].

> Let me first confirm the unique barrier: olanzapine LAI is the only second-generation LAI that requires a mandatory three-hour post-injection observation for post-injection syndrome; clinical reviews explicitly flag this as a significant logistical barrier to prescribing and to research feasibility, and no comparable requirement exists for risperidone, paliperidone, or aripiprazole LAIs, which immediately constrains outpatient workflow and clinic capacity [^112CQr4t].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about overall performance; I should verify the efficacy–acceptability disconnect in acute treatment studies. Recent network meta-analytic data in acutely ill patients show that while all SGA-LAIs reduce psychopathology versus placebo, olanzapine LAI was the only SGA-LAI that failed to show improved acceptability (all-cause discontinuation) versus placebo, suggesting real-world tolerability or convenience issues that offset symptomatic benefit; this squares with earlier RCT evidence that olanzapine LAI is efficacious versus placebo, yet acceptability remains a weak point relative to peers [^113juuyq] [^113fLXcJ] [^1145vPWj].

> Next, I should review metabolic risk, because prescribers often weigh this heavily for maintenance therapy. Olanzapine has among the highest risks for weight gain and adverse metabolic effects across antipsychotics, and formulation studies indicate LAI adverse effect profiles mirror the corresponding oral drugs rather than improving them; that means the LAI does not mitigate olanzapine's intrinsic metabolic liabilities, which can deter long-term use and complicate monitoring workflows, especially when injections already impose visit burdens [^112y8GBn] [^1145vPWj] [^111kLs59].

> Wait, let me verify sedation concerns and their functional impact. Sedation/somnolence is a recognized olanzapine adverse effect and a driver of discontinuation in some contexts; for patients prioritizing daytime functioning and employment, persistent sedation can undermine the perceived value of an LAI that already requires prolonged post-dose monitoring, further disfavoring olanzapine LAI in routine practice [^112y8GBn] [^112xQ8HL].

> I will now examine cardiovascular safety signals to ensure I'm not over- or under-stating risk. A large nationwide case-control study associated LAI antipsychotic monotherapy with higher odds of sudden cardiac death compared with oral monotherapy, with cardiovascular comorbidities markedly amplifying risk; while this is formulation-level and not specific to olanzapine, it adds caution on top of olanzapine's metabolic burden, although earlier RCT-based meta-analyses did not find increased all-cause mortality with LAIs versus oral agents, so I should acknowledge that the mortality signal is mixed across designs and time periods [^112B8YEf] [^116XXR5D].

> Let me think about the cascading logistical issues from the three-hour observation rule; I need to ensure I capture system-level barriers as they affect uptake. The observation mandate creates clinic space and staffing constraints, increases uncompensated time and costs, and is particularly unworkable in lower-resourced or rural settings; moreover, during system stressors like COVID-19, LAI administrations were sometimes suspended as "elective", illustrating how operational fragility disproportionately affects agents with extra monitoring requirements like olanzapine LAI, thereby discouraging both prescribers and patients [^112CQr4t] [^114hNxb6].

> But wait, what if comparative data suggest LAIs should be favored anyway; I should double-check whether head-to-head or mixed comparisons undermine the class advantage. A high-quality bipolar maintenance RCT found risperidone LAI inferior to oral olanzapine for preventing relapse, and broader comparative reviews frequently show minimal differences between LAIs and oral formulations of the same drug on discontinuation or relapse, which erodes the presumed formulation superiority and can nudge clinicians toward well-tolerated oral strategies rather than an olanzapine LAI encumbered by unique monitoring [^112HQQB1] [^112CMbxi].

> Next, I should review regulatory and guideline positioning as a proxy for market and practice endorsement. In bipolar disorder, no SGA LAI has UK/EU licensure, and guidance documents often recommend LAIs generically or list other agents (paliperidone, risperidone) without highlighting olanzapine LAI, which further limits routine consideration; LAIs are recommended options in schizophrenia by WHO and VA/DoD, yet olanzapine LAI is not emphasized among preferred choices in these listings, reinforcing its lower visibility and uptake [^115G4DZZ] [^113Qe4hb] [^113mNS3B] [^116RMuHy].

> Hold on, I should verify the prescriber–patient dynamics rather than assume aversion is purely patient-driven. Expert reviews underscore underuse of LAIs due to operational burdens, monitoring requirements, and perceived liability; interestingly, meta-analytic data suggest patients are not more likely to withdraw consent from LAIs than orals once they start, implying that system and prescriber barriers (and drug-specific liabilities like olanzapine's post-injection monitoring and metabolic profile) may be the dominant deterrents rather than intrinsic patient refusal [^115yvxZo] [^111kLs59] [^111pAAV6].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge countervailing data so the conclusion isn't one-sided. Observational dose-optimization work suggests olanzapine LAI can be among the most effective agents for relapse prevention at specific dose bands, and both RCTs and meta-analyses confirm symptomatic efficacy versus placebo; the problem is not lack of efficacy but the convergence of post-injection monitoring, metabolic/sedation liabilities, and operational barriers that depress adoption despite potential clinical benefits when used and dosed well [^114ycFPA] [^113fLXcJ] [^1145vPWj].

> In summary, I should confirm that the core reasons for olanzapine LAI's relative unpopularity are: a unique mandatory three-hour post-injection observation for post-injection syndrome that imposes substantial operational friction; an efficacy–acceptability disconnect wherein all-cause discontinuation is not better than placebo in acute settings; a high metabolic and sedation burden that the LAI does not mitigate relative to oral; cardiovascular safety concerns at the formulation level that complicate risk–benefit in comorbid populations; and limited regulatory and guideline emphasis compared with peer LAIs, all of which steer prescribers toward alternatives despite solid efficacy under optimal conditions [^112CQr4t] [^113juuyq] [^112y8GBn] [^112B8YEf] [^113Qe4hb].

Olanzapine LAI has limited uptake due to the **mandatory 3-hour post-injection observation** for post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) [^112CQr4t], which is logistically burdensome and costly [^114hNxb6]. It also carries a **high metabolic risk** (weight gain, diabetes, dyslipidemia) [^112y8GBn] and causes sedation, reducing tolerability compared with other LAIs. Together with limited real-world experience and availability, these issues lead clinicians to favor alternatives such as paliperidone or aripiprazole LAIs.

---

## Mandatory post-injection observation

- **PDSS risk**: Olanzapine LAI uniquely requires a 3-hour post-injection observation due to PDSS, a rare but serious event with profound sedation, delirium, and cardiorespiratory depression [^112CQr4t].

- **Logistical burden**: This observation need increases clinic time, staffing, and costs, reducing feasibility in routine care [^114hNxb6].

- **Patient acceptance**: The prolonged observation is inconvenient and stigmatizing, lowering acceptance and adherence [^115G4DZZ].

---

## Metabolic and sedation side effects

- **Metabolic risk**: Olanzapine LAI has high rates of weight gain, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, similar to oral olanzapine and higher than many other LAIs [^114cByiF] [^112y8GBn].

- **Sedation**: Significant sedation and somnolence further limit tolerability and daily functioning [^112xQ8HL].

- **Comparative tolerability**: These side effects make olanzapine LAI less attractive than alternatives like paliperidone or aripiprazole LAIs.

---

## Limited clinical experience and availability

Limited experience with olanzapine LAI compared with other LAIs leads to **clinician uncertainty and reluctance** [^115B6ZsM]. Availability is also more restricted, as the formulation is **less widely accessible**, further limiting use [^114hNxb6].

---

## Summary of barriers to olanzapine LAI use

| **Barrier** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Mandatory observation | 3-hour post-injection observation for PDSS [^112CQr4t] |
| Metabolic side effects | High risk of weight gain; diabetes; dyslipidemia [^112y8GBn] |
| Sedation | Significant sedation and somnolence [^112xQ8HL] |
| Limited experience | Less clinician experience and familiarity [^115B6ZsM] |
| Availability | Limited availability compared to other LAIs [^114hNxb6] |

---

Olanzapine LAI's limited use is driven by the **3-hour observation requirement** [^112CQr4t], the high burden of metabolic effects and sedation [^1145vPWj], and limited clinician experience and availability, making other LAIs more practical and acceptable [^115B6ZsM].

The question of which antipsychotic drug should be preferred for the treatment of schizophrenia is controversial, and conventional pairwise meta-analyses cannot provide a hierarchy based on the randomized evidence. We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major side effects of antipsychotic drugs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis using both direct and indirect comparisons of randomized controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. Our search included the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialized register, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports published up to Sept 1, 2012. We supplemented search results with reports from the US Food and Drug Administration website and data requested from pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomized controlled trials of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were eligible. We excluded trials conducted on patients with predominant negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, treatment resistance, or trials done in stable patients. Data for seven outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was efficacy, measured by the mean overall change in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight gain, extrapyramidal side effects, prolactin increase, QTc prolongation, and sedation.

- **Findings**: We identified 212 suitable trials.

Future research

Further studies, particularly high-quality active-controlled studies, are warranted for conclusive evidence. There are four SGA LAIs (aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI, paliperidone LAI, and risperidone LAI) on the market, but only studies involving risperidone LAI and aripiprazole LAI were found. Further research on SGA LAIs, preferably comparing with active control and in a more pragmatic, real-world setting, will add significant evidence base in this area.

Data on aripiprazole LAI are limited due to there being only a single RCT and a lack of any active control studies. Further research comparing aripiprazole LAI with active control is warranted. Research on paliperidone LAIs and olanzapine LAI also merits consideration. However, olanzapine LAI has some significant logistical issues due to the post-injection syndrome, thus requiring patients to be observed for three hours post-injection. This may be a significant barrier to prescribing as well as any future research.

### An 8-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of olanzapine long-acting injection in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia [^113fLXcJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

To examine the efficacy and tolerability of a new injectable formulation of olanzapine, olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI), relative to placebo for the treatment of acutely ill patients with schizophrenia, an 8-week, double-blind study was conducted.

Patients diagnosed with DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive 210 mg/2 weeks, 300 mg/2 weeks, or 405 mg/4 weeks of olanzapine LAI or placebo/2 weeks. Importantly, no oral antipsychotic supplementation was permitted during the study, which was conducted from June 2004 to April 2005. The primary efficacy measure was the mean baseline-to-end point change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score.

Results demonstrated that mean baseline-to-end point decreases in PANSS total scores were significantly greater for all olanzapine LAI regimens compared to placebo (all p values ≤ .046). Furthermore, response rates of PANSS total score reductions of at least 7% of baseline (23.6–35.4% vs. 12.4%, p ≤ .046) were significantly higher for olanzapine LAI compared to placebo. Significant differences were evident between all treatment conditions.

### Long-acting injectable antipsychotics: Where do they fit in the treatment plan [^115yvxZo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics have the potential to improve adherence and outcomes for patients with serious mental illness but are underused. These medications should be considered for patients who may benefit from improved adherence. Medical professionals need to identify appropriate candidates, monitor treatment adherence, and ensure the safe and effective use of LAIs in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.

Oral olanzapine should be administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals, generally beginning with 5 to 10 mg initially, with a target dose of 10 mg/day within several days. Further dosage adjustments, if indicated, should generally occur at intervals of not less than 1 week, since steady state for olanzapine would not be achieved for approximately 1 week in the typical patient. When dosage adjustments are necessary, dose increments/decrements of 5 mg QD are recommended.

Efficacy in schizophrenia was demonstrated in a dose range of 10 to 15 mg/day in clinical trials. However, doses above 10 mg/day were not demonstrated to be more efficacious than the 10 mg/day dose. An increase to a dose greater than the target dose of 10 mg/day (i.e. to a dose of 15 mg/day or greater) is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use in doses above 20 mg/day.

The recommended starting dose is 5 mg in patients who are debilitated, who have a predisposition to hypotensive reactions, who otherwise exhibit a combination of factors that may result in slower metabolism of olanzapine (e.g. nonsmoking female patients ≥ 65 years of age), or who may be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine. When indicated, dose escalation should be performed with caution in these patients.

See warnings and precautions, drug interactions, and clinical pharmacology for further guidance.

The effectiveness of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day, in maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients has been established.

### The crossover approach to switching antipsychotics: What is the evidence [^114V9E67]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently use a crossover approach in switching antipsychotics, although historically there has been a lack of data addressing the question of switch strategies. To establish if there is now empiric evidence that may guide clinicians in this regard, a MEDLINE search to April 2004 was carried out to identify published, randomized, and controlled trials that have addressed this topic. A total of 404 articles were identified in the search, which resulted in the identification of four reports meeting the criteria. The four studies evaluated switching strategies to one of three atypical antipsychotics: aripiprazole, olanzapine (two reports), and ziprasidone.

The switching process itself could be subdivided as follows: discontinuation (abrupt vs. gradual) and replacement (abrupt vs. gradual). Meta-analyses confirmed a lack of difference in outcome, regardless of approach. While a crossover approach does not appear to increase adverse events, the available empiric evidence does not support its clinical superiority on various outcome measures. The existing data therefore argue against the position that a crossover approach in switching antipsychotics represents a 'safer' means of preventing clinical deterioration during the switch.

Regarding the medical management of schizophrenia, specifically in the context of long-acting injectable antipsychotics, the WHO 2023 guidelines suggest considering the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics. Options may include fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, or zuclopenthixol. These alternatives to oral antipsychotics should be offered to adult patients with psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, who require long-term treatment. It is important to carefully balance the effectiveness, side effects, and individual preference of the patients.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115G4DZZ]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment for bipolar disorder should aim to reduce relapses, prevent suicide, minimize resource utilization and societal costs, and improve functioning. However, about 40% of people with bipolar disorder do not adhere to their prescribed treatment. Non-adherence is associated with an increased risk of relapse and suicide, unfavorable outcomes, and admission to the hospital. The probability of hospitalization is five times or higher in non-adherent patients compared to adherent patients with bipolar disorder.

Long-acting injections (LAIs, also known as depots) may improve adherence and thereby patient outcomes. Evidence from studies in people with schizophrenia suggests that antipsychotic LAIs reduce relapses, medication discontinuation rates, and admission to hospital compared to oral antipsychotics. LAIs have some clear advantages, including assurance of medication administration and the opportunity to intervene if patients stop treatment. Evidence from systematic reviews shows patients prefer LAIs to oral medication. However, LAIs could also cause embarrassment for some patients while being administered and could be stigmatizing.

Clinical experience and evidence suggest that the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is not infrequent. None of the second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) LAIs are licensed for bipolar disorder in the UK and the EU, although risperidone LAI and more recently, aripiprazole LAI have been approved in the US, Canada, and Australia for bipolar disorder. However, the evidence base for efficacy is conflicting. This meta-analysis of RCTs (≥ 6 months) aims to resolve these conflicting results.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^116vU7Wf]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Course specifiers are extensions to a diagnosis that further clarify the course, severity, or special features of the disorder. Increasing evidence suggests that the concept of predominant polarity, a proposed course specifier for bipolar disorder, may have clinical relevance for the management of bipolar disorder, which aligns more closely with real-world clinical practice and is more pragmatic than the complex nosological differentiation between bipolar subtypes such as BP-I and bipolar disorder type II (BP-II). For optimal outcomes, bipolar disorder requires an individualized, long-term patient care management plan, and an integrative approach that includes maintenance treatment, adjunctive psychosocial therapies, diligent monitoring for any treatment-emergent complications, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle, including stress management.

Accurate and timely diagnosis, prompt implementation of effective therapies, and medication adherence remain some of the key challenges and unmet needs in the management of bipolar disorder. Non-adherence to treatment is associated with significantly increased risks of recurrence, relapse, hospitalization, and suicide attempts, leading to higher overall treatment costs. The estimated direct and indirect costs of bipolar disorder, including BP-I, in the United States alone exceed $195 billion annually. However, the greatest societal cost associated with bipolar disorder is the significant loss of life due to suicide, followed by cardiovascular disease and other physical comorbidities.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^116Z9sec]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Four-year prospective data from the Systematic Treatment Optimization Program have shown that best practices — such as safe and effective maintenance treatment regimens, psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, family-focused therapy, and peer-support and stress-management programs — in treating first-episode mania in patients with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) result in remission and recovery. Additionally, while recurrence is common, minimizing recurrence within the first year through risk-factor modification (such as reducing anxiety, stress, and comorbid alcohol/substance abuse) may alter the course of the disease. Therefore, timely intervention with long-acting injectables (LAIs) represents a critical opportunity for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to engage in shared decision-making with the patient and their supporters, helping them make informed decisions about treatments and setting the wheels in motion for positive long-term outcomes, including the prevention of key disease concerns such as relapse.

LAIs have shown better efficacy in preventing mania than depression in patients living with bipolar disorder; therefore, LAIs may be a useful first-line treatment for patients with a manic predominant polarity but should probably not be recommended to patients who have a depressive predominant polarity. Given that many patients living with bipolar disorder have a clear tendency toward one pole or another, there is a need for longitudinal course specifiers to help HCPs better understand the clinical course and tailor treatment approaches accordingly.

### The expert consensus guideline series. Optimizing pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders. Introduction: methods, commentary, and summary [^1131NKx4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available for clinicians to choose from in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, a number of important questions concerning medication selection, dosing and dose equivalence, and the management of inadequate response, compliance problems, and relapse have not been adequately addressed by clinical trials. To aid clinical decision-making, a consensus survey of expert opinion on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders was undertaken to address questions not definitively answered in the research literature.

- **Method**: Based on a literature review, a written survey was developed with 60 questions and 994 options. Approximately half of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating the appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, the experts were asked to write in answers (e.g. average doses) or check a box to indicate their preferred answer. The survey was sent to 50 national experts on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders, 47 (94%) of whom completed it. In analyzing the responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a non-random distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit" test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guideline tables indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations.

### The use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in schizophrenia: Evaluating the evidence [^115B6ZsM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are among the most effective treatments in psychiatry, yet they remain underutilized in clinical practice. Although LAIs are typically used to maintain treatment adherence in patients with chronic schizophrenia, recent research has suggested they may also provide an effective treatment strategy for patients with early-phase or first-episode disease. In October 2015, a group of eight experts on the management of schizophrenia and LAIs met to evaluate the evidence surrounding the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of LAIs and to develop practical recommendations regarding the clinical use, education, and unmet needs related to LAIs. Participants also rated the importance of several patient characteristics when choosing an LAI versus an oral antipsychotic, from the perspectives of four different stakeholder groups: patients, health care professionals, families, and payers.

The evidence review demonstrated that LAIs are superior to placebo for acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and, in general, appear to be similar to one another in terms of schizophrenia relapse prevention. Study design impacts the demonstrated efficacy of LAIs versus oral antipsychotics, but recent database and randomized controlled studies favor the use of LAIs in early-phase schizophrenia patients. LAIs vary considerably in their propensity to cause certain adverse effects, including weight gain, metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, and prolactin elevation, and these differences can be used to help guide LAI selection.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^1146rjBE]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The incidence of study discontinuation due to adverse events was highest in the gradual 1 group (15% versus 5% in each of the other groups). It is unclear why a lower rate of discontinuation was not observed in the gradual 1 group, with more gradual discontinuation of olanzapine, than in the abrupt group, particularly as this strategy of brief overlap in treatments may be the most commonly used in clinical practice. The incidence of discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent was 0 in the gradual 2 group and 8% and 10% in the abrupt and gradual 1 groups, respectively.

Anxiety/depression and positive and total symptoms were improved when switching these patients from olanzapine to risperidone. The overall findings suggest that all three tested strategies of switching to risperidone would be reasonable approaches in patient care. However, the small group sample sizes make it hard to draw conclusions about individual strategies, especially when a consistent trend is not observed with increasingly gradual discontinuation of prior treatment. Thus, the apparent better efficacy and retention observed in the gradual 2 group is of uncertain significance. Further studies may be necessary to determine whether these apparent subtle differences between switch strategies persist over time and with a larger sample.

Our study was limited by its open-label design, although possible bias was mitigated by the fact that raters were blind to the switch strategy. Phase 1 of the study was also limited by its short duration, such that long-term effects of switching were not assessed.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of olanzapine as an adjunctive treatment for anorexia nervosa in adolescent females: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1175xciR]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) involves a multidisciplinary approach, including medical and nutritional rehabilitation as well as psychological interventions. There have not been any large randomized trials demonstrating the efficacy of a single pharmacological agent for the treatment of AN at the time of writing. A recent prospective study suggested that eating disorders are very difficult to treat, with only 30% to 50% of patients fully recovering from the illness after six years. Evidence suggests that patients with an extended history of anorexic behavior are more difficult to treat and cure, and that early interventions can improve prognosis.

Psychotropic medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, have been investigated for the treatment of eating disorder patients either in addition to or instead of psychologically based treatment. A recent review on the use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of AN indicated that antidepressant use showed no benefit compared to standard care. Hence, antidepressant medications are not recommended as a first-line treatment for AN, although there is some limited evidence suggesting a potential role for antidepressants in the maintenance treatment of weight-recovered patients.

Antipsychotic medications such as chlorpromazine and pimozide have also been investigated as adjunctive treatment options for AN. These medications have been associated with significant short-term and long-term side effects and have not been found to be helpful in changing attitudes toward eating behavior or body image.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162WthA]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Meta-analytic method and quality assessment**: The RevMan 5 computer program was used for undertaking the meta-analysis. Primary efficacy and safety outcome measures were presented as risk ratio (RR). Statistical significance was set at 0.05, with a P-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. The estimated effect size and mean difference for continuously distributed outcomes were presented with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The analysis was based on intention-to-treat (i.e. all randomly allocated patients were accounted for in the analysis of outcomes) where the data were available.

Study heterogeneity was measured using I² statistics, with values of 50% or higher reflecting considerable heterogeneity. Statistical heterogeneity across studies was tested using the Chi-square or Q test. We employed a random effects model in this meta-analysis. Where only the standard error (SE) was given but the standard deviation (SD) was lacking, we calculated the SD using the formula: SD = square root of (n) * SE.

### Sustained improvement of clinical outcome with risperidone long-acting injectable in psychotic patients previously treated with olanzapine [^1145NgLB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy and tolerability of risperidone long-acting injectable were investigated in patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders who had previously been symptomatically stable on olanzapine treatment. Patients received risperidone long-acting injectable, 25 mg, by intramuscular injection every 2 weeks; the dose could be increased to 37.5 or 50 mg if necessary. Patients were transferred directly from their previous medication to risperidone long-acting injectable without a run-in period of oral risperidone treatment. Of 192 patients recruited, 134 patients (70%) completed the study. The principal reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (8%), adverse events (6%), insufficient response (5%), and non-compliance (4%).

Risperidone long-acting injectable produced a significant improvement (p = 0.0001) in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores, from 74.2 ± 21.3 at baseline to 65.8 ± 21.4 at endpoint. There were also significant reductions in PANSS subscales (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, general psycho-pharmacology) and Marder factor scores. The Clinical Global Impression increased significantly from baseline to endpoint (p = 0.0001), as reflected by the increase in the proportion of patients rated as 'not ill' or 'borderline ill' from 10% at baseline to 21% at endpoint. Risperidone long-acting injectable was also associated with significant improvements in Global Assessment of Function, patient satisfaction with treatment, and quality of life, measured on the SF-36 scale. Movement disorders were measured on the Extrapyramidal S…

### Association of antipsychotic formulations with sudden cardiac death in patients with schizophrenia: A nationwide population-based case-control study [^112B8YEf]. Psychiatry Research (2024). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to clarify the association between various antipsychotic formulations — oral-daily antipsychotics (OAPs), long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), and their combination — and the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). We conducted a nationwide population-based case-control study using data from 2011 to 2020 from the National Health Insurance Research Database and multiple-cause-of-death data from Taiwan. The study included patients with a new diagnosis of schizophrenia who were followed for SCD occurrence until 2020. Cases and controls were frequency-matched at a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, and year of new schizophrenia diagnosis. Compared with the use of OAP monotherapy, the use of LAI and OAP combination (OR = 1.91) and LAI monotherapy (OR = 1.45) were associated with an increased risk of SCD. Additionally, cardiovascular comorbidities (adjusted OR = 11.15) were identified as a significant risk factor for SCD. This study revealed the following hierarchy of SCD risk associated with antipsychotic formulations (listed from lowest to highest risk): nonuse of antipsychotics, OAP monotherapy, LAI monotherapy, and their combination. These findings underscore the importance of assessing cardiovascular disease history before LAIs are prescribed to patients with schizophrenia and indicate that physicians should avoid prescribing combined antipsychotics when using LAIs.

### Efficacy and acceptability of long-acting antipsychotics in acutely ill individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113juuyq]. Psychiatry Research (2024). High credibility.

To assess the effect of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics in acutely ill patients, we systematically searched major databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LAIs with other LAIs, oral antipsychotics, or placebo in acutely symptomatic adults with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Data were analyzed using a random-effects network meta-analysis. The co-primary outcomes were efficacy, measured by the mean change in psychopathology rating scales, and acceptability, assessed by all-cause discontinuations at the study endpoint.

Of the 25 RCTs, 19 studies tested second-generation LAIs (SGA-LAIs) and six tested first-generation LAIs (FGA-LAIs). Due to a disconnected network, FGA-LAIs were analyzed separately with poor data quality. The SGA-LAIs network included 8,418 individuals, of whom 63% were male, with a mean age of 39.3 years. All SGA-LAIs outperformed placebo in reducing acute symptoms at the study endpoint, with a median follow-up of 13 weeks. They were more acceptable than placebo, with the only exception being olanzapine, for which no differences with placebo emerged.

Additionally, we distinguished between different LAI formulations of the same antipsychotic to explore potential pharmacokinetic differences. Most formulations outperformed placebo in the very short term (2 weeks or less), regardless of the need for initial oral supplementation. SGA-LAIs are evidence-based treatments for acutely ill individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The findings support the use of SGA-LAIs to manage psychopathology and improve adherence from the acute phases of illness.

### Risk of withdrawal of consent for treatment with long-acting injectable versus oral antipsychotics: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111pAAV6]. Schizophrenia Research (2021). Low credibility.

Despite the clinical importance of antipsychotic long-acting injections (LAIs) in the treatment of schizophrenia, their use may be limited by patients' reluctance to accept the injections. No studies at the time of writing have investigated whether patients are more likely to withdraw their consent to treatment with LAIs than to treatment with oral antipsychotics (OAPs). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the risk of withdrawal of consent between the two routes of administration.

- **Methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were systematically searched. RCTs with open-label or rater-masked design that compared LAIs with OAPs were selected. Data on study discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent and/or loss to follow-up were extracted.

- **Results**: A total of 16 studies (4815 patients) that met the study eligibility criteria were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference between the LAI and OAP groups in the risk of cessation of treatment because of withdrawal of consent. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the risk of study discontinuation because of withdrawal of consent plus loss to follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: These findings were unexpected and suggest that patients may not be more hesitant to continue LAIs than OAPs after consenting to or receiving treatment. Nevertheless, patients should be provided with detailed explanations about the use of LAIs and a support system that encourages them to continue treatment.

### Zyprexa intramuscular [^113ymj6Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended oral dose of olanzapine is 5 to 10 mg initially, taken once daily without regard to meals, with the target dose being 10 mg/day achieved within several days. Dosage adjustments should generally occur at intervals of not less than one week, as steady state for olanzapine is typically not reached until approximately one week. When dosage adjustments are necessary, increments or decrements of 5 mg once daily are recommended.

Efficacy in treating schizophrenia was demonstrated in clinical trials at doses ranging from 10 to 15 mg/day. However, doses above 10 mg/day have not been shown to be more effective than the 10 mg/day dose. Increasing the dose above the target 10 mg/day, such as to 15 mg/day or greater, is recommended only after clinical assessment. Olanzapine is not indicated for use at doses above 20 mg/day.

For special populations, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended for patients who are debilitated, have predispositions to hypotensive reactions, exhibit factors that may slow metabolism (e.g. nonsmoking female patients aged 65 years or older), or who may be more sensitive to olanzapine. Caution is advised when escalating doses in these patients.

The effectiveness of oral olanzapine at doses between 10 mg/day to 20 mg/day in maintaining treatment response has been demonstrated.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^114hNxb6]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

- **Accessibility challenges — infrastructure and maintenance logistics**: The requirement for additional resources and infrastructure for LAI use, compared to oral medications, can be a key accessibility barrier. Traditionally, healthcare facilities (i.e. clinics and hospitals) with staff experienced in caring for patients with psychiatric disorders have been required to administer LAIs. Such facilities should exist within manageable distances of the patient and be open at convenient times. Adequate staffing levels are also critical. In regions where these needs are not being met, especially in lower-resourced settings, the likelihood of non-attendance is increased. While home visits to administer injections may represent an alternative approach, these can also be limited by low staffing levels or other barriers. Pharmacists have increasingly been employed to deliver LAIs, which represents an important advancement in access because pharmacies are among the most ubiquitous and accessible healthcare settings.

The post-COVID-19 healthcare landscape may also be a barrier to clinicians adopting new treatment strategies. The administration of LAIs was suspended in some areas during the COVID-19 pandemic because it was considered an "elective" procedure. The suspension prompted the American Psychiatric Association to issue specific COVID-19 pandemic guidance on the administration of LAIs, encouraging clinics, hospitals, and other medical facilities to include the ongoing use of LAIs for patients with high-risk chronic illness as a necessary procedure.

### A comprehensive guide to long-acting injectable antipsychotics for primary care clinicians [^111kLs59]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). High credibility.

We propose a paper that provides education on commonly used long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) to improve primary care-based mental health interventions in patients with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorders. With the expanding interface of primary care and psychiatry across all healthcare settings, it has become increasingly important for primary care clinicians to have a broader understanding of common psychiatric treatments, including LAIs.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics have been shown to significantly improve treatment adherence, prevent disease progression, enhance treatment response, decrease readmission rates, and reduce social impairment. We discuss evidence-based indications and guidelines for the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics. We provide an overview of the treatment of SMI with LAIs, mainly focusing on the most commonly used long-acting injectable antipsychotics, advantages and disadvantages of each, along with outlining important clinical pearls for ease of practical application. Equipped with increased familiarity and understanding of these essential therapies, primary care clinicians can better facilitate early engagement with psychiatric care, promote more widespread use, and thus significantly improve the well-being and quality of life of patients with severe mental illness.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112AMi1b]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The consensus discussed the benefits of long-acting injectables (LAIs) in the management of bipolar disorder type I (BP-I), particularly during early disease, and identified barriers to overcome. It provided potential solutions to aid key stakeholders in making informed treatment decisions. The main consensus recommendations were as follows:

- **Consensus recommendation 1**: It is important to move away from the preconceived notion that LAIs can be used only for patients living with BP-I with the most severe disease. Communication of potential early benefits is key to avoid perpetuating the stigmatization of patients.

- **Consensus recommendation 2**: If antipsychotic therapy is included in the pharmacologic treatment plan, LAIs should be initiated as early as possible in the disease course, ideally at the first manic episode, to aid in improving long-term outcomes.

- **Consensus recommendation 3**: A collaborative focus on the direct involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process should support a more positive patient experience, better care quality, and improved health outcomes (e.g. reduced relapse and hospitalization, and reduced burden on healthcare systems).

- **Consensus recommendation 4**: With careful outcome tracking and a systematic approach to medication changes, logical and strategic combination pharmacotherapy can be designed to minimize unnecessary exposure to redundant, ineffective, or otherwise superfluous psychotropic agents.

- **Consensus recommendation 5**: The generation of additional evidence for the use of LAIs early in the disease course is crucial.

### Mortality risk associated with long-acting injectable antipsychotics: A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^116XXR5D]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics (LAI-APs) have several advantages over oral medications, but deaths reported in Japan during the early post-marketing phase vigilance period have raised safety concerns. We conducted a series of meta-analyses to assess whether LAI-APs affect the mortality of patients with schizophrenia.

Three categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to compare all-cause death (primary outcome) and death due to suicide:

- **Individual and pooled LAI-APs vs placebo**: Individual and pooled LAI-APs were compared against placebo.
- **Individual and pooled LAI-APs vs oral antipsychotics (OAPs)**: Comparisons were made between individual and pooled LAI-APs and oral antipsychotics.
- **Head-to-head comparisons of LAI-APs**: Various LAI-APs were compared to each other.

The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. We identified 52 RCTs (53 comparisons; total participants = 17,416; LAI-APs = 11,360; OAP = 3,910; placebo = 2,146; mean study duration [weeks]: LAI-APs vs placebo = 28.9, LAI-APs vs OAPs = 64.5).

Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone) differed from the placebo regarding the incidences of all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.64, P = 0.37) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.98, P = 0.98). However, in a subgroup meta-analysis of only short-duration RCTs (≤ 13 weeks), pooled LAI-APs exhibited a trend toward a lower incidence of all-cause death than placebo (RR = 0.29, P = 0.08).

Pooled LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol) did not differ from pooled OAPs regarding all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.71, P = 0.30) and death due to suicide.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QNb1e]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Comparison to other studies**: Details of literature reviews of FGA and SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder are described by Prajapati et al, highlighting the differences between this study and previous reviews. Gigante et al. and Bond et al. reviewed evidence of FGAs and SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder and concluded that FGA LAI should not be a first choice due to the risk of induction of depression, but suggested risperidone LAI is effective in bipolar disorder. Samalin et al. carried out a review of SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder and concluded that risperidone LAI may be considered for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, but more evidence is required.

While these literature reviews provide a useful overview of the subject, they generally lack the scientific rigor of systematic reviews. Recently, Chou et al. authored an article titled "A Systemic Review and Experts' Consensus for Long‐acting Injectable Antipsychotics in Bipolar Disorder". This was an expert consensus; details on the review process and methodology were not reported. Additionally, all aforementioned studies included only one SGA LAI, namely, risperidone LAI, and none included a meta‐analysis.

As far as we are aware, this is the first meta‐analysis focusing on SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder that included more than one SGA LAI. The only other meta‐analysis on this topic was by Kishi et al, and there are significant differences between the two meta‐analyses in terms of included studies, methodology, and some results. Our meta‐analysis includes studies of risperidone LAI and aripiprazole LAI, whereas Kishi et al. included…

### Antipsychotic-induced metabolic effects in the female rat: Direct comparison between long-acting injections of risperidone and olanzapine [^113ZQUmU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2015). Low credibility.

Several antipsychotics have well-known adverse metabolic effects. Studies uncovering molecular mechanisms of such drugs in patients are challenging due to high dropout rates, previous use of antipsychotics, and restricted availability of biological samples. Rat experiments, where previously unexposed animals are treated with antipsychotics, allow for direct comparison of different drugs, but have been hampered by the short half-life of antipsychotics in rodents. The use of long-acting formulations of antipsychotics could significantly increase the value of rodent models in the molecular characterization of therapeutic and adverse effects of these agents. However, as long-acting formulations have rarely been used in rodents, there is a need to characterize the basic metabolic phenotype of different antipsychotics.

Using long-acting olanzapine injections as a positive control, the metabolic effects of intramuscular long-acting risperidone in female rats were investigated for the first time. Like olanzapine, risperidone induced rapid, significant hyperphagia and weight gain, with a concomitant increase in several plasma lipid species. Both drugs also induced weight-independent upregulation of several genes encoding enzymes involved in lipogenesis, but this activation was not confirmed at the protein level. Our findings shed light on the role of drug administration, drug dose, and nutritional status in the development of rodent models for adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic agents.

### Identifying profiles of patients with bipolar I disorder who would benefit from maintenance therapy with a long-acting injectable antipsychotic [^113v2DRg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

People with bipolar I disorder experience an illness course marked by potentially disastrous manic episodes, disabling depressive episodes, and functional impairment. A frequent obstacle to wellness in these individuals is nonadherence to treatment. Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics have the potential to address nonadherence and thereby increase patients' chances at sustained recovery and normal psychosocial functioning. LAI formulations of two second-generation antipsychotics — aripiprazole monohydrate and risperidone — have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adult patients.

In a recent roundtable meeting, a panel of four experts discussed the use of these medications in bipolar I disorder. This Academic Highlights summarizes their discussion, which included the impact of functional impairment, the potential benefits of employing an LAI antipsychotic at earlier stages of bipolar illness, and the characteristics of patients who may be good candidates for treatment with an LAI antipsychotic.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112ufPqE]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

For several decades, lithium has been, and remains, the "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients living with BP-I, followed by other oral medications such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone orally disintegrating tablet. Despite declining prescription rates during the past decade due to the adverse-event and toxicity burden, it is used because of its effectiveness in both BP-I and BP-II, including for the prevention of suicidal behavior.

In recent years, LAIs such as aripiprazole and risperidone have emerged as potential maintenance treatment options for patients living with BP-I, including early in the course of the illness. At present, aripiprazole and risperidone are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; however, the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is currently off-label in Europe according to European Medicines Agency recommendations. Compared to oral antipsychotics that are shorter acting and must be taken more frequently, LAIs are designed to provide relief of symptoms by slowly releasing the drug over an extended period (weeks to months).

Studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggest that LAIs may provide additional benefits over oral antipsychotics by reducing the rates of re-hospitalization and risk of relapse, improving overall quality of life, and improving adherence to treatment. However, LAIs are not routinely offered to patients living with BP-I, for reasons that will be explored in this expert consensus report.

The main objectives of this article are to highlight the potential benefits of LAIs in the management of BP-I.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116gd7sA]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Non‐adherence is a significant problem in bipolar disorder. Second‐generation antipsychotics (SGA) long‐acting injections (LAIs) may improve adherence in bipolar disorder and may prevent relapses; however, the evidence is limited and conflicting.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of six months or more was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of SGA LAIs for bipolar disorder. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and LiLACS up to October 2016, and the manufacturers of SGA LAIs were also contacted. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were the relapse rate and all‐cause discontinuation, respectively.

A total of seven RCTs (n = 1192) were included. SGA LAIs showed superiority over placebo for study-defined relapse rate (RR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.49–0.68, P < 0.00001) and all‐cause discontinuation (RR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.64–0.82, P < 0.00001). However, no significant difference was found between SGA LAIs and oral active control for relapse rate (RR = 0.92, P = 0.79) and all‐cause discontinuation (RR = 1.2, P = 0.31).

In terms of secondary outcomes, SGA LAIs performed better than placebo in relapse to mania/hypomania, Young Mania Rating Scales (YMRS), Clinical Global Impression‐Severity (CGI‐S), and Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). There was no significant difference between SGA LAIs and oral active control regarding relapse to mania/hypomania, YMRS, CGI‐S, and extra‐pyramidal side effects (EPSE).

### SPL drug information for olanzapine [^115z5xUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of olanzapine PO (also known as Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa) in pregnant patients during the third trimester, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is advised to enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry. Additionally, neonates should be monitored for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms.

The drug olanzapine PO, also known as Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa, is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Long-acting injectable antipsychotics: An underutilized treatment option [^113d8ohM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

In this issue, Kane and colleagues report on the efficacy of aripiprazole long-acting injection (LAI) in the treatment of an acute episode of schizophrenia. At 10 weeks of treatment, both psychopathology and functioning were improved in patients treated with aripiprazole compared to placebo, with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile. The outcomes suggest that aripiprazole long-acting is a viable treatment option for patients experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia.

### Are weight gain and metabolic side effects of atypical antipsychotics dose dependent? A literature review [^114cByiF]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Numerous publications have provided evidence for clinically important metabolic adverse effects of antipsychotics, but there is no systematic evaluation as to whether weight gain and other metabolic changes are dose dependent.

- **Objective**: This review of the available literature aimed to explore a possible relationship between dosage of second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and the degree of metabolic side effects.

- **Data sources**: A literature review was conducted in three steps:
	1. Articles published between 1975 and 2004 were identified on the basis of the bibliography of an extensive review of the metabolic effects of SGAs.
	2. Articles published between 2004 and 2008 were identified by a PubMed search with the keywords: weight gain, metabolic, glucose, insulin, and lipid AND dose combined with amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone.
	3. A hand search was conducted based on the bibliography of the identified articles.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: All studies that provided information on metabolic side effects in different dose ranges were selected. Data extraction was carried out independently by two observers.

- **Data synthesis**: Preliminary evidence suggests a dose-response relationship between clozapine and olanzapine serum concentrations and metabolic outcomes, although the association between administered daily dose and metabolic outcomes is not clear. Data are controversial with regard to risperidone, and no study has yet assessed risperidone serum concentrations in association with metabolic outcomes.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation [^112hGN1A]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Although multiple older articles cite reduced risk of weight gain as a reason to choose fluphenazine LAI over a second-generation antipsychotic, there does not appear to be enough available data to support this conclusion. The Lancet meta-analysis excluded fluphenazine from its weight gain analysis due to lack of data. A single 1986 study did compare haloperidol LAI and fluphenazine LAI head to head across numerous categories, including weight gain. That study did not find a statistically significant difference between either of these agents, although it noted a trend towards superiority for haloperidol.

In terms of prolactin elevation, although some small studies indicate fluphenazine may be more prolactin-increasing than atypical antipsychotics, there is an unfortunate lack of robust comparative data for fluphenazine that would allow for a meta-analysis.

- **Prolactin elevation**: Some small studies indicate fluphenazine may be more prolactin-increasing than atypical antipsychotics, yet robust comparative data is lacking.

- **Adherence and tolerability**: The key reason for detailed analysis of antipsychotic side effects is predicting overall tolerability within patient populations as adherence issues generally stem from poor tolerance. Improved adherence eclipses most other factors in terms of overall long-term outcomes in schizophrenia treatment. Despite concerns with EPS and other side effects generally associated with poor tolerability, there was not a statistically significant difference in dropout rates for patients on fluphenazine LAI vs. other LAI options. This correlation held true both in the short term — despite higher rates of reported adverse effects with fluphenazine LAI — and in the long term, with the inclusion of studies.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation [^116mqqAL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Fluphenazine is a phenothiazine high-potency typical antipsychotic that is theorized — like most antipsychotics — to primarily exert both its therapeutic effects and side effects through the alteration of D2 receptor activity within the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways. This antipsychotic has a comparatively long history of use in the United States, being the third antipsychotic approved by the FDA. Its 1959 oral formulation approval was preceded only by the approvals of oral perphenazine in 1957 and oral chlorpromazine in 1954. Nine years after the oral formulation of fluphenazine was approved, the long-acting injectable (LAI) "depot" formulation was approved — the first approval of an antipsychotic LAI by the FDA. Until the approval of depot formulation haloperidol in 1986, this was the only long-acting injectable available on the market. Until 2021, fluphenazine was the only long-acting injectable on the WHO essential medicine list.

Early studies indicated that this long-acting formulation was at least as effective as oral antipsychotics for the management of schizophrenia, though contemporary articles recommended caution with dosing amounts and intervals to minimize side effects — also taking individual patient history into account.

Although fluphenazine LAI has a long history of being used for the treatment of schizophrenia, its use has declined as other, ostensibly more benign or efficacious, depot formulations have entered the market. However, there have been very few studies specifically evaluating fluphenazine LAI head-to-head against newer options.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Pi2F1]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Another difference between the two meta-analyses was the completeness of the search. In addition to the databases searched by Kishi et al. (Medline, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov), we also searched LiLACS (to cover literature from Latin America and the Caribbean which may not have been covered elsewhere), EMBASE, and CINAHL (to cover allied health professional literature). Furthermore, we contacted manufacturers of SGA LAIs for further published or unpublished studies, which were lacking in the previous meta-analysis.

Both meta-analyses show that placebo and active control were better than LAI regarding prolactin-related adverse effects. However, the risk ratio of prolactin-related adverse events in this meta-analysis is twice that found by Kishi et al. (RR = 5.75 in this meta-analysis vs. 2.66 in Kishi et al.) in active control studies. This is even more interesting as active control studies in Kishi et al. contained a study comparing FGA LAI (namely flupentixol decanoate), which is known to cause more prolactin-related adverse effects than SGA LAIs in general. This difference between the two meta-analyses is again likely to be due to the inclusion of a study by Macfadden et al. into the active control group by Kishi et al.

Another significant difference between the two meta-analyses is in their conclusion. The main conclusion from Kishi et al. was that "Long-acting injectable antipsychotics appear beneficial for relapse prevention in patients with rapid cycling". Although we found a similar result in our subgroup analysis, this was not the main question or the primary focus.

### Towards the development of a longer-acting injectable contraceptive: past research and current trends [^111nFLbW]. Contraception (2015). Low credibility.

A longer-acting injectable contraceptive that lasts for six months would be a valuable addition to the contraceptive method mix. It would be ideal for women interested in spacing births and/or uncertain about their future reproductive plans. This study reviews past applications of drug delivery technologies to injectable contraceptives and recent advancements in sustained drug delivery technologies that hold promise for developing a new longer-acting injectable contraceptive product.

- **Study design**: A global landscape analysis was conducted, focusing on promising sustained drug delivery technologies. Research opportunities and partnerships were established with experts in contraception and drug delivery to identify new approaches for developing a longer-acting injectable contraceptive product.

- **Results**: The landscape analysis confirmed that several existing polymer systems, such as poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and poly(epsilon-caprolactone), remain promising candidates for application to a longer-acting injectable product. Novel polymers and materials also hold promise for achieving longer release profiles and may offer other advantages over existing systems. However, products using these materials could face longer roads to regulatory approval. Additionally, recent advancements in the manufacturing process of microspheres may benefit the development of a longer-acting injectable contraceptive.

- **Conclusion**: The design of any new injectable product must consider the limitations of current injectable contraceptives and address them effectively.

### Clinical application of aripiprazole monohydrate long-acting injectables for the treatment of bipolar type I disorder: A consensus panel report [^111JLPeh]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is a severe and chronic psychiatric condition characterized by episodes of mania and depression that significantly impact quality of life and functioning. Early recurrence, high relapse rates, and poor adherence to daily oral medications complicate long-term management and increase the risk of hospitalization and suicide. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) offer a potential solution to these challenges by promoting sustained medication delivery and efficacy, reducing pharmacokinetic variability, and improving treatment adherence.

Among available LAIs, aripiprazole is the only partial dopamine D₂ receptor agonist, which may contribute to its favorable tolerability and mood-stabilizing properties. Despite the robust evidence for the efficacy and tolerability of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in patients with BP-I, this agent remains underutilized in this population. Misperceptions about efficacy and tolerability, coupled with systemic and prescriber-level barriers, have limited broader clinical adoption.

To address these issues, a round table panel of experts in psychopharmacology, the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder, and antipsychotic prescribing was convened to evaluate the clinical rationale for earlier use of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in BP-I and to identify key challenges limiting its use. This article summarizes their consensus on the pharmacological distinctiveness, practical advantages, and potential of aripiprazole monohydrate LAIs in improving long-term outcomes in individuals with BP-I.

### Long-acting injectable versus oral antipsychotics for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia: A systematic review and comparative meta-analysis of randomised, cohort, and pre-post studies [^111LgTQt]. The Lancet. Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Evidence of the comparative benefits of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) versus oral antipsychotics for schizophrenia has been inconsistent across study designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative benefits of LAIs versus oral antipsychotics in three study designs to inform clinical decision-making.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis comparing LAIs to oral antipsychotics for schizophrenia across three study designs: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and pre-post studies. Our literature search, which included studies published from database inception up to March 13, 2020, was performed without language restrictions in several databases, including MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Embase. We also searched for unpublished studies.

### Does formulation matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of oral versus long-acting antipsychotic studies [^112CMbxi]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, many authors highlighted the potential advantages of a broader prescription of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) based on various assumptions, including favorable pharmacokinetic features. In this systematic review, data from randomized controlled trials comparing LAIs versus the oral formulation of the same antipsychotic were meta-analyzed in order to ascertain whether the route of administration may be associated with a different efficacy and tolerability profile. Of 21 included studies, 18 contributed to the meta-analysis, providing data for risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, zuclopenthixol, fluphenazine, and haloperidol.

For all drugs, the number of dropouts for any reason (primary outcome) did not differ between the two formulations, except for a small effect in favor of LAI aripiprazole (2 comparisons; 986 patients; relative risk (RR) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.95). Similarly, no differences emerged in terms of dropouts for adverse events, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin increase (except for a small advantage for LAI risperidone), weight gain, non-response rate, relapse rate, and dropouts for inefficacy (except for a small advantage for oral olanzapine). Data on aripiprazole proved to be of high quality according to the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), therefore, we are confident that the effect estimate is close to the true effect. Data on risperidone were of moderate quality, while data on olanzapine, fluphenazine, zuclopenthixol, and haloperidol were of low quality.

### Optimal doses of specific antipsychotics for relapse prevention in a nationwide cohort of patients with schizophrenia [^114ycFPA]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

The superior outcome for olanzapine LAI was observed at doses of 1.4–1.6 DDDs/day.

Sensitivity analysis stratified on the basis of age, schizoaffective diagnosis, and first-episode status were consistent with the primary analysis. In the first-episode cohort, results for high-dose perhenazine (aHR = 6.12, 95% CI = 1.17–32.03), risperidone (aHR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.46–2.73), and olanzapine LAI (aHR = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01–0.16) were even more pronounced than in the primary analysis.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HQQB1]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**

- **Primary outcome measures**: Our systematic review and meta‐analysis found that on primary outcome measures, that is, study‐defined relapse rate and all‐cause discontinuation, SGA LAIs performed better than placebo but not when compared with oral active control.

It is worth noting that three of four active‐controlled studies are open label; two of them are pilot studies; and the number of patients in active control studies is less than half that of placebo‐controlled studies. However, the active‐controlled study by Vieta et al. was of high quality (Jadad score = 5) with a larger sample size (n = 260), in which SGA LAI was less effective than oral olanzapine (RR 1.63, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.37). The study by Vieta et al. contained three arms: risperidone LAI, placebo, and oral olanzapine, and used a double dummy; that is, placebo LAI was given to patients assigned to the oral olanzapine group, and placebo oral was given to patients assigned to risperidone LAI and placebo LAI groups.

It is also argued that participants in the RCTs are more likely to adhere to their oral medication owing to the extra care and monitoring they receive during studies compared to real‐world patients. This may have favored the active control group and can be a limitation of RCTs comparing SGA LAIs with oral active control. This limitation could be overcome by designing double‐blind RCTs with double dummy, that is, giving LAI placebo for the oral active control group and giving oral placebo for the SGA LAI group, as in the case of the study by Vieta et al. Such design would make the study scientifically robust.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173rAPu]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The following search strategy was employed to ensure all relevant studies assessing SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder were captured. Data were independently extracted, analyzed, verified, and quality assessed. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and LiLACS for studies published between January 2000 and October 2016, since SGA LAIs only became available after 2000. There were no language restrictions. Relevant studies referenced in identified articles were manually searched. Manufacturers of SGA LAIs were contacted for any ongoing or unpublished studies. The initial search took place in April 2016 and was rerun in October 2016, resulting in 30 additional studies being identified.

The search strategy consisted of the following three domains:

- **Disease**: bipolar*, mood disorder*, mania*, manic‐depression*, hypomania*
- **Treatment**: antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, psychotropic*, atypical*, second-generation antipsychotic*, SGA*, aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone
- **Formulation**: depot*, long‐acting inject*, LAI*, prolonged-release inject*, sustained-release inject*

The process of identifying, screening, and including or excluding studies is depicted in the PRISMA flow diagram (see Figure 1).

ARP screened titles of all retrieved studies. During title screening, only definitely non-relevant studies were excluded.

### SPL drug information for olanzapine [^1153Axx6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of olanzapine IM (also known as Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis, Zyprexa) in pregnant patients during the third trimester, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Enroll patients in a dedicated pregnancy outcome monitoring registry and monitor neonates for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms.

Olanzapine IM is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or is suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics vs placebo and their oral formulations in acute schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled-trials [^1145vPWj]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2024). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable antipsychotic drugs (LAIs) are mainly used for relapse prevention but could also be advantageous for acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.

- **Study design**: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled-trials (RCTs) comparing the second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole with placebo or their oral counterparts in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia. We analyzed 23 efficacy and tolerability outcomes, with the primary outcome being overall symptoms of schizophrenia. The results were obtained through random effects, pairwise meta-analyses, and subgroup tests. The study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 1.

- **Study results**: Sixty-six studies with 16,457 participants were included in the analysis. Eleven studies compared second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotics (SGA-LAIs) with a placebo, 54 compared second-generation oral antipsychotics (SGA-orals) with a placebo, and one compared an SGA-LAI (aripiprazole) with its oral formulation. All four SGA-LAIs reduced overall symptoms more than placebo, with mean standardized differences of -0.66 (95% CI: -0.90; -0.43) for olanzapine, -0.64 (-0.80; -0.48) for aripiprazole, -0.62 (-0.76; -0.48) for risperidone, and -0.42 (-0.53; -0.31) for paliperidone. The side-effect profiles of the LAIs corresponded to the patterns known from the oral formulations. In subgroup tests compared to placebo, some side effects were less pronounced under LAIs.

### Olanzapine - relapse prevention following mania [^112kG4mP]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

This review describes the pharmacological characteristics of olanzapine (ZYPREXA), outlines the European licensed indications, and examines four peer-reviewed, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine as maintenance therapy in patients with bipolar I disorder. These studies, ranging in duration from 47 to 78 weeks, support the view that olanzapine is an effective and well-tolerated pharmacological therapy for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder. Evidence is presented that olanzapine is effective in preventing relapse following an index manic or mixed episode with or without psychotic features, and in patients with a history of rapid cycling. The safety and tolerability of the medicine are also examined, focusing on weight gain and metabolic issues.

### Patient outcomes within schizophrenia treatment: a look at the role of long-acting injectable antipsychotics [^117CKe4E]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Compliance is a critical issue across all chronic conditions, including schizophrenia. Compliance is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon, with a continuum from taking all medications as prescribed to partial compliance to complete noncompliance. Partial compliance is a serious problem that may result in abrupt dose changes leading to unanticipated adverse effects and can demoralize the patient. Further, there is a nearly five-fold increase in the risk of relapse in first-episode patients when antipsychotic drug treatment is discontinued. Taken together, these data indicate that it is critical to ensure continuous delivery of antipsychotic treatment.

Atypical antipsychotic medications were expected to result in better adherence, primarily because of the anticipated improved efficacy and safety profile. However, atypical agents have poor adherence, irrespective of the type of atypical medication, making it difficult to predict which patients are taking their oral medications. Long-acting injectable (LAI) agents may minimize the fluctuations in peak and overall plasma levels compared with oral agents, indicating they may allow more consistent and predictable administration.

Based on clinical experience in my practice, several important observations regarding LAI use in patients with schizophrenia have been identified. First, there are potential advantages to using LAIs, including assistance in understanding reasons for poor response, the possibility of eliminating daily pill ingestion, and the elimination of the abrupt loss of medication coverage.

### Olanzapine [^112xQ8HL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the assessment of adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment in short-term, placebo-controlled trials:

- **Schizophrenia**: Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (5% for oral olanzapine vs. 6% for placebo). However, discontinuations due to increases in ALT were considered to be drug-related (2% for oral olanzapine vs. 0% for placebo).

- **Bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) monotherapy**: Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (2% for oral olanzapine vs. 2% for placebo).

- **Agitation**: Overall, there was no difference in the incidence of discontinuation due to adverse reactions (0.4% for intramuscular olanzapine for injection vs. 0% for placebo).

For adverse reactions associated with discontinuation of treatment in short-term combination trials:

- **Bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes), olanzapine as adjunct to lithium or valproate**: In a study of patients who were already tolerating either lithium or valproate as monotherapy, discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 11% for the combination of oral olanzapine with lithium or valproate, compared to 2% for patients who remained on lithium or valproate monotherapy. Discontinuations with the combination of oral olanzapine and lithium or valproate that occurred in more than 1 patient included somnolence (3%), weight gain (1%), and peripheral edema (1%).

### An assessment of emergent tardive dyskinesia and existing dyskinesia in patients receiving long-acting, injectable risperidone: results from a long-term study [^113YVnwk]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment-emergent tardive dyskinesia (TD) can be a serious side effect of antipsychotic treatment. Atypical antipsychotics are associated with a lower risk for TD than conventional agents. A long-acting atypical antipsychotic, with more stable blood levels and lower peak blood levels than an oral formulation, may provide differential benefit regarding side effects, including movement disorders. This analysis assessed TD by defined research criteria in patients receiving long-acting, injectable risperidone.

- **Methods**: Clinically stable subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in a 50-week, open-label trial of long-acting, injectable risperidone. TD was studied by defined research criteria (Schooler, N.R. Kane, J.M., 1982. Research diagnosis for tardive dyskinesia. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 39, 486–487; American Psychiatric Association, 2000. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders, fourth ed. American Psychiatric Association, Washington, DC). The severity of dyskinesia and other movement disorders was rated by the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).

- **Results**: ESRS dyskinesia data were available for 662 patients. Five of 530 subjects without dyskinesia at baseline (0.94%) met the predefined criteria for emergent persistent TD during therapy. Based on either exposure to study medication or Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 1-year rate was 1.19%. Among the 132 subjects with dyskinesia at baseline, the mean score on the ESRS physician's exam for dyskinesia improved significantly at endpoint (-2.77; P < 0.0001), regardless.

### Assessment of strategies for switching patients from olanzapine to risperidone: A randomized, open-label, rater-blinded study [^116PzN6g]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The 6-week, open-label, rater-blinded study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three strategies for switching patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder from olanzapine to risperidone. The reason for switching treatments in these patients was a lack of adequate clinical response to olanzapine, a body mass index (BMI) of more than 26 kg/m², or glucose dysregulation.

Patients were randomly assigned to one of three strategies for switching from olanzapine to risperidone: abrupt, gradual 1 (1 week), or gradual 2 (2 weeks), as described below. Dose adjustments were made in an open-label fashion; however, all psychiatric assessments were performed by raters blinded to study group assignment. The trial was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association).

Patients were recruited at 19 sites in the United States. Participants were men or women aged 18 to 65 years with a DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Outpatients or stable chronic inpatients could be included. All patients were required to have received a stable dose of olanzapine for at least 30 days before randomization and to have had no acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms within the preceding 3 months. To qualify for the study, subjects also had to meet the following criteria: a Positive and Ne…

### Using long-acting injectable antipsychotics to enhance the potential for recovery in schizophrenia [^113S7WXM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

The goals of schizophrenia treatment are to control symptoms, prevent relapse, and improve functioning and quality of life. For many patients, these goals are not being met. This report highlights information provided by experts on the reasons for, impact of, and means to reduce relapse in patients with schizophrenia; on patient-centered and patient-reported assessments; on the benefits and risks of medication options, including long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics; and on psychosocial interventions that may improve adherence and help prevent relapse in individuals living with schizophrenia. Modifiable risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with schizophrenia include longer duration of untreated illness, comorbid substance abuse, early nonresponse to an antipsychotic, and the number of relapses that are related to nonadherence.

Recommendations include:

- **Adopting a patient-centered approach**: Incorporate the use of patient-reported outcome measures.
- **Selecting medications**: Base choices on a balanced risk-benefit assessment, including a focus on addressing symptoms for which the agents were superior to placebo and/or active controls.
- **Considering LAIs as an alternative to oral medications**: LAIs offer benefits such as reliable drug delivery, uncovering nonadherence and pseudo-resistance, and reduced relapse risk and mortality.
- **Implementing psychosocial interventions**: These interventions have been proven effective in improving adherence and overall outcomes.

### Choosing an optimal antipsychotic dose for relapse prevention [^113o5CVg]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Low credibility.

What should be done when some patients become unstable or have frequent relapses? Since inappropriate dosing can substantially influence drug efficacy, comparison of drug efficacy should only involve doses in the more efficacious range. Tiihonen's group, in their Table 1, lists the drug and dose combinations most efficacious at preventing relapse. As a crude approximation, we average the mean hazard ratio (HR) of the three most efficacious doses, finding that the drugs best at preventing relapse were: olanzapine LAI, clozapine, and risperidone LAI.

All the other three LAIs and oral olanzapine had an average HR of 0.40. The other oral drugs had an average HR of 0.67. Since depot drugs are frequently used in patients with frequent relapses and suspected noncompliance, and clozapine is used for treatment-resistant patients, the favorable results observed occur despite likely bias. These findings suggest that when a patient seems unstable or has had frequent relapses, the clinician should avoid ultra-high doses and consider switching to an LAI or a different oral medication, such as clozapine.

### Risperidone versus olanzapine for schizophrenia [^112Lk9nj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic medication is a mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia, with risperidone and olanzapine being the most popular choices among the new generation drugs.

- **Objectives**: To determine the clinical effects, safety, and cost-effectiveness of risperidone compared with olanzapine for treating schizophrenia.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (June 2004), which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. References of all identified studies were inspected for further trials. We also contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all clinical randomized trials comparing risperidone with olanzapine for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).

- **Main results**: We found no difference for the outcome of unchanged or worse in the short term (n = 548, 2 RCTs, RR 1.00 CI 0.88 to 1.15). One study, sponsored by the manufacturers of olanzapine, favored this drug for the outcome of relapse/rehospitalization by 12 months (n = 279, RR 2.16 CI 1.31 to 3.54, NNT 7 CI 4 to 25). Most mental state data showed the two drugs to be as effective as each other (n = 552, 2 RCTs).

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1124XbHA]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bipolar disorder, particularly in the context of maintenance therapy, the DoD/VA 2023 guidelines recommend considering the offer of oral olanzapine, oral paliperidone, or risperidone long-acting injectable for the prevention of recurrence of mania. This is suggested if lithium and quetiapine are not used, based on patient preference and characteristics.
