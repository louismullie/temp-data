## Question

How is acute viral pericarditis treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how acute viral pericarditis is treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and likely viral etiology. Then, I should risk stratify to determine inpatient versus outpatient care. Next, I'll initiate first-line therapy with high-dose NSAIDs plus adjunct colchicine and gastroprotection. After that, I should add nonpharmacologic measures including exercise restriction. If NSAIDs are contraindicated or fail, I need to consider low-dose corticosteroids with colchicine while avoiding pitfalls. I will then address nuances for presumed viral disease, including effusion and myopericarditis. For refractory or recurrent disease, I should consider anti–IL-1 agents. Finally, I need to set a monitoring plan and discuss prognosis, ensuring each step aligns with guideline and trial evidence, and correcting any missteps as I verify details along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Acute pericarditis is a clinical diagnosis requiring at least two of the following: typical pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, characteristic ECG changes with diffuse concave ST elevation and PR depression, or a new or worsening pericardial effusion; in developed countries, most cases are idiopathic and presumed viral when no specific cause is identified, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) should be performed to evaluate for effusion and complications at baseline [^114weJcn] [^114kFUzm] [^115CTbH4].

> Next, I should risk stratify to decide the care setting. High-risk features that prompt admission include fever greater than 38°C, subacute course, large effusion or tamponade, failure of NSAID therapy, immunosuppression, trauma, oral anticoagulation use, and suspected myopericarditis; if these are absent, outpatient management with close follow-up is reasonable, but I should confirm the effusion size and hemodynamics with TTE before finalizing disposition [^1116mWCY] [^1152ABKh].

> Wait, let me verify the role of inflammatory markers in risk decisions. Elevated CRP reflects active inflammation and guides treatment duration and taper, but it is not a standalone major admission criterion in ESC guidance; I should use CRP primarily to track response rather than to define admission by itself, correcting my initial impulse to list it as a high-risk criterion [^115sdPx1] [^114kFUzm].

> I will now initiate first-line pharmacotherapy. High-dose aspirin, such as 750–1,000 mg (commonly simplified as 800 mg) every 6–8 hours with a gradual taper after symptom and CRP resolution, or an alternative NSAID like ibuprofen, is foundational; adjunct colchicine at 0.5 mg twice daily if weight is greater than 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily if 70 kg or less for 3 months reduces persistence of symptoms, hospitalizations, and particularly recurrences, as demonstrated in ICAP and earlier COPE data, and endorsed by ESC 2015 [^113q1bz5] [^1143BTfP] [^115sdPx1].

> Hold on, I should confirm gastroprotection. Because high-dose NSAIDs elevate gastrointestinal risk, co-prescribing a proton pump inhibitor is recommended in guidelines as prophylactic acid-suppressive therapy, especially during the high-dose period and taper [^113vQxQH].

> Let me consider supportive, nonpharmacologic measures. Exercise restriction is advised until symptoms resolve and CRP, ECG, and echocardiogram normalize; for athletes, more stringent restrictions apply, but even in non-athletes, I should not rush return to strenuous activity before objective and symptomatic resolution is documented [^117Vztjn] [^115sdPx1].

> If NSAIDs are contraindicated or fail, I should escalate thoughtfully. Low-dose corticosteroids, typically prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day, can be considered only in combination with colchicine and ideally reserved for those with specific indications such as intolerance to NSAIDs, pregnancy beyond 20 weeks, or systemic inflammatory disease, with very slow tapers to prevent rebound flares; critically, prior or high-dose steroid exposure is associated with higher recurrence risk and may blunt colchicine's benefit, so I must minimize dose and duration and avoid steroid monotherapy [^112YtLWK] [^114weJcn] [^111ssLDZ] [^116GxQ6q] [^112RPbXM].

> But wait, what about the virology-specific management? In presumed viral or idiopathic cases, routine antiviral therapy is not indicated unless a specific pathogen such as tuberculosis, HIV, or hepatitis C is identified, so my focus remains on anti-inflammatory therapy plus colchicine and supportive care while excluding nonviral etiologies when clinically suspected [^114kFUzm] [^111ssLDZ].

> I should double-check my approach to effusions and hemodynamics. Small, hemodynamically insignificant effusions are managed conservatively with NSAID plus colchicine; large effusions or any signs of tamponade mandate urgent evaluation, admission, and consideration of pericardiocentesis while treating the underlying inflammatory process and monitoring closely with TTE [^1116mWCY] [^1152ABKh].

> Let me now examine the possibility of myocardial involvement. When troponin is elevated and ECG or imaging supports myopericarditis, the anti-inflammatory and colchicine strategy is generally similar, with avoidance of strenuous activity and careful monitoring; intriguingly, observational data suggest troponin elevation may correlate with fewer recurrences in pericarditis, and emerging reports indicate colchicine can still be effective and safe in myopericarditis, though prior RCTs excluded such patients and data remain limited [^114VMQx2] [^113ScEGS] [^111NrwC3].

> For refractory or recurrent disease, I need to confirm when to introduce targeted cytokine blockade. In corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant recurrent pericarditis, IL-1 pathway inhibitors such as anakinra or rilonacept markedly reduce recurrences and time to pain relief in randomized data and meta-analysis, but these agents are not for the first acute episode; ESC initially issued a class IIb recommendation for anakinra in recurrent cases, and subsequent evidence supports upgraded use in selected recurrent disease with systemic inflammation [^113D95Ct] [^1154QWby].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up cadence. I need to ensure symptoms and CRP trend downward before initiating NSAID taper, re-evaluate with ECG, and repeat TTE if baseline abnormalities or effusion were present; while some schedules suggest reassessment at 2 weeks and again by 2–3 months, I should acknowledge that exact intervals are individualized and not rigidly evidence-based, with the principle being to guide taper by symptom control and CRP normalization and to complete a full 3-month colchicine course after a first episode [^114kFUzm] [^115sdPx1].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should reconcile the expected outcomes to set expectations. With appropriate NSAID plus colchicine therapy, 70–85% of patients experience a benign course, with tamponade occurring in less than 3% and constrictive pericarditis in less than 0.5%; colchicine roughly halves the recurrence risk compared with anti-inflammatory therapy alone in first-episode pericarditis, so adherence and completion of the 3-month course are key for optimal outcomes [^114kFUzm] [^113q1bz5].

> Finally, let me summarize the practical, stepwise algorithm I will use and double-check alignment with evidence. Diagnose pericarditis clinically and with TTE, exclude red flags and high-risk features to determine setting, start high-dose aspirin or ibuprofen plus colchicine with PPI, restrict exercise until full clinical and biomarker remission with normalization of ECG and TTE, guide NSAID taper by CRP and symptoms, avoid early or high-dose steroids and never use them without colchicine, and reserve IL-1 blockade for recurrent, colchicine-resistant, steroid-dependent disease; this sequence reflects ESC guidance and high-quality RCT data supporting colchicine in acute pericarditis and modern data supporting IL-1 inhibition in selected recurrent cases [^113vQxQH] [^115sdPx1] [^113q1bz5] [^113D95Ct] [^1154QWby].

---

The cornerstone of acute viral pericarditis treatment is **NSAIDs plus colchicine** [^113q1bz5] to control inflammation [^113vQxQH], relieve pain [^114kFUzm], and prevent recurrence [^115sdPx1]. **Corticosteroids** are reserved for patients with contraindications to, or failure of, first-line therapy [^112YtLWK] and should be used cautiously given the higher recurrence risk [^113db1AL]. Hospitalization is indicated when high-risk features are present (tamponade, large effusion, myopericarditis, immunosuppression, anticoagulation, or trauma) [^1116mWCY] [^114kFUzm]. Most patients improve within days to weeks; however, 15–30% experience recurrence [^116qhEnp], managed with prolonged colchicine and, when needed, IL-1 blockers [^113D95Ct] [^1154QWby].

---

## Pharmacological management

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- **First-line therapy**: Aspirin or NSAIDs are recommended [^113vQxQH] as initial treatment for acute viral pericarditis [^114weJcn].

- **Dosing**: Aspirin 750–1000 mg every 8 hours; ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours; indomethacin 25–50 mg every 8 hours.

- **Duration**: Continue until symptom resolution and normalization of inflammatory markers (CRP) [^113vQxQH], typically 1–2 weeks, then taper gradually [^114kFUzm].

- **Gastroprotection**: Proton pump inhibitors [^113vQxQH] are recommended to prevent gastrointestinal complications.

---

### Colchicine

- **Adjunct therapy**: Colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for patients > 70 kg; 0.5 mg once daily for patients ≤ 70 kg) is recommended [^115sdPx1] as adjunctive therapy to NSAIDs [^113q1bz5].

- **Duration**: Continue colchicine for 3 months [^115sdPx1] to reduce recurrence risk [^113q1bz5].

- **Efficacy**: Colchicine significantly reduces [^116LN87g] recurrence rates and symptom persistence [^1143BTfP].

---

### Corticosteroids

Second-line therapy consists of low-dose **corticosteroids** (prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day) and is reserved for patients with contraindications to, or failure of, NSAIDs and colchicine [^112YtLWK]. Caution is warranted given their association with **increased recurrence risk** [^113db1AL], and steroids should be tapered slowly [^112YtLWK].

---

## Non-pharmacological management

Rest and **activity restriction** [^117Vztjn] are recommended until symptom resolution and normalization of inflammatory markers [^114weJcn]. Hospitalization is indicated for **high-risk patients**, such as those with cardiac tamponade, large effusion (> 20 mm), myopericarditis, immunosuppression, anticoagulation, or trauma [^1116mWCY] [^113db1AL].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Clinical monitoring includes regular assessment of symptoms, inflammatory markers (CRP) [^114weJcn], and **echocardiography** to assess effusion size and detect complications [^1152ABKh]. Follow-up should include visits at **1 week, 1 month, and 3 months** after treatment initiation.

---

## Complications and recurrence

Complications include **cardiac tamponade**, constrictive pericarditis, and recurrence [^114VMQx2] [^114kFUzm]. Recurrence occurs in **15–30%** [^116qhEnp] of patients and is managed with prolonged colchicine therapy [^112Tzmpu], and, in refractory cases, interleukin-1 blockers (anakinra, rilonacept) [^113D95Ct].

---

## Prognosis

Overall, the **prognosis** is favorable with appropriate treatment, although recurrence and complications can still occur [^114VMQx2] [^114kFUzm].

---

Acute viral pericarditis is **managed with NSAIDs and colchicine** [^113vQxQH], with corticosteroids reserved for selected cases [^114weJcn]. Monitoring and follow-up are **essential** to detect complications and recurrence [^114kFUzm].

### Usefulness of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for idiopathic recurrent pericarditis [^115De15H]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (IRP) is a debilitating illness which leads to great suffering and multiple hospitalizations. Management of acute pericarditis and subsequent recurrences has evolved significantly as the use of colchicine-based strategies becomes more prevalent. However, there remains a subset of patients refractory to colchicine therapy who require prolonged corticosteroid (CS) therapy for symptom control. Since the 1960s, there have been reports of successful management of these cases with immunosuppressive therapy. Guidelines support the use of anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulins, and azathioprine for IRP management, with the goals of controlling symptoms and withdrawing CS. Recent reports provide evidence for both auto-inflammatory and autoimmune activity in these patients. We review the available reports regarding the pathophysiology and reported cases and case series of IRP cases managed with immunomodulation therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of colchicine for the treatment of myopericarditis [^111NrwC3]. Heart (2024). Low credibility.

Pericarditis and myocarditis share common etiologies, and overlapping forms may be encountered in clinical practice. Colchicine is effective and safe for the treatment of acute and recurrent pericarditis. However, data are lacking regarding its efficacy and safety in the setting of pericarditis with concomitant myocarditis, as these patients were excluded in previous studies. The aim of the present work is to explore the possible efficacy and safety of colchicine in reducing recurrences in patients with a first attack of pericarditis with concomitant myocarditis.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of colchicine and anti-interleukin-1 agents in recurrent pericarditis: A pairwise and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1154QWby]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

The management of recurrent pericarditis includes colchicine and anti-interleukin-1 agents, given the limited efficacy and adverse effects of NSAIDs and corticosteroids. We conducted a pairwise and network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine and anti-interleukin-1 agents in recurrent pericarditis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive search on various databases to retrieve relevant randomized controlled trials. Pairwise meta-analyses were performed in R using the exact Mantel-Haenszel method. We also performed a network meta-analysis with a colchicine group as the comparator.

- **Results**: A total of 6 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The risk of pericarditis recurrence was significantly decreased by colchicine (risk ratio [RR], 0.46 [95% CI, 0.37–0.58]) and anti-interleukin-1 agents (RR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.03–0.54]) compared with placebo or standard therapy. Colchicine significantly decreased the risk of treatment failure (RR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.31–0.57]) and pericarditis-related rehospitalization (RR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.10–0.70]) but did not have a significant impact on the risk of adverse events (RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.31–3.62]). Anti-interleukin-1 agents were associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events (RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.60–2.21]). The network meta-analysis showed that anti-interleukin-1 agents were associated with a greater reduction in pericarditis recurrence than colchicine (RR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.11–0.67]), with no significant difference with respect to adverse events (RR, 1.77 [95% CI, 0.

### Pericarditis and autoinflammation: A clinical and genetic analysis of patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis and monogenic autoinflammatory diseases at a national referral center [^112bD192]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Importantly, the treat-to-target strategy relies on validated measures of disease activity, an area that has been neglected in research into idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (IRP). The difficulty of distinguishing disease activity from disease damage in chronic diseases, specifically in autoinflammatory diseases, is well recognized. In previous studies of IRP, the number or timing of recurrences has been widely used. However, there is significant heterogeneity in the presentation of disease recurrence, both between and within patients, and in the definitions used by studies, which limits the generalizability and reproducibility of such research.

This is particularly pertinent given that more than one-third of our patients report chest pain without evidence of acute pericardial inflammation on investigation. Consensus guidance on the management of systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAID) advocates the parallel use of disease activity and disease damage scores to facilitate titration of pharmacological interventions against disease activity. This approach also involves monitoring for complications that may necessitate alternative treatment approaches and for which the benefit of immunomodulatory drugs may not have been proven. Given the adverse outcomes associated with prolonged corticosteroid use, and both the potential side effects and cost of newer biologic agents, distinguishing between active inflammatory disease amenable to immunomodulation and established noninflammatory complications is crucial to minimize treatment-associated harms. The development and validation of disease activity and damage scores are therefore urgent.

### Incidence and impact of acute pericarditis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^114jbgVy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The global pandemic of COVID‐19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, has challenged health care services worldwide. The infection not only caused respiratory complications but also resulted in extrapulmonary syndromes and risks to other systems, including the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular complications linked with COVID‐19 include myocarditis, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and atrial fibrillation.

Most COVID‐19 reports have focused on myocardial involvement, whereas studies on pericardial disease, including acute pericarditis (AP), have been less common. AP is the most common inflammatory heart disorder and includes infectious and noninfectious forms. Although the number of case reports suggesting the coexistence of AP and COVID‐19 is increasing, the incidence and effects of AP on the prognosis of patients with COVID‐19 are unclear. Therefore, using the latest data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS), we aim to investigate the incidence, associated adverse events, and impact of AP on hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.

### International collaborative systematic review of controlled clinical trials on pharmacologic treatments for acute pericarditis and its recurrences [^111ssLDZ]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis is common, yet uncertainty persists regarding its treatment. We aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review on pharmacologic treatments for acute pericarditis and its recurrences.

- **Methods**: Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included if they focused on pharmacologic agents for acute pericarditis or its recurrences. Random-effect odds ratios (ORs) were computed for long-term treatment failure, pericarditis recurrence, rehospitalization, and adverse drug effects.

- **Results**: From 2,078 citations, 7 studies were finally included (451 patients); only 3 were randomized trials. Treatment comparisons were as follows: colchicine versus standard therapy (3 studies, 265 patients), steroids versus standard therapy (2 studies, 31 patients), low-dose versus high-dose steroids (1 study, 100 patients), and statins versus standard therapy (1 study, 55 patients). Colchicine was associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure (OR = 0.23 [0.11–0.49]) and recurrence of pericarditis (OR = 0.39 [0.20–0.77]), but with a trend toward more adverse effects (OR = 5.27 [0.86–32.16]). Overall, steroids were associated with a trend toward increased risk of recurrence (OR = 7.50 [0.62–90.65]). Conversely, low-dose steroids proved superior to high-dose steroids for treatment failure or recurrence (OR = 0.29 [0.13–0.66]), rehospitalizations (OR = 0.19 [0.06–0.63]), and adverse effects (OR = 0.07 [0.01–0.54]). Data on statins were inconclusive.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical evidence informing decision-making for the management of acute pericarditis is limited yet pivotal.

### 2015 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases: The task force for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) endorsed by: The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) [^115sdPx1]. European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pericarditis, specifically with respect to colchicine, EACTS/ESC 2015 guidelines recommend administering colchicine (0.5 mg, 1–2 times daily in patients < 70 kg or intolerant to higher doses) as first-line therapy for acute pericarditis as an adjunct to aspirin/NSAID therapy.

### Anti-interleukin-1 agents for pericarditis: a primer for cardiologists [^113D95Ct]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

The current 2015 ESC guidelines provide a class IIb recommendation (level of evidence C) for the use of anakinra in patients with recurrent pericarditis and corticosteroid dependence, not responsive to colchicine, based on limited case reports available at that time. However, subsequent research has expanded to larger observational studies and the first randomized controlled clinical trial.

- **Indications, therapeutic scheme, and monitoring**: The strongest evidence to support the use of anti-IL-1 agents in pericarditis is for cases of recurrent pericarditis with corticosteroid dependence (unable to taper or withdraw corticosteroids) and colchicine resistance (recurrences despite the use of colchicine). Including the larger observational studies and randomized controlled clinical trials, following a median follow-up of 14 months (interquartile range 12–39), patients receiving anti-IL-1 agents (anakinra or rilonacept) had a significantly lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for recurrent pericarditis (IRR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03–0.14, I² = 95%) compared to patients receiving placebo and/or standard medical therapy. Anti-IL-1 agents reduced the risk of recurrent pericarditis both in the subgroup of randomized controlled clinical trials (IRR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.12, I² = 0%) and observational studies (IRR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03–0.17, I² = 95%). On this basis, the evidence supports upgrading the recommendations for the use of anti-IL-1 agents (anakinra or rilonacept) in patients with recurrent pericarditis, who are not responsive to colchicine and other conventional therapies.

### Seasonal patterns of acute and recurrent idiopathic pericarditis [^116ruP9e]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Idiopathic pericarditis is presumed to result from viral infection. The incidence rates of some viral infections have typical seasonal patterns, yet the data in the literature on a possible seasonal pattern of acute pericarditis are very limited. The mechanisms and possible seasonality of recurrent episodes are not well established.

- **Hypothesis**: The incidence of acute idiopathic pericarditis has a seasonal pattern.

- **Methods**: The computerized database of a tertiary, university-affiliated hospital was searched for all patients admitted with a first episode of acute idiopathic pericarditis between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. Patients for whom a nonviral etiology for the pericarditis was identified were excluded.

- **Results**: The final cohort included 175 patients (75% male) aged 19 to 86 years (median = 50.0 ± 18.2 years). The incidence of the disease was twice as high during the colder half of the year (October-March) than the warmer half, peaking in the first quarter (January-March, P = 0.001). This first-quarter peak was observed in each of the six years examined. Comparison of the patients who acquired pericarditis during peak and non-peak quarters yielded no differences in baseline characteristics, peak body temperature, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, or frequency of myocardial involvement or liver enzyme elevation. No seasonal pattern was identified for recurrent episodes of pericarditis (n = 57).

- **Conclusions**: Acute idiopathic pericarditis appears to have a seasonal pattern with a distinct late winter peak. No seasonal pattern was identified for recurrent episodes.

### Covid-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: A case report [^115MnNNj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

As the world community has experienced years of disease, the lingering effects of COVID-19 — commonly referred to as 'long COVID-19' — have begun to appear. Persistent symptoms remain in subsets of patients; some are minimally debilitating, while others are crippling. Some acute cardiovascular consequences of the infection manifest as chronic problems, such as COVID-19-related cardiomyopathy. This report aims to describe another cardiac pathology associated with COVID-19: constrictive pericarditis. This additional chronic entity, constrictive pericarditis, can now be added to the growing list of cardiac COVID-19 cases. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of this condition, along with the findings and treatment with pericardiectomy, are described in this case report. We believe this is the first report of COVID-19-associated constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy.

### High mortality with COVID-19 acute pericarditis [^1128rNHC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The study by Li and Shi suggests that when there is clinically manifest acute pericarditis in a patient with COVID-19, whether myocardial involvement is present or not, there is a level of inflammation associated with a striking mortality difference. The study further elucidates the causes of pericarditis in COVID-19 and raises the question of why clinical pericardial involvement, even without tamponade, might be associated with such high mortality.

The visceral pericardium has a blood supply from the internal thoracic arteries, off the subclavian arteries, and from the bronchial arteries, off the thoracic aorta. It has postganglionic sympathetic innervation and preganglionic parasympathetic innervation. The sensory neurons are carried within the phrenic nerve. There is also lymphatic drainage of the pericardium. Systemic inflammation with endothelial changes in the pericardial vasculature can inflame the visceral pericardium, making it more vascular and thus more inflamed. Alterations in the parasympathetic ganglia may contribute to the sinus tachycardia and atrial arrhythmia often seen in acute pericarditis.

The parietal pericardium, which is largely fibrous and avascular, can trap the inflammation in the pericardial sac. This results in a rub, pleuritic discomfort, and effusion. If visceral pericardial inflammation is severe enough, it can lead to myopericarditis because changes in the visceral pericardium affect the epicardium, resulting in electrocardiographic changes and the expected pain and rub.

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following Covid-19 vaccination: living evidence syntheses and review [^112vqi9q]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

This review had several strengths. We used a comprehensive, peer-reviewed search strategy and included grey literature to capture recent data. A second reviewer screened the most relevant citations (based on machine learning) and verified all data and risk of bias assessments. GRADE assessments were based on team consensus, including clinical experts. Patient partners reviewed the evidence and developed interpretations from the patient perspective.

The main limitation of our review was that the Covid-19 literature base is evolving rapidly with new evidence constantly emerging; nevertheless, some of our review findings were associated with moderate certainty evidence. Furthermore, one or more updates are planned and will be made publicly accessible via the COVID-END website. Because of apparent differences in presentation between myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination seen in our original review, and different long-term sequelae, we analyzed these outcomes separately where possible. Although myocarditis and pericarditis often coexist, myocarditis is more easily diagnosed due to the presence of elevated cardiac troponin or imaging findings on cardiac MRI. Conversely, pericarditis is often diagnosed based on chest pain symptoms and findings on echocardiogram, and given this subjectivity, related data are likely less robust.

In some cases, authors clearly considered the term myopericarditis to include myocarditis, pericarditis, or both. In others, this distinction was not transparent, and use of these data for rates of myopericarditis could be challenging.

### Efficacy and safety of rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis: results from a phase II clinical trial [^116EKjTY]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

The efficacy of rilonacept for recurrent pericarditis was assessed using multiple endpoints, examining patient-reported pericarditis pain, HRQOL, and inflammatory and clinical manifestations of pericarditis.

- **Resolution of acute pericarditis episodes**: In symptomatic patients with elevated CRP > 1 mg/dL (n = 13) in parts 1 and 4, reductions in average pericarditis pain were observed as soon as after the first (loading) dose of rilonacept, and these decreases were maintained throughout the study. Reductions in pain averaged 4 points on an 11-point pain NRS (ranging from 0 to 10). Similarly, decreases in CRP were observed after the first rilonacept dose and were maintained throughout the study. The median time to CRP normalization was 9.0 days. Other pericarditis manifestations resolved in these patients (refer to online supplemental results and online supplemental table 1). For the remaining symptomatic patients in part 2 who had confirmed pericardial inflammation by MRI (n = 3), an NRS pain reduction was also observed, and the low levels of CRP at study entry were maintained.

Figure 2 shows NRS scores (pain) and CRP levels in symptomatic patients with elevated CRP. CRP stands for C-reactive protein, NRS for numeric rating scale, and RP for rePericarditis.

- **Reduced annualized incidence of pericarditis**: Across all study parts, there was a reduction in pericarditis episode frequency, as demonstrated by a decrease in mean annualized incidence from 3.9 (SD 3.66) episodes per year for all patients prior to study entry to 0.18 (SD 0.62) in part 1 and 0.0 for the remaining study parts during the study (i.e. while on rilonacept treatment).

### Colchicine in addition to conventional therapy for acute pericarditis: Results of the colchicine for acute pericarditis (COPE) trial [^1143BTfP]. Circulation (2005). High credibility.

The COPE study, published by Imazio M and colleagues in 2005 in the journal Circulation, examined acute pericarditis. It posed the question of whether conventional therapy plus colchicine is superior to conventional therapy alone in patients experiencing a first episode of acute pericarditis. This multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial included 120 patients (66 female, 54 male).

The inclusion criteria were patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis. Key exclusion criteria included tuberculous, neoplastic, or purulent causes of pericarditis, severe liver disease, myopathy, blood dyscrasias, gastrointestinal disease, and pregnancy or lactation.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 60 received conventional therapy plus colchicine (1.0 to 2.0 mg on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg daily for 3 months, along with aspirin).
	- n = 60 received conventional therapy alone (aspirin 800 mg PO every 6 or 8 hours for 7 to 10 days, with gradual tapering over 3 to 4 weeks).

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in recurrence at 18 months (10.7% vs. 32.3%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 3.1 to 10).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant decrease in symptom persistence at 72 hours (11.7% vs. 36.7%; RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.53).

- **Safety outcomes**: There was a significant difference in therapy discontinuation due to side effects (8.3% vs. 0%).

The study concluded that in patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis, conventional therapy with colchicine was effective in reducing recurrence and symptom persistence.

### Idiopathic recurrent pericarditis: Not really so idiopathic [^114sV76M]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Colchicine is the cornerstone for the prevention of recurrent episodes of pericarditis, as demonstrated almost two decades ago. More recently, drugs targeting interleukin‐1β more directly, such as rilonacept and anakinra, have garnered interest.

In the AIRTRIP (Anakinra‐Treatment of Idiopathic Recurrent Pericarditis) trial, anakinra, an interleukin‐1β recombinant receptor antagonist, reduced the risk of recurrence over a median of 14 months in a small population of patients with recurrent pericarditis (defined as having three or more previous recurrences). These patients also exhibited elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), colchicine resistance, and corticosteroid dependence. Eleven patients received anakinra, and ten received placebo.

Rilonacept is a soluble decoy receptor "trap" that binds both interleukin‐1α and interleukin‐1β. In the RHAPSODY (Rilonacept Inhibition of Interleukin‐1 Alpha and Beta for Recurrent Pericarditis: A Pivotal Symptomatology and Outcomes Study) trial, patients with recurrent pericarditis were randomized to receive either rilonacept or placebo. Those on rilonacept presented nearly no recurrences at 12 months, with 31 patients receiving rilonacept and 30 receiving placebo.

In these two studies, safety was particularly good. One major limitation is the small size of the included populations, which is often the case in this rare clinical setting. Given the limited uptake of evidence‐based therapies, corroborating the involvement of interleukin‐1β in the pathophysiology of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis remains essential. Herein, the authors studied in depth their cohort of 13 patients.

### Efficacy and safety of colchicine for treatment of multiple recurrences of pericarditis (CORP-2): A multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial [^116Hdtk5]. Lancet (2014). High credibility.

Colchicine is effective for the treatment of acute pericarditis and first recurrences; however, conclusive data are lacking for the efficacy and safety of colchicine for the treatment of multiple recurrences of pericarditis.

- **Methods**: We conducted this multicentre, double-blind trial at four general hospitals in northern Italy. Adult patients with multiple recurrences of pericarditis (≥ two) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either placebo or colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for 6 months for patients weighing more than 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing 70 kg or less), in addition to conventional anti-inflammatory treatment with aspirin, ibuprofen, or indometacin. Randomisation was performed using permuted blocks (size four) with a central computer-based automated sequence. Both patients and all investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measured was the recurrence of pericarditis in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00235079.

- **Findings**: A total of 240 patients were enrolled, with 120 assigned to each group. The proportion of patients who experienced recurrence of pericarditis was 26 (21.6%) of 120 in the colchicine group and 51 (42.5%) of 120 in the placebo group (relative risk 0.49; 95% CI 0.24–0.65; p = 0.0009; number needed to treat 5). Adverse effects and discontinuation of the study drug occurred in similar proportions in each group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal intolerance (nine patients in the colchicine group vs. nine in the placebo group) and hepatotoxicity (three vs. one). No serious adverse events were reported.

### Management, risk factors, and outcomes in recurrent pericarditis [^1179CgJc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Fifty-five of 294 consecutive patients with acute pericarditis experienced first attacks of recurrent pericarditis and were evaluated and treated according to a management protocol. Corticosteroids were restricted to instances where aspirin use was contraindicated or had failed. Colchicine was added in cases where both aspirin and prednisone failed and was the treatment of choice for second and subsequent recurrences.

After logistic regression multivariate analysis, only the previous use of corticosteroids (odds ratio 10.35, 95% confidence interval 4.46 to 23.99, p < 0.001) was associated with an increased risk for recurrence. Following a mean follow-up of 72 months (range 48 to 108), a similar rate of complications was found in patients with or without recurrences.

For specific circumstances related to acute pericarditis, especially in patients with polyarteritis nodosa, the SHARE initiative 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an ECG and echocardiography. These diagnostic tools help identify pericarditis, valve insufficiency, myocarditis, or coronary artery abnormalities in patients with polyarteritis nodosa.

### Diagnosing pericarditis [^113HNagn]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Pericarditis, or inflammation of the pericardium, is most often caused by viral infection. It can also develop as a result of bacterial or other infections, autoimmune disease, renal failure, injury to the mediastinal area, and the effects of certain drugs (notably hydralazine and procainamide). The clinical features of pericarditis depend on its cause, as well as the volume and type of effusion. Patients with uncomplicated pericarditis experience pleuritic-type chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and may be relieved by leaning forward. Chest radiographs, Doppler studies, and laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the degree of effusion. In most patients, pericarditis is mild and resolves spontaneously, although treatment with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or a short course of a corticosteroid may be helpful.

When a large pericardial effusion is produced, cardiac function may be compromised, and cardiac tamponade can occur. In patients with longstanding inflammation, the pericardium becomes fibrous or calcified, resulting in constriction of the heart. Drainage or surgical intervention may be necessary in patients with complicated pericarditis.

### COVID-related constrictive pericarditis requiring pericardiectomy: a case report [^114BGuUy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in two waves across diverse populations throughout the world, the long-term impact of this viral infection on the heart is yet to be fully understood. By examining the features of previous cases as well as newly reported cases, clinicians may better understand the various manifestations of COVID-19 infection as it pertains to myopericarditis. This case report adds to the short list of similar cardiac complications experienced by others.

Two publications, for example, reported on a review of COVID-19-related cardiac disease in general and commented on some cases of myopericarditis in men under 50 years of age. Another publication highlighted the case of an 80-year-old man with constrictive pericarditis who presented with shortness of breath, peripheral edema, weight loss, and skin rash. However, this case is the first known patient to require a pericardiectomy. COVID-19-related constrictive pericarditis was diagnosed by the need for a VATS procedure in which the pleural effusion was drained and a partial anterior pericardiectomy was performed. Pathology of the specimen revealed an autoimmune or immunoglobulin etiology.

These manuscripts postulate an immunologic process as the mechanism by which the inflammatory pathways of the host result in clinical and histologic findings within the pericardium and elsewhere. Therefore, treatments were a combination of medical and surgical interventions.

### Complicated pericarditis: Understanding risk factors and pathophysiology to inform imaging and treatment [^11529vFA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients with acute pericarditis have a benign course and a good prognosis. However, a minority of patients develop complicated pericarditis, which is the focus of this review. Specifically, the review addresses risk factors, multimodality imaging, pathophysiology, and novel treatments.

- **Risk factors**: Early high-dose corticosteroids, a lack of colchicine, and an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are associated with the development of complicated pericarditis.
- **Multimodality imaging**: In select cases, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) may aid in the assessment of pericardial inflammation and constriction.
- **Pathophysiology**: Given phenotypic similarities between idiopathic pericarditis and periodic fever syndromes, disorders of the inflammasome may contribute to relapsing attacks.
- **Novel treatments**: Therapies targeting the inflammasome may lead to more durable remission and resolution.

Finally, regarding future investigations, the authors discuss the potential of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to inform treatment duration and the need to compare steroid-sparing treatments to pericardiectomy.

### Current state of knowledge on aetiology, diagnosis, management, and therapy of myocarditis: A position statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases [^117CnjJE]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

In this position statement of the ESC Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases, an expert consensus group reviews the knowledge on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of myocarditis. They propose new diagnostic criteria for clinically suspected myocarditis and its distinct biopsy-proven pathogenetic forms. The aims are to bridge the gap between clinical and tissue-based diagnosis, to improve management, and to provide a common reference point for future registries and multicentre randomized controlled trials of aetiology-driven treatment in inflammatory heart muscle disease.

### Anti-interleukin-1 agents for pericarditis: A primer for cardiologists [^114USCmn]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Anti-IL-1 agents appear to be a major advance in the medical therapy of recurrent pericarditis. These drugs represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis, allowing more targeted and personalized therapy for patients showing evidence of systemic inflammation (e.g. fever and/or CRP elevation). Selection of patients remains very important; not all subjects with pericardial diseases are good candidates for anti-IL-1 agents, especially if evidence of systemic inflammation is absent.

At present, although data are limited, there is evidence of efficacy of these agents in patients with other etiologies besides idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (e.g. postpericardiotomy syndrome and systemic autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases). The AIRTRIP and RHAPSODY trials enrolled patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis or postpericardiotomy syndromes, while 11% of patients in the IRAP registry had systemic autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases.

Pooled data suggest that anti-IL-1 agents should be a first option for corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant recurrent pericarditis with evidence of systemic inflammation by means of elevated CRP. This will very likely translate into an upgraded recommendation for these agents in future guidelines.

What are the remaining questions to be addressed? First, the best duration of therapy and the need for tapering remain to be investigated. Six to eight months appears to be an optimal duration for a first therapeutic cycle, but some patients may require longer treatments to prevent recurrence.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pericarditis, more specifically with respect to patients with long COVID, ESCMID 2022 guidelines recommend excluding other serious or life-threatening conditions. This includes prior overlooked conditions such as malignancy and complications of acute COVID-19 like thromboembolic events, myopericarditis, and encephalitis, before diagnosing long COVID in symptomatic patients. Physicians should evaluate for other conditions guided by symptoms, signs, and other tests, obtained according to their discretion.

### Advances in imaging and targeted therapies for recurrent pericarditis: A review [^116qhEnp]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease. Recurrence of pericarditis affects 15% to 30% of patients after the initial episode of pericarditis. Up to 50% of patients with the first recurrence have additional recurrences. These patients often progress to having colchicine-resistant and corticosteroid-dependent disease. Rapidly evolving cardiac magnetic resonance imaging techniques and novel targeted therapies have paved the way for imaging-guided therapy for recurrent pericarditis. However, the optimal application of these recent advances remains unclear.

A search was conducted using the PubMed and Cochrane databases for English-language studies, management guidelines, meta-analyses, and review articles published until April 2022 on recurrent pericarditis. Following the 2015 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases, new clinical trials and registry data have emerged that demonstrate the efficacy of interleukin-1 blockers in recurrent pericarditis. In addition, new observational data have come to light supporting the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of such patients.

Advances in imaging and targeted therapies have led to a paradigm shift in the management of recurrent pericarditis. This narrative review summarizes the established and emerging data on the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent pericarditis, with a special emphasis on the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and interleukin-1 blockers.

### Pretreatment with corticosteroids attenuates the efficacy of colchicine in preventing recurrent pericarditis: a multi-centre all-case analysis [^116GxQ6q]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Effective prevention of recurrent pericarditis remains an important yet elusive goal. Corticosteroid therapy often needs to be continued for a prolonged period and causes severe side effects. We performed a multi-centre all-case analysis to investigate the efficacy of colchicine in preventing subsequent relapses of pericarditis and addressed the hypothesis that pretreatment with corticosteroids may attenuate the beneficial effect of colchicine.

One hundred and forty published and unpublished cases of patients treated with colchicine after at least two relapses of pericarditis were aggregated from European centres. Of those, 119 were included in the study group. Only 18% of the patients had relapses under colchicine therapy, and 30% after its discontinuation. There were significantly more relapses among male patients after colchicine treatment (36% vs. 17%, P = 0.046), and those with previous corticosteroid treatment (43% vs. 13%, P = 0.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified previous corticosteroid therapy (OR 6.68, 95% CI: 1.65–27.02) and male gender (OR 4.20, 95% CI: 1.16–15.21) as independent risk factors for recurrence following colchicine therapy.

Treatment with colchicine is highly effective in preventing recurrent pericarditis, while pretreatment with corticosteroids exacerbates and extends the course of recurrent pericarditis.

### Anti-interleukin-1 agents for pericarditis: A primer for cardiologists [^113x324r]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Based on this preliminary experience with anakinra, the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases gave a class IIb recommendation (level of evidence C) for the use of anakinra in patients with re-pericarditis and corticosteroid dependence not responsive to colchicine, as a third-line treatment after non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and corticosteroid failure. The same level of recommendation was provided for other alternative third-line options for re-pericarditis, specifically azathioprine and intravenous human immunoglobulins, although based on weaker evidence from case reports and expert opinion without randomized trials. In some institutions, especially in the United States, pericardiectomy may be an earlier preferred option instead of third-line options, mainly after many failed attempts to discontinue steroid therapy.

Additional clinical trials are warranted to better address this issue and other evidence-based treatments.

- **Management algorithm**: The treatment of re-pericarditis involves first-line agents (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine), second-line drugs (low-dose corticosteroids and colchicine), third-line options (anakinra, azathioprine, and intravenous human immunoglobulins), and fourth-line treatment (pericardiectomy) according to the 2015 ESC guidelines. In some institutions, particularly in the US, pericardiectomy may be an earlier preferred option instead of taking injections of anti-IL-1 agents, after many failed attempts to discontinue steroid therapy.

### Colchicine in addition to conventional therapy for acute pericarditis: results of the colchicine for acute pericarditis (COPE) trial [^112RPbXM]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Colchicine is effective and safe for the treatment and prevention of recurrent pericarditis and might ultimately serve as the initial mode of treatment, especially in idiopathic cases. The aim of this work was to verify the safety and efficacy of colchicine as an adjunct to conventional therapy for the treatment of the first episode of acute pericarditis.

- **Methods and results**: A prospective, randomized, open-label design was used. A total of 120 patients (mean age 56.9 ± 18.8 years, 54 males) with a first episode of acute pericarditis (idiopathic, viral, postpericardiotomy syndromes, and connective tissue diseases) were randomly assigned to conventional treatment with aspirin (group I) or conventional treatment plus colchicine 1.0 to 2.0 mg for the first day and then 0.5 to 1.0 mg/d for 3 months (group II). Corticosteroid therapy was restricted to patients with aspirin contraindications or intolerance. The primary endpoint was recurrence rate. During the 2873 patient-month follow-up, colchicine significantly reduced the recurrence rate (recurrence rates at 18 months were, respectively, 10.7% versus 32.3%; P = 0.004; number needed to treat = 5) and symptom persistence at 72 hours (respectively, 11.7% versus 36.7%; P = 0.003). After multivariate analysis, corticosteroid use (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.21 to 15.25; P = 0.024) was an independent risk factor for recurrences. Colchicine was discontinued in 5 cases (8.3%) because of diarrhea. No serious adverse effects were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Colchicine plus conventional therapy led to a clinically important and statistically significant reduction in the recurrence rates and symptom persistence in acute pericarditis patients.

### US database study of clinical burden and unmet need in recurrent pericarditis [^1177r634]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

This study focused on idiopathic and presumed post-viral etiology, which accounts for the majority of acute pericarditis cases in the United States, but there is not a specific set of codes for idiopathic/viral etiology. The codes selected were therefore not exclusive for idiopathic and viral cases. It is possible that some of the included patients had a different etiology. Overall, 18% of patients with multiple recurrences or recurrence with a complication had autoimmune diseases, but the study did not establish whether autoimmune disorders were contributing factors to pericarditis in these patients. Also, the claims analyzed were from a commercial database and did not include US patients covered by non-commercial plans.

### ESCMID rapid guidelines for assessment and management of long COVID [^115sxQr7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pericarditis, particularly in patients with long COVID, the ESCMID 2022 guidelines recommend considering a TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) for patients presenting with persistent symptoms suggestive of perimyocardial injury, such as chest pain, palpitations, and signs and symptoms of heart failure, following a COVID-19 infection. It is advised to consider repeating the TTE at 2–3 months in patients who had cardiac abnormalities during the acute phase of the disease, including myocarditis, pericarditis, and heart failure.

### Acute pericarditis as a primary presentation of COVID-19 [^112P5CTs]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly contagious viral illness that conventionally manifests primarily with respiratory symptoms. We report a case whose first manifestation of COVID-19 was pericarditis, in the absence of respiratory symptoms and without any serious complications. Cardiac involvement in various forms is possible in COVID-19. We present a case where pericarditis, in the absence of the classic COVID-19 signs or symptoms, is the only evident manifestation of the disease. This case highlights an atypical presentation of COVID-19 and underscores the need for a high index of suspicion to allow early diagnosis and limit the spread of the virus through isolation.

European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for pericardial effusion, more specifically with respect to the setting of care, EACTS/ESC 2015 guidelines recommend admitting patients with pericardial effusion who are at high risk (e.g. cardiac tamponade, pericardial effusion > 20 mm in diastole, fever, subacute course, failure of aspirin or NSAIDs, myopericarditis, immunosuppression, trauma, OAC therapy).

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^117QJnVK]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

The study aimed to identify predictors of the composite adverse outcome such as tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, failure of treatment, clinical recurrences, or death in a large cohort of patients with acute pericarditis. Additionally, it sought to provide an overview of the causes of pericarditis and to compare clinical and laboratory profiles among subgroups, for example, those with or without adverse outcomes.

Patients were identified as having an acute event if they met the 2015 ESC guideline criteria for acute pericarditis. A re-episode requires new signs and symptoms of pericardial inflammation following a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks. Subacute pericarditis was defined as an event developing in an interval from 6 weeks to 3 months. Constrictive pericarditis was identified by the development of hemodynamic diastolic impairment due to chronic inflammation or thickening of the pericardium diagnosed through echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, or surgical biopsy. Tamponade was identified as a pericardial effusion resulting in hemodynamic compromise, diagnosed with echocardiographic criteria.

The failure of treatment was considered as the persistence of symptoms regardless of anti-inflammatory treatment for more than 4–6 weeks. A severe pericardial effusion during an echocardiogram was defined as the presence of an echo-free space greater than 20 mm, according to the classification of Imazio et al. and Weitzman et al. Heart failure at presentation was defined as having signs and symptoms of volume overload or the need to initiate treatment with a loop diuretic.

### Evaluation and treatment of pericarditis: A systematic review [^113db1AL]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common cause of chest pain.

- **Objective**: To summarize published evidence on the causes, diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and prognosis of pericarditis.

- **Evidence review**: A literature search of BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for human studies without language restriction from January 1, 1990, to August 31, 2015. After review and selection of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and large observational studies, 30 studies (5 meta-analyses, 10 randomized clinical trials, and 16 cohort studies) with 7569 adult patients were included.

- **Findings**: The etiology of pericarditis may be infectious (e.g. viral and bacterial) or noninfectious (e.g. systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post-cardiac injury syndromes). Tuberculosis is a major cause of pericarditis in developing countries but accounts for less than 5% of cases in developed countries, where idiopathic, presumed viral causes are responsible for 80% to 90% of cases. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, including chest pain, a pericardial rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. Certain features at presentation (temperature > 38°C [> 100.4°F], subacute course, large effusion or tamponade, and failure of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] treatment) indicate a poorer prognosis and identify patients requiring hospital admission.

### Cardiovascular toxicity related to cancer treatment: A pragmatic approach to the American and European cardio-oncology guidelines [^113WTYEW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with the occurrence of immune-related myocarditis, which has a high mortality rate of approximately 50%. Pericarditis, supraventricular arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and Takotsubo syndrome are other potential cardiovascular immune-related adverse events. The monitoring strategies proposed by the guidelines are detailed in Table S5.

Before initiating ICI therapy, only the ASCO-2018 guidelines recommend performing an ECG and considering troponin, especially in patients treated with combination immune therapies. However, there is no consensus among the guidelines regarding the pretherapeutic cardiovascular assessment or the monitoring of asymptomatic patients. The ASCO-2018 and ESMO-2020 guidelines recommend promptly performing an appropriate workup — which includes ECG, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, viral titer, echocardiogram with global longitudinal strain (GLS), and cardiac magnetic resonance — for patients who develop new cardiovascular symptoms or are incidentally noted to have arrhythmia or conduction abnormality on ECG, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) on echocardiogram while undergoing ICI therapy or after recent completion.

### Acute pericarditis [^114nuuxm]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Although acute pericarditis is most often associated with viral infection, it may also be caused by many diseases, drugs, invasive cardiothoracic procedures, and chest trauma. Diagnosing acute pericarditis is often a process of exclusion. A history of abrupt-onset chest pain, the presence of a pericardial friction rub, and changes on electrocardiography suggest acute pericarditis, as do PR-segment depression and upwardly concave ST-segment elevation.

Although highly specific for pericarditis, the pericardial friction rub is often absent or transient. Auscultation during end expiration with the patient sitting up and leaning forward increases the likelihood of observing this physical finding. Echocardiography is recommended for most patients to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude tamponade.

Outpatient management of select patients with acute pericarditis is an option. Complications may include pericardial effusion with tamponade, recurrence, and chronic constrictive pericarditis. Use of colchicine as an adjunct to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy for acute viral pericarditis may hasten symptom resolution and reduce recurrences.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^114VMQx2]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis is the most common presentation of pericardial diseases. Although generally benign, complications such as constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and recurrence can occur.

- **Research question**: What are the clinical factors associated with adverse outcomes in acute pericarditis?

- **Study design and methods**: We used an informatics-based search engine to search for International Classification of Diseases codes related to pericardial disease between January 1, 2009, and November 14, 2018, and then extracted clinical information, including only patients meeting the European Society of Cardiology criteria for acute pericarditis. We then evaluated the predictive value of clinical characteristics for adverse outcomes (cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, failure of therapy, recurrences, or death).

- **Results**: We identified 240 patients with a first episode of pericarditis (51 [34–62] years, 56% males, and 50% white). Pericarditis was determined to be idiopathic in 126 (53%) cases and related to cardiac injury in 79 (33%). During a median follow-up time of 179 (20–450) days, 82 (34%) patients experienced at least one adverse outcome. Subacute presentation was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. Patients with postcardiac injury pericarditis had a lower incidence in the composite of failure of treatment and recurrence (13% vs 26%; p = 0.022) compared with patients with idiopathic pericarditis. Troponin I measurements were obtained in 167 patients (70%). Elevated troponin I levels were associated with a lower incidence of recurrences.

### Acute pericarditis: Rapid evidence review [^114weJcn]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral. Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions.

Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions. Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

### A randomized trial of colchicine for acute pericarditis [^113q1bz5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Colchicine is effective for the treatment of recurrent pericarditis. However, conclusive data are lacking regarding its use during a first attack of acute pericarditis and in the prevention of recurrent symptoms.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter, double-blind trial, eligible adults with acute pericarditis were randomly assigned to receive either colchicine (at a dose of 0.5 mg twice daily for 3 months for patients weighing > 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing ≤ 70 kg) or a placebo, in addition to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy with aspirin or ibuprofen. The primary study outcome was incessant or recurrent pericarditis.

- **Results**: A total of 240 patients were enrolled, with 120 randomly assigned to each of the two study groups. The primary outcome occurred in 20 patients (16.7%) in the colchicine group and 45 patients (37.5%) in the placebo group, indicating a relative risk reduction in the colchicine group of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.72; number needed to treat, 4; P < 0.001). Colchicine reduced the rate of symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.001), the number of recurrences per patient (0.21 vs. 0.52, P = 0.001), and the hospitalization rate (5.0% vs. 14.2%, P = 0.02). Colchicine also improved the remission rate at 1 week (85.0% vs. 58.3%, P < 0.001). Overall adverse effects and rates of study-drug discontinuation were similar in both study groups, with no serious adverse events observed.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with acute pericarditis, colchicine, when added to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy, significantly reduces the recurrence of symptoms and improves remission rates.

### Recurrent pericarditis: New and emerging therapeutic options [^1113QiEU]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent pericarditis is one of the most common and troublesome complications after an episode of pericarditis, affecting 20–50% of patients treated for pericarditis. In most of these patients, the pericarditis remains idiopathic, although an immune-mediated (either autoimmune or autoinflammatory) pathogenesis is often presumed. The mainstay of therapy for recurrences is aspirin or NSAIDs, with the adjunct of colchicine. Corticosteroids are a second-line option to be considered for specific indications, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy; contraindications or intolerance to aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or colchicine; or insufficient response to these medications. Furthermore, corticosteroids can be added to NSAIDs and colchicine in patients with persistent symptoms.

In patients who do not respond adequately to any of these conventional therapies, alternative treatment options include azathioprine, intravenous human immunoglobulins, and anakinra. An improved understanding of how recurrent pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this complication, and further research is needed into the pathogenesis of recurrences.

### Management of acute and recurrent pericarditis: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111PpzHp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers, resulting from a variety of stimuli triggering a stereotyped immune response, characterized by chest pain often associated with peculiar electrocardiographic changes and, at times, accompanied by pericardial effusion. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited and not life-threatening; yet, it may cause significant short-term disability, be complicated by either a large pericardial effusion or tamponade, and carry a significant risk of recurrence. The mainstay of treatment of pericarditis is represented by anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-inflammatory treatments vary, however, in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. The objective of this review is to summarize the up-to-date management of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis: A review [^114kFUzm]. JAMA (2024). High credibility.

- **Importance**: Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (< 0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (< 3%) can be life-threatening.

- **Observations**: Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with the presence of two or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine (≈90%); new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression (≈25%-50%); a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small (≈60%); or a pericardial friction rub (< 30%). In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis.

Treatment of acute idiopathic and post-cardiac procedure pericarditis involves the use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs. 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%). With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least 6 months.

### Pericarditis as the main clinical manifestation of COVID-19 in adolescents [^112w9CP6]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection usually experience a milder illness, exhibit lower mortality rates, and may present different clinical entities compared to adults. Acute effusive pericarditis is a rare clinical manifestation in COVID-19 patients, particularly among those without pre-existing pulmonary disease or myocardial injury. We present two cases of acute pericarditis occurring without initial respiratory or other symptoms in adolescents with COVID-19.

### A randomized trial of colchicine for acute pericarditis [^116LN87g]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The ICAP study, published by Imazio M and colleagues in 2013 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*, investigated the effect of colchicine in patients with acute pericarditis. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 240 adult patients (95 female, 145 male) with acute pericarditis receiving conventional treatment. Key exclusion criteria were tuberculous, neoplastic, or purulent pericarditis; severe liver disease; skeletal myopathy; blood dyscrasia; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); hypersensitivity to colchicine or other contraindication to its use; prior treatment with colchicine; and a life expectancy of less than 18 months.

Patients were randomized to receive colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily for patients weighing > 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily for patients weighing ≤ 70 kg, n = 120) or placebo (identical placebo for 3 months, n = 120). The primary outcome was a significant decrease in the incidence of incessant or recurrent pericarditis (16.7% vs. 37.5%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.7) in the colchicine group compared to the placebo group.

Secondary outcomes included a significant decrease in symptom persistence at 72 hours (19.2% vs. 40%; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.76), a significant decrease in hospitalization rates (5% vs. 14.2%; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.65), and a significant increase in remission at 1 week (85% vs. 58.3%; RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.33). The study also assessed safety outcomes, which were not detailed in the summary provided.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^116E1iPu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

- **Inflammatory pericardial effusion**:

- **Infections**:

	- **Viral pericardial effusions**: Viruses are the leading causes of pericarditis cases with known etiologies, especially adenovirus and coxsackievirus, where about 60% of viral pericarditis can cause pericardial effusions. However, most effusions are small and can be treated conservatively or with colchicine plus NSAIDs. Corticosteroids and IL-1 blockers are other medical therapies. Hemorrhagic and large (hemodynamically significant) viral causes of pericardial effusion are uncommon. They are generally classified as idiopathic since a viral diagnosis requires histologic, immunologic, or serologic evaluation, which is not usually performed unless HIV or HCV infection is suspected.

	- **Coxsackievirus-induced pericardial effusion**: Coxsackieviruses, including types A and B, present a wide range of clinical symptoms in children and adults. In adults, symptoms range from simple fever or hand-foot-mouth syndrome to severe life-threatening encephalitis or pericarditis. Primarily, the presentation is controllable with malaise or fever, treatable with supportive care and NSAIDs plus colchicine. These infections are more frequently observed in men during winter and fall. Coxsackievirus B is cardiotropic and tends to involve the myocardium, leading to severe myocarditis or large pericardial effusions and tamponades due to myocarditis. Pericardial effusion caused by Coxsackie virus can also be observed in children, and there are case reports of similar occurrences.

Methods: We retrospectively collected data from five patients (three males) diagnosed with acute pericarditis, treated with Anakinra as the first line of treatment. Pericarditis was diagnosed in accordance with ESC guidelines. One patient with postoperative pericarditis was also included. We compared these patients to another group of five patients treated with NSAIDs/colchicine or glucocorticoids alone as the first line of treatment during one year of follow-up.

Results: We collected data on five patients experiencing their first episode of acute pericarditis who received anti-IL1 blocking agents as the first line of treatment in conjunction with NSAID. The median age at disease onset was 12.6 years (range 11–15 years). After initiating Anakinra, all patients exhibited a complete clinical response, reduction of pericardial effusion, and normalization of laboratory variables. They were discharged on average after 8.6 ± 4 days. During Anakinra treatment, no relapses were noted over one year of follow-up. All patients were able to discontinue anti-inflammatory drugs shortly after beginning Anakinra. We compared these to another group of five patients (median age 13.4 years, range 12–15 years) with acute pericarditis treated in their first episode with NSAID/colchicine or glucocorticoids. This group experienced relapses nearly twice or once before starting Anakinra during the one-year follow-up. Due to these flares, patients were hospitalized once or twice during the same year.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical due to the relative lack of randomized trials involving patients with these conditions. The first attempt to consolidate and organize knowledge resulted in the publication of the initial guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases. Nonetheless, several observational studies and some of the first randomized trials are advancing the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data suggest that management can be tailored to individual patients. Although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

### Colchicine for recurrent pericarditis (CORP): A randomized trial [^112Tzmpu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The CORP study investigated the role of colchicine in patients experiencing a first recurrence of pericarditis. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial included 120 patients (57 female, 63 male). Patients with recurrent pericarditis were included, while those with pericarditis caused by tuberculous, purulent, or neoplastic sources; known severe liver disease; known myopathy; blood dyscrasias; gastrointestinal disease; or known hypersensitivity to colchicine were excluded.

- **Interventions**: 60 patients received colchicine (1.0–2.0 mg on the first day followed by 0.5–1.0 mg/d for 6 months) in addition to conventional treatment, while 60 patients received a matching placebo daily for the same duration.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant reduction in the recurrence rate at 18 months was observed (24% vs. 55%; RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a notable decrease in the persistence of symptoms at 72 hours (23% vs. 53%; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.63) and a significant increase in remission at 1 week (82% vs. 48%; RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.72). The time to recurrence was significantly prolonged (2.5 vs. 1; MD 1.5, 90% CI 0 to 19.1).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in side effects was found between the groups, with 7% experiencing side effects in both the colchicine and placebo groups (p > 0.99).

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^111KZUgN]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, patients with idiopathic pericarditis were more likely to fail treatments and experience recurrences compared to those with postcardiac injury pericarditis. Notably, idiopathic pericarditis was more frequently diagnosed in black patients, aligning with findings by Awan et al. However, the diagnosis of idiopathic pericarditis was less common in this cohort than in previous European studies conducted several years ago. This difference may be attributed to a recent increase in cardiac procedures such as atrial fibrillation ablation, pacemaker implantation, coronary artery bypass surgery, and transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

- **Postcardiac injury pericarditis**: Although it can lead to recurrences, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive evolution, it has a lower incidence compared to idiopathic pericarditis. The etiopathogenesis is not fully understood but is likely immune-mediated due to injuries from procedures. Initial pericardial injury secondary to ischemia (as in post-myocardial infarction pericarditis) or physical/chemical trauma (following cardiac procedures) may trigger exaggerated inflammatory responses in predisposed individuals.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pericarditis, the 2021 guidelines by ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR recommend obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for pericardial effusion in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain. Consider obtaining a TTE to detect pericardial abnormalities in intermediate-high-risk patients with stable chest pain who have Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure (HF), or a heart murmur with an unclear diagnosis.

### Prevention of recurrent pericarditis with colchicine in 2012 [^111GRRaq]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). High credibility.

The most troublesome complication of acute pericarditis is recurrent pericardial inflammation, which occurs in 15%-32% of cases. The optimal method for prevention has not been fully established; accepted modalities include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and pericardiectomy. Over recent years, objective clinical evidence has matured and clearly indicates the important role and beneficial clinical effect of colchicine therapy in preventing recurrent pericarditis caused by various etiologies. Patients treated with colchicine consistently display significantly fewer recurrences and longer symptom-free periods. Even when attacks occur, they are weaker and shorter in nature.

Notably, pretreatment with corticosteroids substantially attenuates the efficacy of colchicine, causing significantly more recurrences and longer therapy periods. The safety profile of colchicine seems superior to other drugs, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Colchicine is a safe and effective modality for the treatment and prevention of recurrent pericarditis, especially as an adjunct to other modalities, because it provides a sustained benefit, superior to all other modalities.

European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pericarditis, specifically with respect to corticosteroids, the 2015 EACTS/ESC guidelines recommend considering administering low-dose corticosteroids in patients with acute pericarditis if aspirin/NSAID and colchicine fail or are contraindicated. This recommendation also applies when there is a specific indication for corticosteroids, such as in corticosteroid-responsive autoimmune diseases, provided that infectious causes have been excluded.

### US database study of clinical burden and unmet need in recurrent pericarditis [^117Qk8L7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis is often associated with severe symptoms, including sharp, pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. While pericarditis epidemiology data are limited in the United States, about 5% of patients presenting in emergency departments with chest pain are ultimately identified as having an acute pericarditis episode. Acute pericarditis is diagnosed based on having at least two of the following: chest pain, pericardial friction rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. The etiology of pericarditis varies, with causes including infection, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post-cardiac injury syndromes. In developing countries, tuberculosis is often a cause; however, up to 90% of cases in developed countries are considered "idiopathic", presumed to be viral or post-viral. Although the term "idiopathic" is commonly used in these presumed post-viral cases without a clear underlying cause, there is a growing body of evidence that innate immune system-mediated autoinflammation, specifically interleukin-1 signaling, plays an important role in various inflammatory disorders, including recurrent pericarditis (RP) cases classified as "idiopathic".

For most patients, pericarditis manifests as a single episode that lasts a few days to several weeks, with symptoms resolved through conventional treatments such as NSAIDs, with or without colchicine. However, some patients do not experience long-term symptom resolution after an acute pericarditis episode. Up to 30% of patients experience recurrent pericarditis within 18 months.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^113ScEGS]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

The higher observed incidence of treatment failure or pericarditis recurrence in patients with idiopathic forms may rely on differences in underlying pathogenesis or in the time to anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy. A shorter time to treatment is expected for postcardiac injury syndromes, possibly attributable to scheduled follow-ups that allow for early identification and subsequently early modulation of the inflammatory burden. In contrast, patients with idiopathic pericarditis develop the symptoms in the outpatient setting without ready access to clinicians and are therefore expected to have an extended time-to-diagnosis and anti-inflammatory treatment. Although both idiopathic and postcardiac injury pericarditis can share a similar common inflammatory response, the molecular mechanisms initiating this response may not be the same, which highlights the need for investigations of tailored therapies.

Patients with elevated troponin I levels were found to have a lower risk for the development of recurrences and the adverse composite outcome. The detection of increased troponin I levels in patients with pericarditis is an expression of the concomitant involvement of the subepicardial myocardium in the inflammatory process, as well as ECG abnormalities. In contrast to coronary artery disease, the elevation in troponin levels in the serum is not a negative prognostic marker in patients with pericarditis. Imazio and colleagues had previously described that recurrences were more frequent in cases with "isolated" pericarditis with normal troponin I levels.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder with multiple causes and can present in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have enhanced the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid, allowing for comprehensive characterization of its causes. Despite these advances, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic. Radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become significant causes as well.

Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. The integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge, but this is aided by tissue Doppler and color M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis, providing symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might serve as a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### Myopericardial complications following COVID-19 disease and vaccination: A clinical consensus statement of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases [^112gK5ws]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

The aim of the present clinical consensus statement by the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases is to review the knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, therapy, and outcomes of myocardial and pericardial complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vaccination, in order to improve awareness and clinical confidence in managing patients with these complications. The risk of myopericardial complications is especially higher within one month of COVID-19 disease and vaccination. Forms related to the disease are generally more common and severe than those related to vaccination. Even though vaccination against COVID-19 increases the risk of myocarditis, this risk is lower in vaccinated individuals compared to non-vaccinated individuals with COVID-19, supporting vaccine use. Overall, COVID-19 related complications, especially myocarditis, are relatively rare.
