## Question

Diagnostic criteria for pericardial

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the diagnostic criteria for pericardial diseases, prioritizing acute pericarditis and also addressing constrictive pericarditis and pericardial effusion evaluation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how acute pericarditis is clinically diagnosed and what the minimum criteria are. Then, I should verify the recommended initial evaluation and how to distinguish pericarditis from acute myocardial infarction. Next, I will review risk stratification triggers for admission. After that, I need to check the hemodynamic and imaging criteria for constrictive pericarditis. Then, I will examine the diagnostic approach to pericardial effusion and tamponade and revisit the role and pitfalls of pericardial fluid analysis. Finally, I should consider special populations such as tuberculosis and COVID-19 and synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the core diagnostic paradigm for acute pericarditis, because if I misstate this, everything downstream tumbles. Diagnosis is clinical and requires at least two of four cardinal features: typical pleuritic chest pain that eases when sitting forward, a pericardial friction rub, new widespread ST-segment elevation and/or PR-segment depression on ECG, or a new or worsening pericardial effusion on imaging, with supportive evidence from inflammatory markers and imaging as needed, and this framework traces directly to the 2015 ESC guidelines and aligned summaries, so I can be confident in using it as the anchor [^114TeswA] [^112jHi6F] [^114kFUzm].

> I should double-check the recommended initial evaluation so I do not omit essential tests. The ESC advises a systematic workup in all suspected cases: history and exam with careful rub auscultation, 12-lead ECG, transthoracic echocardiography, chest radiography, inflammatory markers such as CRP and/or ESR with a WBC differential, troponin and CK to screen for myopericarditis, and baseline renal and hepatic function to inform therapy; this is echoed by contemporary primary care and chest pain guidelines recommending prompt TTE in suspected pericardial involvement, so I will keep TTE early in the pathway rather than as a late confirmatory test [^112nM7dV] [^115PDuUL] [^1152ABKh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ECGs alone; I need to carefully distinguish pericarditis from STEMI because management diverges. Typical pericarditis has diffuse, concave ST elevations with PR depression and no reciprocal ST depression, whereas STEMI often shows reciprocal changes and, importantly, QRS prolongation with QT shortening in leads with maximal ST elevation, a pattern not seen in pericarditis; integrating these QRS and QT observations can reduce misclassification when the picture is muddy [^114kFUzm] [^116AnMjH].

> Next, I should review risk stratification, because missing high-risk features leads to under-triage. The ESC identifies features warranting hospitalization or close monitoring, including fever above 38°C, subacute presentation over weeks, a large effusion or evidence of tamponade, failure of NSAID therapy, immunosuppression, trauma, oral anticoagulation, elevated inflammatory markers, and evidence of myopericarditis; formal tools such as the Torino Pericarditis Score operationalize these risks to predict complicated courses, so I will flag any of these features as an admission trigger [^112nM7dV] [^113db1AL] [^1151KQC1].

> Let me think about myocardial involvement and recurrent disease where basic tests may be equivocal. Cardiac MRI can demonstrate pericardial edema on T2-weighted sequences and late gadolinium enhancement of the pericardium, supporting active inflammation in recurrent pericarditis, while also helping to adjudicate concomitant myocarditis via Lake Louise criteria; when initial data are indeterminate or recurrences complicate the course, CMR meaningfully refines diagnosis and risk [^111X2P9Z] [^116n2x3W].

> I will now examine constrictive pericarditis, because the diagnostic logic differs from acute pericarditis and depends on physiology. The hallmark is an inelastic pericardium producing dissociation between intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures and exaggerated ventricular interdependence with respiratory variation in ventricular filling; echocardiography with tissue Doppler can identify septal bounce and respiratory inflow variation, CT or MRI can demonstrate pericardial thickening or calcification, and invasive catheterization remains the hemodynamic gold standard when noninvasive data are discordant or obscured by comorbidities, recognizing that inflammatory constriction may be reversible with anti-inflammatory therapy in select cases [^111VPde1] [^116nQrWd].

> But wait, what if the patient had prior radiation or surgery and imaging is confusing; I should confirm multimodality nuances. Post-radiation disease can present with both constriction and restrictive cardiomyopathy, and in ambiguous cases a combined CT for calcification mapping and CMR for pericardial versus myocardial pathology, along with selective hemodynamics, may be needed to reach a confident diagnosis and to plan pericardiectomy when indicated [^1171nw5g].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach to pericardial effusion and tamponade, because recognizing hemodynamic compromise is time critical. TTE is the primary test to confirm effusion and assess hemodynamic impact, and even focused bedside echocardiography is highly accurate for effusion detection, but I need to remember that classic tamponade signs and IVC plethora are not uniformly present, particularly in low-pressure tamponade, so integrating Doppler respiratory variation, chamber collapse, and clinical context avoids both under- and over-calling tamponade [^113mFTh1] [^115gBk8W] [^112yLtvs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought pericardial fluid Light's criteria could reliably separate exudates with about 98% sensitivity, and that is indeed what older studies suggested; however, let me reconsider in light of newer data showing that even normal pericardial fluid often appears "exudative", meaning Light's criteria, derived for pleural fluid, can misclassify pericardial samples, and overall biochemical parameters have poor discriminative value for specific etiologies, so I should avoid over-relying on these indices and instead prioritize cytology, microbiology, and targeted testing based on pretest probability [^116wm5jP] [^113y4Gbz] [^111VWjZf].

> I need to ensure I cover malignancy and the diagnostic yield of invasive strategies so expectations are realistic. Cytology has variable sensitivity, yet remains a useful tool when malignancy is suspected, and while pericardial windows provide therapeutic benefit for recurrent or loculated effusions, their added diagnostic yield is modest, so procedure choice should be driven by hemodynamics, recurrence, and suspected etiology rather than an expectation of broad diagnostic clarification [^113cpZjm] [^116yuHpm].

> Let me verify special etiologies where targeted diagnostics change management. In high-burden settings or compatible clinical contexts, tuberculous pericarditis warrants directed testing such as ADA, culture, and molecular assays including Xpert MTB/RIF on pericardial fluid or tissue, recognizing composite reference standards are often needed and that pericardiocentesis with adequate sample volume enhances diagnostic yield [^114Tnh8C] [^116h3cvS].

> I should double-check contemporary data on COVID-19, because pericardial findings are common but often nonspecific. Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, pericardial effusion occurs in roughly 14% to 15%, while true acute pericarditis is uncommon, and limited echocardiographic protocols focusing on LVEF, TAPSE, and presence of effusion can assist in risk stratification without full Doppler assessment when resources are constrained [^1111tTRe] [^111WQ7i8] [^111EJotH].

> Hold on, I should also verify pediatric considerations so I do not over-label cases as idiopathic. Follow-up studies suggest that a substantial minority of children initially labeled as having idiopathic pericardial effusions are later found to have autoimmune, neoplastic, infectious, or renal causes, implying that a standardized, stepwise etiologic workup and longitudinal reassessment are crucial in pediatric practice [^111sEeob].

> Before I synthesize, one quick clinical safety check comes to mind. In settings of constriction or tamponade where cardiac output depends on venous return, intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated because it can precipitate hemodynamic collapse, so I should always pause and verify the hemodynamic substrate before initiating vasodilators in suspected pericardial disease [^112KBNcR].

> Bringing this together, my diagnostic algorithm is as follows: screen for acute pericarditis using the two-of-four cardinal criteria; obtain ECG, TTE, chest radiograph, inflammatory markers, and troponin with baseline metabolic panels; distinguish from STEMI using ECG patterns and QRS–QT behavior; risk-stratify for admission using ESC high-risk features or the Torino score; evaluate for complications and myocarditis with TTE and CMR when indicated; if constriction is suspected, demonstrate ventricular interdependence and pericardial noncompliance with echo, CT or MRI, and reserve catheterization for unresolved cases; for effusions, confirm on TTE, assess tamponade physiology with an integrative approach mindful of low-pressure states, and tailor etiologic testing with cytology, microbiology, and disease-specific assays rather than relying on pleural-based biochemical cutoffs, adjusting the workup for TB prevalence, COVID-19 context, and pediatric considerations [^114TeswA] [^112nM7dV] [^116AnMjH] [^1151KQC1] [^116nQrWd] [^113mFTh1] [^113y4Gbz] [^114Tnh8C] [^1111tTRe] [^111sEeob].

The diagnosis of acute pericarditis is clinical, requiring **at least two of four criteria** [^114TeswA] [^114kFUzm]: (1) sharp, pleuritic chest pain relieved by sitting forward; (2) pericardial friction rub; (3) new diffuse ST elevation or PR depression on ECG; (4) new or worsening pericardial effusion on imaging [^112jHi6F]. Supportive findings include elevated **CRP/ESR** and **pericardial inflammation on CMR** [^112nM7dV] [^111X2P9Z]. For constrictive pericarditis, the diagnosis relies on imaging (echocardiography/CT/CMR) showing pericardial thickening/calcification, septal bounce, and ventricular interdependence [^111VPde1], with invasive hemodynamics confirming equalized diastolic pressures and discordant RV/LV systolic pressures [^116nQrWd] [^11568Pev]. Pericardial effusion is diagnosed by echocardiography [^115CTbH4] [^115ezntf], and **pericardiocentesis is indicated** for tamponade or suspected infection/malignancy [^115p9D9k].

### Constrictive pericarditis — a curable diastolic heart failure [^111VPde1]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis can result from a stiff pericardium that prevents satisfactory diastolic filling. The distinction between constrictive pericarditis and other causes of heart failure, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, is important because pericardiectomy can cure constrictive pericarditis. Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is based on characteristic hemodynamic and anatomical features determined using echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, cardiac MRI, and CT.

The Mayo Clinic echocardiography and cardiac catheterization hemodynamic diagnostic criteria for constrictive pericarditis are based on the unique features of ventricular interdependence and the dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures seen when the pericardium is constricted. A complete pericardiectomy can restore satisfactory diastolic filling by removing the constrictive pericardium in patients with constrictive pericarditis. However, if inflammation of the pericardium is the predominant constrictive mechanism, anti-inflammatory therapy might alleviate this transient condition without a need for surgery.

Early diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is, therefore, of paramount clinical importance. An improved understanding of how constrictive pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this diastolic heart failure. In this review, we discuss the etiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, with a specific emphasis on how to differentiate this disease from conditions with similar clinical presentations.

European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of acute pericarditis, specifically in relation to diagnostic criteria, the EACTS/ESC 2015 guidelines recommend making a clinical diagnosis of acute pericarditis in patients who present with two or more of the following four suggestive clinical criteria: chest pain, pericardial rub, ECG changes, and pericardial effusion.

### Management of pericardial effusion [^115p9D9k]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion is a common finding in clinical practice, either as an incidental finding or as a manifestation of a systemic or cardiac disease. The spectrum of pericardial effusions ranges from mild asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. The etiology is varied, including infectious, neoplastic, autoimmune, metabolic, and drug-related causes, with tuberculosis being the leading cause of pericardial effusions in developing countries and worldwide. Moreover, HIV infection may play an important role in promoting pericardial effusions in this setting.

Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (i.e. pericarditis), associated medical conditions, and the etiology when possible. Pericardiocentesis is mandatory for cardiac tamponade and when a bacterial or neoplastic etiology is suspected. Pericardial biopsy is generally reserved for cases with recurrent cardiac tamponade or persistence without a defined etiology, especially when a bacterial or neoplastic origin is suspected and cannot be assessed by other conventional and less invasive means.

An isolated effusion may not require specific treatment if the patient is asymptomatic, although large effusions risk progressing to cardiac tamponade in up to one-third of cases. While pericardiocentesis alone may be curative for large effusions, recurrences are common. Therefore, pericardiectomy or less invasive options, such as a pericardial window, should be considered for recurrent cardiac tamponade or symptomatic pericardial effusion (either circumferential or loculated).

### Bedside echocardiography by emergency physicians [^113mFTh1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Timely diagnosis of a pericardial effusion is often critical in the emergency medicine setting, and echocardiography provides the only reliable method of diagnosis at the bedside. This study attempts to determine the accuracy of bedside echocardiography as performed by emergency physicians to detect pericardial effusions in a variety of high-risk populations.

- **Methods**: Emergency patients presenting with high-risk criteria for the diagnosis of pericardial effusion underwent emergency bedside 2-dimensional echocardiography by emergency physicians trained in ultrasonography. The presence or absence of a pericardial effusion was determined, and all images were captured on video or as thermal images. All emergency echocardiograms were subsequently reviewed by the Department of Cardiology for the presence of a pericardial effusion.

- **Results**: During the study period, a total of 515 high-risk patients were enrolled. Of these, 103 patients were ultimately deemed to have a pericardial effusion according to the comparative standard. Emergency physicians detected pericardial effusion with a sensitivity of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI] 90.4% to 98.9%), specificity of 98% (95% CI 95.8% to 99.1%), and overall accuracy of 97.5% (95% CI 95.7% to 98.7%).

- **Conclusion**: Echocardiography performed by emergency physicians is reliable in evaluating for pericardial effusions. This bedside diagnostic tool may be used to examine specific patients at high risk. Emergency departments incorporating bedside ultrasonography should teach focused echocardiography to evaluate the pericardial effusion risk in high-risk patients.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute pericarditis" serves as a clinical tool for identifying patients with this condition. The primary purpose of these criteria is to facilitate accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes. The target patient population includes individuals presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute pericarditis.

- **Primary components**: The primary components of these diagnostic criteria include characteristic symptoms of chest pain, pericardial friction rub, typical electrocardiogram changes, and pericardial effusion identified on diagnostic imaging. The chest pain associated with acute pericarditis is typically sharp and pleuritic, and it improves when the patient sits up and leans forward. A pericardial friction rub is a superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border. Typical electrocardiogram changes include new diffuse ST segment elevation or PR depression in the acute phase. Pericardial effusion can be identified through diagnostic imaging techniques such as echocardiogram or computed tomography.

- **Diagnosis likelihood**: The diagnosis of acute pericarditis is likely if any two of these criteria are met. Specifically, the combinations can be (A and B), (A and C), (A and D), (B and C), (B and D), or (C and D). If these combinations are not met, the diagnosis of acute pericarditis is considered unlikely. This approach allows for flexibility in diagnosis, accommodating the variability in clinical presentations.

### Imaging of the acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of radiation therapy [^11568Pev]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Given that both constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy are seen post-radiotherapy with similar presentations, differentiating between these can be diagnostically challenging. Echocardiographic criteria can help distinguish between the two conditions, although a multimodality approach is often required for both diagnosis and management planning (Figure 4). Despite imaging advances, cases may remain unclear due to coexistent disease clouding key echocardiographic parameters or early disease not having caused significant anatomic changes. In such cases, invasive hemodynamic assessment may be required.

Assessment for late-onset constrictive pericarditis should be approached like acute pericarditis, but pericardial calcification is also common. Hence, cardiac CT offers added value. CMR can detect both the structural and functional abnormalities seen in constrictive pericarditis while identifying features more consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy. LGE and T2-weighted imaging are less commonly abnormal in chronic constrictive pericarditis, where calcification and chronic fibrosis, rather than active inflammation, are more prominent pathological processes. Surgical planning should assess the extent and location of pericardial calcification from CT images to plan the regions of the pericardium to be stripped and to assess for mediastinal fibrosis or aortic calcification, which may complicate already high-risk pericardial surgery.

### Management of acute and recurrent pericarditis: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111PpzHp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Pericarditis refers to the inflammation of the pericardial layers resulting from a variety of stimuli that trigger a stereotyped immune response. It is characterized by chest pain, often associated with peculiar electrocardiographic changes and, at times, accompanied by pericardial effusion. Acute pericarditis is generally self-limited and not life-threatening; yet, it may cause significant short-term disability, be complicated by either a large pericardial effusion or tamponade, and carry a significant risk of recurrence.

The mainstay of pericarditis treatment is represented by anti-inflammatory drugs. However, anti-inflammatory treatments vary in both effectiveness and side-effect profile. The objective of this review is to summarize the up-to-date management of acute and recurrent pericarditis.

### Constrictive pericarditis: A practical clinical approach [^11756sP2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) represents a form of severe diastolic heart failure (HF), secondary to a noncompliant pericardium. The true prevalence of CP is unknown, but it is observed in 0.2–0.4% of patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or have had pericardial trauma or inflammation due to a variety of etiologies. Despite its poor prognosis if untreated, CP is a potentially curable disease, and surgical pericardiectomy can now be performed at low perioperative mortality in tertiary centers with surgical expertise in pericardial diseases.

Cardiologists should have a high index of suspicion for CP in patients presenting with predominant right-sided HF, particularly when a history of cardiac surgery, pericarditis, or pericardial effusion is present. Transthoracic two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography is usually the first diagnostic tool in the evaluation of HF and can reliably identify CP in most patients by characteristic real-time motion of the heart and hemodynamic features.

Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging provide incremental data for the diagnosis and management of CP and are especially helpful when clinical or echocardiographic findings are inconclusive. Cardiac catheterization has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of CP, but may not be necessary if non-invasive tests demonstrate diagnostic features of CP; it should then be reserved for selected cases or for assessment of concomitant coronary disease.

Although most patients with CP require pericardiectomy, anti-inflammatory therapy may be curative in patients presenting with CP.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease: A scientific statement for health professionals from the American Heart Association [^116tFiqs]. Circulation (2017). High credibility.

The American Heart Association (AHA) diagnostic criteria for classic Kawasaki disease is a clinical calculator used to diagnose Kawasaki disease, a condition that primarily affects children and involves inflammation of the blood vessels. This scoring system is specifically applicable to pediatric patients, typically under the age of 5, who present with prolonged fever and other clinical signs suggestive of the disease.

The AHA criteria for Kawasaki disease include five main clinical features: fever lasting 5 or more days, bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis, changes in the lips and oral cavity, changes in the extremities, and polymorphous exanthem. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy is also considered.

The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, which can be challenging due to its nonspecific symptoms and the lack of a definitive diagnostic test. Early diagnosis is crucial as the disease can lead to serious complications, such as coronary artery aneurysms, if not treated promptly.

Exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator include patients who do not meet the fever duration requirement or those who have an alternative diagnosis that better explains the clinical presentation. Additionally, it should be noted that a certain percentage of patients may have "incomplete" or "atypical" Kawasaki disease.

### Diagnostic accuracy of quantitative PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) for tuberculous pericarditis compared to adenosine deaminase and unstimulated interferon-γ in a high burden setting: a prospective study [^114Tnh8C]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

uIFNγ levels were measured in duplicate using supernatant attained from 3 to 20 mL of thawed and centrifuged (3,000 g for 15 minutes) PF using the InterGam Ultrasensitive Rapid Immuno-suspension Assay (IRISA; Antrum Biotech, Cape Town, South Africa; limit of detection = 5 to 10 pg/ml) following the manufacturer's instructions and without antigen stimulation.

- **Diagnostic classification for analysis**: All participants who were included had a large pericardial effusion on echocardiography. Participants were categorized into the following diagnostic groups based on a combination of pericardial and non-pericardial sample culture results, histopathology of pericardial biopsy samples, basic PF characteristics, and the commencement of TB treatment as follows:
	- **(i) Definite-TB**: At least one M. tb sample positive by liquid culture (either pericardial or non-pericardial) and/or granulomatous inflammation on pericardial tissue histology (that is, composite reference standard).
	- **(ii) Probable-TB**: Not meeting the criteria for definite-TB, but based on clinical suspicion (symptoms, imaging, and preliminary fluid analysis) commenced empirically on TB treatment in the absence of an alternative diagnosis.
	- **(iii) Non-TB**: No microbiological evidence of M. tb and an alternative diagnosis is available.

- **Modelling clinical predictors using multiple imputation**: A univariable analysis was used to determine basic clinical predictors of definite TBP. Thereafter, a set of multivariable clinical predictors was generated using logistic regression modelling. Multiple imputation by chained equa

### Pericardial involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Prevalence, associates, and clinical implications [^1111tTRe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In a large prospective cohort of consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 infection encompassing the entire spectrum of disease severity, pericardial effusion is common, but rarely attributable to acute pericarditis or myocarditis. Nevertheless, it is associated with myocardial dysfunction and excess mortality. To achieve significant clinical value for risk stratification, a limited echocardiographic examination, including LVEF, TAPSE, and evaluation for the presence of pericardial effusion, is sufficient.

### Shining a new light on pericardial fluid [^113y4Gbz]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

The authors found that physiological pericardial fluid is rich in protein, albumin, LDH, and nucleated cells with low levels of glucose and cholesterol. They derived normal reference values for total protein (1.7–4.6 g/dL), pericardial fluid/serum protein ratio (0.29–0.83), LDH (141–2613 U/L), pericardial fluid/serum LDH ratio (0.40–2.99), albumin (1.19–3.06 g/dL), and pericardium to serum albumin gradient (0.18–2.37 g/dL). Normal reference intervals were also determined by optical microscopy for nucleated cells (278–5608 × 10⁶ cells/L), mesothelial cells (40–3790 × 10⁶ cells/L), leucocytes (19–2210 × 10⁶ cells/L), and lymphocytes (19–1634 × 10⁶ cells/L). The study's modest sample size likely contributes to wide reference intervals. However, the results imply that normal physiological pericardial fluid would meet traditional criteria for an exudate. The authors hypothesize that the unique composition of pericardial fluid may be due to increased pericardial vasculature permeability, pericardial mechanical stress due to cardiac contractility, or the abundant cell types found within the pericardial space.

The findings of the study highlight the potential for diagnostic errors when interpretive tools are used outside their validated purpose. Light's criteria were derived from fluid samples from a different physiological space with a composition distinct from pericardial fluid. Based on the study, normal physiological samples would be routinely misclassified as exudates due to the rich cellularity and biochemical composition of pericardial fluid.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® routine chest imaging [^116w45QG]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Routine chest imaging has been used to identify unknown or subclinical cardiothoracic abnormalities in the absence of symptoms. Various imaging modalities have been suggested for routine chest imaging. We review the evidence for, or against the use of routine chest imaging in different clinical scenarios.

This document aims to determine guidelines for the use of routine chest imaging as initial imaging for hospital admission, initial imaging prior to noncardiothoracic surgery, and surveillance imaging for chronic cardiopulmonary disease. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Diagnostic value of the biochemical composition of pericardial effusions in patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^111VWjZf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In contrast to pleural effusion or ascites, there is limited data regarding the chemical and cell-count parameters of pericardial effusions (PEs) to aid diagnosis. In this study, all patients who underwent pericardiocentesis during a 9-year period (1995 to 2004) at a tertiary hospital and who had available fluid laboratory results were retrospectively identified. Causes of PE were diagnosed using predetermined criteria.

- **Methods**: The results of pericardial fluid biochemical and hematologic tests were compared with blood test results and analyzed to identify cut-off points that could distinguish among the various causes or various groups of causes.

- **Results**: Of 173 patients who underwent pericardiocentesis during the study period, 120 had available fluid laboratory results, forming the study population. The most common causes of PE were neoplastic, idiopathic, and effusion related to acute pericarditis, accounting for 42, 22, and 17 of 120 patients, respectively. Most fluids (118 of 120) would have been classified as exudates using Light's pleural effusion criteria. Moreover, in all parameters examined, there was considerable overlap of test results among the different pericardial disorders. Thus, no biochemical or cell-count parameter was found to be useful with reasonable accuracy for differentiating among the individual causes or among various groups of pericardial disorders.

In conclusion, most PEs are exudates. The analysis of pericardial fluid biochemical and cell-count composition is generally not helpful for the diagnosis of most PEs.

### Clinical characteristics, evaluation and outcomes of chylopericardium: A systematic review [^1118N4h4]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

A comprehensive search was conducted on 2 December 2020 for published articles on chylous pericardial effusion using the following databases: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, CINAHL from EBSCOhost, Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science's BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science. The search was updated on 27 May 2021.

Indexing terms and keywords for both chyle and pericardial effusion or chylopericardium were combined without any language filters. All publication types were considered, and all databases were searched for the concepts. Identified articles were reviewed for our selection strategy. Our inclusion criteria included case reports, and we also searched for potential observational studies, clinical trials, and registry reports seeking information on CPE. Letters to the editors, animal/paediatric studies, and publications in languages other than English were excluded.

- **Systematic review design**: The review was based on the PICO (patient, intervention, control, and outcome) framework. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) with CPE were the study population. Medical ± surgical therapy constituted the intervention, and outcomes considered were mortality during index hospitalisation, recurrence of CPE, reinterventions (pericardiocentesis, pericardial window, or pericardiectomy), rehospitalisation, and mortality after discharge. Due to a lack of observational studies, no comparison group was included in the analysis. Patient and public involvement is not applicable to this study.

### Diagnostic accuracy of quantitative PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF) for tuberculous pericarditis compared to adenosine deaminase and unstimulated interferon-γ in a high burden setting: a prospective study [^116h3cvS]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

- **Study population**: Between October 2009 and September 2012, consecutive patients with suspected TBP referred to Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town for enrollment in the Investigation of Management of Pericarditis in Africa (IMPI Africa) registry were screened for inclusion in this diagnostic study. Inclusion criteria were the presence of a large pericardial effusion amenable to safe pericardiocentesis (greater than 10 mm echo-free space around the heart in diastole), age 18 years or older, and the provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, anti-TB treatment initiation > 1 week prior to pericardiocentesis, and refusal or inability to sign consent. Informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to enrollment in the registry, and the study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki, as reflected in a priori approval by the human research ethics committee of the University of Cape Town (HREC REF402/2005).

- **Diagnostic sample collection and handling**: A minimum of 60 mL of pericardial fluid (PF) was collected for diagnostic testing by means of percutaneous pericardiocentesis. PF was sent to the NHLS for measurement of ADA and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, differential cell counts, and cytology, as well as routine TB diagnosis consisting of concentrated fluorescence smear microscopy and mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) liquid culture (MGIT 960, BD Diagnostics, Hunt Valley, MD, USA). Drug susceptibility testing was performed on positive culture isolates.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical due to the relative lack of randomized trials involving patients with these conditions. The publication of the first guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases marked an initial effort to consolidate and organize knowledge. Nevertheless, a number of observational studies and the first randomized trials are steering the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data indicate that management can be tailored to the individual patient. Although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

### Etiology and long-term outcome of patients undergoing pericardiocentesis [^113cpZjm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

In the present patient cohort, the underlying diagnosis of effusion was established based on pericardial fluid characteristics obtained by pericardiocentesis, using routine tests including cytology, microbiology, serology, and biochemistry, as per clinical indication. The sensitivity of pericardial fluid cytology ranges from 66.7% to 92%. This value depends heavily on the gold standard used per study (e.g. follow-up, pericardial biopsy, postmortem autopsy) but nevertheless is considered a valid and useful diagnostic tool. Variation also exists between series on what should be classified as a definite malignant effusion; some authors consider cytology-negative fluid as constituting a malignant effusion if the patient has a known malignancy. In contrast with these analyses, we chose to limit malignant effusion to those with a proven positive cytology, as determined by a pathologist, and to classify cytology-negative patients as idiopathic in the absence of another plausible cause, even when they had an underlying cancer.

For this reason, and despite the context of a large tertiary care cohort, our number of malignant effusions is slightly lower than in other reports. Consequently, about 1 in 4 patients ultimately was categorized as having no definite underlying cause of effusion (i.e. the idiopathic group); however, almost half had a known malignancy and could not be distinguished from cytology-positive patients in terms of long-term outcome. If we take this into account, our data are consistent with previous studies in the sense that neoplasia was the most common.

### Bad company? The pericardium microbiome in people investigated for tuberculous pericarditis in an HIV-prevalent setting [^114dbDF8]. Microbes and Infection (2024). Low credibility.

- **Patient classification**: We designated people as definite tuberculous pericarditis (dTB), probable tuberculous pericarditis (pTB), or non-tuberculous pericarditis (nTB) per Table S1. People were classified as dTBs if they were positive for acid-fast bacilli by Ziehl-Neelsen smear microscopy and/or had at least one MTB-positive specimen by Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) 960 liquid culture (BD Diagnostics, USA), Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert; Cepheid, USA) and/or Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra; Cepheid, USA). pTBs did not meet dTB criteria, had no alternative diagnosis, and were empirically prescribed TB therapy. nTBs had no microbiological evidence of TB and were not placed on treatment.

- **Laboratory procedures**: The PureLink Microbiome DNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen, USA) was used for pericardial fluid, skin swabs, and, for efficiency, 1 in 5 background samples. The 16S rRNA gene V4 hypervariable region (150 bp read length, paired-end) was amplified and underwent Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Further detail is in the Supplementary Material. CRP was measured in bio-banked serum using the Cobas High-Sensitivity Immunoturbidimetric Assay (Roche Diagnostics Limited, Burgess Hill, UK) per the manufacturer's instructions.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^117QJnVK]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

The primary goal was to identify predictors of the composite adverse outcome (tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, failure of treatment, clinical recurrences, or death) in a large cohort of patients with acute pericarditis. Secondary aims were to provide an overview of the pericarditis causes and to compare clinical and laboratory profiles among subgroups (e.g. with or without adverse outcomes).

Patients were identified as having an acute event if they met the 2015 ESC guideline criteria for acute pericarditis. A recurrent episode requires new signs and symptoms of pericardial inflammation following a symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks. Subacute pericarditis was defined as an event developing in an interval from 6 weeks to 3 months. Constrictive pericarditis was defined by the development of hemodynamic diastolic impairment due to chronic inflammation or thickening of the pericardium, diagnosed by echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, or surgical biopsy. Tamponade was identified as a pericardial effusion resulting in hemodynamic compromise, diagnosed with echocardiographic criteria.

Failure of treatment was considered as the persistence of symptoms regardless of anti-inflammatory treatment for more than 4–6 weeks. A severe pericardial effusion during an echocardiogram was defined as the presence of an echo-free space greater than 20 mm, according to the classification of Imazio et al. and Weitzman et al. Heart failure at presentation was defined by signs and symptoms of volume overload, or the need to initiate treatment with a loop diuretic.

### Acute pericarditis [^112PntzD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis is an acute inflammatory disease of the pericardium, which may occur in many different disease states, both infectious and non-infectious. The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath, electrocardiographic changes like ST elevation, physical examination findings such as pericardial friction rub, and the elevation of cardiac biomarkers. It may occur in isolation or be associated with an underlying inflammatory disorder. In routine clinical practice, acute pericarditis can be associated with myocarditis due to their overlapping etiologies.

### Pericarditis [^112nxU4w]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that has multiple causes and presents in various primary-care and secondary-care settings. New diagnostic techniques have improved the sampling and analysis of pericardial fluid and allow comprehensive characterization of its cause. Despite these advances, pericarditis is most commonly idiopathic. However, radiation therapy, cardiac surgery, and percutaneous procedures have become important causes.

Pericarditis is frequently self-limiting, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents remain the first-line treatment for uncomplicated cases. The integrated use of new imaging methods facilitates the accurate detection and management of complications such as pericardial effusion or constriction. Differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy remains a clinical challenge but is facilitated by tissue Doppler and color M-mode echocardiography. Most pericardial effusions can be safely managed with an echo-guided percutaneous approach. Pericardiectomy remains the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and provides symptomatic relief in most cases. In the future, the pericardial space might become a conduit for treatments directed at the pericardium and myocardium.

### Emerging therapies for recurrent pericarditis: Interleukin-1 inhibitors [^114WvvUk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The clinical application of IL-1 inhibitors, specifically rilonacept and anakinra, has been demonstrated only in patients with recurrent pericarditis (RP) who have at least two recurrences. These recurrences must be secondary to non-prohibited conditions for IL-1 inhibitor use, such as active infection, tuberculosis, active malignancy, or immunocompromised states. The patients should have failed treatment with conventional therapies, including colchicine (termed "colchicine-resistant") and corticosteroids. Additionally, they must show evidence of systemic inflammation, such as fever, elevated CRP levels (≥ 1 mg/dL), and/or delayed gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, they may experience recurrences while attempting to withdraw from corticosteroids, describing them as corticosteroid-dependent.

The European Society of Cardiology 2015 guidelines recommend anakinra as a third-line therapy for patients intolerant or non-responsive to corticosteroids. Most recently, rilonacept received approval from the FDA in March 2021 for use in RP in adults and children over 12 years. However, there are currently no formal recommendations from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. No data are available regarding the role of IL-1 inhibitors in treating patients with RP without systemic inflammation or after the first recurrence. Therefore, additional studies are required to address these gaps, and long-term follow-up data are needed to determine the recurrence rate beyond 8 months for anakinra and 14 months for rilonacept. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of RP has allowed for the identification of phenotypes, enabling more targeted treatment approaches.

### Usefulness of cardiac magnetic resonance for recurrent pericarditis [^111X2P9Z]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) offers the capability to objectively detect pericarditis by identifying pericardial thickening, edema/inflammation using Short-TI Inversion Recovery-T2 weighted (STIR-T2w) imaging, edema/inflammation or fibrosis with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and the presence of pericardial effusion. This is especially helpful for diagnosing recurrent pericarditis. The aim of the present paper is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CMR findings as well as their potential prognostic value for the diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis.

This multicenter cohort study involved consecutive patients with recurrent pericarditis evaluated by CMR. We included 128 consecutive cases (60 males, 47%; mean age 48 ± 14 years). CMR was performed at a mean time of 12 days (95% confidence interval 15 to 21) after the clinical diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for CMR diagnostic criteria and complications, such as additional recurrences, cardiac tamponade, and constrictive pericarditis. Areas under the ROC curve were 64% for pericardial thickening, 84% for pericardial edema, 82% for pericardial LGE, and 71% for pericardial effusion.

After a mean follow-up of 34 months, recurrences occurred in 52% of patients, tamponade in 6%, and constrictive pericarditis in 11%. Using a multivariable Cox model, the elevation of CRP and the presence of CMR pericardial thickening were predictors of adverse events, whereas the presence of CMR LGE was associated with a lower risk.

### Etiology of pericarditis in a prospective cohort of 1162 cases [^112LJny5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is a common disorder that presents in various pathologies and may be the first manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. The aims of this study were to describe the different causes of infectious and noninfectious pericarditis and compare them with those in the literature.

- **Methods**: Between May 2007 and September 2012, we prospectively evaluated a strategy using a systematic prescription of tests for the different etiological causes of pericarditis in patients with acute pericarditis who were hospitalized in the Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Department or admitted to the Emergency Department at the University Hospital of Marseille. A total of 1162 patients with suspected pericarditis were included. A standardized diagnosis procedure was performed for 800 patients, and 362 underwent pericardiocentesis.

- **Results**: Acute pericarditis was diagnosed in 933 patients. No diagnosis was established in 516 patients (55%), 197 patients suffered from postinjury syndromes, and 156 had previously known diseases associated with pericarditis. Our survey allowed us to identify the probable cause of pericarditis in 64 cases. An infectious etiological diagnosis was established in 53 cases. In our study, postinjury syndrome was the leading cause of pericarditis, a new diagnosis was made in 6.7% of cases, and 16% of the diagnoses were linked to a secondary, underlying disease.

- **Conclusion**: Using this strategy, we were able to reduce the number of idiopathic cases. In many cases, the etiologies were still identified. Long-term follow-up in the management of idiopathic cases remains crucial.

### Evolving diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^114ndFVV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In 1994, a task force (TF) of experienced clinicians in the field of cardiomyopathy was convened under the auspices of the European Society of Cardiology (Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases) and the International Society and Federation of Cardiology (Scientific Council) to establish formal criteria aimed at facilitating and standardizing the clinical diagnosis of the original phenotype of the disease characterized by typical involvement of the right ventricle (RV). Because single clinical features and instrumental tests had low diagnostic accuracy, the TF strategy consisted of reaching a clinical diagnosis by combining multiple aspects of diagnostic information such as family history, ECG, arrhythmic, structural, functional, and histopathological findings.

The TF criteria were set up on the basis of their specificity for the right-dominant variant of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) to avoid misdiagnosis due to conditions with an overlapping phenotype such as biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) ventricular tachycardia (VT). The TF diagnostic criteria were grouped into six different categories encompassing the spectrum of clinical manifestations of ARVC. The criteria were classified as "major" and "minor" according to their specificity for ARVC. The diagnosis was fulfilled in the presence of two major criteria, or one major plus two minor, or four minor criteria from different categories.

### Incidence, risk factors, natural history, and hypothesised mechanisms of myocarditis and pericarditis following covid-19 vaccination: Living evidence syntheses and review [^112vqi9q]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of the review

This review had several strengths. We used a comprehensive, peer-reviewed search strategy and included grey literature to capture recent data. A second reviewer screened the most relevant citations (based on machine learning) and verified all data and risk of bias assessments. GRADE assessments were based on team consensus, including clinical experts. Patient partners reviewed the evidence and developed interpretations from the patient perspective.

The main limitation of our review was that the covid-19 literature base is evolving rapidly with new evidence constantly emerging; nevertheless, some of our review findings were associated with moderate certainty evidence. Furthermore, one or more updates are planned and will be made publicly accessible via the COVID-END website. Because of apparent differences in presentation between myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination seen in our original review, and different long-term sequelae, we analysed these outcomes separately where possible. Although myocarditis and pericarditis often coexist, the former is more easily diagnosed due to the presence of elevated cardiac troponin or imaging findings on cardiac MRI. Conversely, pericarditis is often diagnosed based on chest pain symptoms and findings on echocardiogram; given this subjectivity, related data are likely less robust.

In some cases, authors clearly considered the term "myopericarditis" to include myocarditis, pericarditis, or both. In others, this distinction was not transparent, and the use of these data for rates of myoca…

### Complicated pericarditis: Understanding risk factors and pathophysiology to inform imaging and treatment [^11529vFA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients with acute pericarditis experience a benign course and have a good prognosis. However, a minority develop complicated pericarditis, which is the focus of this review. Specifically, we address risk factors, multimodality imaging, pathophysiology, and novel treatments. The authors conclude that:

- **Early high-dose corticosteroids**: The lack of colchicine and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are associated with the development of complicated pericarditis.
- **Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging**: In select cases, this may aid in assessing pericardial inflammation and constriction.
- **Phenotypic similarities**: The similarities between idiopathic pericarditis and periodic fever syndromes suggest disorders of the inflammasome may contribute to relapsing attacks.
- **Therapies targeting the inflammasome**: These may lead to more durable remission and resolution.

Finally, regarding future investigations, the authors discuss the potential of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to inform treatment duration and the need to compare steroid-sparing treatments to pericardiectomy.

### Pericardial involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Prevalence, associates, and clinical implications [^111WQ7i8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

The association of pericardial disease with infections was first reported in 1933. Since then, it has been described in various viral infections, with Enteroviruses, Coxsackie, and Herpesviruses being the most common. The data on pericardial disease in other coronaviruses are scarce and based only on case reports. Our data show that in consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 infection, the prevalence of pericardial effusion was nearly 15%, but only 17 of 530 (3.2%) had pericarditis. Several recent small prospective studies in critically ill patients with COVID‐19 have described a prevalence ranging from 43% to 90% for pericardial effusion. Other publications have dealt with the prevalence and clinical impact of pericardial effusion in acute COVID‐19 infection. However, all these reports were either retrospective or based on systematic literature review, assessing only patients with clinically indicated echocardiographic examinations.

Our study used a prospectively defined protocol and included unselected hospitalized patients encompassing all grades of disease severity, which can better evaluate the prevalence and clinical impact of pericardial effusion in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. Recently, Brito et al. studied the presence of pericardial inflammation in a small cohort of 54 athletes recovering from COVID‐19 infection. Although 39.5% had pericardial late enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, only 6% had associated pericardial effusion by echocardiography. The possible reasons for the lower prevalence

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112y1wXU]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The pericardium can be involved in various clinical disorders. The imaging findings are not specific for an individual pathology in most cases; however, the patient's clinical history may guide the radiologist to a definitive diagnosis. Congenital absence of the pericardium can be recognized by the imaging appearance of interposed lung tissue between the main pulmonary artery and the aorta. Pericardial effusion is a non-specific condition that may occur due to inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders. Cardiac tamponade may occur in case of massive or rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac.

Pericardial calcification is a common and easily identified entity on a computed tomography (CT) scan. The presence of calcification and/or fibrosis may result in pericardial constriction. Nevertheless, the pulsation of an adjacent coronary artery may prevent calcification formation in a focal area and consequently may result in a pericardial diverticulum containing epicardial fat and the coronary artery. The imaging findings encountered in patients with pericardial hydatid disease and Erdheim-Chester disease may mimic those of pericardial neoplasia.

Pericardial adhesions and pedicled fat flaps may cause confusion on a CT scan in the post-surgical period following cardiac surgery. Pericardial fat necrosis can be diagnosed by CT in patients with chest pain. Radiologists should be familiar with the medical devices placed in the pericardial space for certain individual indications. A pericardial patch and temporary epicardial pacemaker wires can be identified on a CT scan.

### Role of biochemical tests in the diagnosis of large pericardial effusions [^116wm5jP]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the biochemical characteristics of large pericardial effusions in various disease states and assess their utility as diagnostic tools. It was conducted at an academic university hospital in the Western Cape, South Africa, as a consecutive, prospective case series.

The participants included 110 hospital patients older than 12 years, who presented to the echocardiography department with large pericardial effusions, and 12 control subjects who underwent open-heart surgery, such as coronary artery bypass graft or aortic valve replacement.

Fluid from the patients was examined for biochemistry, adenosine deaminase, microbiology, hematology, and cytology. The etiology of each pericardial fluid sample was determined using predetermined criteria. The study found that the biochemistry of pericardial exudates differed significantly from pericardial transudates.

- **Diagnostic tool**: Light's criteria, which define an exudate as having one or more of the following: pleural fluid/serum protein ratio > 0.5, pleural fluid/serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ratio > 0.6, and/or pleural fluid LDH level > 200 U/L, were applied to pericardial fluids. They demonstrated to be the most reliable diagnostic tool for identifying pericardial exudates with a sensitivity of 98%.

Although laboratory tests serve as useful guidelines when assessing the etiology and pathophysiology of pericardial effusions, the study concludes that the majority of large, clinically significant pericardial effusions result from exudative causes.

Pleural and pericardial effusions are not an unusual finding, but their differential diagnosis remains uncertain. A Medline-based review identified an extensive list of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, iatrogenic, and myriad other etiologies. A single retrospective study has addressed this presentation. Several principles of a diagnostic workup are suggested, acknowledging that a significant minority of patients may not require a comprehensive workup and remain 'idiopathic'.

In biology, classification systems are used to promote understanding and systematic discussion through the use of logical groups and hierarchies. In clinical medicine, similar principles are used to standardize the nomenclature of diseases. For more than three decades, heart muscle diseases have been classified into primary or idiopathic myocardial diseases (cardiomyopathies) and secondary disorders that have similar morphological appearances but are caused by an identifiable pathology such as coronary artery disease or myocardial infiltration (specific heart muscle diseases). In this document, the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases presents an update of the existing classification scheme. The aim is to help clinicians look beyond generic diagnostic labels in order to reach more specific diagnoses.

**Contraindications**: Allergic reactions to organic nitrates are extremely rare, but they do occur. Nitroglycerin injection is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to it. In patients with pericardial tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis, cardiac output is dependent upon venous return. Intravenous nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with these conditions.

### Sustained pericarditis recurrence risk reduction with long-term rilonacept [^113zpb3V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

- **Study design and patients**: RHAPSODY (NCT03737110), a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven, randomized-withdrawal trial of rilonacept in patients with recurrent pericarditis, included a prespecified long-term extension of up to 24 months additional open-label rilonacept treatment. RHAPSODY was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, and all relevant regulations. The protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review boards or independent ethics committees for all participating centers. All patients provided written informed consent, and data supporting the findings of this study are available upon reasonable request.

The RHAPSODY design and pivotal study results have been published. Briefly, eligible adults and children 12 years or older with recurrent pericarditis presented with acute signs and symptoms that constituted at least a second recurrence despite treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and/or oral glucocorticoids; scored ≥ 4 on the 11-point (0 [none] to 10 [greatest severity]) numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain; and had C-reactive protein (CRP) of at least 1 mg/dL within 7 days of first study drug administration.

### Sustained pericarditis recurrence risk reduction with long-term rilonacept [^113thXKm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Clinically stable patients completing the randomized‐withdrawal period were eligible to continue into the open‐label, long‐term extension and receive weekly rilonacept. Patients still in the run‐in when the event‐driven randomized‐withdrawal period ended and who had achieved the defined clinical‐response criteria entered the long‐term extension directly. Concomitant oral pericarditis medications (except steroids) were allowed, unlike the randomized‐withdrawal period, and patient participation ended after 24 months of treatment, upon treatment discontinuation, or rilonacept US commercial launch (US patients only).

Individually, 18 months after the most recent pericarditis recurrence (qualifying episode or randomized‐withdrawal period flare), based on clinical status and investigator discretion, patients continued rilonacept treatment on study, suspended rilonacept treatment but remained on study for observation off treatment (rescue/bailout allowed), or discontinued the study without further observation other than a 6-week safety follow‐up (no option for rescue/bailout). This terminology for the 18-month decision milestone was intentionally chosen to distinguish among the different management strategies. Long‐term extension recurrences were investigator assessed, different from the independent adjudication for the randomized‐withdrawal period. However, individual clinical outcomes measures (i.e. pain, CRP, ECG, presence/absence of effusion by echocardiogram, and presence/absence of pericardial friction rub) were collected and were available.

### The clinical value of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 in evaluating pericardial thickness in tuberculous constrictive pericarditis [^116oHLqe]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between P-wave terminal force (Ptfv1) and pericardial thickness in patients with tuberculous constrictive pericarditis.

From January 2018 to October 2022, a total of 95 patients with tuberculous constrictive pericarditis requiring pericarditis dissection were considered, but 3 patients did not meet the criteria, resulting in 92 cases. The absolute value of Ptfv1 was tested using conventional electrocardiograms before surgery. Pericardial thickness was measured by echocardiography and chest CT, as well as post-pericardial dissection. Pearson correlation analysis was performed using R software to create scatter plots, and a non-parametric Chi-square test was utilized. The correlation of postoperative measurements with echocardiography, chest CT, and the absolute value of Ptfv1 was analyzed.

Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated statistically significant correlation coefficients between postoperative measurements and echocardiography, chest CT, and Ptfv1 values. Both scatter plots and the nonparametric Chi-square test indicated that postoperative measurements were consistent with the absolute values observed in echocardiography, chest CT, and Ptfv1 (p < 0.05). Additionally, the study found that the distribution of Ptfv1 values of ≥ 5 was higher than those of Ptfv1 < 5 following pericardiectomy (0.95:0.05).

### Misconceptions and facts about pericardial effusion and tamponade [^112yLtvs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Several common misconceptions can make the clinical diagnosis of subacute pericardial tamponade challenging. Widely known physical findings of pericardial tamponade lack sensitivity and specificity. Interpretation of echocardiographic signs requires a good understanding of pathophysiology. Over-reliance on echocardiography may result in the over-utilization of pericardial drainage procedures. Awareness of these misconceptions, along with an integrative approach to both clinical and imaging data, will help clinicians assess the hemodynamic impact of pericardial effusion and determine the need for drainage.

### Clinical update in pericardial diseases [^114fbP9A]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with pericardial disease often require interventional therapies or surgery, making it essential for anesthesiologists to understand the altered physiology of these disease states and the resultant impact on perioperative management. The broad spectrum of syndromes involving the pericardium presents with varying degrees of clinical significance, from asymptomatic presentations to life-threatening emergencies. Impaired diastolic filling of the heart represents a common theme of pericardial disease, with the rate of onset of pericardial pathology largely determining the extent of this impairment and subsequent severity of presentation. This review highlights recent updates in the literature regarding the diagnostic evaluation, medical therapy, and invasive therapeutic procedures for common pericardial syndromes from the perspective of a perioperative physician.

### Low-pressure pericardial tamponade: Case report and review of the literature [^115gBk8W]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Focused cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS) is accurate for determining the presence of a pericardial effusion. Using FoCUS to evaluate for pericardial tamponade, however, is more involved. Many experts teach that tamponade is unlikely if the inferior vena cava (IVC) shows respiratory variation and is not distended.

- **Case report**: A 53-year-old woman presented to the emergency department (ED) with severe orthostatic hypotension, exertional dyspnea, and hypoxia. The evaluation did not reveal an acute cardiopulmonary etiology, but FoCUS demonstrated a pericardial effusion, with several signs consistent with tamponade. The IVC, however, was not distended. She was believed to be hypovolemic, but fluid therapy provided minimal benefit. The patient's condition improved only after aspiration of the effusion. The patient's presentation was likely a "low-pressure" pericardial tamponade. Patients with this subset of tamponade often do not have significant venous congestion, but urgent pericardial aspiration is still indicated.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: Pericardial tamponade may not manifest with IVC plethora on ultrasound. Patients with low-pressure tamponade do not present with the most florid signs of tamponade, but they nonetheless fulfill diagnostic criteria for tamponade. If a non-plethoric IVC is used to rule out tamponade, the clinician risks delaying comprehensive echocardiography or other tests. Furthermore, the potential for deterioration to frank shock could be discounted, with inappropriate disposition and monitoring.

Acute pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac-like structure around the heart. This scoring system aids clinicians in stratifying patients based on their risk of developing complications such as cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, or recurrence of pericarditis.

This tool is applicable to patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute pericarditis but is not suitable for those with chronic pericarditis or pericarditis resulting from direct injury to the heart or pericardium, such as post-cardiac surgery or trauma.

The Torino Pericarditis Score uses various clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters to calculate the risk score. These include factors like fever, subacute onset, immunosuppression, trauma, oral anticoagulant therapy, myopericarditis, and pericardial effusion size. A higher score indicates a higher risk of developing complications, guiding clinicians in decisions about hospitalization, intensive care, and aggressive therapeutic interventions.

- **Risk assessment parameters**: The Torino Pericarditis Score calculator assesses risk based on various clinical indicators. Each indicator is assigned a specific numerical score, which are summed to produce a total score representing the risk level.

### Pericardial windows have limited diagnostic success [^117ACVzX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

A pericardial effusion (PE) is a common finding in patients with chronic cardiac failure, those who have undergone postoperative cardiac surgery, or patients with certain infectious, benign, or malignant diseases. Often, these effusions are diagnosed incidentally or in association with systemic or cardiac disease. The clinical spectrum of patients with pericardial effusions ranges from mild, asymptomatic effusions to cardiac tamponade. Management is guided by the hemodynamic impact, size, presence of inflammation (such as pericarditis), and etiology. Drainage of the PE is required for cases of cardiac tamponade, symptomatic moderate to large pericardial effusions, and when there is a suspicion of bacterial or neoplastic etiology.

Surgical pericardial drainage procedures, known as "pericardial windows", are frequently requested for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The perceived diagnostic benefit lies in determining malignancy or infection in patients with PEs of unclear etiology through testing of the pericardial fluid and tissue. The purpose of the study is to assess the diagnostic yield of surgical drainage procedures.

### Constrictive pericarditis: Diagnosis, management and clinical outcomes [^116nQrWd]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a form of diastolic heart failure that arises because an inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling. This disorder must be considered in the differential diagnosis for unexplained heart failure, particularly when the left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved. Risk factors for the development of CP include prior cardiac surgery and radiation therapy, but most cases are still deemed to be idiopathic. Making the diagnosis may be challenging and requires meticulous echocardiographic assessment, often supplemented by cross-sectional cardiac imaging and haemodynamic catheterisation.

The key pathophysiological concepts, which serve as the basis for many of the diagnostic criteria, remain:

- **Dissociation of intrathoracic and intracardiac pressures** and enhanced ventricular interaction.

Complete surgical pericardiectomy is the only effective treatment for chronic CP. A subset of patients with subacute inflammatory CP, often identified by cardiac MRI, may respond to anti-inflammatory treatments.

### Pericardial involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Prevalence, associates, and clinical implications [^111jSdHF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Recent documents published by the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography recommended a focused cardiac ultrasound approach in patients with COVID‐19. In a previous work, we found that a limited echocardiographic evaluation, including only TAPSE and LVEF, provides valuable information for clinical management. Recent advances in ultrasound technology have led to the miniaturization of machines to the size of a mobile telephone, which do not provide spectral Doppler functions. We show that in the context of hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, assessment for presence of pericardial effusion, combined with LVEF and TAPSE from the 4‐chamber view alone, carries significant prognostic data, on top of clinical evaluation and risk scores. This may further help risk stratify patients with COVID‐19 in a reality of overwhelmed health systems.

- **Study limitations**: This single‐center study included only hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. The fact that only a minority of patients with COVID‐19 are admitted to the hospital may lead to overestimation of the prevalence and clinical impact of pericardial effusion in COVID‐19. Furthermore, the presence of preexisting pericardial effusion cannot be excluded, resulting in possible overestimation of the true incidence of pericardial effusion. Eighty patients were excluded because they had "do not resuscitate/intubate" orders and thus received palliative care and died shortly after admission without echocardiographic assessment.

### Pericardial disease and pericardial tamponade [^115ezntf]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The pericardium serves many important functions, but it is not essential for life. Pericardial heart disease comprises only pericarditis and its complications, namely, tamponade and constriction, as well as congenital lesions. However, the pericardium is affected by virtually every category of disease. The critical care physician is thus likely to encounter the patient with pericardial disease in various settings, either as an isolated phenomenon or as a complication of a range of systemic disorders, trauma, or certain drugs.

Echocardiography is the primary tool for diagnosing and quantifying pericardial effusions. Within the context of the clinical presentation, a thorough understanding of M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler findings can help not only to identify patients with impending tamponade, but also to suggest a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis. This article reviews the pathogenesis and diagnosis of pericardial heart disease, focusing on the diagnostic utility of echocardiography, with an emphasis on those areas of greatest interest to the intensivist.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis: A review [^114kFUzm]. JAMA (2024). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (< 0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (< 3%) can be life-threatening.

- **Observations**: Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with the presence of two or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine (≈90%); new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression (≈25%-50%); a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small (≈60%); or a pericardial friction rub (< 30%). In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis.

Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves the use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and the C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a three-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs. 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%). With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least six months. Cortic

### Pericardial involvement in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Prevalence, associates, and clinical implications [^111EJotH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Prevalence of pericardial effusion and pericarditis**: Clinical data were collected for 664 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. A total of 134 patients were excluded because they did not undergo echocardiographic assessment: 35 were discharged within 48 hours of admission, 4 patients refused, 80 patients had a "do not intubate/resuscitate" status and received palliative care, and 15 patients died within 48 hours from admission.

	- The final study group included 530 patients (aged 63.1 ± 18.3 years; 62% men) who underwent clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. At the baseline evaluation, all patients exhibited COVID-19 symptoms and were stratified as follows: 278 patients (52%) with mild/moderate disease (oxygen saturation ≥ 94% in room air), 233 patients (44%) with severe disease (requiring oxygen supplement), and 19 patients (4%) with critical disease (requiring mechanical ventilation or use of vasopressors and/or extracorporeal life support). Of these patients, 75 (14.2%) had pericardial effusion. The effusion was mild in 72 patients and moderate in 3 patients. None of the patients required pericardial drainage.

	- Only 17 out of 75 patients (22.7%) with pericardial effusion met the criteria for pericarditis, based on the combination of typical ECG changes (observed in 7 patients) and/or typical chest pain (reported by 12 patients). No patients without pericardial effusion met the criteria for pericarditis.

### Acute pericarditis and cancer risk: A matched cohort study using linked UK primary and secondary care data [^116XYDnP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pericarditis is based on two of the following criteria: (1) chest pain; (2) pericardial friction-rub; (3) characteristic ECG changes; and (4) pericardial effusion on two-dimensional echocardiography. Elevated inflammatory markers and evidence of inflammation by imaging modalities may support diagnosis. However, the diagnosis can be challenging because the only reliable criterion may be symptomatic chest pain, whereas criteria two to four can be difficult to confirm with the standard diagnostic workup in a general practitioner setting.

In the hospital setting, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has a high sensitivity for detecting even smaller pericardial effusions. Our cohort was based on data from the CPRD and HES, which are considered to have good generalizability to both the UK population and comparable countries. Pericarditis diagnoses, as recorded in the CPRD and HES, have not been specifically validated, so there may have been some misclassification in our exposure measure. However, our combined use of primary care and hospital data should have improved sensitivity and allowed us to include patients who may have had pericarditis without hospital admission.

### New electrocardiographic criteria to differentiate acute pericarditis and myocardial infarction [^116AnMjH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Transmural myocardial ischemia induces changes in the QRS complex and QT interval duration; however, theoretically, these changes might not occur in acute pericarditis provided that the injury is not transmural. This study aims to assess whether QRS and QT duration can distinguish between acute pericarditis and acute transmural myocardial ischemia.

- **Methods**: Clinical records and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at ×2 magnification were analyzed in 79 patients with acute pericarditis and in 71 with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

- **Results**: ECG leads with maximal ST-segment elevation showed longer QRS complex and shorter QT interval than leads with isoelectric ST segment in patients with STEMI (QRS: 85.9 ± 13.6 ms vs. 81.3 ± 10.4 ms, P = 0.01; QT: 364.4 ± 38.6 vs. 370.9 ± 37.0 ms, P = 0.04), but not in patients with pericarditis (QRS: 81.5 ± 12.5 ms vs. 81.0 ± 7.9 ms, P = 0.69; QT: 347.9 ± 32.4 vs. 347.3 ± 35.1 ms, P = 0.83). QT interval dispersion among the 12-ECG leads was greater in STEMI than in patients with pericarditis (69.8 ± 20.8 ms vs 50.6 ± 20.2 ms, P < .001). The diagnostic yield of classical ECG criteria (PR deviation and J point level in lead aVR, and the number of leads with ST-segment elevation, ST-segment depression, and PR-segment depression) increased significantly (P = 0.012) when the QRS and QT changes were added to the diagnostic algorithm.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with acute STEMI, but not those with acute pericarditis, show prolongation of the QRS complex and shortening of the QT interval in ECG leads with ST-segment elevation. These new findings enhance the diagnostic approach for differentiating between these conditions.

### Diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis obscured by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Back to basics [^1171nw5g]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2015). Low credibility.

This report describes the case of a 41-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presenting with right-sided congestive heart failure symptoms. Noninvasive testing was suggestive but non-diagnostic for constrictive pericarditis (CP), which necessitated invasive hemodynamic catheterization. The unique presence of both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and constriction in this case resulted in the absence of "modern" echocardiographic and invasive criteria for CP, based on findings of enhanced ventricular dependence. However, classic hemodynamic criteria, such as early rapid filling with elevation and end-equalization of diastolic pressures, were present. The patient ultimately underwent pericardiectomy, resulting in dramatic clinical improvement.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pericarditis and specifically in relation to TTE, the 2021 ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR guidelines recommend obtaining TTE to assess for pericardial effusion in intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain. Consider obtaining TTE to detect pericardial abnormalities in intermediate-high-risk patients with stable chest pain exhibiting Q waves, symptoms or signs suggestive of heart failure, or when a heart murmur has an unclear diagnosis.

### Idiopathic pericardial effusions in children: Workup and final diagnoses [^111sEeob]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Pediatric idiopathic pericardial effusions are common and often have a prolonged clinical course. We hypothesized that these effusions have no standardized diagnostic workup and ultimately have a final etiology not initially appreciated. To test these hypotheses, a hospital system-wide retrospective cohort study (from January 1, 1990, to October 1, 2019) of pericardial effusions in children was conducted. Readmission occurred in 12% of the cases. Resolution of effusion occurred in 83% of patients within a median of one admission (range 1–4).

Of those effusions initially deemed idiopathic, 12 out of 42 (29%) were later found to have an underlying etiologic diagnosis, including:

- **Autoimmune**: 7 cases (58%)
- **Neoplastic**: 2 cases (16%)
- **Infectious**: 2 cases (16%)
- **Renal**: 1 case (8%)

Children initially diagnosed with idiopathic pericardial effusions have an underlying etiologic diagnosis 29% of the time, and a standardized workup may prevent delays in definitive diagnosis and treatment.

### Acute pericarditis: Rapid evidence review [^114weJcn]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium and occurs in approximately 4.4% of patients who present to the emergency department for nonischemic chest pain, with a higher prevalence in men. Although there are numerous etiologies of pericarditis, most episodes are idiopathic and the cause is presumed to be viral.

Diagnosis of pericarditis requires at least two of the following criteria: new or worsening pericardial effusion, characteristic pleuritic chest pain, pericardial friction rub, or electrocardiographic changes, including new, widespread ST elevations or PR depressions. Pericardial friction rubs are highly specific but transient, and they have been reported in 18% to 84% of patients with acute pericarditis. Classic electrocardiographic findings include PR-segment depressions; diffuse, concave, upward ST-segment elevations without reciprocal changes; and T-wave inversions.

Transthoracic echocardiography should be performed in all patients with acute pericarditis to characterize the size of effusions and evaluate for complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment option. Glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with contraindications to first-line therapy and those who are pregnant beyond 20 weeks' gestation or have other systemic inflammatory conditions. Colchicine should be used in combination with first- or second-line treatments to reduce the risk of recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of complications should be admitted to the hospital for further workup and treatment.

### Sustained pericarditis recurrence risk reduction with long-term rilonacept [^113tx7ou]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Potential limitations of the randomized withdrawal design have been discussed previously. While the relatively small number of patients is a limitation, the open-label design of the long-term extension allowed for rilonacept treatment in all 74 patients — more than double the number of patients in the randomized-withdrawal period rilonacept cohort (n = 30) and over a 2- to 3-fold longer period, with 52 of 74 patients reaching the 18-month decision milestone. Despite the limitations of sample size in this rare disease study, the efficacy findings were robust and clinically significant. Although the open-label design and the nonrandomized allocation of interventions are limitations, the nonrandomized subgroup of patients who voluntarily suspended rilonacept after the 18-month decision milestone with observation effectively served as a small nontreated control group, who experienced a high recurrence event rate and demonstrated results that were consistent with the arm in the main study of patients who were randomized to placebo.

Another consideration was the fact that recurrences during the long-term extension were investigator-assessed and were not externally adjudicated. While this different approach in the long-term extension was intended to more closely mirror clinical practice, some cases reported as recurrences did not meet formal RHAPSODY randomized-withdrawal recurrence criteria, in which a CRP elevation > 1 mg/dL was required in addition to the report of increased pain. As a result, three patients during continuous long-term rilonacept therapy who reported only pain symptoms were not considered to have experienced a true recurrence.

### Evaluation and treatment of pericarditis: A systematic review [^113db1AL]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common cause of chest pain.

- **Objective**: To summarize published evidence on the causes, diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and prognosis of pericarditis.

- **Evidence review**: A literature search of BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for human studies without language restriction from January 1, 1990, to August 31, 2015. After literature review and selection of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and large observational studies, 30 studies (5 meta-analyses, 10 randomized clinical trials, and 16 cohort studies) with 7569 adult patients were selected for inclusion.

- **Findings**: The etiology of pericarditis may be infectious (e.g. viral and bacterial) or noninfectious (e.g. systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post-cardiac injury syndromes). Tuberculosis is a major cause of pericarditis in developing countries but accounts for less than 5% of cases in developed countries, where idiopathic, presumed viral causes are responsible for 80% to 90% of cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria including chest pain, a pericardial rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. Certain features at presentation (temperature > 38°C [> 100.4°F], subacute course, large effusion or tamponade, and failure of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] treatment) indicate a poorer prognosis and identify patients requiring hospital admission. The most common treatment for idiopathic and viral pericarditis in Nor…

### The imaging appearances of various pericardial disorders [^112pAvHX]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

The pericardium can be involved in various clinical disorders. The imaging findings are not specific for an individual pathology in most cases; however, a patient's clinical history may guide the radiologist to a definitive diagnosis.

Congenital absence of the pericardium can be recognized with the imaging appearance of interposed lung tissue between the main pulmonary artery and aorta. Pericardial effusion is a nonspecific condition that may occur due to inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic disorders. Cardiac tamponade may occur in the case of massive or rapid accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. Pericardial calcification is a common and easily identified entity on a computed tomography (CT) scan. The presence of calcification and/or fibrosis may result in pericardial constriction. Nevertheless, the pulsation of an adjacent coronary artery may prevent calcification formation in a focal area, consequently resulting in a pericardial diverticulum containing epicardial fat and coronary artery.

The imaging findings encountered in patients with pericardial hydatid disease and Erdheim-Chester disease may mimic those of pericardial neoplasia. Pericardial adhesions and pedicled fat flaps may cause confusion on a CT scan in the post-surgical period following cardiac surgery. Pericardial fat necrosis can be diagnosed by CT in patients with chest pain. Radiologists should be familiar with the medical devices placed in the pericardial space for certain individual indications. A pericardial patch and temporary epicardial pacemaker wires can be identified on a CT scan.

### Clinical presentation and outcomes of acute pericarditis in a large urban hospital in the United States of America [^113ScEGS]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

The higher observed incidence of treatment failure or pericarditis recurrence in patients with idiopathic forms may rely on the differences in underlying pathogenesis or in the time to anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy. A shorter time to treatment is expected for postcardiac injury syndromes, possibly attributable to scheduled follow-ups that allow for early identification and subsequent early modulation of the inflammatory burden. In contrast, patients with idiopathic pericarditis develop symptoms in the outpatient setting without ready access to clinicians and are, therefore, expected to have an extended time to diagnosis and anti-inflammatory treatment. Although idiopathic and postcardiac injury pericarditis can share a similar inflammatory response, the molecular mechanisms initiating this response may differ, highlighting the need for investigations of tailored therapies.

Patients with elevated troponin I levels were found to have a lower risk for developing recurrences and adverse composite outcomes. The detection of increased troponin I levels in patients with pericarditis is indicative of the concomitant involvement of the subepicardial myocardium in the inflammatory process, as well as ECG abnormalities. In contrast to coronary artery disease, the elevation in troponin levels in pericarditis patients is not a negative prognostic marker. Imazio and colleagues previously described that recurrences were more frequent in cases with "isolated" pericarditis accompanied by normal troponin I levels.

European Heart Journal (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute pericarditis, the EACTS/ESC 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining the following in the initial evaluation of all cases of suspected pericardial disease:

- **Cardiac auscultation**: Perform cardiac auscultation to detect any abnormal heart sounds indicative of pericardial involvement.
- **Electrocardiography (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)**: These are crucial for assessing electrical and structural changes in the heart.
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: Used to identify any changes in the heart size or pulmonary involvement.
- **Inflammatory markers**: Measure levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and conduct a white blood cell (WBC) count with differential to determine the presence of inflammation.
- **Renal and liver function tests, myocardial damage markers**: Evaluate renal and liver function and check myocardial damage markers, including creatine kinase (CK) and troponin, to assess the overall impact on heart function.
