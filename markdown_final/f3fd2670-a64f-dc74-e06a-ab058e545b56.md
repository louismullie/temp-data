## Question

What condition is represented by ICD-10 code J41.0?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition is represented by ICD-10 code J41.0. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which ICD-10 block J41 belongs to and whether it sits within COPD or a related respiratory category. Then, I should verify the exact subcategory and whether J41.0 is the simple or mucopurulent form of chronic bronchitis. Next, I will cross-check multiple authoritative sources to confirm the label and ensure there isn't a nuance I'm missing. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically accurate answer with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm the code family. J41 falls within the ICD-10 chapter for respiratory diseases, and multiple high-quality sources explicitly list J41 codes under COPD and allied conditions, which anchors J41.0 in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease spectrum rather than acute bronchitis or asthma, so I should not misclassify it as acute or unspecified bronchitis [^858ddbd8] [^63819987].

> Wait, let me verify the subcategory. J41 is titled "Simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis", and within that, J41.0 corresponds to simple chronic bronchitis, whereas J41.1 corresponds to mucopurulent chronic bronchitis; I initially wondered if J41.0 might be the mucopurulent variant, but that would be J41.1, so I should correct that assumption and confirm J41.0 as simple chronic bronchitis [^bf62ff81] [^b01d86b0].

> I should double-check consistency across sources. The CDC mortality tables, large epidemiologic studies, and respiratory registries consistently map J41.0 to simple chronic bronchitis within the COPD-related code set, which reinforces that this is the standard nomenclature used in both clinical documentation and public health reporting [^b01d86b0] [^bf62ff81] [^91b3d70a].

> Let me consider the clinical context briefly. Simple chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic productive cough without prominent airway obstruction or emphysema on imaging, and it is part of the broader COPD constellation even if airflow limitation may be mild or not universally present in all patients labeled this way, which aligns with how J41.0 is used in administrative and epidemiologic datasets [^63819987] [^63819987].

> Final answer: ICD-10 code J41.0 represents simple chronic bronchitis, a form of chronic bronchitis within the COPD spectrum, distinct from mucopurulent chronic bronchitis (J41.1) and unspecified chronic bronchitis (J42) [^c1852a96] [^b01d86b0] [^63819987].

---

ICD-10 code J41.0 denotes **simple chronic bronchitis**, a form of chronic bronchitis characterized by a persistent productive cough for at least three months in two consecutive years, without prominent infection or emphysema. It is part of the COPD spectrum [^63819987] and is used for **epidemiologic tracking, clinical documentation, and billing** [^439852f4] [^cd4941f1]. Accurate coding supports disease surveillance, resource planning, and appropriate reimbursement [^fb8d01f8] [^cd4941f1].

---

## Clinical definition and characteristics

Simple chronic bronchitis is defined by a **persistent productive cough** for at least three months in two consecutive years, with minimal or no airway obstruction or emphysema. Key characteristics include:

- **Persistent cough**: Productive cough lasting ≥ 3 months in two consecutive years [^notfound].
- **Minimal obstruction**: Little or no airflow limitation on spirometry.
- **Absence of emphysema**: No significant destruction of alveolar walls or enlargement of air spaces.
- **Stable course**: Typically lacks acute exacerbations or marked infection.

---

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology involves chronic **airway inflammation** with mucus hypersecretion, goblet cell hyperplasia, and hypertrophy of mucous glands. Airflow is usually preserved, distinguishing it from chronic obstructive bronchitis or emphysema [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis relies on clinical history and exclusion of other causes. Criteria include:

- **Chronic productive cough**: ≥ 3 months in two consecutive years [^notfound].
- **Exclusion of other causes**: Rule out asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, and other respiratory diseases.
- **Spirometry**: Typically normal or only mildly abnormal, without significant airflow limitation.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Simple chronic bronchitis can impair quality of life due to chronic cough and sputum production. Management focuses on **symptom control** and risk reduction:

- **Smoking cessation**: Essential to slow progression and reduce symptoms [^notfound].
- **Bronchodilators**: May be used if mild airflow limitation is present.
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to prevent infections.
- **Patient education**: Self-management and recognition of exacerbations.

---

## Epidemiological significance

ICD-10 code J41.0 is used in epidemiological studies and public health surveillance to track the prevalence and burden of **simple chronic bronchitis** [^b01d86b0]. It aids in:

- **Disease surveillance**: Monitoring trends and geographic distribution [^d16bbc1b].
- **Resource allocation**: Informing healthcare planning and resource distribution [^notfound].
- **Comparative studies**: Enabling international comparisons of respiratory disease burden [^d79581de].

---

## Coding and documentation considerations

Accurate coding of J41.0 requires **detailed clinical documentation** of chronic productive cough, duration, and exclusion of other respiratory conditions. Coders should ensure:

- **Specificity**: Document the chronicity and nature of the cough [^cd4941f1].
- **Exclusion of other conditions**: Clearly differentiate from chronic obstructive bronchitis (J44.x) and emphysema (J43.x) [^c1852a96].
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology aligned with ICD-10 coding guidelines [^3fb71031].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its utility, ICD-10 coding for simple chronic bronchitis has limitations:

- **Underdiagnosis**: Chronic bronchitis may be underrecognized or misclassified, affecting epidemiological data [^d79581de].
- **Variability**: Differences in coding practices across healthcare systems can impact data comparability [^b7ad7b35].
- **Clinical overlap**: Differentiating simple chronic bronchitis from other chronic respiratory conditions can be challenging, requiring careful clinical judgment and documentation [^3fb71031].

---

ICD-10 code J41.0 represents **simple chronic bronchitis**, characterized by a chronic productive cough with minimal airflow limitation or emphysema. Accurate coding and documentation are essential for epidemiological surveillance, clinical management, and healthcare resource allocation [^d79581de] [^439852f4].

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^d79581de]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Mortality in COPD — The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes mortality statistics for selected causes of death annually for all WHO regions, and in ICD-10 deaths from COPD or chronic airways obstruction are included under "COPD and allied conditions" (ICD-10 codes J42-46). Under-recognition and under-diagnosis of COPD reduces the accuracy of mortality data, and COPD may be listed as a contributory cause or omitted from death certificates. In 2011, COPD was the third leading cause of death in the United States. Data from the GBD Study 2017 estimated a COPD-attributable death rate was 42/100,000 (4.72% of all-cause deaths). With these caveats, globally there are around three million deaths annually due to COPD, and projections estimate over 5.4 million annual deaths from COPD and related conditions by 2060.

### Importance of proper utilization of international classification of Diseases 10th revision and clinical documentation in modern payment models [^cd4941f1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Health care payment models are changing rapidly, and the measurement of outcomes and costs is increasing.

Methods

With the implementation of International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, providers now have the ability to introduce a precise array of diagnoses for their patients.

Results

More specific diagnostic codes do not eliminate the potential for vague application, as was seen with the utility of ICD-9. Complete, accurate, and consistent data that reflect the risk, severity, and complexity of care are becoming critically important in this new environment. Orthopedic specialty organizations must be actively involved in influencing the definition of value and risk in the patient population.

Conclusion

Now is the time to use the ICD-10 diagnostic codes to improve the management of patient conditions in data.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation? [^3fb71031]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th ed (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by International Classification of Diseases, 10th ed (ICD-10). When the codes that relate to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned. In the future, a more simplified terminology that is consistent with clinical usage could improve accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the present ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in the medical records more accurately reflect current coding terminology.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^d495525c]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

ICD-10-CM impact on payment — Pediatricians "should use the specificity of the ICD-10-CM to accurately reflect the child's conditions and complexity", and when "sufficient clinical information is not known or available about a particular health condition, the payer should recognize that the clinician can appropriately report an unspecified code without the claim being summarily denied solely on the basis of specificity". Furthermore, payers "should not use ICD-10-CM specificity to deny payment to appropriately trained pediatricians performing those specialized services within their scope of practice". New payment models "incorporate elaborate risk-adjustment algorithms based on diagnostic completeness", and such risk-based models "must appropriately represent the risk contributed by children with special health care needs". To support diagnostic comprehensiveness, "claim-form formatting should be expanded (such as doubling to 8) to accommodate more than 4 diagnoses per line-item service", exceeding "the current line-item limitation for the version 5010 CMS 837P electronic and 1500 paper claim forms".

### International classification of diseases coding for inflammatory arthritides [^f6832853]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

The International Classification of Diseases was revised in 2015 from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), representing the largest revision to the system in 30 years (from 14 500 to 70 000 codes). Although ICD-10 could document conditions with greater granularity, it remains to be seen whether it has been well-utilized up to the 2022 transition to International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11).

With ICD-10, the number of inflammatory arthritis codes increased from 14 to 425. Although this allows for better characterization of such conditions for more than 1.3 million affected US individuals, the greater granularity is useful only if the breadth of codes is utilized. The purpose of this quality improvement study was to investigate usage patterns of inflammatory arthritides codes under ICD-10 vs ICD-9.

Severity and years lived with disability

Codes from the ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision; J41, J42, J43, J44, and J47) and ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, ninth revision; 491–492, and 496) were use for mapping COPD. In the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study, J40 and 490 (bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic) and J47 and 494 (bronchiectasis) were not included, however. The three GOLD classes are not a direct measure of disease severity, but rather reflect a grading system based on a physiological measurement. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (US, 2001–2011) were used to map the epidemiological findings into the three COPD health states, for which disability weights had been previously identified. More specifically, the GOLD class designations estimated for the US in 2005 (midpoint of the years included in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) were converted into the Global Burden of Disease classifications of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe COPD. Table S3 shows the three health states for COPD (mild, moderate, and severe), lay descriptions, and disability weights. Finally, the severity levels were multiplied by the severity specific disability weights to produce the years lived with disability.

### Health disparities among older adults following tropical cyclone exposure in Florida [^d16bbc1b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Hospitalization records

We obtained daily hospitalization data based on the residential ZIP code of the patient for all pay-per-service Medicare beneficiaries (≥ 65 years) in Florida (1999–2016) for cardiovascular disease ([CVD]: International Classification of Diseases [ICD]−9, 390–459; ICD-10, I00–I99) and respiratory disease ([RD]: ICD-9, 464–466, 480–487, and 490–493; ICD-10, J06.9; J20.9; J18.9; J43.9; J40; J41.0; J41.1; J41.8; J42; J44.0; J44.1; J44.9; J47.1; J47.9; J67.0-J67.9). ZIP codes reflect participants' primary residential addresses. This data does not include Medicare Advantage (Part C) enrollees, for whom claims are processed separately. However, traditional Medicare enrollees (included here) and Medicare Advantage enrollees (not included here) do not differ significantly by age, income, race, or chronic conditions. We aggregated daily hospitalizations from ZIP to ZCTA for analysis. For all Medicare records we obtained individual-level characteristics including age (65 to 74 years, 75 to 84 years, ≥ 85 years), sex (male, female), race (Black, white, other), and dual Medicaid eligibility (yes, no), which serves as an indicator of low socioeconomic status. Medicare data is highly representative of older adults in American, as 98% of Americans aged 65 years or older are insured by Medicare. However, our study does not capture morbidities that did not result in hospitalization.

### Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: consensus guidelines from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^ea6cd846]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

ICD-10 coding for CF and other CFTR dysfunction — primary ICD-10 codes include CF, unspecified (E84.9), CF, with meconium ileus (E84.11), CF with other intestinal manifestations (eg, DIOS) (E84.19), and CF, with pulmonary manifestations (E84.0). For CFSPID, use P09 (abnormal findings on neonatal screening) or E88.89 (if CRMS/CFSPID is adopted as the preferred terminology). A secondary code option is Z14.1 (CF carrier status).

### Health policy basics: implementation of the international classification of disease, 10th revision [^489ad2ef]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standardizes diagnostic codes into meaningful criteria to enable the storage and retrieval of information regarding patient care. Whereas other countries have been using ICD, 10th Revision (ICD-10), for years, the United States will transition from ICD, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), to ICD-10, on 1 October 2015. This transition is one of the largest and most technically challenging changes that the medical community has experienced in the past several decades. This article outlines the implications of moving to ICD-10 and recommends resources to facilitate the transition.

### Global implementation of the World Health Organization's international classification of diseases (ICD)-11: the allergic and hypersensitivity conditions model [^93df4267]. Allergy (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) provides a common language for use worldwide as a diagnostic and classification tool for epidemiology, clinical purposes and health management. Since its first edition, the ICD has maintained a framework distributing conditions according to topography, with the result that some complex conditions, such as allergies and hypersensitivity disorders (A/H) including anaphylaxis, have been poorly represented. The change in hierarchy in ICD-11 permitted the construction of the pioneer section addressed to A/H, which may result in more accurate mortality and morbidity statistics, including more accurate accounting for mortality due to anaphylaxis, strengthen classification, terminology and definitions. The ICD-11 was presented and adopted by the 72nd World Health Assembly in May 2019, and the implementation is ongoing worldwide. We here present the outcomes from an online survey undertaken to reach out the allergy community worldwide in order to peer review the terminology, classification and definitions of A/H introduced into ICD-11 and to support their global implementation. Data are presented here for 406 respondents from 74 countries. All of the subsections of the new A/H section of the ICD-11 had been considered with good accuracy by the majority of respondents. We believe that, in addition to help during the implementation phase, all the comments provided will help to improve the A/H classification and to increase awareness by different disciplines of what actions are needed to ensure more accurate epidemiological data and better clinical management of A/H patients.

### The E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury epidemic: pathogenesis, management, and future directions: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^6cf4a283]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

E-cigarette or vaping product use–associated lung injury (EVALI) ICD-10 coding guidelines — For encounters, an umbrella diagnosis of U07.0 Vaping-related disorder should be used, and examples of additional specific condition diagnoses include J68.0 Bronchitis and pneumonitis due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors; J69.1 Pneumonitis due to inhalation of oils and essences; J80 Acute respiratory distress syndrome; J82 Pulmonary eosinophilia, not elsewhere classified; J84.114 Acute interstitial pneumonitis; J84.89 Other specified interstitial pulmonary disease; R04.89 Diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage; and, when no additional condition is specified, J68.9 Unspecified respiratory condition due to chemicals, gases, fumes, and vapors. Other codes that may be relevant in combination include F12.- Cannabis related disorders and F17.29- Nicotine dependence, other tobacco product, with a clinical note describing the type of e-cigarette used; in addition, T65.291- Toxic effect of other tobacco and nicotine, accidental (unintentional) or T40.7X1- Poisoning by cannabis (derivatives), accidental (unintentional), may also be appropriate, and additional codes may be needed to fully characterize an event so that encounters fully comply with ICD-10 coding rules.

Methods

Overview

SSA is amongst the seven super-regions where the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimate was produced. In this paper, as part of the GBD 2019 round, we have studied the GBD estimate of COPD in SSA, as classified by the World Bank. The methods applied in this paper are the same as those described for the GBD 2019, mentioned elsewhere. Additional methodological details are available as a supplementary appendix on the GBD 2019 Capstones: Diseases and Injuries, and Risk Factors.

Non-fatal estimation for COPD: prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs)

The GOLD spirometry-based post-bronchodilation measurement (< 0.7 FEV₁/FVC) was used as case definition and severity grading for COPD. An alternative case definition was also used from GOLD Pre-bronchodilation, Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) Pre and Post bronchodilation, and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines. Furthermore, the International Classification of diseases (ICD) versions 9 and 10 codes associated with COPD were enrolled as methods of evaluating whether individuals had COPD or not: the codes 491–492, and 496 from ICD-9, and J41, J42, J43, J44, and J47 from ICD-10 were included. Codes J40 and 490 (Bronchitis, not specified as acute or chronic) and J47 and 494 (Bronchiectasis) were excluded.

### Classification of chronic pain for the international classification of diseases (ICD-11): results of the 2017 international World Health Organization field testing [^6663b705]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Because chronic pain has been poorly represented in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) despite its significant contribution to the burden of disease worldwide, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) developed a classification of chronic pain that was included in the ICD-11 version as "MG30" and approved by the World Health Assembly in 2019. The objective of this field test was to determine how well the classification of chronic pain works in the context of the ICD-11. A web-based survey using the WHO-FiT platform recruited 177 healthcare professionals from all WHO regions. After a training on coding chronic pain hosted by the IASP Web site, participants evaluated 18 diagnostic codes (lines) of the 2017 frozen version of the ICD-11 and 12 vignettes (cases) describing chronic pain conditions. Correctness, ambiguity, and perceived difficulty of the coding were compared between the ICD-11 and the ICD-10 and the applicability of the morbidity rules for the ICD-11 verified. In the line coding, 43.0% of correct chronic pain diagnoses assigned with the ICD-10 contrasted with 63.2% with the ICD-11. Especially in cases in which the chronic pain is regarded as the symptom of an underlying disease, the ICD-11 (63.5%) commanded more correct diagnoses than the ICD-10 (26.8%). The case coding was on average 83.9% accurate, only in 1.6% of cases any difficulty was perceived. The morbidity rules were applied correctly in 74.1% of cases. From a coding perspective, the ICD-11 is superior to the ICD-10 in every respect, offering better accuracy, difficulty, and ambiguity in coding chronic pain conditions.

### Pediatric application of coding and valuation systems [^449cf18a]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric diagnostic classification — ICD-10-CM and DC: 0–5 relationship states that although the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) remains the HIPAA-mandated code set for diagnostic selection in electronic transactions, mental health disorders in infancy and early childhood are also addressed by the Diagnostic Classification of Mental and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0–5). DC: 0–5 is "especially relevant to pediatrics", crosswalks to ICD-10-CM exist but are "not one-to-one", and DC: 0–5 "is not intended to represent a claims-based diagnostic set" but "is intended to complement ICD-10-CM" with guidance such as cultural variables. As ICD-10-CM expands yearly with new codes, alignment opportunities between DC: 0–5 and ICD-10-CM may increase.

### Nonarthritic hip joint pain [^43fdb678]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2014). Medium credibility.

Nonarthritic hip joint pain — classification codes include the primary International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes "M25.5 Pain in joint, M24.7 Protrusio acetabuli, M24.0 Loose body in joint, and M24.2 Disorder of ligament". The corresponding ICD-9-CM codes and conditions are "719.45 Joint pain, 718.65 Unspecified intrapelvic protrusion of acetabulum, 718.15 Loose body in joint, and 718.5 Other derangement of joint pelvic region and thigh". Other ICD-10 codes that may be associated are "M21.0 Valgus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.1 Varus deformity, not elsewhere classified", "M21.2 Flexion deformity", "M24.3 Pathological dislocation and subluxation of joint, not elsewhere classified", and "M24.4 Recurrent dislocation and subluxation of joint".

### Medication use by US patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a retrospective study of administrative data [^7064cdea]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study sample

Patients were included if they were ≥ 18 years old on the index date and had one of the following codes for PH: ICD-9-CM code 416.0 or ICD-10-CM codes I27.0, I27.2, I27.20, I27.21, I27.23, or I27.29 (Additional file 1: eTable 1). Patients also had to have a diagnosis of COPD. COPD was identified by codes for chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other chronic airway obstruction: ICD-9-CM codes 491.x and ICD-10-CM codes J40, J41.x for chronic bronchitis; ICD-9-CM codes 492.x and ICD-10-CM codes J43.x for emphysema; ICD-9-CM code 496 for chronic airway obstruction and ICD-10-CM codes J44.x for COPD (Additional file 1: eTable 1).

Patients were excluded if they had ICD-10-CM codes 127.22 or 127.24, representing, respectively, PH due to left-heart disease, and CTEPH (Additional file 1: eTable 1). Patients were also excluded if they had codes for any of the following conditions: pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung disease, or idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (presumed to be other Group 3 PH diagnoses); left-heart failure, unspecified heart failure prior to the PH diagnosis, or right-heart failure prior to the PH diagnosis (presumed to be Group 2 PH); lung transplantation prior to the PH or COPD diagnosis. Finally, patients were excluded if they had either a diagnosis code for PH or an NDC code for a PAH-targeted therapy prior to the first diagnosis code for COPD, or if they died during the study period.

### The rendering of human phenotype and rare diseases in ICD-11 [^a9a3b2d2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Implications for phenotype representation

ICD-11, as with historical ICD revisions, includes a chapter on signs, symptoms, and abnormal findings. This chapter is highly enriched with what many could consider the root of phenotyping features; however, disease signs and symptoms are emphasized more than rare anomalies. A deeply enriched chapter on developmental anomalies, expanded from the ICD-10 chapter on congenital malformations, is informed by contributions from the rare disease community and Orphanet in particular. There are also subchapter groupings, such as inborn errors of metabolism, which include specific phenotype manifestations.

ICD-11 heavily leverages post-coordination to describe anomalies in particular. The table illustrates the recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations for polydactyly. An example of validation post-coordination of polydactyly of the left intermediate phalanx of the hand is:

Combining into the ICD-11 MMS cluster code:

Code: LB78&XA1473556831&XK1694310660

Note that the "&" symbol is a syntactic convention which links codes into a single cluster. This introduces the use of base 34 numbers (0–9; A–Z except O and I) as MMS code values. Also, these code values may change by the June 2018 publication date, as these examples were drawn from a draft version of ICD-11 under review.

Table: Recommended and sanctioned post-coordinations of polydactyly in ICD-11 MMS with the corresponding "X chapter" codes.

Composite phenotype rendering

Recognizing the expressive power of post-coordination, one can create a cluster of a disease or diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or anomalies that can comprehensively describe a given patient. This aligns with the overloaded use of phenotyping as a description of a complex of findings to describe particular categories or subtypes of patients, as opposed to distinct features. ICD-11 is capable of representing these complexes as post-coordinated clusters of specific rubrics.

### Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation [^11ba64d1]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable advances in pediatric healthcare over the past century have substantially reduced overall childhood morbidity and mortality, while concomitantly enabling some children with complex chronic conditions (CCC) to survive and live longer. A clear definition of these CCCs is important for several reasons: to assess population-level temporal trends in the proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with CCCs; to assess patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with CCCs; and to perform individual-level risk adjustments for patients' CCC status in studies of healthcare processes and outcomes.

In 2000, Feudtner and colleagues developed a definition for CCCs: "Any medical condition that can be reasonably expected to last at least 12 months (unless death intervenes) and to involve either several different organ systems or 1 organ system severely enough to require specialty pediatric care and probably some period of hospitalization in a tertiary care center". Based on this definition, a comprehensive set of codes available at that time from the International Classification of Disease version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) system were identified as indicative of a CCC, and further categorized into 9 categories (cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromuscular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematologic or immunologic, metabolic, other congenital or genetic, and malignancy).

The CCC classification system (v1) can be used to either examine a particular CCC category or to identify patients with multiple CCC categories. The CCC system was initially applied to studying patterns of pediatric mortality and end-of-life care, and has subsequently been applied to a variety of research problems, including risk adjustment, prediction of adverse health outcomes, and identification of populations with high health care utilization.

The original CCC system, now more than a decade old, warranted revision for 3 main reasons. First, the International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) is replacing the ICD-9 system in the United States. Although already widely used internationally, ICD-10 was first used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vital statistics data files in 1999, and government diagnostic and procedural billing codes will change to ICD-10 in 2015. Second, the original CCC system has not been updated to include new diagnostic codes added over the past decade, and in particular the original CCC system does not include a category for conditions originating in the neonatal period. Third, the original CCC system consisted entirely of diagnostic codes and lacked a domain of codes that specify either a likely dependence upon medical technology or having undergone organ (including bone marrow) transplantation, both of which would indicate CCC status.

### 2022 AHA / ACC key data elements and definitions for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular complications of COVID-19: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical data standards [^3d036628]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association COVID-19 data standards — scope and special considerations: This document provides data standards for cardiovascular and other complications related to COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the intent is to provide data elements consistent with current practice guidance and to include updated terminology and attributes in compliance with Task Force methodology and ACC/AHA policies for harmonization. The document is intended for use by researchers, registry developers, and clinicians and is proposed as a framework for ICD-10 code development of COVID-19–related cardiovascular conditions. In this document, data elements were not differentiated for specific encounters such as for inpatients versus outpatients, dates of encounter, number of encounters, baseline or repeated data elements, and databases can be built and customized according to users' needs to capture such information. The intent was not to provide recommendations regarding COVID-19 treatment, and the writing committee recommends that readers follow prevailing COVID-19 management guidelines.

### Amblyopia preferred practice pattern [^1cde52cc]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Amblyopia — ICD-10 CM coding categories and laterality conventions are listed as follows: Amblyopia, unspecified is H53.00–; Strabismic amblyopia (suppression) is H53.03–; Deprivation amblyopia is H53.01–; Refractive amblyopia, including anisometropic and isoametropic amblyopia, is H53.02–; and Amblyopia, suspect is H53.04–. Laterality uses the final character, with mappings "1, right eye; 2, left eye; 3, bilateral; 9, eye not specified"; when laterality is specified it can appear in different digit positions, and if no bilateral code is provided for a bilateral condition, separate left and right codes are assigned; unspecified laterality can be "a 0 or 9 depending on whether it is a 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th digit".

### Β-blocker therapy and risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – A Danish nationwide study of 1. 3 million individuals [^bd507f17]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

2.1.2 The Danish National Patient Registry

The Danish National Patient Registry includes discharge diagnoses from all Danish hospitals since 1978 and from outpatient clinics since 1995. Diseases are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 8th revision (ICD-8) through 1993 and 10th revision afterwards. ICD-8 codes for COPD are 490, 491, and 492, and ICD-10 codes are J41, J410, J411, J418, J42, J429, J43, J430, J431, J431A, J432, J438, J439, J439A, J44, J440, J448, J448A, J448C, J449, J47, J479. For each hospitalization, diagnoses directly causing the hospitalization (action diagnoses, labeled with A in the registry) and diagnoses of comorbidities (labeled with B in the registry) are noted. We only included A-diagnoses in the analyses of the study. By that, it is possible to exclude patients hospitalized for other reasons than COPD. Specification of ICD-codes is given in the Supplementary Material (Table S3).

2.1.3 Danish Register of Causes of Death

Since 1871 data on all causes and numbers of deaths occurring in Denmark have been collected. Causes of death have since 1948 been registered according to ICD-codes and the data collected in the Danish Register of Causes of Death. On the death certificate, the diagnosis directly causing death is labeled as the "direct cause of death", whereas comorbidities not directly causing death are labeled as "secondary diagnoses". In the present study, we have defined death related to COPD with the above-mentioned ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes when COPD was registered as the direct cause of death, and calculated all-cause mortality and risk of death from COPD between the two treatment groups.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^b7ad7b35]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Was the transition from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) in October 2015 associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence when diagnoses are grouped by classification system?

Findings

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined insurance claims for more than 18 million privately insured adults and children in the US from 2010 to 2017 and found instantaneous increases or decreases of 20% or more associated with the ICD-10-CM transition for nearly 1 in 6 (16%) diagnostic categories in 2 of 3 influential diagnostic classification systems.

Meaning

These findings suggest that diagnostic classification systems developed with ICD-9-CM data may need to be refined for use with ICD-10-CM data for disease surveillance, performance assessment, or risk-adjusted payment.

### International classification of diseases (ICD-11) and neurologic disorders: the future [^cd55411e]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

When the WHO's Topic Advisory Group for Neurology (TAG) started work on revision of the ICD-10 diagnostic codes in June 2009, the issues were daunting. The existing classification was produced a generation ago and the need to move to the digital age was becoming imperative. Appreciating modern advances in genetics and immunology, and the consequent changes in understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of the nervous system, WHO's charge to the TAG was to produce a comprehensive, up-to-date disease classification, while providing published or consensus evidence for each coding change. In addition, the task would be to focus on ways to reduce the treatment gap while considering the utility of ICD-11 when used in primary care and nonspecialist settings. The project mushroomed over the 3 years since our first meeting and continues to do so. The work was made even more difficult as the group needed to add "content models" for the major codes for the first time (i.e., providing a definition for each disorder, along with appropriate diagnostic tests and outcome). The ICD-11 is meant to be updated as new knowledge develops, rather than waiting some years for another whole-scale revision, but this process has yet to be defined.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^2c847ed5]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Classification codes — there have been no changes in ICD-10 codes that would impact the 2021 CPG update, so ICD-10 content was not updated or revised; there is a transition plan to ICD-11 codes which will include coding for primary chronic pain and secondary chronic pain conditions (eg, musculoskeletal); and changes to ICD-11 codes are likely in a future CPG update because directly coding chronic pain will noticeably impact clinical classification of low back pain (LBP).

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^5ad88265]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, we only examined the association of diagnostic category prevalence with the ICD-10-CM transition for individuals younger than 65 years who were privately insured by employer-sponsored insurance, a population mostly enrolled in relatively generous health plans. Coding patterns and discontinuities in frequencies of diagnostic categories may not generalize to individuals covered by other insurers (eg, the ACA marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). Many health care practitioners have been encouraged by their institutions to maximize the capture of patient complexity in their billing. However, our study data came from commercial plans whose payments are rarely risk adjusted for disease prevalence. Specifically, their payments do not generally rely on HHS-HCCs, reducing the explicit incentive to increase the prevalence of well-reimbursed HHS-HCC categories. Second, we did not examine changes at the ICD-10-CM transition on coding for particular conditions for specific patients or in category prevalence based on other sources of diagnoses, such as electronic medical records. Third, we used a piecewise linear model to look for changes in level and trend, but for some categories in which diagnostic category prevalence trends are not linear, our model may find changes at the transition when a nonlinear model would not.

### Spatial distribution of unscheduled hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the central area of asturias, Spain [^c1852a96]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Location of the study area. The study area comprised eleven municipalities in the central area of Asturias, an Autonomous Community of Spain

The study focused on unscheduled COPD hospital admissions coded using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), as J41–J44 (J41 – simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis; J42 – unspecified chronic bronchitis; J43 – emphysema; and J44–0ther chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) during 2016–2018. Unscheduled hospital admission is defined as any unplanned hospitalization registered in hospitals facilities, without taking in consideration emergency care that does not require hospitalization.

Data on unscheduled hospital admissions into four hospitals in Asturias — San Agustín University Hospital (Avilés), Cabueñes University Hospital (Gijón), Jove Hospital (Gijón), and Central Asturias University Hospital (Oviedo) — were obtained from the Specialised Care Activity Registry RAE-CMBD – Minimum Basic Dataset, which is regulated by legislation and provided by the Health Service of the Principality of Asturias, responsible of its management, which authorized the utilization and analysis of the database according to the Collaboration Agreement SV-PA-19-03.

Each entry corresponded to one admission event, included a personal ID, sex, date of birth, date of admission and discharge, and main diagnosis (ICD 10), and could be linked to a residential address registered in the Population and Health Resources Identification System, which was used for geographical allocation. All entries with J41–J44 ICD 10 codes were included. Information on sex and age group (< 15, 15–39, 40–64, 65–84, and ≥ 85 years) was collected. Entries with any missing variables were excluded.

CTs of municipalities obtained from the National Institute of Statistics were used as unit areas; a total of 558 CTs were included. The CT cartography applied corresponds to the 2016 data year. The total reference population was determined using the CT codes contained in the dataset of the Municipal Register of Inhabitants supplied by the Asturian Society of Economic and Industrial Studies. The CT constitutes the most homogeneous unit of population, with an average of 1,265 inhabitants in each of the 558 CTs included.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma preferred practice pattern ® [^424d245d]. Ophthalmology (2021). High credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma — ICD-10 CM classifications and coding rules include the following: open-angle glaucoma is coded as H40.10X-; primary open-angle glaucoma uses H40.111-, H40.112-, or H40.113-; low-tension glaucoma uses H40.121-, H40.122-, or H40.123-; residual stage of open-angle glaucoma uses H40.151, H40.152, or H40.153; and glaucomatous atrophy of the optic disc uses H47.231, H47.232, or H47.233. The footnote defines " = 0, stage unspecified; 1, mild stage; 2, moderate stage; 3, severe stage; 4, indeterminate stage". Additional ICD-10 CM instructions state that certain categories require a "7th character" and, if needed, "a placeholder X must be used" to ensure it is in the seventh position, that for bilateral sites "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality" and if no bilateral code exists "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned", and that laterality mapping is standardized as "Right is always 1", "Left is always 2", and "Bilateral is always 3".

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern ® [^ccf9d77a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis ICD-10 CM coding — Blepharitis, which includes entities with the following ICD-10 classifications, lists Ulcerative (H01.01-), Squamous (H01.02-), Stye (H00.01-), Meibomitis (H01.02-), Abscess of eyelid (H00.03-), and Parasitic infestation of eyelid (B89). CM = Clinical Modification used in the United States; "(-) = 1, right upper eyelid; 2, right lower eyelid; 4, left upper eyelid; 5, left lower eyelid", and when laterality is specified "Right upper eyelid is always 1", "Right lower eyelid is always 2", "Left upper eyelid is always 4", and "Left lower eyelid is always 5". "Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters" and "The 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field"; if a 7th character is required and the code is "not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters". For bilateral sites, "the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality"; if no bilateral code exists and the condition is bilateral, "separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned" and "Unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available". A starred note instructs to "Code first underlying disease, as leishmaniasis (085.0–085.9), loiasis (125.2), onchocerciasis (125.3), or pediculosis (132.0)".

### Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens [^2cb0c995]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We also analyzed the uptake of the U09.9 code itself, among sites using the code. There is a rapid increase in the use of U09.9 by sites following the code's release (Fig. 1). Usage of U09.9 post-release is compared with usage of B94.8 ("Sequelae of other specified infectious and parasitic diseases"); some sites used B94.8 at the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) initial recommendation as a placeholder code prior to U09.9's release. Once U09.9 became available, it quickly supplanted B94.8. A visualization of the U09.9 uptake timeline by site is shown in Additional file 1: Supplemental Fig. 1.

The definition of long COVID includes a wide-ranging list of symptoms and clinical features. Many of those features appear below in Fig. 2, a visualization of diagnoses that commonly co-occur with U09.9, and each other. As shown, the mix of co-occurring diagnoses as well as the clusters produced by the Louvain algorithm change when the cohort is subset into age groups. A full accounting of diagnoses co-occurring with U09.9 (i.e. within the analysis window) in at least 1% of our cohort is included as Additional file 1: Supplemental Fig. 3.

Fig. 3
Common procedures among patients with a U09.9 code. Procedures shown occur within 60 days after a patient's U09.9 diagnosis. Procedure records that simply reflect that an encounter took place (e.g. CPT 99212, "Office or other outpatient visit") are excluded. Category totals represent unique patient–procedure pairs, not necessarily unique individuals. Procedure classes associated with fewer than 20 patients or less than 1.0% of the age-stratified cohort size are not shown, per the N3C download policy. Percentages in each column are shown relative to the total n in that column

Our findings suggest that long COVID symptoms and associated functional disability may present differently depending on the patient, but commonly fall into clusters. Conditions within a single cluster are more likely to co-occur within a single patient than conditions appearing in different clusters, allowing us to roughly subtype clinical presentations of long COVID. When stratified by age, the conditions within each cluster change somewhat, though the themes remain consistent.

### Pediatric complex chronic condition system version 3 [^7e59b1dc]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Since implementation of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) in the US, thousands of new or related codes have been added to represent clinical conditions. The widely used pediatric complex chronic condition (CCC) system required a major update from version 2 (V2) to version 3 (V3) to capture the range of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

Objective

To update the CCC V3 system, creating V3, with new, missing, or retired codes; to reconceptualize the system's use of technology codes; and to compare CCC V3 with V2.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This repeated cross-sectional study examined US hospitalization data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) and the Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019, for all patients aged 0 to 18 years. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to April 1, 2024.

Exposures

The CCCs were identified in both data sources using the CCC V2 and V3 systems.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The (1) percentage of pediatric hospitalizations associated with a CCC, (2) numbers of CCC body-system categories per patient, and (3) explanatory power for hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality were compared over time for V3 vs V2.

Results

Among 7 186 019 hospitalizations within PHIS, 54.3% patients were male, the median age was 4 years (IQR, 1–11 years), and 51.2% were aged 0 to 4 years). The CCC V2 identified 2 878 476 (40.1%) patients as having any CCC compared with 2 753 412 (38.3%) identified by V3. In addition, V2 identified 100 065 (1.4%) patients with transplant status compared with 146 683 (2.0%) by V3, and V2 identified 914 835 (12.7%) as having technology codes compared with 805 585 (11.2%) by V3. The 2 systems were similar in accounting for the number of CCC body-system categories per patient and in explaining variation in hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality. For both V2 and V3, 10.0% of the variance in hospital length of stay and 12.0% of the variance in in-hospital mortality was explained by the presence of a CCC. Similar patterns were observed when analyzing the 2 999 420 Medicaid Merative MarketScan Research Databases' hospitalizations (52.3% of patients were male, the median age was 1 year [IQR, 0–12 years], and 62.0% were 0 to 4 years old), except that the percentages of identified CCCs were all lower: V2 identified 758 110 hospitalizations (25.3%) with any CCC compared with 718 100 (23.9%) identified by V3.

Conclusions and Relevance

These results suggest that, moving forward, V3 should be used to identify CCCs, and ongoing, frequent updates to V3, using a transparent, structured process, will enable V3 to accurately reflect the evolving spectrum of clinical conditions represented in the ICD-10-CM.

### Association of high-normal blood pressure defined by the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guideline with mortality in the Chinese population: a nationwide, population-based, prospective study of 3.6 million adults [^2604f6eb]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
SBP trajectory patterns during the follow-up. Abbreviations: SBP, systolic blood pressure; The participants included in this study had at least three SBP measurements. Optimal-stable: n = 20,419 (26.5%); normal-stable: n = 30,606 (38.3%); high-normal-stable: n = 23,363 (29.6%); high-normal-increasing: n = 3,742 (5.6%). Follow-up years represented the time since baseline enrollment, where 0 represented the baseline measurement

Study outcomes

All-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and non-CVD mortality were the study outcomes. The death records of all participants were collected through passive follow-up, where data links were established between the ChinaHEART cohort and the National Mortality Surveillance System and the Vital Registration of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, covering urban and rural areas in 31 provinces of mainland China. Death records in the system were reported by health care institutions in real-time and subsequently checked against local residence records and health insurance records annually.

In the National Mortality Surveillance System and the Vital Registration of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the main causes of death are coded using the 10 th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10). The CVD mortality subtypes were hemorrhagic stroke (ICD- 10: I60–I62), ischemic stroke (ICD- 10: I63), and ischemic heart disease (IHD; ICD- 10: I20–I25). The non-CVD mortality subtypes were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; ICD- 10: J41–J44) and neoplasms (ICD- 10: C00–D48).

### Optimization of the allergen classification of the international classification of diseases, 11th revision (ICD-11) [^e97a7c43]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate diagnosis of triggers or causative allergens is essential for appropriate risk assessment, providing correct advice to patients with allergy and their caregivers and personalized treatment. However, allergens have never been represented in the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

Objective

In this article, we present the process of selection of allergens to better fit the ICD, 11th Revision (ICD-11) structure and the outcomes of this process.

Methods

The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes database, containing 1444 allergens, was used as the basis for the selection process. Two independent experts were responsible for the first selection of the allergens according to specific technical criteria. The second step of the selection process was based on real-life relevance of the allergens according to the frequency of requests regarding each of them.

Results

We selected 1109 allergens (76.8%) from all 1444 present in the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes database, with considerable agreement between experts (Cohen κ = 8.6). After assessment of real-life data, 297 additional relevant allergens worldwide were selected and grouped as plants (36.4%), drugs (32.6%), animal proteins (21%), mold and other microorganisms (1.5%), occupational allergens (0.4%), and miscellaneous allergens (0.5%).

Conclusion

The stepwise approach allowed us to select the most relevant allergens in practice, which is the first step to building a classification of allergens for the WHO ICD-11. Aligned with the achievement in the construction of the pioneer section addressed to the allergic and hypersensitivity conditions in the ICD-11, the introduction of a classification for allergens can be considered timely and much needed in clinical practice.

### International classification of diseases, tenth revision diagnosis codes are overutilized in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [^17bc528a]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Retrospective studies and large databases, such as the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium, rely on International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes to identify patients with specificity. This study aimed to determine if ICD-10 codes for CP are overutilized.

Materials and Methods

Retrospective analysis was conducted for patients with ICD-10 codes K86.0 (alcohol-induced CP) and K86.1 (other CP) from February 2018 to February 2020. Data were extracted from the integrated electronic data repository. This study was approved by the institutional review board. The diagnosis of CP was defined as either being made by a gastroenterologist, proven by biopsy, or having characteristic findings on cross-sectional imaging with appropriate symptoms.

Results

Five hundred four (37%) out of the 1360 patients had no evidence of CP. When broken down by diagnosis code, 41 of 176 charts (23.3%) with K86.0 and 461 of 1184 charts (38.6%) with K86.1 had no evidence of CP. Two hundred ninety-nine of these patients had either a single episode of acute pancreatitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis, or episode of acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Of note, 81 patients had no identifiable abdominal pathology.

Conclusions

Although the OneFlorida database makes multicenter research more accessible, it does not replace labor-intensive chart review given the propensity for overdiagnosis.

### Comparing the ICD-11 chronic pain classification with ICD-10: how can the new coding system make chronic pain visible? A study in a tertiary care pain clinic setting [^8463e321]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain is a frequent reason for patients to ask for medical services. However, systematic information about the extent and impact of pain, especially in developing countries, has not been available up to now. We evaluated whether the 11th edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) can fill this gap by coding all electronic out-patient medical records of the pain clinic at Siriraj Hospital in Thailand in 2019 (8714 visits), using the ICD-10 and ICD-11 browsers referenced on the WHO websites. The 3 most frequent pain-related codes in ICD-10 were R52.2 "other chronic pain" (29%), M54.5 "low back pain" (18%), and M79.6 "pain in limb" (13%). In ICD-11, the 3 most frequent codes were MG30.31 "chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain associated with structural changes" (28%), MG30.51 "chronic peripheral neuropathic pain" (26%), and MG30.10 "chronic cancer pain" (23%). Thus, using the currently valid ICD-10 system, roughly one-third of patient encounters were coded as "other chronic pain", and the next 2 were specifying the pain region rather than any underlying cause. By contrast, ICD-11 coding of the same patients identified underlying causes (bones and joints, somatosensory nervous system, cancer, or surgery), which provide guidance towards differential patient management. In our pain clinic, most patients suffered from chronic cancer pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic secondary musculoskeletal pain, which were poorly defined or nonexistent in the current ICD-10 coding system. Compared with the ICD-10, the ICD-11 provides more detailed diagnostic categories and is more informative for clinical use, research, and resource allocation for pain-related conditions.

ICD-10-CM coding limitations and data needs — Limitations with the current strategy include a lack of EVALI-specific codes, leaving EVALI events under a broad umbrella and restricting specification of EVALI to clinical notes, which hampers broad data collection; although timely and thorough use of the U07.0 coding paradigm will help identify new EVALI cases, ICD-10-CM codes are needed to capture patient use of e-cigarettes, characterize constituents of e-liquids used (nicotine, cannabinoids, others, unknown), define use patterns/dosage, and help define the magnitude and scope of e-cigarette use across all users, independent of EVALI diagnosis.

### Reply to lindenauer: apparent increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality is likely an artifact of changes in documentation and coding [^46cb3b43]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We thank Dr. Lindenauer and colleagues for their letter in reference to our publication. The authors suggest that the increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospital-level 30-day postdischarge mortality (from here on out: 30-day mortality) found in our study during the Hospitals Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) implementation period (October 2014 to November 2017) may be associated with changes in coding practices for COPD and pneumonia discharges, specifically, the guidelines published in the fall of 2016 by the American Hospital Association (AHA) regarding COPD with acute lower respiratory infection (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision [ICD-10], code J44.0). The guidance specified that for patients hospitalized with COPD and pneumonia, the ICD-10 code J44.0 needed to be used as principal discharge diagnosis, followed by the ICD-10 code to identify pneumonia. Therefore, that hospitalization would be counted toward the COPD measure (not the pneumonia measure) for the HRRP. Further guidance by the AHA in October 2017 allowed hospitals to code pneumonia as a primary discharge diagnosis (over COPD) if clinical documentation by providers supported that the patient with COPD was hospitalized for pneumonia.

3.2. Case coding

One of the prepared cases referred to a diagnosis (Chronic peripheral neuropathic pain) that had not yet been implemented in the ICD-11 at the time of the field trial, and therefore was excluded from evaluation, leaving 13 pain diagnoses for 11 cases to be rated per participant. Taken together, the participants rated 1342 cases, each case was rated by between 67% (119/177) and 75% (132/177) of participants. Participants assigned the correct code for the pain diagnosis in 83.9% of cases, and in 98.4% of cases, participants reported having no difficulty in assigning the diagnosis (Table 2). The aggregated clinical utility (the mean for the individual facets) was high across all cases (4.3 ± 0.90) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful) and all single cases (Table 2).

Text box 1.
Morbidity coding rules

Morbidity rule 1 (MB1): Several conditions recorded as the "main condition". Select the "main condition" for which the patient received care. Extension codes may be used to indicate different types of main condition (eg, reason for admission or main resource condition). In cases where the main condition cannot be determined based on documentation, select the condition that is mentioned first.
Morbidity rule 2 (MB2): Condition recorded as "main condition" is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition. If a symptom or sign (ICD-11 chapter 21) or a problem (ICD-11 chapter 24) is recorded as the "main condition", and this is obviously a sign, symptom, or problem of a diagnosed condition coded elsewhere, and care was given to the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the "main condition".
Morbidity rule 3 (MB3): Signs and symptoms. When a symptom or sign is documented as the "main condition", and it is documented that it could be caused by either one condition or another, select the symptom or sign as "main condition".

### Ethnic differences in smoking intensity and COPD risk: an observational study in primary care [^d4e2a852]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Variables

Demographic data included age, sex and socioeconomic deprivation. Deprivation was measured at patient level by the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD-10) score, and mapped to lower super-output area using postcode. IMD score is based on national census and local authority data, and reflects deprivation specific to geographical areas.

Ethnicity was self-reported and recorded by practices according to UK 2001 Census categories. We grouped together the small subgroups of Chinese, mixed, and other. We used 11 ethnic groupings as follows: white British; white Irish; other white; black Caribbean; black African; other black; Indian; Pakistani; Bangladeshi; other Asian; Chinese/mixed/other; unknown/not stated. Subgroups were reported in order to reveal significant differences within the same ethnic group if they were large enough to allow comparative analysis.

Clinical variables included diagnostic Read codes for asthma and for COPD. All patients with a GP-recorded diagnosis of COPD (including emphysema, chronic bronchitis and other ICD-ten diagnostic codes J41–J44.9 consistent with COPD) were included. This represented symptomatic disease and differs from true prevalence. A spirometry-confirmed COPD subgroup was identified. It comprised patients with a GP-recorded COPD diagnosis and confirmation of obstructive spirometry, that is, ratio of FEV₁/FVC < 0.7, as defined by GOLD. Where necessary the FEV₁/FVC ratio was calculated from the latest recorded FEV₁ and FVC values.

Smoking status was assigned as never smoker, current smoker, ex-smoker or unknown. Where there were conflicting older smoking codes in the same patient, the most appropriate code was used. For example, most recent code "never smoked tobacco" or "current non-smoker" with any previous positive smoking history became "ex-smoker". Any patients with a CPD value but no smoking status recorded were re-classified as "current smoker". The most recent value for CPD was extracted, where recorded. We considered using maximum and mean patient values for CPD, but found no significant difference between them. Because the CPD variable had a multimodal distribution, patients were assigned a smoking intensity category to enable statistical analysis. Smoking intensity categories were: never smoker; light smoker (0–9 CPD); moderate smoker (10–19 CPD); heavy smoker (20 + CPD). Where there were multiple values for a variable, the most recent was used, unless specified otherwise.

### The IASP classification of chronic pain for ICD-11: chronic neuropathic pain [^677b6f30]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

The upcoming 11th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) of the World Health Organization (WHO) offers a unique opportunity to improve the representation of painful disorders. For this purpose, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has convened an interdisciplinary task force of pain specialists. Here, we present the case for a reclassification of nervous system lesions or diseases associated with persistent or recurrent pain for ≥ 3 months. The new classification lists the most common conditions of peripheral neuropathic pain: trigeminal neuralgia, peripheral nerve injury, painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and painful radiculopathy. Conditions of central neuropathic pain include pain caused by spinal cord or brain injury, poststroke pain, and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. Diseases not explicitly mentioned in the classification are captured in residual categories of ICD-11. Conditions of chronic neuropathic pain are either insufficiently defined or missing in the current version of the ICD, despite their prevalence and clinical importance. We provide the short definitions of diagnostic entities for which we submitted more detailed content models to the WHO. Definitions and content models were established in collaboration with the Classification Committee of the IASP's Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG). Up to 10% of the general population experience neuropathic pain. The majority of these patients do not receive satisfactory relief with existing treatments. A precise classification of chronic neuropathic pain in ICD-11 is necessary to document this public health need and the therapeutic challenges related to chronic neuropathic pain.

### Identifying older adults with serious illness: transitioning from ICD-9 to ICD-10 [^0957438a]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Identifying the seriously ill population is integral to improving the value of health care. Efforts to identify this population using existing data are anchored to a list of severe medical conditions (SMCs) using diagnostic codes. Published approaches have used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, which has since been replaced by ICD-10.

Objectives

We translated SMCs from ICD-9 to ICD-10 using a refined code list. We aimed to test the hypothesis that people identified by ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes would have similar Medicare costs, health care utilization, and mortality.

Methods

Using data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study linked to Medicare claims, we compared samples from periods using ICD-9 (2014) and ICD-10 (2016). We included participants with six-month fee-for-service Medicare data before their interview date who had an SMC identified within that period. We compared the groups' demographic, functional, and medical characteristics and followed up them for six months to compare outcomes.

Results

Among subjects in the 2016 (ICD-10) sample, 19.9% were hospitalized, 24.6% used the emergency department, 7.2% died, and average Medicare spending totaled $9902.04 over six months of follow-up. We observed no significant differences between the 2014 and 2016 samples (P > 0.05); both samples represent 18% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.

Conclusion

Identifying the seriously ill population using currently available data requires using ICD-10 to define SMCs. Routine measurement of function, quality of life, and caregiver strain will further enhance the identification process and efficiently target palliative care services and appropriate quality measures.

### Exacerbations and healthcare resource utilization among COPD patients in a Swedish registry-based nation-wide study [^6ba9e7c5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

In Sweden, individual-level data for all residents of the country can be linked across multiple national databases. As the aim of this study was to describe the total Swedish COPD population which had attended secondary in-patient or out–patient care with respect to medication, comorbidities, and COPD burden, data from the Centre for Epidemiology at the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare were utilized. Patients with COPD only attending primary care were not included in this study. Briefly, the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (filled prescriptions), the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, the Swedish Hospital Out-Patient Register, the Swedish Death Register and the Swedish Cancer Register were used for this study. These national databases hold data on all inhabitants in Sweden and thus cover the complete population of 9.7 million inhabitants. Data from the different registers were linked by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare using individual patient identification (ID) and patient IDs were then pseudonymised. Ethical approval was granted by the ethics committee in Stockholm, Sweden (diary number: 2013/1412–31/2).

Living patients with a diagnosis of COPD (ICD-10 code J44) or chronic bronchitis (CB; ICD-10 code J41, J42) and aged ≥ 40 years on 1.7.2009 were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Swedish Hospital Out-Patient Register. Patients were followed from baseline (1.7.2009) for up to 1 year until 1.7.2010 or death.

Baseline medical conditions were defined based on ICD-10 diagnosis codes from in-patient hospitalizations, from 1.1.1998, and out-patient secondary care visits, from 1.1.2001. Diagnosis codes for both the primary cause and all secondary causes were utilized. Use of medication at baseline was evaluated based on specific drug purchases within the last year and within the last four months prior to baseline. This four-month period was used as a proxy for ongoing drug exposure. In Sweden, the maximum length of a reimbursed medication purchase is three months. For prior use of healthcare, the numbers of all-cause hospitalizations, secondary care out-patient visits, and hospitalizations due to respiratory diseases within one year prior to baseline were evaluated. Case-specific hospitalizations were evaluated based on the primary diagnosis only. All baseline covariates were evaluated separately for females, males, and all patients.

### Development of a customised programme to standardise comorbidity diagnosis codes in a large-scale database [^7b265eb9]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

On 1 October 2015, the department of Health and Human Services updated the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system by mandating the adoption of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in electronic medical records. Serving as the new standard for naming and categorizing patient diagnoses, the ICD-10 system contains over five times more codes than ICD-9, posing a challenge for analysing longitudinal databases spanning both systems. Prior solutions have included the use of alternate coding systems, which are updated each time a new ICD system is released. Current literature is aimed at the accuracy and scope of these systems, how they update with new ICD releases, and how systems are similar or different. These studies fail to address how to implement such a system on a large-scale database, where manual reference and cell-by-cell translation is infeasible. We sought to develop a programme that quickly and accurately standardises a dataset to one diagnostic coding system.

### Dust storms and emergency department visits in 3 southwestern States using NWS storm reports [^991611b8]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Emergency Department Visits

Patient-specific ED visit records were obtained from the 3 state health departments, constituting complete capture during each state's study years. However, only zip codes overlapping NWS WFZs in which at least 1 dust storm was reported during the study period were included in the study. Many of these zip codes, especially those in Utah, were in rural areas and thus contributed few ED visits.

ED visit records included the date of visit, primary and secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses, patient demographics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity), and zip code of residence. Race and ethnicity data were taken from state health department administrative databases, where this information was taken from hospital billing record data. Categories varied but included American Indian or Native Alaskan, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, and multiracial; numbers are reported only for Black and White participants in the demographic table because other categories were small and categories were not consistent across state or time. Race and ethnicity are reported to provide a demographic description of the study population. The health outcomes analyzed were chosen to reflect conditions previously found to be associated with or thought to be exacerbated by dust exposure, including respiratory conditions (asthma [ICD-9: 493; ICD-10: J45], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD; ICD-9: 491, 492, and 496; ICD-10: J41-J44], and culture-negative pneumonia [ICD-9: 485–486; ICD-10: J18]), cardiovascular conditions (congestive heart failure [ICD-9: 428; ICD-10: I42, I50-I51], ischemic heart disease [ICD-9: 410–414; ICD-10: I20-I25], and cerebrovascular disease [ICD-9: 430–434, 436–438; ICD-10: I60-I69]), and motor vehicle accidents (ICD-9: E810-E819; ICD-10: V87-V89). Outcomes were defined based on primary ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis code, except for motor vehicle accidents, which were defined based on secondary diagnosis codes given that no primary codes were observed for this outcome.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^439852f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic codes are widely used within health care in the US for reimbursement, quality assessment, public health reporting, calculating risk-adjusted payments, and studying clinical outcomes. In October 2015, the US switched its diagnostic coding system from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to the more detailed International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), expanding the number of available codes nearly 5-fold. Previous studies have noted discontinuities in specific disease or population subgroups. This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study sought to quantify the magnitude of change in prevalence in all diagnostic categories for 3 widely used diagnostic classification systems and to explore potential reasons for these changes through selected clinical review.

### Patterns and determinants of COPD-related healthcare utilization by severity of airway obstruction in Korea [^91b3d70a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Study population

Data for this study were obtained from KNHANES IV, in which a stratified, multi-stage, clustered probability design was used to select a representative sample of non-institutionalized civilians from among the Korean population. KNHANES IV data included information on demographics, smoking status, household income, education, residential area, self-reported physician diagnoses (i.e. COPD, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, osteoporosis, depression, and anemia), and PFTs. However, we inevitably included self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma in our study population because it is not possible to exclude asthma patients using self-reported physician diagnosis criteria. We describe the percentage of asthma patients in our study in Table 1. Spirometry was performed by specially trained technicians according to the 2005 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society recommendations. A total of 12,151 individuals from the KNHANES IV data were older than 40 years of age; however, only 57.1% of these individuals (n = 6,934) underwent complete PFTs. Informed consent was obtained from 96.1% (n = 6,663) of the individuals. Their personal information was successfully combined with records from the computerized Korean NHI claims database between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2010. The entire population of South Korea has been provided with health coverage since 1989 by the Korean National Health Insurance System, which has managed a computerized database for all medical facilities in South Korea since 1998. The following codes from the Korean version of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) were used to identify COPD-related healthcare use: simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis (J41), simple chronic bronchitis (J410), mucopurulent chronic bronchitis (J411), mixed simple and mucopurulent chronic bronchitis (J418), unspecified chronic bronchitis (J42), emphysema (J43), MacLeod syndrome (J430), panlobular emphysema (J431), centrilobular emphysema (J432), other emphysema (J438), emphysema, unspecified (J439), other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (J44), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection (J440), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, unspecified (J441), other specified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (J448), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unspecified (J449). Information on COPD-related healthcare use from the NHI claims database contained the frequency of healthcare visits, the number of PFTs performed, and any prescribed medications. A total of 897 (13.4%) of 6,663 eligible individuals demonstrated an obstructive airflow pattern and were included in the final data analysis. Only 244 (27.2%) of these 897 patients used the healthcare system, and they were assessed based on disease severity (Figure 1). The study protocol was approved by the Public Institutional Review Board (PIRB 11-025-2).

### Trends in gastroenteritis-associated mortality in the United States, 1985–2005: variations by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes [^76811ed6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Data

We conducted a population-based, descriptive study of data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Multiple Cause of Death Mortality database for the years 1985–2005. We utilized individual level data for which we obtained a data use agreement from NCHS. The data use agreement was only for the period 1985–2005 therefore, we were not able to consider out years. Each entry includes demographic and residence information for the decedent as well as the underlying cause of death and up to 20 contributing conditions which are listed on the death certificate. The cause of death and conditions are coded using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. We abstracted all deaths for which the underlying cause or any contributing cause of death included gastrointestinal infection. Deaths prior to 1999 were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes. We abstracted records with the following codes listed for underlying cause or a contributing cause of death: 001–009, 041, 047, 070, 074, 079, 127, and 558. From 1999–2005, deaths were coded using the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. We selected the records with the following gastrointestinal conditions listed: A00.0–09, A08, A87, B15, B08.4, B34.1, B77-79, B81-82, B95-97, and K52.

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^e325508b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Data and Study Sample

We used the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, including individuals ages 0 to 64 years enrolled in noncapitated commercial insurance plans with both medical and pharmacy benefits. The MarketScan database contains deidentified health care claims information from US employers, health plans, and hospitals. Data on all enrollment records and inpatient, outpatient, ancillary, and drug claims are collated and linked to individuals. The age and sex distribution of the eligible population varied little over the 96 months studied. Boston University's institutional review board exempted this study from review and informed consent owing to the use of deidentified data. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Outcome

Our primary outcome was the monthly rate of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 enrollees. We used claim dates of service, health care practitioner type, and inpatient and outpatient procedure codes to identify claims that are allowed to contribute diagnostic codes, mimicking Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) filters used in risk adjustment, which only consider diagnoses from an acceptable health care practitioner claim type: hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, or professional. Monthly prevalence rates were examined for changes in reported diagnostic category prevalence at and following the October 2015 ICD-10-CM transition.

Diagnostic Classification Systems

There were 14 567 allowable ICD-9-CM codes in 2015 vs 71 486 allowable ICD-10-CM codes in 2017 to describe patient medical conditions. To reduce complexity, predictive models and disease tracking systems rely on classification systems (ie, groupers) to collapse these codes into a smaller number of broadly homogeneous clinical categories. We explored 3 commonly used classification systems.

The World Health Organization (WHO) maps codes into chapters, which are commonly used for epidemiology and surveillance, based on their first 3 alphanumeric characters. The WHO's ICD-9-CM mapping had 19 chapters, which expanded to 21 chapters with the transition to ICD-10-CM by separating previously grouped eye, ear, and neurological disorders into distinct chapters. To facilitate cross-year comparisons, we maintained the 19-chapter structure.

### How well do principal diagnosis classifications predict disability 12 months postinjury? [^b3200ea6]. Injury Prevention (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The application of disability weights by nature of injury is central to the calculation of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Such weights should represent injury diagnosis groups that demonstrate homogeneity in disability outcomes. Existing classifications have not used empirical data in their development to inform groups that are homogeneous for disability outcomes, limiting the capacity to make informed recommendations for best practice in measuring injury burden.

Methods

The Validating and Improving injury Burden Estimates (Injury-VIBES) Study includes pooled data from over 30000 injured participants recruited to six cohort studies. The International Classification of Disease 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes were mapped to existing injury burden study groupings and prediction models were developed to measure the capacity of the injury groupings and ICD-10 diagnoses to predict disability outcomes at 12 months. Models were adjusted for age, gender and data source and investigated for discrimination using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration using Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and calibration curves.

Results

Discrimination and calibration of models varied depending on the outcome measured. Models using full four-character ICD-10 diagnosis codes, rather than groupings of codes, demonstrated the highest discrimination ranging from an AUC (95% CI) of 0.627 (0.618 to 0.635) for the pain or discomfort item of the EQ-5D to 0.847 (0.841 to 0.853) for the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale independent living outcome. However, gain over other groupings was marginal.

Conclusions

Prediction performance was best for measures of function such as independent living, mobility and self-care. The classifications were poorer predictors of anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort. There was no clearly superior classification.

### Time-ordered comorbidity correlations identify patients at risk of mis-and overdiagnosis [^3b9f35cc]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Identifying patients with COPD

In this retrospective population-based study, we used the DNPR, which covers all hospital encounters in Denmark including 6.9 million individuals in the 1994–2015 period. All diagnoses in the DNPR are coded in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) terminology, which has a hierarchical structure of disease classification. The Danish version of ICD-10 differs slightly from the standard international version regarding the COPD diagnosis that was used to exemplify the approach developed. The international version of the ICD-10 code "J44" is "Other Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease", whereas it in the Danish version is "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease". Our definition of COPD patients is based on the definition from the Danish Register of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (DrCOPD), though we broaden the definition and define COPD patients as any patient being diagnosed with "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease" (ICD-10: J44) either as primary or secondary diagnosis during the 21-year period the DNPR data covers. We include all COPD patients in the analysis to capture all the different COPD patterns.

### Interstitial lung disease and risk of lung cancer [^59c84bd1]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Ascertainment of Outcome

Since 1958, newly diagnosed cancers have been required to be reported to the Swedish Cancer Register, ensuring nationwide comprehensive data collection on cancer incidence. The main outcome of our study was overall lung cancer, identified using ICD-7 code 1621 in the Swedish Cancer Register. We subsequently identified histological subtypes of lung cancer using histopathological diagnoses classified according to a 3-digit coding system within the Swedish Cancer Register. For more detailed histological classification, we defined the subtypes based on the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition. Detailed code information is provided in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

Covariates

We obtained data on sex and age from the Total Population Register. As a proxy for socioeconomic status, we used information on the highest educational level attained (0–9, 10–12, or > 12 years or missing), which was obtained from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies. Diagnoses of tobacco use (ICD-8 code 989.90; ICD-9 code 305B; or ICD-10 codes F17, T65.2, Z71.6, Z72.0, and Z864A) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ICD-7 code 502; ICD-8 codes 491 and 492; ICD-9 codes 491 and 492; or ICD-10 codes J41 to J44), retrieved from the National Patient Register, were used as a proxy for smoking history. These diagnoses were combined into a single variable termed smoking-related diseases.

Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed from February 15, 2024, to January 30, 2025. We calculated the crude incidence rate (IR) of lung cancer among individuals with (exposed) and without (unexposed) a diagnosis of ILD, dividing the number of incident cancer cases by the accumulated person-years. Exposure status was treated as a time-varying variable. Individuals with a diagnosis of ILD before cohort entry contributed all follow-up time to the exposed group, while those diagnosed during follow-up contributed time to the unexposed group before the first diagnosis and to the exposed group after the first diagnosis. If an individual received no ILD diagnosis, they contributed all person-time to the unexposed group. To alleviate concerns about surveillance bias or reverse causation, the first year of follow-up and incident outcomes were excluded from the exposed group and included in the unexposed group.

### Breathing (and coding?) a bit easier: changes to international classification of disease coding for pulmonary hypertension [^66f72f62]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system is broadly used by health-care providers, hospitals, health-care payers, and governments to track health trends and statistics at the global, national, and local levels and to provide a reimbursement framework for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The current iteration of the ICD system, the ICD, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), was implemented in 2015. Although many changes to the prior ICD, Ninth Revision system were included in the ICD-10 system, the newer revision failed to adequately reflect advances in the clinical classification of certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). Recently, a proposal to modify the ICD-10 codes for PH was considered and ultimately adopted for inclusion as an update to the ICD-10 coding system. Although these revisions better reflect the current clinical classification of PH, in the future, further changes should be considered to improve the accuracy and ease of coding for all forms of PH.

Retinal vein occlusion ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM codes — International Classification of Diseases (ICD) classifications include: central retinal vein occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.35; ICD-10 CM H34.811-, H34.812-, H34.813-; venous tributary (branch) occlusion — ICD-9 CM 362.36; ICD-10 CM H34.831-, H34.832-, H34.833-; venous engorgement — ICD-9 CM 362.37; ICD-10 CM H34.821-, H34.822-, H34.823-. For ICD-10 CM laterality, the guidance states: "For bilateral sites, the final character of the codes in the ICD-10 CM indicates laterality. If no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned. Unspecified codes should be used only when there is no other code option available". When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, "Right is always 1 Left is always 2 Bilateral is always 3".

### Diagnostic category prevalence in 3 classification systems across the transition to the international classification of diseases, tenth revision, clinical modification [^2079c164]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

On October 1, 2015, the US transitioned to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for recording diagnoses, symptoms, and procedures. It is unknown whether this transition was associated with changes in diagnostic category prevalence based on diagnosis classification systems commonly used for payment and quality reporting.

Objective

To assess changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study examined level and trend changes in diagnostic category prevalence associated with the ICD-10-CM transition and clinically reviewed a subset of diagnostic categories with changes of 20% or more. Data included insurance claim diagnoses from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2017, for more than 18 million people aged 0 to 64 years with private insurance. Diagnoses were mapped using 3 common diagnostic classification systems: World Health Organization (WHO) disease chapters, Department of Health and Human Services Hierarchical Condition Categories (HHS-HCCs), and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Clinical Classification System (AHRQ-CCS). Data were analyzed from December 1, 2018, to January 21, 2020.

Exposures

US implementation of ICD-10-CM.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Monthly rates of individuals with at least 1 diagnosis in a diagnostic classification category per 10 000 eligible members.

Results

The analytic sample contained information on 2.1 billion enrollee person-months with 3.4 billion clinically assigned diagnoses; the mean (range) monthly sample size was 22.1 (18.4 to 27.1) million individuals. While diagnostic category prevalence changed minimally for WHO disease chapters, the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with level changes of 20% or more among 20 of 127 HHS-HCCs (15.7%) and 46 of 282 AHRQ-CCS categories (16.3%) and with trend changes of 20% or more among 12 of 127 of HHS-HCCs (9.4%) and 27 of 282 of AHRQ-CCS categories (9.6%). For HHS-HCCs, monthly rates of individuals with any acute myocardial infarction diagnosis increased 131.5% (95% CI, 124.1% to 138.8%), primarily because HHS added non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction diagnoses to this category. The HHS-HCC for diabetes with chronic complications increased by 92.4% (95% CI, 84.2% to 100.5%), primarily from including new diabetes-related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia codes, and the rate for completed pregnancy with complications decreased by 54.5% (95% CI, -58.7% to -50.2%) partly due to removing vaginal birth after cesarean delivery as a complication.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ICD-10-CM transition was associated with large prevalence changes for many diagnostic categories. Diagnostic classification systems developed using ICD-9-CM may need to be refined using ICD-10-CM data to avoid unintended consequences for disease surveillance, performance assessment, and risk-adjusted payments.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ICD-9 CM/ICD-10 CM coding — Macular degeneration, dry corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.51 and to ICD-10 CM Nonexudative AMD H35.31-; macular degeneration, wet corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.52 and to ICD-10 CM Exudative AMD H35.32-; macular drusen corresponds to ICD-9 CM 362.57 and to ICD-10 CM Drusen (degenerative) of macula H35.36-. AMD does not require laterality indicators. Certain ICD-10 CM categories have applicable 7th characters, the 7th character must always be the 7th character in the data field, and if a code that requires a 7th character is not 6 characters, a placeholder X must be used to fill in the empty characters. For bilateral sites, the final character of ICD-10 CM codes indicates laterality; if no bilateral code is provided and the condition is bilateral, separate codes for both the left and right side should be assigned, and unspecified codes should only be used when there is no other code option available. When the diagnosis code specifies laterality, right is always 1, left is always 2, and bilateral is always 3.

### 11th revision of the international classification of diseases chronic primary pain diagnoses in children and adolescents: representation of pediatric patients in the new classification system [^ccf07b1d]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic pain is common among children and adolescents; however, the diagnoses in the newly developed 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) chronic pain chapter are based on adult criteria, overlooking pediatric neurodevelopmental differences. The chronic pain diagnoses have demonstrated good clinical applicability in adults, but to date, no field study has examined these diagnoses to the most specific diagnostic level in a pediatric sample. The current study aimed to explore pediatric representation within the ICD-11, with focus on chronic primary pain. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) at a specialized pediatric pain center documented the symptoms of and assigned both ICD-10 and ICD-11 diagnoses to N = 402 patients. Using criteria-based computer algorithms, specific ICD-11 pain diagnoses were allocated for each documented pain location, with residual diagnoses (ie, "unspecified") assigned if criteria were not (fully) met. Within the ICD-11, the algorithms assigned specific pain diagnoses to most patients (73.6%). In ICD-10, HCPs could not specify a diagnosis for 5.2% of patients; the ICD-11 algorithm allocated a residual chronic primary pain diagnosis in 51.2%. Residual categories were especially prevalent among younger children, boys, patients with headaches, and those with lower pain severity. Overall, clinical utility of the ICD-11 was high, although less effective for chronic back pain and headache diagnoses. The latter also exhibited the lowest agreement between HCPs and algorithm. The current study underscores the need for evidence-based improvements to the ICD-11 diagnostic criteria in pediatrics. Developing pediatric coding notes could improve the visibility of patients internationally and improve the likelihood of receiving reimbursement for necessary treatments through accurate coding.

### Detecting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and risk factors in health databases: accuracy and limitations of the ICD-10-AM [^1fd75ae6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ICD-10-AM codes

In the ICD-10-AM, two codes may be used to record NAFLD/NASH: K75.8 'Other specified inflammatory liver diseases (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)' and K76.0 'Fatty (change of) liver, not elsewhere classified (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)'. NAFLD/NASH cirrhosis may also attract code K74.6 'Other and unspecified cirrhosis of liver'. Obesity may be represented by ICD-10-AM codes under the E66 code block or by the chronic condition supplementary code U78.1. T2DM codes are contained in the E11 code block. Codes for other causes of CLD are outlined in table 1.

Table 1
ICD-10-AM codes for aetiologies of chronic liver disease

All ICD-10-AM codes were obtained from the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patient Data Collection registry (QHAPDC) for every hospital encounter within the study cohort during a minimum 12-month follow-up period. For the current study, one encounter was randomly selected for each patient to be included in the audit sample. In a subset of patients who had ≥ 1 encounter with and ≥ 1 encounter without code K74.6, a second encounter was selected (one encounter containing code K74.6 and one encounter that did not contain code K74.6) to ensure the sample contained a representative number of patients with possible NAFLD.

In Australia, assignment of ICD-10-AM diagnosis codes is impacted by the Australian Coding Standards, which stipulate the condition must be either the chief reason for admission or required commencement, alteration or adjustment of therapeutic treatment, diagnostic procedures or increased clinical care and/or monitoring during the encounter. T2DM and HCV are exceptions to this assignment process, as these conditions are always coded when documented. In addition, a supplementary 'U' coding capability was introduced on 1 July 2015, to capture conditions (such as obesity) that contribute to a patient's health status during the admission, but do not otherwise meet the criteria for coding. The index pathway used by coders for coding of cirrhosis, CLD aetiology, obesity and T2DM remained consistent during the audited time period.

### Pre-eclampsia and risk of later kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^5e9bf914]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The acute renal dysfunction diagnoses included in ICD-8 and ICD-10 changed very little over the study period. However, as with pre-eclampsia, kidney disease paradigms have evolved. In particular, the concept of acute kidney injury has emerged in the past 10–15 years, and KDIGO published guidelines for staging acute kidney injury in 2012. Acute kidney injury and its staging are not yet implemented in the ICD system; of particular note, the early stages of acute kidney injury have no direct equivalent in ICD-10 (the version currently used in Denmark). Consequently, our use of the ICD system will have resulted in an overall underestimation of the occurrence of acute renal dysfunction as defined by the KDIGO system. This underestimation will have been most pronounced for early stages of acute kidney injury, about which little can be inferred from our findings. By contrast, any underestimation of the rates of severe, clinically important acute renal dysfunction is likely to have been negligible, as these conditions are diagnosed and treated in the hospital setting and captured by ICD codes.

Changing definitions and diagnostics for chronic kidney disease have mostly affected our ability to sub-classify the condition. Whereas chronic kidney disease was previously classified clinically as mild, moderate, or severe, it is now staged from 1 to 5. However, the overall definition of chronic kidney disease covered approximately the same group of patients throughout the study period, so changes to definitions and diagnostic criteria are not likely to have had a large effect on our findings.

Pre-eclampsia is strongly associated with later cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes, all of which are known risk factors for chronic kidney disease and could therefore be suspected of mediating the observed associations. However, our results indicated that comorbid conditions, cardiovascular disease and hypertension in particular, could only partially explain the observed associations, suggesting that at least part of the link between pre-eclampsia and chronic kidney disease might arise from common predisposing factors such as increased susceptibility to vascular endothelial dysfunction.

### Treatment patterns in US patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement [^ac4d333c]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and patient population

This retrospective analysis identified patients hospitalized with COVID‐19‐related pulmonary involvement using data from the IBM Explorys database from December 1, 2019, through August 27, 2020. The Explorys database, a convenience sample of health systems containing data on approximately 70 million patients (since 2000), comprises data from approximately 400 hospitals and 400 000 providers in 39 large US health systems, including electronic health record (EHR) data, outgoing billing, and adjudicated claims from commercial and public payers. Most patients in the database are from the Midwest (39%) and South (33%), followed by the West (18%) and Northeast (5%). Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was not required because study data were deidentified and fully compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Variables were measured using International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD‐9‐CM and/or ICD‐10‐CM) diagnosis codes, and additional EHR terminology and drug coding systems, including Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, and National Drug Codes. Hospitalized patients with a diagnosis code for COVID‐19 or other coronavirus and a diagnosis code for at least 1 of 6 conditions representing pulmonary involvement, including pneumonia (J12.89), acute bronchitis (J20.8), bronchitis not otherwise specified (J40), lower respiratory infection (J22), associated with a respiratory infection not otherwise specified (J98.8), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (J80), based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention coding guidelinesfor patients with COVID‐19, were included (Table S1). If a patient had multiple hospitalizations for COVID‐19 with pulmonary involvement, only the first hospitalization was analyzed.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^558158a2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Approximately 375,000 deaths during 2020 were attributed to COVID-19 on death certificates reported to CDC (1). Concerns have been raised that some deaths are being improperly attributed to COVID-19 (2). Analysis of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnoses on official death certificates might provide an expedient and efficient method to demonstrate whether reported COVID-19 deaths are being overestimated. CDC assessed documentation of diagnoses co-occurring with an ICD-10 code for COVID-19 (U07.1) on U.S. death certificates from 2020 that had been reported to CDC as of February 22, 2021. Among 378,048 death certificates listing U07.1, a total of 357,133 (94.5%) had at least one other ICD-10 code; 20,915 (5.5%) had only U07.1. Overall, 97.3% of 357,133 death certificates with at least one other diagnosis (91.9% of all 378,048 death certificates) were noted to have a co-occurring diagnosis that was a plausible chain-of-event condition (e.g., pneumonia or respiratory failure), a significant contributing condition (e.g., hypertension or diabetes), or both. Overall, 70%-80% of death certificates had both a chain-of-event condition and a significant contributing condition or a chain-of-event condition only; this was noted for adults aged 18–84 years, both males and females, persons of all races and ethnicities, those who died in inpatient and outpatient or emergency department settings, and those whose manner of death was listed as natural. These findings support the accuracy of COVID-19 mortality surveillance in the United States using official death certificates. High-quality documentation of co-occurring diagnoses on the death certificate is essential for a comprehensive and authoritative public record. Continued messaging and training (3) for professionals who complete death certificates remains important as the pandemic progresses. Accurate mortality surveillance is critical for understanding the impact of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and of COVID-19 vaccination and for guiding public health action.

### Updating and validating the rheumatic disease comorbidity index to incorporate ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes [^b80625ec]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we aimed to translate the ICD-9-CM codes defined for the RDCI to ICD-10-CM and validate its predictive ability for the key long-term rheumatic disease outcomes of mortality and functional status. We created a set of ICD-10-CM codes that generated comparable RDCI scores and individual comorbidity prevalence estimates to those derived from ICD-9-CM codes within a large, multicenter RA registry, then tested the predictive ability of the RDCI score using the ICD-10-CM code set. We found the ICD-10-CM code set was able to predict mortality and functional status as well as the ICD-9-CM codes. With the updated codes (Table 1), the RDCI can continue to be used in rheumatic disease outcomes research utilizing ICD-10-CM era data.

After assembling an ICD-10-CM code set using a cross walk and clinical expertise, we calculated RDCI scores for RA cohorts spanning ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM time periods. RDCI scores were comparable between cohorts (mean scores of 2.93 vs. 2.92) and, among individuals observed during both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras, RDCI scores had substantial agreement (K = 0.71). Similarly, when we assessed the prevalence of individual comorbidities between coding systems, the absolute differences were quite small (all < 6%). While evaluating individuals in both cohorts, we discovered that agreement between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM varied across individual conditions. Individual conditions with greater chronicity had stronger agreement than acute conditions. For example, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, other cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and depression (chronic conditions) all had at least substantial agreement (K > 0.60). In contrast, ulcer or GI problem and fracture of the spine, hip, or leg (acute conditions) had fair and slight agreement (K = 0.27, K = 0.13). We postulate the superior agreement for the more chronic conditions is primarily the result of these conditions being continually addressed and recorded during clinical encounters. However, it is also possible that medical care for acute conditions may have occurred solely outside the VA system. Finally, the variability in agreement may be related to differences in the prevalence of these conditions, with those having the lowest prevalence also having poorer agreement.

PCC Cohort

The PCC cohort was drawn from an initial pool of 249 013 individuals 18 years and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Patients were included if they had a medical claim with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code for COVID-19 (U071, B342, B9721, B9729, J1281) or a laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 test. The first observed diagnosis or positive test date was set as the index date. Individuals were required to have 6 months of continuous enrollment prior to the index date and to have survived at least 30 days following their diagnosis date. An index month was set by adding 30 days to the COVID-19 diagnosis date. Continuous enrollment was not required beyond the initial 30 days, as mortality was included as an outcome measure. Characteristics of the full COVID-19 cohort vs PCC cohort are summarized in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

A claims-based definition for PCC was constructed based on symptoms drawn from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publications and other peer-reviewed publications. Individuals in the PCC cohort received 3 or more diagnoses for COVID-19 or COVID-19 symptoms across more than 1 visit during weeks 5 to 12 after their index date, inclusive of telehealth visits (see eTable 2 in Supplement 1 for ICD-10 codes used in the definition). In 2021, several ICD-10 codes were issued to capture PCC (M35.81, U09.9); however, they were not available during the time period used for defining the cohort. From the initial pool of individuals confirmed positive for COVID-19, 14 086 (6.8%) were identified as having PCC and meeting cohort inclusion criteria (Figure 1).

### The complexity and challenges of the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification to international classification of diseases, 10th revision, clinical modification transition in EDs [^9b81e000]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Beginning October 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services will require medical providers to use the vastly expanded International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) system. Despite wide availability of information and mapping tools for the next generation of the ICD classification system, some of the challenges associated with transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM are not well understood. To quantify the challenges faced by emergency physicians, we analyzed a subset of a 2010 Illinois Medicaid database of emergency department ICD-9-CM codes, seeking to determine the accuracy of existing mapping tools in order to better prepare emergency physicians for the change to the expanded ICD-10-CM system. We found that 27% of 1830 codes represented convoluted multidirectional mappings. We then analyzed the convoluted transitions and found that 8% of total visit encounters (23% of the convoluted transitions) were clinically incorrect. The ambiguity and inaccuracy of these mappings may impact the workflow associated with the translation process and affect the potential mapping between ICD codes and Current Procedural Codes, which determine physician reimbursement.

ICD-10 Classification Process

We extracted all ICD-10 codes associated with the SARS-CoV-2 testing visit for each patient by matching visit numbers. Codes specific for the outcomes (R50* for fever, R05* for cough, and R06.0* for dyspnea) were selected on the basis of the specifications suggested by the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. The asterisk (*) denotes that any code starting with the specified alphanumeric sequence would be included (ie, R06.03 is included for cough). Using this approach, the following codes were present in our data: R50.9, R50.81, R05, R06.02, R06.00, R06.03, and R06.09. Patients with at least 1 code in a given category were classified as having the symptom according to ICD-10 code.

### Mediators and adverse effects of child poverty in the United States [^1107af4b]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Tracking socioeconomic risk in health care settings using ICD-10-CM — compared with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) provides a more robust classification system that enables clinicians to track socioeconomic factors in patient care that may be related to families' annual income level; by using the ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians can submit supplemental codes that include not only diagnosis, such as acute asthma exacerbation, but additional socioeconomic factors related to the asthma exacerbation and treatment, such as childhood poverty or the family's inability to afford the recommended medical regimen; it will be important to capture this additional socioeconomic information with the sole use of ICD-10-CM codes to enable investigators to examine the putative impact of expanded codes on children's health care.

### Assessing the validity of ICD-10 administrative data in coding comorbidities [^3883eaa5]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2025). High credibility.

Objectives

Administrative data are commonly used to inform chronic disease prevalence and support health informatic research. This study assessed the validity of coding comorbidities in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) administrative data.

Methods

We analysed three chart review cohorts (4008 patients in 2003, 3045 in 2015 and 9024 in 2022) in Alberta, Canada. Nurse reviewers assessed the presence of 17 clinical conditions using a consistent protocol. The reviews were linked with administrative data using unique patient identifiers. We compared the accuracy in coding comorbidity by ICD-10, using chart review data as the reference standard.

Results

Our findings showed that the mean difference in prevalence between chart reviews and ICD-10 for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6% in 2015 and 6.3% in 2022. Some conditions were relatively stable, such as diabetes (1.9%, 2.1% and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1% and 0.4%). For these 17 conditions, the sensitivity ranged from 39.6–85.1% in 2003, 1.3%-85.2% in 2015 and 3.0–89.7% in 2022. The C-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality using comorbidities by ICD-10 were 0.84 in 2003, 0.81 in 2015 and 0.78 in 2022.

Discussion

The undercoding could be primarily due to the increase in hospital patient volumes and the limited time allocated to coding specialists. There is the potential to develop artificial intelligence methods based on electronic health records to support coding practices and improve data quality.

Conclusion

Comorbidities were increasingly undercoded over 20 years. The validity of ICD-10 decreased but remained relatively stable for certain conditions mandated for coding. The undercoding exerted minimal impact on in-hospital mortality prediction.

### Terminal decline in objective and self-reported measures of motor function before death: 10 year follow-up of whitehall II cohort study [^858ddbd8]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

We ascertained chronic diseases by using data from multiple sources, including clinical examinations in the study and linkage to electronic health records. We used three national databases: the national hospital episode statistics (HES) database with inpatient and outpatient data; the Mental Health Services Data Set, which in addition to inpatient and outpatient data also has data on care in the community; and the cancer registry. Chronic conditions considered were diabetes (fasting glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, reported diabetes diagnosed by a doctor, use of diabetes medication, ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) codes E10-E14), coronary heart disease (12 lead resting electrocardiogram, ICD-10 codes I20-I25), stroke (MONICA-Ausburg stroke questionnaire, ICD-10 codes I60-I64), cancer (cancer registry with malignant cancer, ICD-10 codes C00-C97, to include colorectal, lung, breast, prostate, smoking related, and melanoma skin cancers), dementia (ICD-10 codes F00-F03, F05.1, G30, G31), Parkinson's disease (self-report of longstanding illness, ICD-10 code G20), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (self-report of longstanding illness, ICD-10 codes J41-J44), depression (self-report of longstanding illness, use of antidepressants, ICD-10 codes F32-F33), and arthritis (self-report of longstanding illness, ICD-10 codes M05, M06, M15-M19). We created a multimorbidity score as the count of these chronic conditions, ranging from 0 to 9.

### Use of the postacute sequelae of COVID-19 diagnosis code in routine clinical practice in the US [^505766f9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

A new International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code (U09.9 Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified) was introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October 1, 2021.

Objective

To examine the use of the U09.9 code and describe concurrently diagnosed conditions to understand physician use of this code in clinical practice.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study of US patients with an ICD-10-CM code for post-COVID-19 condition used deidentified patient-level claims data aggregated by HealthVerity. Children and adolescents (aged 0–17 years) and adults (aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years) with a post-COVID-19 condition code were identified between October 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. To identify a prior COVID-19 diagnosis, 3 months of continuous enrollment (CE) before the post-COVID-19 diagnosis date was required.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Presence of the ICD-10-CM U09.9 code.

Results

There were 56 143 patients (7723 female patients [61.2%]; mean [SD] age, 47.6 [19.2] years) with a post-COVID-19 diagnosis code, with cases increasing in mid-December 2021 following the trajectory of the Omicron case wave by 3 to 4 weeks. The analysis cohort included 12 622 patients after the 3-month preindex CE criteria was applied. Among this cohort, the median (IQR) age was 49 (35–61) years; however, 1080 (8.6%) were pediatric patients. The U09.9 code was used most often in the outpatient setting, although 305 older adults (14.0%) were inpatients. Only 698 patients (5.5%) had at least 1 of the 5 codes listed as possible concurrent conditions in the coding guidance. Only 8879 patients (70.4%) had a documented acute COVID-19 diagnosis code (569 [52.7%] among children), and the median (IQR) time between acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 diagnosis codes was 56 (21–200) days. The most common concurrently coded conditions varied by age; children experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (eg, 207 [19.2%] had cough and 115 [10.6%] had breathing abnormalities), while 459 older adults aged 65 years or older (21.1%) experienced respiratory failure and 189 (8.7%) experienced viral pneumonia.

Conclusions and Relevance

This retrospective cohort study found patients with a post-COVID-19 ICD-10-CM diagnosis code following the acute phase of COVID-19 disease among patients of all ages in clinical practice in the US. The use of the U09.9 code encompassed a wide range of conditions. It will be important to monitor how the use of this code changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.

### Positive predictive value of international classification of diseases, 10th revision, codes for cirrhosis and its related complications [^7a9e696f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Large administrative databases using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are useful for epidemiologic, health services, and outcomes research. 1,2 However, coding accuracy of disease conditions could be a limiting factor. Cirrhosis prevalence is increasing because of an aging hepatitis C cohort and an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. 3 We previously examined the validity of ICD, 9th revision (ICD-9), codes for cirrhosis in US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative databases. 4,5 This work has formed the basis for many clinical, epidemiologic, and health services research studies. However, with transition from the ICD-9 to ICD, 10th revision (ICD-10), coding system, it is important to determine the validity of these new cirrhosis codes in administrative databases. Although the greater number of codes in the ICD-10 system may be associated with greater specificity and coding accuracy than with the ICD-9 system, this hypothesis remains untested.

### The epidemiology of alcohol-induced pancreatitis [^4a7dd17b]. Pancreas (2003). Low credibility.

Although the association between alcohol and pancreatitis has been recognized for centuries, the precise magnitude of the impact of alcohol remains poorly quantified. Epidemiologic research on this condition has been seriously handicapped by several factors. Classifications are based on morphology rather than on etiology; the diagnostic differences between acute and chronic pancreatitis are imprecise and confusing; and coding by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been inadequate. The current ICD (ICD-10), used in the United States since 1999, identifies alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis as a separate code for the first time, an enhancement that will greatly improve the quality of data collected in current and future studies. Unfortunately, no code yet exists for acute alcoholic pancreatitis. Of the approximately 2.4 million deaths in the United States in 1999, pancreatitis was listed as the underlying cause for 3289 deaths, making it the 235th leading cause of death. Acute pancreatitis accounted for 84% of these deaths, and chronic pancreatitis the remaining 16%. Alcohol is a primary cause of both acute and chronic pancreatitis in most developed countries. About one-third of acute pancreatitis in the United States is alcohol-induced. In the United States and other developed countries, 60%-90% of chronic pancreatitis is alcohol induced. Both forms are more common in men. The development of chronic pancreatitis is proportional to the dose and duration of alcohol consumption (minimum, 6–12 years of approximately 80 g of alcohol per day). Autopsy studies reveal subclinical chronic pancreatitis in another 10% of alcohol abusers. Yet, since < 10% of chronic alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis, clearly other predisposing factors besides alcohol are involved. Genetic variability and environmental exposures, such as diet, are prime candidates for further investigation. To date, there have been few large epidemiological studies of alcoholic pancreatitis in the United States or other developed countries. Additional studies are needed to improve the quality of existing baseline epidemiologic data and allow better assessment of risk. Improved diagnostic precision, more complete and specific coding, and greater understanding of covariables and mechanisms would also advance the field.

Study population

For the COVID-19 cohort, we included patients 21 years of age or above who had one or more medical service visits with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code U07.1; in any setting) between April 2020 and June 2021. Two comparator cohorts (pandemic and pre pandemic) involving patients 21 years of age or greater with at least one medical service visit with a primary diagnosis of AURI (pandemic (between April 2020 and June 2021) or pre pandemic (between January 2018 and December 2018)) were also created. An AURI diagnosis was defined as any of the following ICD-10-CM codes: J00, J01, J010, J0100, J0101, J011, J0110, J0111, J012, J0120, J0121, J013, J0130, J0131, J014, J0140, J0141, J018, J0180, J0181, J019, J0190, J0191, J02, J020, J028, J029, J03, J030, J0300, J0301, J038, J0380, J0381, J039, J0390, J0391, J04, J040, J041, J0410, J0411, J042, J043, J0430, J0431, J05, J050, J051, J0510, J0511, J06, J060, J069. The initial COVID-19 (for the COVID-19 cohort) or AURI diagnosis (for AURI pandemic/prepandemic cohorts) date was considered as the index date. Consistent across all cohorts, patients were excluded if there was a record of them having any of the following in the pre index period: COVID-19, AURI, prior AF diagnosis, an antiarrhythmic prescription drug claim or a catheter ablation procedure. For all three cohorts, continuous enrolment was required throughout the 12-month pre index and post index period. For the AURI pandemic cohort, an additional exclusion criterion was record of a COVID-19 diagnosis in the entire study period.
