## Question

In a patient with dyspnea, what factors increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what factors increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure (CHF) in a patient presenting with dyspnea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline prevalence and why the diagnosis is challenging in acute dyspnea. Then, I should verify which historical and symptom features carry the highest likelihood ratios. Next, I will examine physical findings with the strongest diagnostic weight. After that, I need to assess objective tests, starting with natriuretic peptides, then chest radiography, ECG, and echocardiography, along with point-of-care ultrasound. Finally, I should consider special populations and caveats, synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic pathway, and list the factors in hierarchical order, ensuring I double-check thresholds and likelihood ratios against the key studies and guidelines as I go [^114Wjz9q] [^111VTuRa].

> Let me first confirm the baseline and diagnostic challenge. Dyspnea has a broad differential in the ED, and acute CHF is common yet not straightforward to confirm clinically because signs and symptoms are nonspecific, with prevalence ranging from roughly one third to nearly one half depending on the cohort, which complicates pretest probability estimation and pushes us toward integrated diagnostic strategies rather than single findings alone [^114Wjz9q] [^1159tQD9] [^115esYdK] [^112gAPUJ].

> I need to verify the most powerful historical factor. Past history of heart failure is the strongest single historical predictor, with a positive likelihood ratio around 5.8, so the moment I hear it in a dyspneic patient, my pretest probability should jump substantially, and I should then look for converging evidence from exam and tests to avoid anchoring bias [^114Wjz9q]. Hold on, I should also check whether other historical elements independently add value; age, coronary artery disease, and loop diuretic use are each independently informative in primary care cohorts and can be combined with exam findings to improve discrimination, which reinforces the need to account for comorbidity burden upfront [^1142mMm4].

> Let me consider demographics and comorbidities that shift probability. Older age meaningfully increases risk, and in models for nonacute HF and HFpEF, variables such as age over 60, atrial fibrillation, obesity, and treatment with two or more antihypertensives carry diagnostic weight, aligning with the epidemiologic link between age, hypertension, CAD, diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure syndromes [^1142mMm4] [^116HbyXP] [^112ZuxLg]. I should confirm that these are not diagnostic in isolation, but they make a patient "look like" HF before I even examine them, which matters when I interpret downstream tests such as natriuretic peptides and imaging [^1142mMm4].

> Next, I should review symptom features that actually move the needle. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea carries a positive LR near 2.6 and orthopnea also adds meaningful weight; in prediction tools, orthopnea, nighttime dyspnea, and a history of pulmonary edema score points toward CHF, whereas chronic pulmonary disease can decrease the probability, so I need to ask about nocturnal symptoms and pillows explicitly and reconcile with any obstructive lung history [^114Wjz9q] [^113nRvEC]. Exertional dyspnea is common but nonspecific; nonetheless, progressive exertional intolerance in a patient with risk factors should keep CHF high on the list while I pursue objective tests and imaging [^112AfYDC].

> I will now examine the physical findings with the highest diagnostic value. A third heart sound, when present, carries a strong LR around 11 and often points to elevated filling pressures and systolic dysfunction, while an elevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary rales each materially increase the odds of CHF, and a displaced apex beat or new murmur can suggest structural disease as an etiology rather than just a syndrome label [^114Wjz9q] [^1142mMm4]. Wait, I initially thought S3 was the single highest LR overall, but let me double-check the chest radiograph section; pulmonary venous congestion on CXR actually reaches an LR of about 12, which is slightly higher than S3, so I need to weigh both highly when present to drive my post-test probability appropriately [^114Wjz9q].

> Now, I should confirm the role and thresholds of natriuretic peptides, since they are the most powerful objective test at the bedside. Guidelines explicitly recommend BNP or NT-proBNP in dyspneic patients to support or exclude HF, with rule-out thresholds typically at BNP ≤ 100 pg/mL and NT-proBNP ≤ 300 pg/mL in the acute setting, and higher, age-specific rule-in thresholds for NT-proBNP in ED populations that increase specificity without losing sensitivity [^111VTuRa] [^112692Lq] [^115gURyi]. Hold on, I should verify PRIDE's cut points and ensure I apply them correctly; PRIDE supports NT-proBNP > 450 pg/mL under age 50 and > 900 pg/mL at age 50 or older as highly sensitive and specific rule-in thresholds, and NT-proBNP < 300 pg/mL as an optimal rule-out, with performance superior to unaided clinical judgment and strongest independent association with acute CHF diagnosis, which justifies early ordering in undifferentiated dyspnea [^1159tQD9]. I should also integrate the Breathing Not Properly data that BNP > 100 pg/mL yields high sensitivity and that adding BNP to clinical judgment improves overall accuracy, especially in the intermediate-probability zone, reminding me that peptides and clinical assessment work best together rather than in isolation [^115esYdK] [^111DtQqR].

> Next, I will review chest radiography because its positive findings are highly specific. Cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous congestion, interstitial edema, or pleural effusions substantially increases the likelihood of CHF, and guidelines recommend obtaining a CXR in suspected or new-onset HF to assess heart size, congestion, and alternative diagnoses, which I should prioritize early in the ED workflow alongside peptides [^114Wjz9q] [^113sYqT2]. But wait, chest radiograph sensitivity can be limited early in decompensation or in obesity, so a normal film should not overrule a high pretest or positive peptide result, and I must be cautious not to dismiss early HF presentations based on CXR alone [^114Wjz9q].

> I should confirm the roles of ECG and echocardiography next. Atrial fibrillation on ECG meaningfully increases the probability of CHF among dyspneic patients, and the ECG can reveal ischemia, LV hypertrophy, or conduction disease that refine etiology and acuity, while transthoracic echocardiography remains the standard to confirm cardiac dysfunction, quantify EF, and assess diastolic function and pulmonary pressures to stage the syndrome and guide therapy [^114Wjz9q] [^115sXryv]. Hold on, I should verify that in the acute setting echo is used to confirm the syndrome and characterize it, not necessarily to make the initial ED diagnosis when immediate decisions are needed; nonetheless, early echo access is pivotal if the diagnosis remains uncertain or to direct management when shock or severe valvular disease is suspected [^115sXryv].

> I need to check whether point-of-care ultrasound can help at the bedside for rapid triage. Sonographic assessment of the inferior vena cava can discriminate cardiac from pulmonary dyspnea with high specificity when inspiratory diameter exceeds about 9 mm and collapsibility is reduced, offering a quick adjunct while awaiting labs, though technique and patient factors influence accuracy and should be interpreted in context with JVP and lung ultrasound if available [^11625bZN].

> Let me consider special populations and caveats before I synthesize. Obesity lowers BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations such that standard BNP cutoffs can be falsely negative in roughly one in five obese patients with acute CHF, which means I should not rule out HF solely on a BNP ≤ 100 pg/mL in a patient with BMI ≥ 30 if other features point to HF, and I may rely more on NT-proBNP and imaging in this subgroup [^112zE4Cz]. Renal insufficiency elevates NT-proBNP independent of HF, yet NT-proBNP retains diagnostic value even down to GFR in the mid-teens, so I should interpret higher baselines with adjusted thresholds and always integrate with clinical context and imaging [^112Z99EG]. In patients with COPD or asthma, overlap is common and clinicians underrecognize concurrent CHF; BNP and NT-proBNP help uncover cardiac dyspnea in this group and prevent anchoring on obstructive disease alone, which I need to remember whenever wheeze and edema coexist [^1118A7go]. Hmm, wait a minute, very early presentations or flash pulmonary edema may show transiently lower natriuretic peptide levels and yield indeterminate diagnostic value; in such cases, echo and CXR patterns, alongside rapid reassessment, can compensate for timing effects on biomarkers and avoid premature rule-outs [^113zNUp5] [^116RY1Rq].

> I should now synthesize how these elements integrate into decision-making. A prototypical high-likelihood profile is an older patient with prior HF who reports PND and orthopnea, with exam showing JVP elevation, rales, and S3, plus a CXR with pulmonary venous congestion and a peptide above rule-in thresholds, which together drive a multiplicative increase in post-test probability from moderate pretest to near-diagnostic certainty in the ED, prompting immediate decongestion while confirming with echocardiography [^114Wjz9q] [^1159tQD9] [^115esYdK]. I should double-check an example: prior HF history with LR about 5.8 combined with pulmonary venous congestion on CXR with LR around 12 could push post-test probability toward or beyond 90% depending on baseline, and adding a clearly positive BNP or NT-proBNP further solidifies the diagnosis, illustrating why combinations, not single findings, are decisive [^114Wjz9q] [^115esYdK].

> Hold on, I should also lay out a pragmatic diagnostic pathway that respects guideline priorities. I will start with focused history emphasizing prior HF, CAD, hypertension treatment intensity, and diuretic use, then target symptoms such as orthopnea and PND, proceed to a congestion-focused exam including JVP, S3, rales, edema, and displaced apex, obtain BNP or NT-proBNP early, order a CXR to assess congestion and alternatives, and use ECG to detect AF or ischemia, with echocardiography to confirm the syndrome and phenotype when needed, all while reassessing probability as each data element arrives and avoiding premature closure when discordant [^11166BTv] [^111VTuRa] [^113sYqT2] [^113y7agB]. I need to ensure that when peptides are indeterminate or confounded, imaging and repeated clinical evaluation anchor the diagnosis, and that management for congestion is initiated promptly when the preponderance of evidence indicates acute HF, even as confirmatory testing proceeds [^11166BTv] [^113sYqT2].

> But wait, what if features are mixed or equivocal. In intermediate-probability scenarios, combining clinical judgment with BNP materially improves accuracy over either alone, and tool-assisted approaches such as integrating NT-proBNP with clinical variables can refine individual patient probabilities, which is particularly useful in older adults or those with renal dysfunction or obesity where fixed cutpoints perform variably [^115esYdK] [^113mbm9x]. I should double-check that such tools complement, not replace, careful exam and imaging, and that they are interpreted in light of actual bedside congestion and hemodynamics rather than as stand-alone gatekeepers [^116RY1Rq].

> Finally, I should present the hierarchical factors that most increase CHF likelihood in dyspneic patients and verify alignment with high-credibility evidence. The strongest elements are a past history of CHF from the history domain, elevated natriuretic peptides above rule-in thresholds from the objective testing domain, high-yield physical signs such as S3, pulmonary rales, and elevated JVP, characteristic symptoms including PND and orthopnea, imaging evidence of pulmonary venous congestion and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph, demographic and comorbidity context such as older age, CAD, and hypertension treatment intensity, and ECG abnormalities like atrial fibrillation, with the understanding that combined findings, rather than any single feature, deliver the most reliable diagnostic certainty in the ED [^114Wjz9q] [^1159tQD9] [^115esYdK] [^113sYqT2] [^1142mMm4].

---

In patients presenting with dyspnea, the likelihood of congestive heart failure (CHF) increases with a combination of clinical features, biomarkers, and imaging findings [^113y7agB]. The most predictive elements are a **history of heart failure** or **coronary artery disease**, **orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea**, **elevated jugular venous pressure**, **third heart sound (S3)** [^114Wjz9q], and **peripheral edema** [^1142mMm4]. Elevated natriuretic peptides [^111VTuRa] (**BNP > 400 pg/mL** or **NT-proBNP > 900 pg/mL** in patients ≥ 50 years) [^1159tQD9] strongly support CHF, while levels **< 100 pg/mL (BNP)** or **< 300 pg/mL (NT-proBNP)** make CHF unlikely [^112692Lq]. Chest radiography [^113sYqT2] showing **cardiomegaly**, **pulmonary venous congestion** [^114Wjz9q], or **interstitial edema**, and echocardiography [^111DtQqR] demonstrating **reduced ejection fraction** or **diastolic dysfunction**, further increase diagnostic certainty. Integrating these findings yields the highest diagnostic accuracy for CHF in dyspneic patients [^115esYdK].

## Clinical history and symptoms

- **History of heart failure or coronary artery disease**: Strongly predictive of CHF recurrence or exacerbation [^114Wjz9q] [^1142mMm4].

- **Orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND)**: Classic symptoms of CHF [^114Wjz9q], indicating fluid redistribution and pulmonary congestion [^1142mMm4].

- **Rapid weight gain**: Suggests fluid retention [^11166BTv], a hallmark of CHF exacerbation [^114Wjz9q].

- **Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance**: Commonly associated with CHF [^113y7agB] due to decreased cardiac output and perfusion [^1142mMm4].

---

## Physical examination findings

| **Physical finding** | **Likelihood ratio (LR)** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) | 5.1 | Indicates elevated right atrial pressure and volume overload [^1142mMm4] |
| Third heart sound (S3) | 11.0 | - Highly specific for CHF <br/> - Indicating increased ventricular filling pressures [^114Wjz9q] |
| Peripheral edema | 2.3 | Suggests fluid retention and systemic congestion [^113y7agB] |
| Pulmonary rales | 2.8 | Indicates pulmonary congestion and interstitial edema [^114Wjz9q] |
| Displaced apex beat | 3.1 | Suggests cardiac enlargement and ventricular dysfunction [^1142mMm4] |

---

## Laboratory biomarkers

- **B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)**: Levels > 400 pg/mL strongly suggest CHF, while levels < 100 pg/mL effectively exclude CHF [^114szVzd] [^115esYdK].

- **N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP)**: Levels > 900 pg/mL in patients ≥ 50 years [^1159tQD9] strongly indicate CHF, while levels < 300 pg/mL effectively exclude CHF.

- **Cardiac troponins**: Elevated levels may indicate myocardial injury or stress, supporting the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

---

## Imaging studies

- **Chest radiography**: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary venous congestion [^114Wjz9q], interstitial edema, and pleural effusions strongly suggest CHF.

- **Echocardiography**: Reduced ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, and structural cardiac abnormalities confirm CHF diagnosis [^111DtQqR].

- **Cardiac MRI**: Useful in complex cases to assess myocardial structure, function, and fibrosis [^1175JYp5].

---

## Clinical prediction rules and scoring systems

Several **clinical prediction rules and scoring systems** aid in diagnosing CHF. The **Framingham criteria** [^114Wjz9q] compile major and minor signs and symptoms; the **Brest score** is designed for acute CHF diagnosis in the emergency setting [^113nRvEC]; and the **H2FPEF score** assists in diagnosing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in patients with unexplained dyspnea [^116HbyXP].

---

## Integration of clinical findings, biomarkers, and imaging

A comprehensive approach that integrates clinical history, physical examination, biomarkers, and imaging yields the **highest diagnostic accuracy** for CHF in dyspneic patients. Combining elevated natriuretic peptides with specific clinical signs (e.g. elevated JVP, S3) and imaging findings (e.g. cardiomegaly, reduced ejection fraction) significantly increases the likelihood of CHF [^114WcJbP].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite the availability of diagnostic tools, **challenges remain** in evaluating dyspneic patients for CHF. Dyspnea is non-specific and complicates the differential diagnosis [^114Wjz9q]; COPD and other pulmonary conditions can mimic CHF and complicate assessment [^114bogZC]; and factors such as obesity [^112zE4Cz], renal dysfunction [^112Z99EG], and age can affect natriuretic peptide levels and confound interpretation [^112692Lq].

In patients presenting with dyspnea, the likelihood of CHF increases with a combination of clinical history, physical examination findings, laboratory biomarkers, and imaging studies. A comprehensive approach integrating these elements yields the **highest diagnostic accuracy** for CHF [^111VTuRa].

Echocardiography and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are diagnostic tests for congestive heart failure (CHF); however, an emergency diagnosis can be difficult. This prospective, multinational, multicenter study assessed the diagnostic performance of BNP testing and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic function, separately and combined, for the identification of CHF in patients with acute dyspnea.

The study was conducted in the emergency departments of seven hospitals between June 1999 and December 2000 and included a total of 1,586 patients with acute dyspnea. The main outcome measures were echocardiographic determination of ejection fraction (EF) and point-of-care BNP measurement for the diagnosis of CHF.

Of the 1,586 patients, 709 underwent echocardiography, and 492 patients (69.4%) received a final diagnosis of CHF. It was observed that patients with CHF were older (68.5 years vs. 61.6 years). The sensitivity of a BNP level ≥ 100 pg/mL for the diagnosis of CHF was 89%, and specificity was 73%. Values for EF were additionally evaluated in conjunction with BNP measurements to improve diagnostic accuracy.

### The diagnostic value of physical examination and additional testing in primary care patients with suspected heart failure [^1142mMm4]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of nonacute heart failure is crucial because prompt initiation of evidence-based treatment can prevent or slow down further progression. Diagnosing new-onset heart failure in primary care is challenging.

- **Methods and results**: This is a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study with external validation. Seven hundred twenty-one consecutive patients suspected of new-onset heart failure underwent standardized diagnostic work-up, including chest x-ray, spirometry, ECG, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement, and echocardiography in specially equipped outpatient diagnostic heart failure clinics. The presence of heart failure was determined by an outcome panel using the initial clinical data and six-month follow-up data, blinded to biomarker data. Of the 721 patients, 207 (28.7%) had heart failure. The combination of three items from history (age, coronary artery disease, and loop diuretic use) plus six from physical examination (pulse rate and regularity, displaced apex beat, rales, heart murmur, and increased jugular vein pressure) showed independent diagnostic value (c-statistic 0.83). NT-proBNP was the most powerful supplementary diagnostic test, increasing the c-statistic to 0.86 and resulting in net reclassification improvement of 69% (P < 0.0001). A simplified diagnostic rule was applied to two external validation datasets, resulting in c-statistics of 0.95 and 0.88, confirming the results.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we estimated the quantitative diagnostic contribution of elements of the history and physical examination in the initial diagnostic process.

### The N-terminal pro-BNP investigation of dyspnea in the emergency department (PRIDE) study [^1159tQD9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The utility of aminoterminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) testing in the emergency department to rule out acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and the optimal cutpoints for this use are not established. We conducted a prospective study of 600 patients who presented in the emergency department with dyspnea. The clinical diagnosis of acute CHF was determined by study physicians who were blinded to NT-proBNP results. The primary endpoint was a comparison of NT-proBNP results with the clinical assessment of the managing physician for identifying acute CHF.

The median NT-proBNP level among 209 patients (35%) who had acute CHF was 4,054 pg/ml versus 131 pg/ml among 390 patients (65%) who did not (p < 0.001). NT-proBNP levels > 450 pg/ml for patients under 50 years of age and > 900 pg/ml for patients 50 years or older were highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acute CHF (p < 0.001). An NT-proBNP level < 300 pg/ml was optimal for ruling out acute CHF, with a negative predictive value of 99%. Increased NT-proBNP was the strongest independent predictor of a final diagnosis of acute CHF (odds ratio 44, 95% confidence interval 21.0 to 91.0, p < 0.0001).

- **Clinical judgment vs. NT-proBNP testing**: NT-proBNP testing alone was superior to clinical judgment alone for diagnosing acute CHF (p = 0.006). NT-proBNP plus clinical judgment was superior to NT-proBNP or clinical judgment alone. NT-proBNP measurement is a valuable addition to standard clinical assessment for the identification and exclusion of acute CHF in the emergency department setting.

### Does this dyspneic patient in the emergency department have congestive heart failure [^114Wjz9q]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

Dyspnea is a common complaint in the emergency department where physicians must accurately make a rapid diagnosis. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of history, symptoms, and signs, along with routine diagnostic studies (chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) that differentiate heart failure from other causes of dyspnea in the emergency department.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE (1966-July 2005) and the reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks.

- **Study selection**: We retained 22 studies on various findings for diagnosing heart failure in adult patients presenting with dyspnea to the emergency department.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality.

- **Data synthesis**: Many features increased the probability of heart failure, with the best feature for each category being:
	- Past history of heart failure (positive LR = 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.1–8.0)
	- Symptom of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (positive LR = 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5–4.5)
	- Sign of the third heart sound (S3) gallop (positive LR = 11; 95% CI, 4.9–25.0)
	- Chest radiograph showing pulmonary venous congestion (positive LR = 12.0; 95% CI, 6.8–21.0)
	- Electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation (positive LR = 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7–8.8)

The features that best decreased the probability of heart failure were the absence of a past history of heart failure.

### Cut-off values of B-type natriuretic peptide for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure in patients with dyspnoea visiting emergency departments: A study on Korean patients visiting emergency departments [^1119ABWY]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2007). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal cut-off values of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) in 1,040 Korean patients with dyspnoea visiting emergency departments, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: BNP values were measured for 662 patients without CHF to examine whether significant relationships existed between BNP values and age, gender, or underlying disease. In 378 patients with CHF, a similar analysis was performed, including an examination of the relationship between the mean BNP values and CHF severity.

- **Results**: The optimal threshold for the detection of heart failure was a BNP concentration of 296.5 pg/mL, regardless of age, sex, and underlying disease among the Korean study population. In the non-CHF patients, women showed significantly higher mean BNP values than men. Further, in these patients, the mean BNP values of men with underlying diseases (hypertension, angina pectoris, chronic renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and those with at least two underlying diseases, one of which was hypertension, were higher than those without underlying disease. No difference was observed between women with and without underlying disease. Based on the New York Heart Association classification, echocardiography findings, and mortality rate of the CHF patients, the BNP value was found to be related to both the severity of heart failure and its prognosis.

- **Conclusions**: The BNP concentration used for the diagnosis of CHF in Korean people is considerably higher than the normal cut-off value of 100 pg/mL.

### Heart failure diagnosis in the general community - who, how and when? A clinical consensus statement of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^115t6bf6]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). High credibility.

A significant proportion of patients experience delays in the diagnosis of heart failure due to the non-specific signs and symptoms of the syndrome. Diagnostic tools, such as measurement of natriuretic peptide concentrations, are fundamentally important when screening for heart failure, yet are frequently under-utilized. This clinical consensus statement provides a diagnostic framework for general practitioners and non-cardiology community-based physicians to recognize, investigate, and risk-stratify patients presenting in the community with possible heart failure.

### A prediction rule to identify low-risk patients with heart failure [^115MTHrY]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To derive a prediction rule using data available in the emergency department (ED), a study was conducted to identify a group of patients hospitalized for the treatment of heart failure who are at low risk of death and serious complications.

The authors analyzed data for all 33,533 patients with a primary hospital discharge diagnosis of heart failure in 1999 who were admitted from EDs in Pennsylvania. Candidate predictors were demographic and medical history variables and the most abnormal examination or diagnostic test values measured in the ED (vital signs only) or on the first day of hospitalization. The authors constructed classification trees to identify a subgroup of patients with an observed rate of death or serious medical complications before discharge < 2%; the tree that identified the subgroup with the lowest rate of this outcome and an inpatient mortality rate < 1% was chosen.

Within the entire cohort, 4.5% of patients died and 6.8% survived to hospital discharge after experiencing a serious medical complication. The prediction rule used 21 prognostic factors to classify 17.2% of patients as low risk; 19 (0.3%) died and 59 (1.0%) survived to hospital discharge after experiencing a serious medical complication.

This clinical prediction rule identified a group of patients hospitalized from the ED for the treatment of heart failure who were at low risk of adverse inpatient outcomes. Model performance needs to be examined in a cohort of patients with an ED diagnosis of heart failure and treated as outpatients or hospitalized.

### Renal function, congestive heart failure, and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide measurement: Results from the ProBNP Investigation of Dyspnea in the Emergency Department (PRIDE) Study [^112Z99EG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The relationship between renal insufficiency and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels remains unclear. We examined this relationship in the context of patients who presented to the emergency department of an urban tertiary care medical center with dyspnea. Even in the presence of renal insufficiency, NT-proBNP remained a valuable tool for the diagnosis of acute congestive heart failure and provides important prognostic information.

- **Objectives**: We sought to examine the interaction between renal function and amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels.

- **Background**: The effects of renal insufficiency on NT-proBNP among patients with and without acute congestive heart failure (CHF) are controversial. We examined the effects of kidney disease on NT-proBNP-based CHF diagnosis and prognosis.

- **Methods**: A total of 599 dyspneic patients with glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) as low as 14.8 ml/min were analyzed. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine covariates associated with NT-proBNP results and linear regression analysis to analyze associations between NT-proBNP and GFR. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis determined the sensitivity and specificity of NT-proBNP for CHF diagnosis. We also assessed 60-day mortality rates as a function of NT-proBNP concentration.

- **Results**: Glomerular filtration rates ranged from 15 ml/min/1.73 m² to 252 ml/min/1.73 m². Renal insufficiency was associated with risk factors for CHF, and patients with renal insufficiency were more likely to have CHF (all p < 0.003).

### Development of a clinical prediction score for congestive heart failure diagnosis in the emergency care setting: The Brest score [^113nRvEC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The objective was to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule for acute congestive heart failure that is obtainable in the emergency care setting.

- **Design**: Derivation of the score was performed on a retrospective cohort of 927 patients admitted to our Emergency Department for dyspnea. The prediction model was externally validated on an independent cohort of 206 prospective patients.

- **Interventions and measures**: During the derivation phase, variables associated with acute congestive heart failure were included in a multivariate regression model. Logistic regression coefficients were used to assign scoring points to each variable. During the validation phase, every diagnosis was confirmed by an independent adjudication committee.

- **Results**: The score comprised 11 variables: age ≥ 65 years (1 point), seizure dyspnea (2 points), night outbreak (1 point), orthopnea (1 point), history of pulmonary edema (2 points), chronic pulmonary disease (-2 points), myocardial infarction (1 point), crackles (2 points), leg edema (1 point), ST-segment abnormality (1 point), and atrial fibrillation/flutter (1 point) on electrocardiography. In the validation step, 30 patients (14.6%) had a low clinical probability of acute congestive heart failure (score ≤ 3), of which only 2 (6.7%) had proven acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The prevalence of acute congestive heart failure was 58.5% in the 94 patients with an intermediate probability (score of 4–8) and 91.5% in the 82 patients (39.8%) with a high probability (score ≥ 9).

- **Conclusion**: This score identifies acute congestive heart failure based on easily available and objective measures.

### Evaluation of a provocative dyspnea severity score in acute heart failure [^114iyvMc]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The Acute Heart Failure (AHF) Syndromes International Working Group proposed assessing dyspnea under standardized, incrementally provocative maneuvers and called for studies to evaluate this approach's feasibility. We sought to assess the feasibility and statistical characteristics of a novel provocative dyspnea severity score (pDS) versus the traditional dyspnea visual analog scale (DVAS) in an AHF trial.

- **Methods**: At enrollment, and at 24, 48, and 72 hours, 230 ROSE-AHF patients completed a DVAS. Dyspnea was then assessed with 5-point Likert dyspnea scales administered during four stages (A: upright-with O2, B: upright-without O2, C: supine-without O2, and D: exercise-without O2). Patients with moderate or less dyspnea were eligible for the next stage.

- **Results**: At enrollment, oxygen withdrawal and supine provocation were highly feasible (≥ 97%), provoking more severe dyspnea (≥ 1 Likert point) in 24% and 42% of eligible patients, respectively. Exercise provocation had low feasibility, with 38% of eligible patients unable to exercise due to factors other than dyspnea. A pDS was constructed from Likert scales during the three feasible assessment conditions (A-C). Relative to DVAS, the distribution of the pDS was more skewed, with a high "ceiling effect" at enrollment (23%), limiting sensitivity to change. Change in pDS was not related to decongestion or 60-day outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Although oxygen withdrawal and supine provocation are feasible and elicit more severe dyspnea, exercise provocation had unacceptable feasibility in this AHF cohort. The statistical characteristics of the pDS require further evaluation to enhance the understanding of dyspnea severity changes in AHF.

### Effect of body mass index on natriuretic peptide levels in patients with acute congestive heart failure: A ProBNP investigation of dyspnea in the emergency department (PRIDE) substudy [^112zE4Cz]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Obesity is associated with lower B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in healthy individuals and patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). Neither the mechanism of natriuretic peptide suppression in the obese patient nor whether obesity affects natriuretic peptide levels among patients with acute CHF is known.

- **Methods**: The associations of amino-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), BNP, and body mass index (BMI) were examined in 204 subjects with acute CHF. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently related to NT-proBNP and BNP levels.

- **Results**: Across clinical strata of normal (or ≥ 30 kg/m²) patients, median NT-proBNP and BNP levels decreased with increasing BMI (both P values or ≥ 30 kg/m²). Using the standard cut point of 100 pg/mL, BNP testing was falsely negative in 20% of CHF cases in both overweight and obese patients. The assays for NT-proBNP and BNP exhibited similar overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of CHF.

- **Conclusions**: When adjusted for relevant covariates, compared with normal counterparts, overweight and obese patients with acute CHF have lower circulating NT-proBNP and BNP levels, suggesting a BMI-related defect.

### Acute heart failure: More questions than answers [^111ytRnn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a life-threatening condition with a significant burden in terms of symptoms, morbidity, and mortality. It represents a specific syndrome requiring urgent, life-saving treatment. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved, including congestion, inflammation, and neurohormonal activation, eventually leading to symptoms, end-organ damage, and adverse outcomes.

The clinical presentation varies, but it almost universally includes worsening congestion associated with different degrees of hypoperfusion. Due to the substantial burden of early symptoms and high morbidity and mortality, patients with AHF require intensive monitoring and intravenous treatment. However, beyond variable improvement in congestion, none of the available intravenous therapies for AHF has been shown to improve long-term outcomes.

Although oral treatment with guideline-directed therapies for stable patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) before discharge may fully prevent subsequent episodes, proof that this strategy may benefit patients is lacking. Most patients with AHF have preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), where no effective therapies have been identified. Moreover, therapies developed for HFrEF patients were tested for efficacy in individuals stable without recent AHF episodes. Thus, the implementation of these chronic therapies during an AHF episode remains untested.

The challenge to better treat AHF patients in their early phase remains crucial, with treatment strategies largely untested as of yet. Further studies targeting AHF-specific mechanisms are urgently needed.

### The diagnostic accuracy of the natriuretic peptides in heart failure: Systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis in the acute care setting [^112692Lq]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Making the correct diagnosis in patients with suspected acute heart failure is challenging and confirmatory in only 40–50% of cases. Several studies have shown that when added to routine history, clinical examination, and conventional investigations (for example, chest radiography), measurement of plasma natriuretic peptide levels improves diagnostic accuracy and has led to these markers being recommended in international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of heart failure.

The 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for heart failure endorsed specific age-independent decision cut-offs for plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (≤ 100 ng/L), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, ≤ 300 ng/L), and mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP, ≤ 120 pmol/L) for the exclusion of acute heart failure based on consensus of expert opinion. Although natriuretic peptide levels have been widely used for the earlier diagnosis or exclusion of chronic heart failure in the outpatient setting, their use in the acute care setting has only partially been adopted because their role has remained uncertain. They are not routinely available in emergency departments in the United Kingdom for the rapid assessment of patients presenting with breathlessness. This lack of availability reflects a lack of clarity on the diagnostic accuracy of natriuretic peptides in this setting. In particular, while the age-independent cut-offs as recommended by the European Society of Cardiology are relatively easy to apply in clinical practice, they have not been evaluated by any large-scale studies.

### An algorithmic approach to chronic dyspnea [^113SGisE]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to prospectively evaluate an algorithmic approach to determine the cause(s) of chronic dyspnea.

- **Materials, patients, and methods**: Prospective observational study. The study group consisted of 123 patients with a chief complaint of dyspnea of unknown cause present for more than 8 weeks. Dyspnea severity scores were documented at entry and after therapy. Patients underwent an algorithmic approach to dyspnea. Therapy could be instituted at any time that data supported a treatable diagnosis. Whenever possible, the accuracy of diagnosis was confirmed with an improvement in dyspnea after therapy. Tests required, the spectrum and frequency of diagnoses, and the values of individual tests were determined.

- **Results**: Cause(s) was(were) diagnosed in 122 out of 123 patients (99%); 97 patients had one diagnosis, and 25 had two diagnoses. Fifty-three percent of diagnoses were respiratory, and 47% were non-respiratory. Following therapy, dyspnea improved in 63% of patients.

- **Conclusions**: The prospective algorithmic approach led to diagnoses in 99% of cases. A third of patients were diagnosed with each tier of the algorithm, thus minimizing the need for invasive testing. Specific diagnoses led to improvement in dyspnea in the majority of cases. Based on the results of this study, the algorithm can be revised to further minimize unnecessary tests without loss of diagnostic accuracy.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: But we can induce remission [^112KE5Ro]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In part, the lack of progress in acute heart failure (AHF) research over the past decades can be attributed to its subjective definition. Most authors define it as a sudden worsening of symptoms and signs of congestion associated with some cardiac abnormality requiring emergency treatment. Some add to the definition the need for admission, whereas others add requirements for intravenous therapy.

However, compared with other acute cardiovascular conditions, such as myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, or pulmonary embolism — where electrocardiographic data, imaging data, and biomarkers can confirm or refute the diagnosis with high certainty — no such imaging or blood test exists for the diagnosis of AHF. Although elevated natriuretic peptides are important in diagnosing AHF and a lack of increase in natriuretic peptides can rule out AHF with high certainty, increased natriuretic peptides can also be caused by other disease states, most notably chronic stable heart failure (HF). Hence, natriuretic peptides by themselves are not specific for AHF.

Chest X-ray signs of congestion, on the other hand, are highly specific but lack sensitivity. Therefore, despite years of research, no single biomarker or imaging technique has been found to be both specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of AHF. Its diagnosis remains subjective and based mostly on symptoms, clinical assessments, and ruling out other reasons for acute congestion, such as an acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, or infection.

### Diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of natriuretic peptides in emergency department patients with dyspnea [^112V8AS1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

More than 4.5 million Americans have congestive heart failure (CHF), with close to 550,000 new cases diagnosed each year. One third of known patients with CHF are annually admitted to the hospital. Emergency department diagnosis of CHF is often based on a combination of history and physical examination findings, along with results from ancillary tests such as chest radiography and ECG. Although signs and symptoms of fluid overload, such as lower extremity edema and dyspnea, raise the suspicion of CHF, their lack of sensitivity makes them poor screening tools.

The natriuretic peptides are promising markers of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure. Because of their relationship to myocardial pressure and stretching, natriuretic peptides have been investigated over the past five decades as both diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndromes and CHF. This article discusses each of the natriuretic peptides and attempts to delineate their potential diagnostic and prognostic roles in the emergency department.

### The role of inferior vena cava diameter in the differential diagnosis of dyspneic patients; best sonographic measurement method [^11625bZN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The study aimed to determine the role of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter in differentiating between dyspnea of cardiac origin (acute heart failure [AHF]) and pulmonary origin. Additionally, the research attempted to identify the best sonographic method for measuring IVC diameter.

This prospective observational study was conducted at the intensive care unit of the emergency department of a training and research hospital. Patients presenting with the main symptom of dyspnea were enrolled and categorized into two groups: cardiac dyspnea and pulmonary dyspnea, based on the final diagnosis. All patients underwent sonographic measurement of the minimum and maximum diameters of the IVC, and the caval index (CI) was calculated in both M-mode and B-mode. The sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) of the IVC measurements were calculated to differentiate between the two groups.

The study included a total of 74 patients, with a mean age of 72.8 years. Among them, 32 patients had dyspnea of cardiac origin, while 42 patients had dyspnea of pulmonary origin. The IVC diameter measured with B-mode during inspiration (B-mode i) proved to be the most effective method for distinguishing between the two groups. Specifically, B-mode i values greater than 9 mm predicted dyspnea of cardiac origin with a sensitivity of 84.4% and a specificity of 92.9% (+LR: 11.8, LR: 0.16).

In conclusion, the sonographic assessment of the IVC diameter may be utilized as a rapid, readily available, cost-effective, complication-free, and reproducible technique for differentiating between cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea.

### Ventilatory response to carbon dioxide output in subjects with congestive heart failure and in patients with COPD with comparable exercise capacity [^116UijQA]. Respiratory Care (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with congestive heart failure or COPD may share an increased response in minute ventilation (V̇E) to carbon dioxide output (V̇CO2) during exercise. The goal of this study was to ascertain whether the V̇E/V̇CO2 slope and V̇E/V̇CO2 intercept can discriminate between subjects with congestive heart failure and those with COPD at equal peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2).

- **Methods**: We studied 46 subjects with congestive heart failure (mean age 61 ± 9 years) and 46 subjects with COPD (mean age 64 ± 8 years) who performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test.

- **Results**: The V̇E/V̇CO2 slope was significantly higher in subjects with congestive heart failure compared with those with COPD (39.5 ± 9.5 vs. 31.8 ± 7.4, P < 0.01). Regardless of peak V̇O2, the end-tidal pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) at peak exercise was not different in subjects with congestive heart failure (P = 0.42) and was significantly higher in subjects with COPD (P < .01) compared with the corresponding unloaded PETCO2.

- **Conclusions**: The ven

### Causes of shortness of breath in the acute patient: A national study [^115wYhX2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is a common and ambiguous complaint that results in 3.4 million emergency department (ED) visits annually. While learners may encounter lists of differential diagnoses to consider during training, often these lists are not empirically based. We sought to establish an evidence-based differential diagnosis for dyspnea and to determine whether normal vital signs can rule out a life-threatening diagnosis.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2005 to 2014 for ED visits with a chief complaint of dyspnea, tallying the principal discharge diagnosis. We included 10,170 sampled ED visits by adults with a chief complaint of dyspnea, representing nearly 42 million visits nationally. We then calculated the most common principal discharge diagnoses by age group and the frequency of abnormal respiratory vital signs in cases with life-threatening diagnoses.

- **Results**: The most represented age group was 45 to 64 years (31.6%). Most visits were discharged directly from the ED (57.5%), while 8.1% required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). The most common diagnosis in patients aged 18 to 44 was acute asthma exacerbation (14.8%). Obstructive chronic bronchitis was the most common specified diagnosis in both patients ages 45 to 64 (11.1%) and patients ages 65 to 79 (12.4%), while congestive heart failure was the most common for patients ages 80 and over (15.9%). Respiratory vital signs were frequently normal in the 44.6% of visits that resulted in a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, but corresponded to increases in severity.

### Congestive heart failure: Diagnosis, pathophysiology, therapy, and implications for respiratory care [^116p3fuF]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a common clinical disorder that results in pulmonary vascular congestion and reduced cardiac output. CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination, as well as characteristic chest radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography has substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis.

Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.

### Dyspnoea in a patient with chronic heart failure: surprise, surprise [^1123qsi2]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Dyspnoea is one of the typical symptoms of congestive heart failure.

### Dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure: results from the Pre-RELAX-AHF study [^113DRBRw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Relief from dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients admitted for acute heart failure

Symptoms of heart failure, usually dyspnoea, are the main cause of hospitalization in acute heart failure (AHF). These symptoms are so disabling that patients with advanced heart failure have professed acceptance of an increased risk of death for some improvement in symptoms. The importance of dyspnoea is recognized by regulatory agencies and accepted as an important endpoint required for registration trials of new AHF medical treatments, provided there is sufficient evidence of safety. Improved standardization of dyspnoea measurement has been proposed and adopted in clinical trials, including in Pre-RELAX-AHF.

Rates of early and persistent dyspnoea relief were surprisingly low in our study. This finding is at odds with previous trials where higher rates were reported. Using the Likert scale (similar to the one used in the study), approximately 45% of patients enrolled in the placebo arm of the VMAC study had moderate or marked improvement in dyspnoea by 3 hours after enrollment. Similar proportions (40–60%) of patients with improved dyspnoea were observed in the placebo arm of the REVIVE study at 6 hours and in the Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study with Tolvaptan (EVEREST). Using the VAS in VERITAS, major improvements in dyspnoea were observed at 3 and 24 hours, surpassing those observed in the present study at Day 5. The lower proportion of patients with an early improvement in dyspnoea and the smaller improvements to Day 5 in the present study cannot be ascribed to the inclusion of patients.

### Development and validation of a decision support tool for the diagnosis of acute heart failure: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and modelling study [^113mbm9x]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) thresholds for acute heart failure and to develop and validate a decision support tool that combines NT-proBNP concentrations with clinical characteristics.

The research design involved an individual patient-level data meta-analysis and modelling study. The setting comprised fourteen studies from 13 countries, including randomized controlled trials and prospective observational studies.

Participants included individual patient-level data for 10,369 patients with suspected acute heart failure, which were pooled for the meta-analysis to evaluate NT-proBNP thresholds. A decision support tool, known as the Collaboration for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Heart Failure (CoDE-HF), which combines NT-proBNP with clinical variables to report the probability of acute heart failure for an individual patient, was developed and validated.

The main outcome measure was the adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure. Results showed that overall, 43.9% (4,549/10,369) of patients had an adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure; with 73.3% (2,286/3,119) of patients with previous heart failure and 29.0% (1,802/6,208) of those without. The negative predictive value of the guideline-recommended rule-out threshold of 300 pg/mL was 94.6% (95% confidence interval, 91.9% to 96.4%). Despite the use of age-specific rule-in thresholds, the positive predictive value varied at 61.0% (55.3% to 66.4%), 73.5% (62.3% to 82.3%), and 80.2% (70.9% to 87.1%) in patients aged 75 years, respectively. Performance varied in most subgroups, particularly patients with certain characteristics.

### Cardiac or pulmonary dyspnea in patients admitted to the emergency department [^116dK7wr]. Respiratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A simple and quick way to discriminate between cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea is essential for patients admitted to the emergency department. We aimed to assess the utility of easily applicable diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnea in patients presenting with shortness of breath. Clinical and radiologic evaluation, peak expiratory flow (PEF), PaO2, and PaCO2 were measured in 94 patients admitted to the emergency room with dyspnea. All the patients were hospitalized for accurate diagnosis and later categorized into cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea groups.

- **Dyspnea differentiation index (DDI)**: Using DDI = PEF x PaO2/1000, a cut-off value of 1.6 was considered. Measurements above this value imply cardiac pathology with 76.7% sensitivity and 67.2% specificity.

- **Sensitivity and specificity**: The sensitivity and specificity for cardiac dyspnea calculated according to cut-off values were 96.7% and 40.6% for %DDI; 86.7% and 60.9% for PEF; 86.7% and 54.7% for %PEF; and 66.7% and 68.7% for PaO2. For pulmonary dyspnea, the sensitivity and specificity values for PaCO2 were 50% and 93%.

We conclude that DDI, %DDI, PEF, %PEF, PaO2, and PaCO2 are simple and easily applicable tools for the differential diagnosis of cardiac and pulmonary dyspnea. The adjunctive utility of these tests in the emergency department, in conjunction with clinical and radiologic evaluation, contributes significantly to this diagnostic process.

### A simple, evidence-based approach to help guide diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116HbyXP]. Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging in euvolemic patients with dyspnea, and no evidence-based criteria are available. We sought to develop and then validate noninvasive diagnostic criteria that could be used to estimate the likelihood that HFpEF is present among patients with unexplained dyspnea to guide further testing.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with unexplained dyspnea referred for invasive hemodynamic exercise testing were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnosis of HFpEF (case) or noncardiac dyspnea (control) was ascertained by invasive hemodynamic exercise testing. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the ability of clinical findings to discriminate cases from controls. A scoring system was developed and then validated in a separate test cohort.

- **Results**: The derivation cohort included 414 consecutive patients (267 cases with HFpEF and 147 controls; HFpEF prevalence, 64%). The test cohort included 100 consecutive patients (61 with HFpEF; prevalence, 61%). Obesity, atrial fibrillation, age > 60 years, treatment with ≥ 2 antihypertensives, echocardiographic E/e' ratio > 9, and echocardiographic pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mmHg were selected as the final set of predictive variables. A weighted score based on these six variables was used to create a composite score (H2 FPEF score) ranging from 0 to 9. The odds of HFpEF doubled for each 1-unit score increase (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.74–2.30; P < 0.0001), with an area under the curve of 0.841 (P < 0.0001). The H2 FPEF score was superior.

### Relation of dyspnea in patients unable to perform exercise stress testing to outcome and myocardial ischemia [^1165xxVV]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Limited information exists regarding the significance of dyspnea in patients who are unable to exercise and the contribution of myocardial ischemia to this symptom. To assess this, we evaluated results of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) and the long-term outcome of patients with dyspnea referred for DSE. We studied 6,376 consecutive patients who were unable to perform an exercise test and were referred for DSE. Patients were classified according to presenting symptoms and followed for 5.5 ± 2.8 years. Endpoints were cardiac ischemic events (myocardial infarction or revascularization), hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and death.

- **Ischemia Identification**: Dobutamine stress echocardiogram was positive for ischemia in 19% of patients with dyspnea versus 24% of those with typical angina (p = 0.002) and 17% of asymptomatic patients (p = 0.2).

- **Risk Analysis**: In multivariate analysis, the risk of death was increased in dyspneic patients versus asymptomatic patients (hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, p = 0.02) and patients with chest pain (HR 1.20, p < 0.001). Hospitalization for HF occurred more often in patients with dyspnea (HR 1.26, p = 0.05 vs. asymptomatic; HR 1.24, p = 0.06 vs. chest pain), especially in the subset without previous HF (HR 1.45, p = 0.006 vs. chest pain).

- **Cardiac Events Comparison**: The risk of cardiac ischemic events in patients with dyspnea was similar to asymptomatic patients (HR 0.92, p = 0.39) and decreased compared to patients with chest pain (HR 0.70, p < 0.001).

In conclusion, in patients referred for DSE, dyspnea was associated with poor outcomes. This increased hazard seems not to be linked to myocardial ischemia.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in perspective [^111PtTfe]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

Approximately half of the patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure have a left ventricular ejection fraction that is not markedly abnormal. Despite the initially surprising discovery, heightened risks for heart failure-specific major adverse events occur across the broad range of ejection fractions, including those considered normal. The recognition of the magnitude of the problem of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction over the past 20 years has led to an explosion of clinical investigation and growing intensity of informative outcome trials. This article addresses the historic development of this component of the heart failure syndrome, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, and existing and planned therapeutic studies. Looking forward, more specific phenotyping and even genotyping of subpopulations should lead to improvements in outcomes from future trials.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to acute decompensated heart failure [^115r4ugS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007).

Heart failure afflicts large numbers of patients and is the leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States. Diagnosis and management of decompensated heart failure present a clinical challenge, requiring complex decision-making. History and physical examination findings are important in the diagnosis of heart failure. Diagnostically, B-type natriuretic peptide levels appear very useful to separate cardiac from noncardiac causes of dyspnea and provide information about heart failure severity and prognosis. Immediate management goals include improvement of symptoms and hemodynamic parameters. Diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents are useful in the acute setting. This article provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of acute decompensated heart failure.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® dyspnea-suspected cardiac origin (ischemia already excluded): 2021 update [^115sXryv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Dyspnea is the symptom of perceived breathing discomfort and is commonly encountered in a variety of clinical settings. Cardiac etiologies of dyspnea are an important consideration; among these, valvular heart disease (Variant 1), arrhythmia (Variant 2), and pericardial disease (Variant 3) are reviewed in this document. Imaging plays an important role in the clinical assessment of these suspected abnormalities, with usually appropriate procedures including resting transthoracic echocardiography in all three variants, radiography for Variants 1 and 3, MRI heart function and morphology in Variants 2 and 3, and CT heart function and morphology with intravenous contrast for Variant 3.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### An unusual cause of dyspnea [^112oKz3q]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Dyspnea is an alarming symptom for both the patient and the emergency physician. There are many causes of dyspnea, some of which are life-threatening, especially in elderly patients. In addition to the usual cardiac and pulmonary causes, such as congestive heart failure, asthma exacerbation, COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism, there are less common causes of dyspnea. If not diagnosed and managed expeditiously, these may have dire consequences for both the patient and the physician. We present a case of an elderly patient with a life-threatening, unusual cause of acute shortness of breath: a diaphragmatic hernia with sepsis.

### B-type natriuretic peptide and clinical judgment in emergency diagnosis of heart failure: Analysis from Breathing Not Properly (BNP) Multinational Study [^115esYdK]. Circulation (2002). High credibility.

We sought to determine the degree to which B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) adds to clinical judgment in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF). The Breathing Not Properly Multinational Study was a prospective diagnostic test evaluation study conducted in 7 centers. Of 1586 participants who presented with acute dyspnea, 1538 (97%) had clinical certainty of CHF determined by the attending physician in the emergency department. Participants underwent routine care and had BNP measured in a blinded fashion. The reference standard for CHF was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists, also blinded to BNP results. The final diagnosis was CHF in 722 (47%) participants.

At an 80% cutoff level of certainty of CHF, clinical judgment had a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 96%. At 100 pg/mL, BNP had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 73%. In determining the correct diagnosis (CHF versus no CHF), adding BNP to clinical judgment would have enhanced diagnostic accuracy from 74% to 81%. In those participants with an intermediate (21% to 79%) probability of CHF, BNP at a cutoff of 100 pg/mL correctly classified 74% of the cases. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.86 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.88), 0.90 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.91), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.94) for clinical judgment, BNP at a cutoff of 100 pg/mL, and for the two in combination, respectively (P < 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons).

### Uncovering heart failure in patients with a history of pulmonary disease: Rationale for the early use of B-type natriuretic peptide in the emergency department [^1118A7go]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) can reliably identify acute congestive heart failure (CHF) in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea. Heart failure, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are syndromes where dyspnea and wheezing are overlapping signs, and hence, these syndromes are often difficult to differentiate.

- **Objective**: To determine whether BNP can distinguish new-onset heart failure in patients with COPD or asthma presenting with dyspnea to the ED.

- **Methods**: The BNP Multinational Study was a seven-center prospective study of 1,586 adult patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea who had blinded BNP levels measured on arrival with a rapid, point-of-care device. This study evaluated the 417 patients with no previous history of heart failure and a history of asthma or COPD as a subgroup from the 1,586 adult patients in the BNP Multinational Study. The reference standard for CHF was adjudicated by two independent cardiologists, also blinded to BNP results, who reviewed all clinical data and standardized CHF scores.

- **Results**: A total of 417 subjects (mean age 62.2 years, 64.4% male) had a history of asthma or COPD without a history of CHF. Of these, 87/417 (20.9%, 95% CI = 17.1% to 25.1%) were found to have CHF as the final adjudicated diagnosis. The emergency physicians identified a minority, 32/87 (36.8%), of these patients with CHF. The mean BNP values (± SD) were 587.0 ± 426.4 and 108.8 ± 221.3 pg/mL for those with and without CHF (p < 0.0001). At a cutpoint of 100 pg/mL, BNP had the f

### Noninvasive assessment of acute dyspnea in the ed [^112gAPUJ]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in nonselected patients presenting with acute dyspnea is challenging. Symptoms and physical examination are nonspecific and lack the sensitivity to make an accurate and reliable diagnosis of heart failure in acutely dyspneic patients presenting to a medical facility. Although commonly available adjunct testing, including ECG, chest radiography, and serum troponin, may help at times, they do little to improve the diagnosis of heart failure.

- **Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)**: Although BNP improves the diagnosis of heart failure in some settings, it is affected by factors such as age, sex, and medications, and has a large indeterminate range. BNP may not be diagnostic in cases of flash pulmonary edema, mitral regurgitation, or obesity. Furthermore, clinical assessment correlates poorly with either BNP levels or patient outcomes, and serial BNP levels are of limited value in patient management.

Additional diagnostic accuracy may be obtained from echocardiography or invasive hemodynamic monitoring, but these tools are expensive and may not be available in acute care settings. The variation in hospital admission rates for heart failure and inaccurate physician estimates of heart failure patient risk of death suggest that a more accurate means of diagnosis could improve the appropriateness of admission and treatment decisions. Indeed, the inaccuracy of ED physicians in diagnosing ADHF delays appropriate treatment. The ideal adjunct for diagnosing ADHF would be noninvasive, inexpensive, and able to increase diagnostic accuracy.

### ACR appropriateness criteria chronic dyspnea-noncardiovascular origin [^111XpaQ7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic dyspnea may result from a variety of disorders of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, systemic, and psychogenic etiology. This article discusses guidelines for the initial imaging of six variants for chronic dyspnea of noncardiovascular origin:

1. Chronic dyspnea of unclear etiology
2. Chronic dyspnea with suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
3. Chronic dyspnea with suspected central airways disease
4. Chronic dyspnea with suspected interstitial lung disease
5. Chronic dyspnea with suspected disease of the pleura or chest wall
6. Chronic dyspnea with suspected diaphragm dysfunction

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Impact of the history of congestive heart failure on the utility of B-type natriuretic peptide in the emergency diagnosis of heart failure: Results from the Breathing Not Properly Multinational Study [^117SsDtV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

B-type natriuretic peptide is known to correlate with hemodynamic state, the presence and severity of congestive heart failure, and prognosis. Although a low-range B-type natriuretic peptide, less than 100 pg/mL, has a high negative predictive value (90%), and a high-range B-type natriuretic peptide, greater than 500 pg/mL, has a high positive predictive value (87%), there remains some ambiguity in the interpretation of results in the medium range (100–500 pg/mL). We hypothesized that considering the history of congestive heart failure along with other clinical variables would be helpful in this range of B-type natriuretic peptide levels.

- **Method**: The Breathing Not Properly Multicenter Study was an international, 7-center, prospective study including 1475 patients with a mean age of 63 years (57% were male and 54% were female). Thirty-five percent of patients with a history of congestive heart failure were enrolled, and a final diagnosis of congestive heart failure was made in 46%. The index criteria were defined as positive if any two index findings (i.e. history of coronary artery disease, lower extremity edema, pulmonary edema, cephalization of the pulmonary arteries, and cardiomegaly) were present.

- **Results**: The interval likelihood ratios (LR) for low, medium, and high B-type natriuretic peptide ranges are 0.13, 1.85, and 8.1, respectively. For medium B-type natriuretic peptide levels, a positive history of congestive heart failure makes the diagnosis of congestive heart failure more probable, with a cumulative LR of 4.3. Also, in this range, a positive index criterion was strongly indicative.

### Epidemiology of heart failure [^112ZuxLg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a contemporary overview of the epidemiology of heart failure for the practicing physician, covering prevalence and incidence, aetiology, and prognosis.

The heterogeneity of the heart failure syndrome is reflected in the existing variety of definitions and categorizations, leading to large variance in reported estimates of occurrence, hospitalizations, and mortality rates of heart failure. This paper is not intended to be a comprehensive presentation of all epidemiological reports, but rather a clinical summary of the evolving heart failure epidemic and a guide to understanding differences across studies.

### Utility of a rapid B-natriuretic peptide assay in differentiating congestive heart failure from lung disease in patients presenting with dyspnea [^113D2TeS]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Since B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted by the left ventricle (LV) in response to elevated LV pressure, we sought to assess whether a rapid assay for BNP levels could differentiate cardiac from pulmonary causes of dyspnea.

Differentiating congestive heart failure (CHF) from pulmonary causes of dyspnea is very important for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute dyspnea. BNP levels were obtained in 321 patients presenting to the ED with acute dyspnea. Physicians were blinded to BNP levels and asked to provide their probability of the patient having CHF along with their final diagnosis. Two independent cardiologists, also blinded to BNP levels, reviewed the data to evaluate which patients presented with heart failure. Patients with right heart failure from cor pulmonale were classified as having CHF.

Patients with CHF (n = 134) had BNP levels of 758.5 ± 798 pg/ml, significantly higher than the group of patients with a final diagnosis of pulmonary disease (n = 85), whose BNP was 61 ± 10 pg/ml. The area under the receiver operating curve, which plots sensitivity versus specificity for BNP levels in separating cardiac from pulmonary disease, was 0.96 (p < 0.001).

- **A breakdown of patients with pulmonary disease revealed**: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): 54 ± 71 pg/ml (n = 42); asthma: 27 ± 40 pg/ml (n = 11); acute bronchitis: 44 ± 112 pg/ml (n = 14); pneumonia: 55 ± 76 pg/ml (n = 8); tuberculosis: 93 ± 54 pg/ml (n = 2); lung cancer: 120 ± 120 pg/ml.

### Practical algorithms for early diagnosis of heart failure and heart stress using NT-proBNP: A clinical consensus statement from the Heart Failure Association of the ESC [^115gURyi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosing heart failure is often difficult due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, which can be caused by a range of medical conditions. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) have been recognized as important biomarkers for diagnosing heart failure. This document from the Heart Failure Association examines the practical uses of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in various clinical scenarios. The concentrations of NT-proBNP vary according to the patient profile and the clinical scenario; therefore, values should be interpreted with caution to ensure appropriate diagnosis. Validated cut-points are provided to rule in or rule out acute heart failure in the emergency department and to diagnose de novo heart failure in the outpatient setting.

We also coin the concept of 'heart stress' when NT-proBNP levels are elevated in an asymptomatic patient with risk factors for heart failure (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease), underlying the development of cardiac dysfunction and further increased risk. We propose a simple acronym for healthcare professionals and patients, FIND-HF, which serves as a prompt to consider heart failure: Fatigue, Increased water accumulation, Natriuretic peptide testing, and Dyspnoea. Use of this acronym would enable the early diagnosis of heart failure. Overall, understanding and utilizing NT-proBNP levels will lead to earlier and more accurate diagnoses of heart failure, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

### Comparative value of Doppler echocardiography and B-type natriuretic peptide assay in the etiologic diagnosis of acute dyspnea [^113zNUp5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

We compared the accuracy of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) assay with Doppler echocardiography for the diagnosis of decompensated congestive left-heart failure (CHF) in patients with acute dyspnea. Both BNP and Doppler echocardiography have been described as relevant diagnostic tests for heart failure.

One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients with severe dyspnea underwent BNP assay and Doppler echocardiogram on admission. The accuracy of the two methods for etiologic diagnosis was compared on the basis of the final diagnoses established by physicians who were blinded to the BNP and Doppler findings.

- **Results**: The final etiologic diagnosis was CHF in 115 patients. Twenty-four patients (15%) were misdiagnosed at admission. The BNP concentration was 1,022 ± 742 pg/ml in the CHF subgroup and 187 ± 158 pg/ml in the other patients (p < 0.01). A BNP cutoff of 300 pg/ml correctly classified 88% of the patients (odds ratio [OR] 85 [19 to 376], p < 0.0001), but a high negative predictive value (90%) was only obtained when the cutoff was lowered to 80 pg/ml. The etiologic value of BNP was low in patients with values between 80 and 300 pg/ml (OR 1.85 [0.4 to 7.8], p = 0.4) and also in patients who were studied very soon after onset of acute dyspnea. Among the 138 patients with assessable Doppler findings, a "restrictive" mitral inflow pattern had a diagnostic accuracy for CHF of 91% (OR 482 [77 to 3,011], p < 0.0001), regardless of the BNP level.

- **Conclusions**: Bedside BNP measurement and Doppler echocardiography are both useful for establishing diagnoses.

### Development and validation of a decision support tool for the diagnosis of acute heart failure: Systematic review, meta-analysis, and modelling study [^1144xQuS]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

We acknowledge several limitations of the study. Firstly, we were able to obtain individual patient-level data for 14 of 30 studies that met our eligibility criteria, introducing the possibility of selection bias. Nevertheless, the eligible studies not included had a similar prevalence of acute heart failure, publication dates, and geographical coverage, and the population had similar demographic and clinical characteristics to those that were included.

Secondly, in combining information from multiple studies, data were missing for some variables. To maximize the use of information, we utilized a hierarchical multiple imputation method. Thirdly, we did not have consistently recorded data from the electrocardiogram and chest radiograph to include these data in our model. The interpretation of NT-proBNP in patients with suspected acute heart failure should be made in conjunction with these investigations, and future studies are needed to determine whether approaches that integrate these investigations can improve the performance of CoDE-HF.

Fourthly, not all studies have adjudicated the diagnosis blinded to the results of NT-proBNP testing. In our sensitivity analysis, diagnostic performance was unchanged when we excluded the two studies in which adjudication was unblinded. Fifthly, the adjudicated diagnosis of acute heart failure did not differentiate between heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the heart failure patient: the cornerstone of effective management [^114WcJbP]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a syndrome describing a pathophysiological state with diverse etiologies. Providing an adequate mechanistic definition is difficult. The guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology define the diagnosis of heart failure based on three criteria:

- **Diagnosis criteria**: Patients should have symptoms compatible with heart failure at rest or during exercise. There should be objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest. In doubtful cases, there should be a favorable response following therapy for heart failure.

The term diagnosis derives from the Greek words "dia" and "nosi" meaning "through knowledge". It implies that a conclusion is drawn describing the patient's status based on the available information. This information is commonly based on symptoms, history, findings at physical examination, results from laboratory tests, and various non-invasive and invasive special examinations. Diagnostic precision is crucial in deciding treatment strategy, and this task presents a continuous academic and clinical challenge. Ultimately, the clinical diagnosis of heart failure is based on all the information available to the physicians. No single investigation is specific for this clinical syndrome, and management strategies attempt to modify the underlying mechanisms in order to alleviate symptoms and improve survival.

### Dyspnoea and worsening heart failure in patients with acute heart failure: results from the Pre-RELAX-AHF study [^113vXZm1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Patients assessed their dyspnoea at baseline and then at 6, 12, and 24 hours from randomization, then daily to Day 5, and finally on Day 14, using patient-reported assessment tools. These tools included two main measures:

- **Absolute dyspnoea severity**: Assessed at each time point on a visual analogue scale (VAS) using a 100 mm vertical line, upon which patients were required to draw a horizontal line rating their breathing, with 100 representing the "best imaginable health state" and zero the "worst imaginable health state".

- **Relative changes in dyspnoea**: Captured using a 7-point Likert scale. Patients were required to rate their breathing as being markedly, moderately, or minimally better; no change; or minimally, moderately, or markedly worse compared with baseline.

Dyspnoea assessment was conducted with patients lying on the bed with the head elevated to 30 degrees, legs on the bed, and oxygen withdrawn for 5 minutes. If the patient could not tolerate the position or being taken off oxygen for 5 minutes, these measures were discontinued. The patient was then requested to complete the dyspnoea assessment describing how they felt at the time the oxygen was withdrawn. Dyspnoea questionnaires were translated into all languages by certified translators.

After assessing dyspnoea, physicians were requested to perform additional clinical evaluations daily. These evaluations included assessments of orthopnoea, dyspnoea on exertion, and congestion by assessing jugular venous pressure.

### Establishing prognosis in heart failure: A multimarker approach [^1149q41f]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide, making its progression prediction crucial. This is important for both patient and physician understanding of the disease course and for determining the appropriate timing for various medications and interventions available to patients with advanced heart failure. Many features of a patient's history, laboratory findings, and imaging evaluations are correlated with prognosis.

This article begins with a review of individual markers that contribute to the risk of adverse events. These individual variables can be combined into multivariate models of outcome, most commonly expressed as life expectancy or probability of death within a certain time period. A representative sample of the better-validated models in heart failure patients is then summarized and compared.

The value in applying these predictors to several specific points in medical decision-making is highlighted.

### What causes exertional dyspnoea in patients with atrial fibrillation? Implications for catheter ablation in patients with heart failure [^111QQXPS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

Recently, the effect of catheter ablation in the setting of a randomized controlled trial was evaluated in a subgroup of patients who participated in the CABANA trial. The investigators identified 778 patients who were considered to have heart failure, of whom nearly 75% had an ejection fraction of 50% or greater. The investigators reported that death for any reason occurred in fewer patients assigned to ablation; however, the trial recorded only 60 deaths, leading to imprecise estimates that are prone to yielding non-reproducible results. Interestingly, there were only 30 cardiovascular deaths and only 10 deaths due to heart failure in the trial, even though the median follow-up was 4 years; these low event rates are incompatible with the diagnosis of heart failure. When the number of deaths in a trial is sparse, investigators typically look toward the treatment effect on hospitalizations for heart failure. However, in the CABANA trial, catheter ablation did not reduce the risk of these non-fatal serious adverse heart failure events (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.44).

### Diagnosis and evaluation of heart failure [^115Y881R]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common clinical syndrome characterized by dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of volume overload, which may include peripheral edema and pulmonary rales. Heart failure has high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in older persons. Many conditions, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, can cause or lead to the decompensation of chronic heart failure.

Up to 40 to 50 percent of patients with heart failure have diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular function, and the overall mortality is similar to that of systolic heart failure. The initial evaluation includes a history and physical examination, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and laboratory assessment to identify causes or precipitating factors. A displaced cardiac apex, a third heart sound, and chest radiography findings of venous congestion or interstitial edema are useful in identifying heart failure.

Systolic heart failure is unlikely when the Framingham criteria are not met or when B-type natriuretic peptide level is normal. Echocardiography is the diagnostic standard to confirm systolic or diastolic heart failure through assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction. Evaluation for ischemic heart disease is warranted in patients with heart failure, especially if angina is present, given that coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure.

### Relationship between heart failure and the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD [^114bogZC]. Thorax (2021). Low credibility.

These results suggest that heart failure (HF) may be an underlying factor triggering the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are a number of challenges facing clinicians in the management of patients with COPD and HF. COPD exacerbation is a diagnosis of exclusion, with no biomarkers for exacerbation; the overlapping symptoms with HF make misdiagnosis possible. Similarly, the signs and symptoms of HF are non-specific, and many patients with HF are initially treated for exacerbation of other conditions. COPD and HF share common risk factors (e.g. smoking) and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, fatigue, exercise intolerance), which can complicate diagnosis.

Air trapping due to pulmonary disease can affect echocardiogram acoustic windows, leading to unsatisfactory imaging quality and making diagnosis more difficult. The severity of COPD may be overestimated in patients with comorbid HF, as part of the reduction in lung function may be caused by HF. In patients with COPD, the median time between symptom presentation and HF diagnosis in UK primary care has been shown to exceed 3 years, compared with only 2.4 years in patients without COPD. HF treatment is also delayed in patients with COPD, who wait 2.9 years compared with only 1.9 years for those without COPD.

There are currently no bespoke guidelines available for the management of patients with both COPD and HF, despite the ongoing debate around the use of beta-agonists and the lingering hesitancy around beta-blocker (BB) use, which appears to be largely unfounded. There is increasing recognition of the multimorbid patient, but the translation of this into practice remains limited.

### Influence of history of heart failure on diagnostic performance and utility of B-type natriuretic peptide testing for acute dyspnea in the emergency department [^114szVzd]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a history of heart failure (HF) on emergency department (ED) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) testing and the impact of BNP level feedback to ED physicians.

- **Methods**: Admission BNP was measured in 143 patients (mean age 79 ± 10 years) presenting to the ED with dyspnea. Emergency department physicians scored the probability of HF as the cause of dyspnea and categorized the cause of dyspnea. An independent cardiologist determined the cause of dyspnea after chart review. In 83 patients, ED physicians rescored and reclassified patients after BNP measurement and evaluated test utility.

- **Results**: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for BNP diagnosis of HF as the cause of dyspnea was significantly worse in patients with a history of HF than those without (0.74 vs. 0.94, P < .01), and in those with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (0.64 vs. 0.87, P < .05). A BNP cut point of 100 pg/mL had 100% sensitivity but only 41% specificity for diagnosing acute HF, whereas a cut point of 400 pg/mL had 87% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Emergency department physicians rated BNP useful in 64% of patients, and diagnostic uncertainty was reduced from 53% to 25% (P < .001).

- **Conclusion**: B-type natriuretic peptide test performance for diagnosis of dyspnea is significantly reduced in patients with a history of HF and must be taken into consideration in the evaluation of such patients in the ED.
