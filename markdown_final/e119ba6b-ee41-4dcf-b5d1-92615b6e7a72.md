## Question

Which medications are used to treat urinary frequency and urgency?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are used to treat urinary frequency and urgency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether these symptoms map to overactive bladder (OAB) and confirm the diagnostic frame. Then, I should identify guideline-endorsed first-line pharmacologic classes. Next, I will enumerate representative drugs with regulatory support and typical formulations. After that, I need to consider mechanisms, common adverse effects, and patient-specific selection, including cognitive and blood pressure risks. Finally, I should verify escalation strategies for inadequate response and integrate nonpharmacologic measures to complete the management plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Urinary frequency and urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of infection or overt pathology, fit the definition of OAB used by contemporary guidelines and the International Continence Society; I should ensure we are indeed discussing idiopathic, non-neurogenic OAB rather than secondary causes like UTI, bladder outlet obstruction, or stones before applying OAB pharmacotherapy, but the therapeutic classes are anchored to this OAB construct.

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations to anchor first-line medication choices. Wait, let me verify that current guidance still prioritizes two classes: antimuscarinics (anticholinergics) and beta-3 adrenergic agonists; both the 2024 AUA/SUFU and 2025 EAU/EAUN guidelines recommend offering either class as initial pharmacotherapy for OAB after conservative measures, with selection driven by side-effect profile and patient factors [^115mRFEv].

> I will now enumerate representative agents to make this actionable. For antimuscarinics, commonly used options include oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, trospium, and fesoterodine; tolterodine and solifenacin have clear FDA-labeled indications for urgency, frequency, and urge urinary incontinence in OAB, which I should explicitly acknowledge, and oxybutynin is widely used in multiple formulations including transdermal, though choice should align with tolerance and access considerations; for the beta-3 class, mirabegron is the principal oral agent recommended by guidelines as an alternative or add-on when appropriate [^115Bgfyv] [^111qcbTf] [^114Hwjsr] [^116sgcXs] [^115mRFEv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without recalling how these drugs work. Antimuscarinics reduce involuntary detrusor contractions by blocking M2/M3 muscarinic receptors in the bladder, thereby reducing urgency and frequency, while beta-3 agonists such as mirabegron facilitate detrusor relaxation during the storage phase to increase bladder capacity; this complementary pharmacology underpins both monotherapy selection and combination strategies when monotherapy is inadequate.

> Now, I need to ensure the selection is individualized by adverse-effect profile and comorbidities. I should confirm that antimuscarinics carry anticholinergic burden risks such as dry mouth and constipation and, importantly, guideline-cited concerns for cognitive impairment and dementia with long-term use in older adults, prompting caution or preference-shifting toward beta-3 agonists in patients at cognitive risk; conversely, mirabegron may raise blood pressure, so I should screen and monitor for hypertension or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease when choosing it [^114uj6Cg] [^114HNEYG] [^115VfpUx].

> Let me consider formulation and tolerability next. Extended-release antimuscarinic formulations generally have better tolerability than immediate-release, and transdermal delivery of oxybutynin can reduce xerostomia relative to oral forms; guidelines also specifically suggest favoring ER formulations when possible, and I should double-check anticholinergic burden and comorbidities in candidates for these agents to optimize safety and adherence [^112s1qgW] [^115Bgfyv] [^112wwQks].

> If symptom control is suboptimal on a single agent, I should review escalation strategies. The AUA/SUFU guideline supports switching to another agent within or across classes for tolerability or efficacy, and combining an antimuscarinic with a beta-3 agonist when monotherapy response is insufficient; for refractory OAB despite optimized oral therapy, intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA 100 U is FDA-approved with randomized trial evidence demonstrating significant reductions in incontinence and micturitions at 12 weeks, although counseling on intermittent catheterization risk is part of standard practice [^117TY3iy] [^113gt1ZW] [^115f7NH6].

> But wait, I need to emphasize that medications sit on a foundation of behavioral care. Bladder training and pelvic floor muscle therapy improve urgency/frequency and are recommended first-line and as adjuncts to pharmacotherapy; lifestyle counseling such as fluid/diet optimization, weight loss when BMI exceeds 25 kg/m², and mindfulness-based strategies can further enhance outcomes; importantly, there is insufficient evidence for nutraceuticals or supplements in OAB, so I should steer patients toward evidence-based combinations and arrange early follow-up after starting antimuscarinic or beta-3 therapy to assess efficacy and side effects [^113sLkc5] [^113SiSEo] [^112JwcT6] [^112Kk3Xe] [^114WuQL6] [^116UcHTU] [^113zcERc].

> Finally, let me synthesize the practical answer. For urinary frequency and urgency consistent with idiopathic OAB, offer either an antimuscarinic (for example, oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, trospium, or fesoterodine) or a beta-3 agonist (mirabegron), selecting based on side-effect profiles, comorbidities, and patient preference; favor ER formulations for tolerability, consider a class switch or combination therapy if monotherapy is inadequate, and escalate to onabotulinumtoxinA for refractory symptoms, all while maintaining behavioral therapy and close follow-up; in older or cognitively vulnerable patients, I should confirm the discussion of anticholinergic cognitive risks and often prioritize beta-3 therapy, while in patients with hypertension I should verify suitability before choosing mirabegron [^112qdqSw] [^111hBCo2] [^114uj6Cg] [^115mRFEv] [^115f7NH6].

For urinary frequency and urgency, the main medication classes are **antimuscarinics** and **beta-3 agonists** [^112qdqSw] [^115mRFEv], with onabotulinumtoxinA reserved for refractory cases. Antimuscarinics (oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, trospium) reduce urgency and frequency [^115HbHH7] but can cause dry mouth [^111qcbTf], constipation [^114Hwjsr], and **cognitive effects** [^114uj6Cg], especially in older adults [^114HNEYG]. Beta-3 agonists (mirabegron, vibegron) are effective and have fewer cognitive effects [^112qdqSw] but can **raise blood pressure** [^115VfpUx]. OnabotulinumtoxinA is used when oral therapy fails [^112qdqSw]; **urinary retention** [^115f7NH6] is a key risk [^115VfpUx]. Treatment should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and side-effect profile [^111hBCo2]; consider combination therapy [^113gt1ZW] or switching classes [^117AHSHa] if monotherapy is inadequate [^117TY3iy].

| **Medication class** | **Medications** | **Mechanism of action** | **Common side effects** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Antimuscarinics | - Oxybutynin <br/> - Tolterodine <br/> - Solifenacin <br/> - Darifenacin <br/> - Fesoterodine <br/> - Trospium | Block muscarinic receptors to reduce detrusor contractions | - Dry mouth [^111qcbTf] <br/> - Constipation [^114Hwjsr] <br/> - Cognitive impairment [^114uj6Cg] | - Use caution in elderly [^114HNEYG] <br/> - Avoid in narrow-angle glaucoma [^114Hwjsr] <br/> - Consider ER formulations for tolerability [^113m6K6s] [^115Bgfyv] |
| Beta-3 agonists | Mirabegron and Vibegron | Stimulate β3 receptors to relax detrusor muscle | - Hypertension [^115VfpUx] <br/> - Headache <br/> - Nasopharyngitis | Preferred in elderly or those at cognitive risk [^112qdqSw]; monitor BP [^115VfpUx] |
| OnabotulinumtoxinA | Botox | Inhibits acetylcholine release, reducing detrusor activity | Urinary retention and UTIs [^115f7NH6] | For refractory cases; monitor post-void residual [^112qdqSw] |

---

The **key points** are that antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists are **first-line pharmacotherapy** [^112qdqSw], while onabotulinumtoxinA is for refractory cases [^115f7NH6]. Individualize therapy based on **patient factors** and **side-effect profiles** [^111hBCo2], and consider **combination therapy** [^113gt1ZW] or **class switching** [^117TY3iy] if needed.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA is a well tolerated and effective treatment for refractory overactive bladder in real-world practice [^115VfpUx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterized by the International Continence Society as "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology". An estimated 546 million people worldwide are affected by symptoms consistent with OAB; approximately 423 million have urinary incontinence (UI).

UI as a result of OAB can significantly affect quality of life (QoL). Due to social embarrassment, many patients suffer from low self-esteem, resulting in avoidance and limited social behavior. Many aspects of daily life can be impacted by UI, including physical activity, travel, relationships, sexual activity, and quality of sleep. It is also associated with further medical problems such as falls and dermatitis. There is also a substantial direct cost to the patient with UI, primarily from the use of absorbent products, as well as indirect sequelae costs.

First-line pharmacological treatments for OAB with UI include anticholinergic medications and beta-3 agonists. Anticholinergic medications are not always effective over time and can be associated with side effects of dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and an increased risk of dementia. Beta-3 agonists have been associated with side effects such as constipation, dry mouth, headaches, and an increased risk of hypertension.

OnabotulinumtoxinA 100 U is approved in many countries for the treatment of OAB with symptoms of urge UI, urgency, and frequency in adults.

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, 24-week clinical studies were conducted in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) featuring symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency (Studies OAB-1 and OAB-2). Participants needed to have at least 3 urinary urgency incontinence episodes and at least 24 micturitions over 3 days to qualify for the studies. In total, 1105 patients, whose symptoms were not adequately managed with anticholinergic therapy (either due to inadequate response or intolerable side effects), were randomized to receive either 100 Units of Botox (n = 557) or placebo (n = 548). Patients received 20 injections of the study drug (5 Units of Botox or placebo) spaced approximately 1 cm apart into the detrusor muscle.

In both studies, significant improvements over placebo in the primary efficacy variable — change from baseline in daily frequency of urinary incontinence episodes — were observed for Botox 100 Units at the primary time point of week 12. Significant improvements over placebo were also noted for the secondary efficacy variables: daily frequency of micturition episodes and volume voided per micturition.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^115WcCwr]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder management presents significant challenges, with treatment failures and medication non-adherence posing substantial barriers to patient outcomes. Early prediction of these challenges could enable timely interventions and treatment modifications.

- **Objectives**: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence-based prediction model for early identification of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder patients, with specific focus on different pathological subgroups including diabetic neuropathy.

- **Methods**: In this single-center retrospective study (January 2018-April 2025), we analyzed data from 285 patients with overactive bladder. We developed and validated artificial intelligence models using comprehensive clinical parameters, including ultrasonography findings, uroflowmetry results, standardized voiding diaries, and disease-specific questionnaire outcomes. Primary outcome measures were treatment failure and medication non-adherence at three months.

- **Results**: The gradient boosting model achieved an accuracy of 87.3% (95% CI: 84.1–90.5%) for predicting treatment failure and 85.1% (95% CI: 81.8–88.4%) for predicting medication non-adherence. Key predictive factors included early changes in bladder wall thickness (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.14–6.81), diabetes duration > 7 years (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.58–4.72), and urgency improvement < 25% (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.76–4.92). Treatment failure rates varied significantly among pathological subgroups, with highest rates in diabetic neuropathy (42.8%) and lowest in idiopathic OAB (28.6%).

### Detrol [^111qcbTf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Detrol tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received Detrol 2 mg twice daily and 685 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency, and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies.

- **Efficacy endpoints for study 007**:

	- The change from baseline for the number of incontinence episodes per week; number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days); and volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days).

- **Efficacy endpoints for studies 008, 009, and 010**:

	- Identical to the above endpoints with the exception that the number of incontinence episodes was per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days).

### The causes and consequences of overactive bladder [^115BkUas]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), usually with frequency and nocturia. OAB affects approximately 17% of women in the United States and Europe. The causes of OAB, as with many bladder disorders, are multifactorial and are not completely understood.

The primary functions of the lower urinary tract (bladder and bladder outlet mechanism) are storage and evacuation of urine. The bladder and the micturition cycle are under complex neural control involving both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Micturition may occur in response to the activation of receptors in the bladder muscle and detection of chemical stimuli by receptors within the bladder lining.

Neurogenic or myogenic bladder dysfunction can lead to symptoms of urgency, frequency, and UUI that characterize OAB. The consequences of this condition are far-reaching and include direct medical consequences and coping strategies that adversely affect quality of life. Although the prevalence of OAB increases with age, it is not a normal consequence of aging.

Antimuscarinic agents (e.g. oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium, solifenacin, and darifenacin) have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of OAB symptoms in multiple clinical trials. This review explores the physiological basis for OAB, the effects of OAB on health-related quality of life, and the pharmacotherapies that may provide relief to patients with this distressing condition.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with antimuscarinic drugs for overactive bladder [^113m6K6s]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic drugs are commonly used in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) who do not achieve symptom relief and quality of life improvement with conservative management. Several drugs, with different doses, formulations, and routes of administration are currently available, making the choice quite difficult.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses, formulations, and routes of administration of the available anticholinergic drugs, a systematic review of the literature was performed in August 2007 using Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Efficacy end points, including micturitions per 24 hours, volume voided per micturition, urgency urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and incontinence episodes per 24 hours, as well as safety end points, mainly adverse events and withdrawal rates, were evaluated in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the role of anticholinergic drugs in non-neurogenic OAB. A meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted using the Review Manager software 4.2 (Cochrane Collaboration).

Our systematic search identified 50 RCTs and three pooled analyses. Tolterodine immediate release (IR) had a more favorable profile of adverse events than oxybutynin IR. Regarding different dosages of IR formulations, dose escalation might yield some limited improvements in efficacy but at the cost of a significant increase in the rate of adverse events. In comparisons between IR and extended-release (ER) formulations, the latter showed some advantages, both in terms of efficacy and safety.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^115UbSTQ]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex defined by the International Continence Society as urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. It is important to emphasize that OAB is primarily a symptom-based clinical diagnosis that does not require urodynamic confirmation of detrusor overactivity. While detrusor overactivity (an urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase) may be present in many OAB patients, the correlation is imperfect, and the two conditions are not synonymous. Approximately 54% of patients with OAB symptoms demonstrate detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing; conversely, not all patients with urodynamically confirmed detrusor overactivity report OAB symptoms.

This clinical distinction is crucial because OAB is diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms rather than urodynamic findings. Urodynamic studies may provide additional information about bladder function but are not necessary for diagnosis and are typically reserved for complex cases or when invasive treatments are being considered. The diagnosis and initial management of OAB should focus on the symptom complex that significantly impacts patients' quality of life rather than on the presence or absence of detrusor overactivity.

This symptom complex significantly impacts patient quality of life and presents substantial challenges in clinical management. Despite advancements in treatment, this area continues to require focused attention to improve patient outcomes.

### The placebo effect in overactive bladder syndrome [^114iBZSJ]. Nature Reviews. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a condition that involves urinary urgency, and affected individuals are usually treated with behavioral therapy and antimuscarinic agents as first-line therapies. Existing evidence from clinical trial data suggests that a positive placebo effect occurs in patients receiving treatment for OAB. In our systematic review of placebo-controlled, randomized trials in OAB, we show statistically significant improvements in three patient-reported outcomes: incontinence episodes per day, micturition episodes per day, and mean micturition volume from baseline, after placebo in randomized studies for OAB. The findings could highlight the brain's role in the pathophysiology of OAB or the role of additional bladder training conducted as part of OAB clinical trials. More research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of the placebo effect in OAB.

### Factors influencing treatment strategy for overactive bladder in the National Institute of Health All of Us Research Program [^114bUH8b]. Urogynecology (2025). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence, affecting up to 43% of women. While treatment disparities are well-documented, this study sheds light on broader systemic barriers and the need for equitable approaches to improve diagnosis and management.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to examine the types of OAB treatments (no treatment, pharmacotherapy, advanced therapy) received by patients in the United States, stratified by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors, using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

- **Study design**: Data were collected from 20,941 female patients diagnosed with OAB in the All of Us Research Hub. Patients were categorized into three treatment groups: no treatment, pharmacotherapy, or advanced therapy. Demographic factors such as race, ethnicity, age, income, and health status were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to determine the influence on treatment type.

- **Results**: Of the participants, 71% received no treatment, 27% were treated with pharmacotherapy, and 2% underwent advanced therapy. On multivariate analysis, Asian and Hispanic patients were less likely to receive pharmacotherapy compared to White patients (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.47 [0.31–0.72] and 0.84 [0.74–0.95] respectively). Additionally, factors such as increasing age, unemployment, and lower income were associated with greater odds of receiving pharmacotherapy.

- **Conclusions**: Significant differences exist in the treatment of OAB, particularly among Asian and Hispanic patients.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^111q3o1q]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

The incidence of refractory overactive bladder (OAB) seems to be overestimated. An unsatisfactory improvement of symptoms in the first-line treatment option of patients with OAB may depend on various factors. Realistic estimation of treatment outcomes and side effects by the patient and/or the physician, individual patient guidance to improve the patient's motivation to adhere to treatment, review of the OAB diagnosis, exclusion of other underlying causes, and individual antimuscarinic dose adjustment are procedures which can improve the success of OAB therapy in daily medical practice. The authors suggest using the term "refractory OAB" only in cases when the aforementioned steps have confirmed the patient's nonresponse to first-line treatment, including antimuscarinic therapy.

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113RMZBc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to general principles, AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering a combination of one or more of the following when symptoms of overactive bladder do not adequately respond to monotherapy:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Noninvasive techniques aimed at reducing symptoms.
- **Noninvasive therapy**: Interventions that do not require surgery or insertion of instruments into the body.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: Medication-based approaches.
- **Minimally invasive therapies**: Procedures that require minimal incisions or penetration.

### Which anticholinergic is best for people with overactive bladders? A network meta-analysis [^112s1qgW]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to carry out a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of anticholinergic drug treatments for individuals with overactive bladders.

- **Methods**: Comprehensive searches for relevant RCTs were conducted, beginning with those included in prior systematic reviews, with the most recent search in February 2017. The searches incorporated terms for anticholinergic drugs such as tolterodine, oxybutynin, trospium, propiverine, solifenacin, darifenacin, imidafenacin, and fesoterodine. Data were extracted from systematic reviews or study reports for cure or improvement rates, voids per 24 hours, leakage episodes per 24 hours, and instances of dry mouth. The data analysis was performed using a frequentist network meta-analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 128 studies were identified. No clearly superior treatment was found for cure or improvement. The differences among treatments regarding voids and leakages were minimal and unlikely to be of clinical significance. Transdermal delivery of oxybutynin was notably the most effective treatment for reducing dry mouth, although it still underperformed compared to placebo.

- **Conclusions**: All anticholinergic drugs showed superiority over placebo in effectiveness, but, with the exception of dry mouth, they exhibited similar effects. Transdermal oxybutynin resulted in less dry mouth than other treatments and may be considered as the primary treatment option.

### Overactive bladder: A better understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^115ECyJw]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed information regarding the updated definitions, prevalence, etiologies, disease burden, and management of overactive bladder (OAB) from a number of perspectives, including professional impact and patient quality of life.

Published literature and treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the understanding and management of OAB. OAB is a symptom syndrome including urinary urgency with or without urinary incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia. Approximately 17% of the adult population experience OAB. There are evolving theories regarding its pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of the most commonly prescribed pharmacological therapy, antimuscarinic agents. Treatment primarily revolves around improving quality of life.

Behavioral therapy combined with pharmacological therapy often results in acceptable outcomes for patients with OAB. Modalities such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, and various surgical interventions are also showing encouraging results in more refractory patients.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^116mVciz]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

- **Study characteristics**: Considering fair- and good-quality RCTs identified in this update, trial sample size of included populations ranged from 60 to 3,080 participants. Trial durations spanned from 4 to 52 weeks, with a median duration of 12 weeks. Of the 12 trials that reported a funding source, all but one were funded by industry. The mean age of patients was 57.4 years (SD 13.4), with a mean BMI of 28.4.

- **Patient demographics**: Similar to RCTs included in the 2012 review, the majority of patients were female (77.7%) and White (89.7%). Urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) was the most common form of overactive bladder (OAB) at 58.6%, followed by mixed incontinence (22.2%) and then OAB without incontinence (19.4%).

- **Baseline characteristics**: Patients experienced a mean duration of 67.4 months of OAB symptoms, with 59.2% having previous pharmacotherapy for OAB. At baseline, patients reported a mean of 3 incontinence episodes, 6.1 urgency episodes, and 2.5 UUI episodes per day. Consistent with previously included RCTs, baseline incontinence episodes per day ranged from 1.9 to 8.9, with a median of 2.78. Baseline numbers of urgency and UUI episodes were more consistent, ranging from 4.2 to 8.2 urgency episodes and 1.7 to 3.9 UUI episodes per day.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116Ue1jV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We abstracted information on baseline population characteristics, interventions, subject enrollment and discontinuation, and results for effectiveness and harms outcomes.

- **Efficacy outcomes**: These examined changes from the baseline number of incontinence and urgency (grade 3 or 4) episodes, micturition frequency, and the proportion of patients reporting no incontinence over three days at the end of the study. Patient-reported symptom assessment was conducted using the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Symptom Bother score, or the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). The PPBC contains six items assessing change scores from −2 to 2, with negative scores indicating improvement; however, a clinically meaningful difference has not yet been established. The OAB-q Symptom Bother score contains eight items on a 100-point scale, with a suggested minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of ten points. The OABSS contains four questions assessing daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urge urinary incontinence (UUI) with a maximum score of 2, 3, 5, and 5, respectively (higher scores indicate worse symptoms), leading to a total possible score of 15. An MCID of 3 points has been suggested.

- **Harm outcomes**: These included withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined by individual studies, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, QT prolongation, arrhythmia, and other cardiac outcomes. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer.

### Muscarinic receptor antagonists for overactive bladder treatment: does one fit all [^116Q7ApC]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To review evidence and regulatory dosing recommendations for muscarinic receptor antagonists used in the treatment of overactive bladder symptom complex, including darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium, in special patient populations.

- **Recent findings**: Growing evidence demonstrates the effects of renal impairment, hepatic impairment, genetics, and/or comedications on the pharmacokinetics of muscarinic antagonists. These factors may cause greater exposure in the respective populations, potentially leading to increased risks for side effects. Consequently, drug-specific regulatory dosing recommendations or contraindications may be necessary for certain patient populations.

- **Summary**: Physicians should be aware of pharmacokinetic alterations in special patient populations and the possible associated risks. The evidence-based choice of a muscarinic antagonist in such patients should be guided by its specific pharmacokinetic profile.

### What are the chances of improvement or cure from overactive bladder? A pooled responder analysis of efficacy and treatment emergent adverse events following treatment with fesoterodine [^1126Z6VR]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Age stratification**: The sample consisted of 4340 patients aged 75 years. For all three treatment groups combined, at Week 4, a 50% response in UUE was reported by 19.9% of patients aged 75 years. At Week 8, this response was reported by 9.0% of the same age group, and at Week 12, the responses were 30.9%, 28.7%, and 25.4%, respectively. For a 50% response in UUI, the proportions at Week 4 were 63.3%, 62.9%, and 57.6%; at Week 8, they were 59.4%, 62.4%, and 43.2%. By Week 12, a 50% response in UUI was reported in 74.1% of patients aged 75 years.

- **Sex**: For all three treatment groups combined, at Week 4, 20.4% of 5080 women and 15.0% of 1154 men reported a 50% response in UUE. At Week 8, these proportions were 8.5% of 1265 women and 9.2% of 338 men. By Week 12, 30.9% of women and 25.4% of men reported a 50% response. For a 50% response in UUI per 24 hours, these proportions were, at Week 4, 62.5% of 4841 women and 63.6% of 1037 men; at Week 8, 56.6% of 1048 women and 67.6% of 225 men. By Week 12, 72.7% of 4906 women and 77.3% of 1049 men reported a 50% response.

The proportions of patients achieving a 100% response to each variable are shown in Tables 2 and 3, which are not included here but are referenced in the content.

### Undertreatment of overactive bladder among men with lower urinary tract symptoms in the United States: A retrospective observational study [^1163tzvx]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

The age-standardized prevalence estimate reported here (12.2%) falls in the range of other published estimates, which have ranged from 3.5% to 19.0%. The variation in estimates may be due to a number of reasons. Within studies conducted using administrative and claims data sets, variation in specific LUTS definition and/or study population, and inclusion criteria may result in variability of epidemiological estimates. Prevalence estimates of OAB and LUTS generated from database studies (which describe populations of patients with treatment-seeking behavior) have been historically lower than cross-sectional studies where LUTS are self-reported. There is evidence that a high proportion of males with LUTS symptoms do not seek medical help; these individuals would be captured in a study where the condition is defined based on self-reported symptoms, but not in a study relying on administrative data. Overall, the prevalence estimated here can be regarded as a more accurate representation of the prevalence of LUTS among commercially insured, treatment-seeking males in the United States.

An important limitation of the present study is that treatment persistence and adherence were not investigated, which limited the ability to assess treatment switching. In this study, a substantially higher proportion of patients who received OAB therapy as their primary therapy subsequently switched to BPH therapy compared with patients who first received BPH therapy and subsequently switched to OAB therapy.

### Bother related to bladder control and health care seeking behavior in adults in the United States [^111SYKhh]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We measured patient-reported bother due to overactive bladder syndrome, patterns of physician consultation, and prescription medication use for overactive bladder symptoms in adults in the United States.

A survey sample was derived from a consumer panel of 600,000 American households developed to match the United States Census of 260,000 adults. The survey included the Overactive Bladder-Validated 8 awareness tool, which consists of eight questions measuring the degree of bother due to specific bladder symptoms. A score of 8 or greater denotes probable overactive bladder. Additional questions probed treatment patterns, health care consultation, overactive bladder diagnosis, treatment type, and prescription treatment use. A nonrespondent telephone survey in 1,004 participants was conducted to evaluate differences between mail survey respondents and nonrespondents.

The response rate was 63% (162,906 respondents). Women represented 55.1% of the sample, and 21.8% of respondents were 65 years old or older. Symptom bother, as determined by an Overactive Bladder-Validated 8 score of 8 or greater, was reported by 26.6% of the total sample, including 23.7% of men and 28.9% of women. The percentage of men and women reporting bother increased with age. Of respondents with probable overactive bladder, only 45.7% had discussed the symptoms with a medical provider, 22.5% had previously used prescription medication for overactive bladder, 13.5% had used overactive bladder medication in the last 12 months, and 8.1% were currently on treatment.

### Prevalence of commonly prescribed medications potentially contributing to urinary symptoms in a cohort of older patients seeking care for incontinence [^116FAJHG]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, urinary incontinence, and voiding difficulties are highly prevalent and bothersome. They impair quality of life and are associated with falls in the elderly. The etiology of lower urinary tract symptoms may be singular or multifactorial, with potential contributors including lifestyle habits, underlying bladder or pelvic floor dysfunction, associated co-morbidities, and functional factors. Many commonly used medications have been proposed to inadvertently interfere with bladder and/or sphincter function or indirectly impair the ability to toilet.

- **Common medications**:
	- The use of oral estrogens, alpha-blocking agents, sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and calcium channel blockers have all been implicated to some degree in the onset or exacerbation of urinary symptoms.

- **Specific associations**:
	- Stress urinary incontinence has been associated with the use of alpha-blocking agents, which reduce urethral sphincter tone and with the consumption of ACE inhibitors in patients who experience treatment-related cough. Loop diuretics promote polyuria and can lead to urinary urgency and frequency, while NSAIDs and other medications known to cause edema may exacerbate nocturia due to nocturnal fluid redistribution.

Centrally active medication may exert direct effects on the lower urinary tract system by causing relaxation of striated pelvic floor muscles and interfering with afferent sensory messages from the bladder.

### Overactive bladder medication access [^112DmAT9]. Urogynecology (2024). High credibility.

The price range, insurance coverage, and side effect burden of overactive bladder medications is broad and varied. An internal quality improvement project was undertaken to improve patients' ability to access and ultimately adhere to preferred medication therapy for the treatment of overactive bladder.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to increase the percentage of patients per month at an academic urogynecology practice who receive their preferred overactive bladder medication from a baseline of 39.5% to 45%.

- **Study design**: Data were extracted via Epic report. Manual chart review and calls to patients and/or pharmacies were completed to obtain the status of medication access and reasons why medications were not taken. A targeted intervention was implemented with the creation of a written document to help guide patients with options to decrease prescription costs. After this document was embedded into Epic after-visit summary documentation, a repeat analysis was performed.

- **Results**: The most common barrier to medication access was cost; specifically, the medication was not covered and a prior authorization was not initiated. Before the intervention, more than 60% of patients did not persist with their initially prescribed overactive bladder medication at a 6-month follow-up interval from the office visit. Following the implementation of a cost-navigation guide, persistence increased to 45.5% at a 3-month follow-up interval.

- **Conclusions**: A targeted intervention on cost navigation of prescriptions can have a positive effect on patient access and persistence in using overactive bladder medication.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115HbHH7]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). High credibility.

In this systematic review update, we identified 20 new RCTs (in 38 records and 3 new publications for trials identified in the previous systematic review) published since the 31 RCTs included in the 2012 review. See Fig. 1 for the PRISMA flow diagram. We also included the full publication and data from an RCT comparing darifenacin vs. solifenacin that was only published as an abstract at the time of the 2012 review. This study and five others (in six records) were rated poor quality due to unclear allocation concealment, blinding, and issues related to missing data, and were not discussed in this report.

Five RCTs were rated good quality and 10 were fair quality. Since mirabegron was approved after the 2012 review, all evidence involving mirabegron is new (14 RCTs total). Two new comparisons added were fesoterodine vs. solifenacin and darifenacin vs. trospium. Excluded studies with reasons for exclusion are listed in Table S3. Detailed study characteristics and quality assessments of included studies are in Tables S4 and S5.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: Nuances and considerations [^112rMG9f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex including urinary urgency, frequency, and/or nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence. While common in the general population, OAB disproportionately impacts older adults in both prevalence and severity. Population-based studies estimate over a third of older adults suffer from OAB. The condition is also associated with significant psychosocial and health-related quality-of-life costs in the elderly, causing increased social isolation, anxiety, depression, and fall risk. Its economic burden is substantial as well; a 2010 analysis estimated a national cost of $83 billion by 2020, over half of which arises from costs associated with patients over age 65.

Updated 2019 guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction on the diagnosis and management of OAB provide a treatment algorithm based on progression from least to most invasive options. Behavioral therapies and lifestyle modifications represent the foundation, with pharmacotherapy as second-line therapy, and procedural interventions as third-line options.

Pharmacotherapy for OAB, which includes anticholinergic and/or beta-3 agonist medications, is often problematic in elderly patients. Anticholinergics have well-known side effects of constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, core temperature dysregulation, and cognitive impairment. Of particular concern in the elderly, recent studies have suggested a strong association between anticholinergic use and risk of incident cognitive impairment.

### Symptom assessment tool for overactive bladder syndrome — overactive bladder symptom score [^113M79R7]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common symptom syndrome characterized by urgency, urinary frequency, and urgency incontinence. To collectively express OAB symptoms, we developed the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS).

- **Methods**: Four symptoms — daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence — were scored. The weighting score was based on a secondary analysis of an epidemiologic database. Psychometric properties were examined in five patient groups: OAB (n = 83), asymptomatic controls (n = 34), stress incontinence (n = 29), benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 28), and other diseases with urinary symptoms (n = 26).

- **Results**: The maximal score was defined as 2, 3, 5, and 5 for daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence, respectively. The sum score (OABSS 0 to 15) was significantly higher in patients with OAB (8.36) than in the other patient groups (1.82 to 5.14). The distribution of the OABSS showed a clear separation between those with OAB and asymptomatic controls. The OABSS correlated positively with the individual scores (Spearman's r = 0.10 to 0.78) and quality-of-life scores assessed by the King's Health Questionnaire (Spearman's r = 0.20 to 0.49). The weighted kappa coefficients ranged from 0.804 to 1.0 for each symptom score and were 0.861 for OABSS. The posttreatment reduction in the OABSS was consistent with the patients' global impressions of therapeutic efficacy.

- **Conclusions**: The OABSS, as the sum score of four symptoms (daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and urgency incontinence), has been developed.

### Medical therapy for the overactive bladder in the elderly [^112Jnwdc]. Age and Ageing (2002). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is the most common underlying bladder disorder causing urinary incontinence in elderly people. Management of the condition relies upon a holistic assessment of the problem, lifestyle adjustment, behavioral management, and drug therapy. The majority of currently available drugs rely on their anti-muscarinic properties for efficacy. Both behavioral techniques and drug therapy are effective in the treatment of the elderly, and each modality has a particular role to play in the successful treatment and maintenance of this condition.

### Tolterodine: A safe and effective treatment for older patients with overactive bladder [^114PSKTh]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2001). High credibility.

To investigate the clinical safety and efficacy of two dosages of tolterodine in older patients with symptoms attributable to overactive bladder, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational, phase III study was conducted. The study was set in incontinence, older care, urological, and urogynecological clinics in the United Kingdom, France, and the Republic of Ireland.

The participants were one hundred and seventy-seven older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) with symptoms of urinary urgency, increased frequency of micturition (≥ 8 micturitions/24 hours), and/or urge incontinence (≥ 1 episode/24 hours). The intervention involved administering tolterodine 1 mg or 2 mg twice daily (bid), or placebo, for 4 weeks.

- **Measurements**: Safety and tolerability were evaluated through spontaneously reported adverse events, electrocardiograms, and blood pressure measurements. Efficacy was assessed using micturition diary variables, specifically the mean change from baseline in the frequency of micturition and the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours.

- **Results**: The mean age of the patient population was 75 years. Overall, ≥ 87% of patients completed the study. Neither dosage of tolterodine was associated with serious drug-related adverse events during the study, and no cardiac arrhythmogenic events were noted. Dry mouth (mild to moderate intensity) was the most common adverse event in both the placebo and tolterodine treatment groups. Three percent of patients in the tolterodine 2 mg bid group discontinued treatment because of dry mouth, compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA/SUFU guideline amendment 2019 [^115od3cd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB).

- **Materials and methods**: The primary source of evidence for the original version of this guideline was the systematic review and data extraction conducted as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report/Technology Assessment Number 187, titled "Treatment of Overactive Bladder in Women" (2009). This report was supplemented with additional searches capturing literature published through December 2011. Following initial publication, this guideline underwent amendment in 2014 and 2018, reflecting relevant literature published through October 2018.

- **Results**: When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such statements are provided as Standards, Recommendations, or Options. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence-based statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of OAB, as well as for the various treatments. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows and as new treatment strategies become obtainable.

### Do patient characteristics predict responsiveness to treatment of overactive bladder with antimuscarinic agents [^1157KMxw]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine clinical and demographic characteristics associated with antimuscarinic treatment response, a regression model was employed. Adults with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for more than 3 months, who experienced at least one urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) episode and at least 8 micturitions per 24 hours at baseline, were randomized to receive fesoterodine (8 mg), tolterodine extended-release (4 mg), or a placebo in two 12-week, double-blind, head-to-head studies. Fesoterodine-treated patients received 4 mg/day during the first week, followed by 8 mg/day thereafter.

Patients completed 3-day bladder diaries and the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire at baseline and week 12. Pooled data for changes from baseline to week 12 in winsorized UUI episodes, micturitions, urgency episodes per 24 hours, and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Bother and health-related quality of life scores were analyzed posthoc. The analysis used a regression model that selected outcome predictors from baseline values and patient characteristics, retaining baseline values and treatment, with stepwise inclusion of significant covariates and assessment of treatment interactions. Logistic regression was utilized for analyzing diary-dry rates.

Younger age, lack of previous antimuscarinic treatment, shorter duration of OAB diagnosis, and female gender were identified as common predictors of larger changes in outcomes from baseline to week 12. Baseline measures frequently interacted with treatment, indicating that poorer baseline outcomes were predictive of larger treatment differences. A longer duration since OAB diagnosis predicted greater treatment differences.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^113cuMP6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Fesoterodine 8 mg, which is chemically related to tolterodine, showed greater improvement in incontinence, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency than tolterodine 4 mg. However, fesoterodine appeared to have a worse safety profile with significantly higher incidences of withdrawals due to adverse events, SAE, constipation, and dry mouth than tolterodine.

Based on one small trial using the OABSS, no difference was found between fesoterodine 4 mg and solifenacin 5 mg. Patients who received fesoterodine reported a higher incidence of adverse events of interest, but none reached statistical significance, likely because of the small sample size. Solifenacin 5 mg reduced one-half incontinence and urgency episodes per day more than tolterodine 4 mg, a significant difference. Overall adverse event profiles are similar between solifenacin and tolterodine, except that solifenacin led to a significantly higher incidence of constipation than tolterodine. Both fesoterodine and solifenacin are more effective than tolterodine, but clinicians should consider solifenacin for its better safety profile than fesoterodine.

From the 2012 review, oxybutynin showed comparable improvement of incontinence and micturition frequency to solifenacin 5 mg and tolterodine. The 2012 review did not evaluate patients' assessment of symptoms, though it found no difference between oxybutynin and tolterodine in terms of condition-specific quality of life. Significantly more patients randomized to oxybutynin withdrew because of adverse events than with solifenacin or tolterodine.

### What is the best first choice oral drug therapy for oab [^115AacvC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

The management of overactive bladder (OAB) involves lifestyle changes and conservative measures as initial steps, including liquid/dietary advice, weight loss, and bladder training. Oral pharmacotherapy is then introduced for symptomatic patients, with antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists being the main classes of drug therapy. Views on the best first-line OAB treatment are evolving based on recent evidence and adverse event profiles of these medications.

At the ICI-RS meeting 2023 in Bristol, UK, this topic was discussed as a proposal. This article summarizes the concepts presented and the interactive discussions that followed.

OAB guidelines are increasingly adopting an approach that considers either antimuscarinic or beta-3 agonist therapy based on patient-specific factors. Concerns have been raised about the long-term impacts of antimuscarinics, including effects on cognition, dementia, cardiovascular events, and mortality, all associated with antimuscarinic load. Neither antimuscarinics nor beta-3 agonists demonstrate good persistence and adherence rates over the medium to long term. Barriers to prescribing include guidelines recommending the use of drugs with the lowest acquisition cost and "step therapy". A newer approach to managing OAB is personalized therapy, considering the various etiological factors and phenotypes. These concepts are highlighted in this article.

Oral pharmacotherapy in managing OAB is limited by adverse events, adherence, and persistence issues.

### Overactive bladder: Clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^116cma3r]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a condition that involves urinary urgency, usually accompanied by increased daytime frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. This condition is multifactorial, and several theories explain the pathophysiologic process underlying the condition. Because the prevalence of the condition is high among women across all age groups, obstetrician-gynecologists will encounter women with OAB syndrome and should be able to evaluate and treat this condition.

The appropriate management often is based on the degree of bother and severity of symptoms in an individual patient. This monograph will delineate the general characteristics of OAB syndrome from its epidemiology to potential causes and provide a detailed discussion of the evaluation of the patient with various diagnostic modalities and the range of available treatment options.

### Treatment success for overactive bladder with urinary urge incontinence refractory to oral antimuscarinics: A review of published evidence [^115R5v9a]. BMC Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder disease (OAB) is defined by the Standardization Subcommittee of the International Continence Society (ICS) as urinary urgency, with or without urinary incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with no proven infection or other obvious pathology. As part of the National Overactive Bladder Evaluation (NOBLE) program, 16.5% of the United States population (16% of men and 16.9% of women) over 18 years of age had symptoms consistent with OAB. This translates into approximately 34 million symptomatic people in the United States alone. Of the 16.5% of the adult population with symptoms consistent with OAB, 37.2% were characterized as having OAB with urinary urge incontinence (UUI). OAB significantly impacts health-related quality of life and is associated with comorbidities such as an increased risk of falls and fractures, increased urinary tract and skin infections, sleep disturbances, depression, and decreased sexual health. The economic impact of OAB is considerable, given its estimated attributable cost of $12.02 billion in the United States for the year 2000.

Depending on severity and etiology, initial treatment of OAB is characterized by behavioral modification (timed voiding, bladder training, pelvic floor exercises, etc) and antimuscarinic drugs. Behavioral interventions for treating OAB, such as bladder training, are often the first-line therapy for mild symptoms of urge, frequency, and/or incontinence. Bladder training involves patient education, scheduled voiding, and positive reinforcement. Other behavioral interventions include pelvic floor exercises (PFE) and biofeedback.

### Characteristics of providers who prescribed only anticholinergic medications for overactive bladder in 2020 [^116sgcXs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic therapy for overactive bladder typically includes either an anticholinergic or a beta-3 agonist. Based on research that has demonstrated increased risks of cognitive impairment and dementia associated with anticholinergic use, guidelines support the use of beta-3 agonists rather than anticholinergics in older patients.

This study aimed to describe the characteristics of providers prescribing only anticholinergics to treat overactive bladder in patients aged ≥ 65 years. The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publishes data on medications dispensed to Medicare beneficiaries. Data include the National Provider Identifier of the prescriber and the number of pills prescribed and dispensed for any given medication for beneficiaries aged ≥ 65 years. We obtained each provider's National Provider Identifier, gender, degree, and primary specialty. National Provider Identifiers were linked to an additional Medicare database that includes graduation year. We included providers who prescribed pharmacologic therapy for overactive bladder in 2020 for patients aged ≥ 65 years.

We calculated the percentage of providers who prescribed only anticholinergics (and did not prescribe beta-3 agonists) for overactive bladder and stratified by provider characteristics. Data are reported as adjusted risk ratios. In 2020, 131,605 providers prescribed overactive bladder medications. Of those identified, 110,874 (84.2%) had complete demographic information available. Although only 7% of providers who prescribed medications for…

### Using anticholinergics to treat overactive bladder: The issue of treatment tolerability [^1165Ws7A]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic syndrome with debilitating symptoms that negatively affect health-related quality of life. Although anticholinergic agents have been first-line treatment for OAB for many years, the efficacious pharmacologic management of this condition has been compromised by concerns regarding tolerability. Anticholinergic agents prevent involuntary contractions of the bladder detrusor muscle by preventing acetylcholine from binding to the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes.

Anticholinergics are not tissue-specific, and their use for treatment of OAB has been associated with side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision. Recent studies with extended-release formulations and newly developed receptor subtype-specific anticholinergic agents demonstrate that side effects are typically mild to moderate and generally tolerable, seldom leading to patient withdrawal. By incorporating patient-initiated dose adjustment into the protocol, the primary care physician can effectively manage adverse events associated with OAB without compromising efficacy. Recent dose-adjustment data with extended-release oxybutynin suggest that, given some control in the process, patients are willing to tolerate certain side effects in exchange for symptom relief.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^115NvjYr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Lifestyle interventions and behavioral therapies, which may be combined with antimuscarinic treatment, are recommended in international guidelines as first-line therapy for patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Failure to respond to conservative and pharmacological treatment of OAB has previously been described, but there is considerable heterogeneity in the definitions of both treatment response and nonresponse in trials involving patients with OAB.

Over the last few years, several clinical studies have been published investigating different pharmacological principles, such as other antimuscarinic drugs, beta-3 agonists, and botulinum toxin, and strategies like increasing anticholinergic doses or additional treatment with other anticholinergic drugs or beta-3 agonists in the treatment of patients with refractory OAB. The vast majority of these studies report significant improvement in OAB symptoms following a change in treatment.

This review discusses published data concerning factors behind refractory OAB to aid in understanding different treatment results in OAB patients.

### Optimizing nonsurgical treatments of overactive bladder in the United States [^115bnetJ]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is a prevalent condition impacting quality of life, activities of daily living, work productivity, physical and psychological health, sleep, and sexuality. Published guideline recommendations and effective behavioral, pharmacologic, and neuromodulatory therapies exist; however, adherence can be poor. Clinicians have important roles in educating patients, setting treatment expectations, and providing follow-up. Determining patient goals, routinely assessing and adjusting therapy, and combining treatment strategies may improve outcomes. We review the benefits and challenges of overactive bladder treatments and propose approaches to improve patient management, with the goals of initiating therapy earlier and achieving better patient satisfaction, functioning, and quality of life.

### The effects of antimuscarinic treatments in overactive bladder: an update of a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116EHawP]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Antimuscarinic agents are currently the first-line pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder. A systematic review published in 2005 was updated, including data on a newly licensed antimuscarinic, fesoterodine. The primary aim of this study was to systematically review evidence on the efficacy of licensed administration of antimuscarinic treatments in overactive bladder from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Secondary aims were to review evidence on tolerability, safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).

All relevant data sources from RCTs were searched, and two independent reviewers considered publications for inclusion and extracted relevant data. Meta-analysis was used to pool efficacy, tolerability, safety, and HRQL outcomes by treatment. Efficacy was measured by continent days, mean voided volume, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency. Tolerability and safety were measured by adverse event and withdrawal rates. HRQL was measured by various instruments.

An additional 1,118 references were retrieved, with data on 83 studies extracted. Antimuscarinics were found to be more effective than placebo. Tolerability was good; few of the antimuscarinics were found to have significantly higher withdrawal rates in comparison to placebo. No serious adverse event for any product was statistically significant compared to placebo. Dry mouth (mild, moderate, severe) was the most commonly reported adverse event (29.6% on treatment vs. 7.9% on placebo), followed by pruritus.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^114HzmXX]. BMC Urology (2025). High credibility.

Overactive bladder management presents significant challenges, with treatment failures and medication non-adherence posing substantial barriers to patient outcomes. Early prediction of these challenges could enable timely interventions and treatment modifications.

- **Objectives**: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence-based prediction model for early identification of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder patients, with a specific focus on different pathological subgroups including diabetic neuropathy.

- **Methods**: In this single-center retrospective study (January 2018–April 2025), we analyzed data from 285 patients with overactive bladder. We developed and validated artificial intelligence models using comprehensive clinical parameters, including ultrasonography findings, uroflowmetry results, standardized voiding diaries, and disease-specific questionnaire outcomes. Primary outcome measures were treatment failure and medication non-adherence at three months.

- **Results**: The gradient boosting model achieved an accuracy of 87.3% (95% CI: 84.1–90.5%) for predicting treatment failure and 85.1% (95% CI: 81.8–88.4%) for predicting medication non-adherence. Key predictive factors included early changes in bladder wall thickness (OR: 3.82, 95% CI: 2.14–6.81), diabetes duration > 7 years (OR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.58–4.72), and urgency improvement < 25% (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.76–4.92). Treatment failure rates varied significantly among pathological subgroups, with the highest rates in diabetic neuropathy (42.8%) and lowest in idiopathic OAB (28.6%).

### Diagnosis and treatment of the overactive bladder [^116NR2YX]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a symptomatic diagnosis based on the presence of urgency, with or without urge incontinence, and usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, in the absence of obvious pathologic or metabolic disease. Initial management of OAB requires an integrated approach using behavioral and pharmacologic methods. Patients should be educated about the functioning of the lower urinary tract system, fluid and dietary management, timed or prophylactic voiding and bladder training regimens, the keeping of micturition charts or bladder diaries, and pelvic floor exercises. Although the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists for the treatment of OAB has been shown, adverse effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision, have somewhat limited their usefulness.

Newer agents that are more bladder selective have been and continue to be developed. The concept of clinical effectiveness — a combination of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance — can be used to evaluate not only how well a drug works but also its side-effect profile and bothersomeness, and how likely patients are to continue treatment. Patients who do not respond to antimuscarinic treatment of OAB may do so because of a variety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic reasons. Most cases of OAB are not cured, but rather the symptoms are reduced, with an associated improvement in the patients' quality of life. Patients who have failed behavioral and pharmacologic intervention may respond to neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Future approaches may include other types of treatments.

### Pathophysiology: The varieties of bladder overactivity [^11464JhN]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common term currently used in clinical medicine to describe a complex of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with or without incontinence. The symptoms usually include urgency, frequency, nocturia, troublesome or incomplete emptying, and, occasionally, pain. Causes of bladder overactivity include neurologic illness or injury, bladder outlet obstruction, urethral weakness, detrusor hyperactivity and impaired contractility in elderly patients, emergence of new voiding reflexes, and so-called idiopathic bladder overactivity. Most clinicians agree that effective treatment for OAB symptoms should be guided by a basic assessment of patients for these contributing factors. However, it is not at all certain that outcomes are significantly improved by diagnostic precision. This is in part because of the ubiquity of LUTS in the setting of the various common lower urinary tract disorders: stress incontinence, outlet obstruction, and neurologic illness or injury. The ubiquity of LUTS would imply that they are caused by common mechanisms and, theoretically at least, would be amenable to a single form of effective therapy. Conversely, the limited kinds and number of LUTS and the limited representation of lower urinary tract structures in the central nervous system may mean that several different causes produce similar symptoms, but these are not amenable to a single form of effective therapy. Future research directions should keep each possible explanation in mind as new knowledge about lower urinary tract function and possible intervention continues.

### Tolterodine and tamsulosin for treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms and overactive bladder: a randomized controlled trial [^111UysJw]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Men with overactive bladder and other lower urinary tract symptoms may not respond to monotherapy with antimuscarinic agents or alpha-receptor antagonists. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tolterodine extended release (ER), tamsulosin, or both in men who met research criteria for both overactive bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 95 urology clinics in the United States. It involved men aged 40 years or older with a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 12 or higher and an International Prostate Symptom Score quality-of-life (QOL) item score of 3 or higher. Participants had to have a self-rated bladder condition of at least moderate bother, and a bladder diary documenting micturition frequency (≥ 8 micturitions per 24 hours) and urgency (≥ 3 episodes per 24 hours), with or without urgency urinary incontinence. Patients were recruited between November 2004 and February 2006, and the study was completed in May 2006.

- **Interventions**: Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n = 222), 4 mg of tolterodine ER (n = 217), 0.4 mg of tamsulosin (n = 215), or both tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin (n = 225) for 12 weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study assessed patient perception of treatment benefit, bladder diary variables, International Prostate Symptom Scores, and safety and tolerability.

- **Results**: A total of 172 men (80%) receiving tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin reported treatment benefit by week 12 compared with 132 patients (62%) receiving placebo (p < 0.001).

### Developments in the pharmacotherapy of the overactive bladder [^112HxCeb]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The overactive bladder is a common and distressing condition that significantly impacts the quality of life of many people worldwide. Anticholinergics remain the first line in pharmacotherapy; however, the use of these agents is hindered by adverse effects and limited efficacy. Thus, there is a need for more effective treatments. Recently, there has been a move towards targeting novel pathways thought to play a role in bladder overactivity. This review aims to provide insight into the recent developments in pharmacotherapy for the overactive bladder.

With recent advances in our understanding of the basic science of the overactive bladder, it is becoming clear that the control of bladder functioning is far more complex than previously believed. Peripherally, a prominent role has emerged for the urothelium and the underlying suburothelium in mechanosensory control, and the role of afferent pathways in pathophysiology is increasingly recognized.

Recent research has highlighted several potential targets for the treatment of the overactive bladder, particularly within the mechanosensory pathways. With the exception of botulinum toxin, however, few new therapies have emerged showing clinical benefits. A clearer understanding of the pathophysiology of the bladder will hopefully lead to more effective and better-tolerated treatments.

### Patient-reported outcomes in overactive bladder: Importance for determining clinical effectiveness of treatment [^113KbtFS]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition defined by its symptoms: urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence, and often with frequency and nocturia. Determining the efficacy of OAB treatments using objective measures, such as urodynamic testing, can be challenging. A more effective means of gauging treatment efficacy for symptom-based conditions is through the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). With PROs, clinicians gain insight into how a treatment affects a patient's symptoms and whether improvement in symptoms has a positive effect from the patient's perspective. PROs are increasingly included as endpoints in clinical trials, including those of antimuscarinic drugs for OAB. Consequently, clinicians should become familiar with the most commonly used instruments. We provide an overview of instruments used to assess symptoms, health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction in patients with OAB and discuss how PROs can be incorporated into clinical trial protocols.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116heSEX]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that increases with age and affects quality of life. While numerous OAB drugs are available, persistence is low. We evaluated evidence published since 2012 to determine if newer drugs provided better efficacy and harm profiles.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library from 2012 to September 2018 using terms for included drugs and requested information from manufacturers of included drugs. We performed dual review of all systematic review processes, evaluated study quality, and conducted meta-analyses using random effects models.

- **Results**: In addition to 31 older studies, we included 20 trials published since 2012 (N = 16,478; 4 good, 11 fair, and 5 poor quality). Where statistical differences were found, they were clinically small (reductions of < 0.5 episodes/day). Solifenacin plus mirabegron improved efficacy outcomes over monotherapy with either drug but significantly increased constipation compared with solifenacin and dry mouth compared with mirabegron. Solifenacin reduced incontinence over mirabegron and tolterodine and urgency episodes over tolterodine. Mirabegron did not differ from tolterodine in efficacy but had significantly lower incidence of dry mouth than solifenacin or tolterodine. Fesoterodine showed significant improvements but also exhibited anticholinergic effects versus tolterodine. Oxybutynin, solifenacin, and tolterodine had similar efficacy, but dry mouth led to greater discontinuation with oxybutynin. Blurred vision, cardiac arrhythmia, and dizziness were uncommon.

### Outcome reporting in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the pharmacological management of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) in women; a systematic review for the development of core outcome sets (COS) [^112nKm3j]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

A comprehensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), as well as ICTRP. Inclusion criteria included the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms: 'overactive bladder', 'idiopathic', 'randomized controlled trial', 'urgency', 'urge incontinence', 'urgency incontinence', 'anticholinergic', 'antimuscarinic', 'mirabegron', 'solifenacin', 'tolterodine', 'oxybutynin', 'trospium', and 'female'. The search was refined to include articles from the inception to January 2020, written in English and carried out only on humans and adult women. Duplicates were removed, resulting in 1402 initial search results. The Cochrane Central Register was also used to identify any systematic reviews (SRs) relevant to the pharmacological management of OAB, aiding in the snowballing process.

Snowballing is a methodological technique used to identify additional studies that may be eligible based on the inclusion criteria. It involves searching the reference list of SRs and primary studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Title screening was followed by abstract and full-text screening. We excluded articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria in a standardized and staged approach. The search was narrowed to 530 studies after title screening and subsequently to 38 studies after abstract and full-text screening. Any studies that were observational or non-randomized were excluded.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115Sri8N]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Cumulative evidence showed small differences across all comparisons of pharmacotherapies used to treat overactive bladder (OAB), including combination therapy (solifenacin/mirabegron) vs. monotherapy (< 0.8 episode per day). While some of these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance is unclear, and all treatment groups reported more than one incontinence episode and 2.5 urgency episodes per day at study end. For patients with urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) at baseline, less than 65% reported no incontinence over 3 days at the end of treatment.

Anticholinergic adverse effects remain a concern even with mirabegron. Considering that persistence with antimuscarinic drugs is already known to be low, it is unclear whether the added benefit of combining mirabegron with solifenacin outweighs the increased harm. A patient's preference for increased efficacy vs. reduced harms, and tolerance of specific adverse events, should be considered when selecting treatment for OAB.
