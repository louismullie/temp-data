## Question

SRI and blood thinner

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the interaction between serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs/SSRIs/SNRIs) and blood thinners (anticoagulants), including mechanisms, magnitude of risk, clinical contexts, and management recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms that plausibly increase bleeding. Then, I should quantify the clinical risk from high-quality studies. Next, I will examine whether risk varies by anticoagulant class or SSRI potency. After that, I need to consider special populations and time course of risk. Finally, I will translate this into practical management and monitoring steps, including alternatives and counseling points, and I should double-check for any conflicting data that might temper conclusions.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get this wrong, downstream decisions will be shaky. SSRIs and SNRIs inhibit the serotonin transporter on platelets, depleting intraplatelet serotonin and impairing aggregation and granule release, which weakens primary hemostasis; this is a pharmacodynamic effect that compounds with anticoagulants that impair the coagulation cascade, yielding additive bleeding risk rather than a classic pharmacokinetic interaction, although some SSRIs also inhibit CYP2C9/2C19 and can modestly increase warfarin exposure, which is a secondary contributor rather than the main driver [^ab4fe15d] [^2d6760e4] [^87c19596].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of risk so I don't overstate it. Large, population-based nested case-control studies in atrial fibrillation cohorts show that concomitant SSRI use with oral anticoagulants increases major bleeding risk by about 33% versus anticoagulant alone, with the highest risk in the first few months of coadministration and attenuation after 6 months; this aligns with platelet effects emerging within 2–3 weeks and stabilizing thereafter, and the absolute risk remains low in most patients [^6db93262] [^2362d618] [^2e8505a3]. I should also note that a meta-analysis links SSRI exposure to increased intracranial hemorrhage, with a pooled adjusted RR around 1.5, again emphasizing rarity but clinical severity when it occurs [^f1219528].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anticoagulant class differences. I initially thought DOACs might eliminate the interaction, but I need to check that. The JAMA Network Open analyses found a similar relative increase with both VKAs and DOACs, suggesting the dominant effect is pharmacodynamic platelet impairment rather than a VKA-specific CYP interaction; however, some data suggest DOACs may have fewer clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interactions with SSRIs than warfarin, which could modestly favor DOACs in polypharmacy, though this is not a license to ignore bleeding risk [^ab4fe15d] [^6db93262]. Let me reconsider: while the relative risk increment is comparable, absolute baseline bleeding risk differs by agent, so apixaban may still yield lower absolute event rates than warfarin in many settings, but the SSRI-related relative increase persists [^57d76e91].

> I should confirm whether SSRI potency matters. The large 2024 studies did not find a clear gradient by SSRI potency, implying the class effect predominates; however, a separate cohort suggested higher intracranial hemorrhage risk with stronger serotonin transporter inhibitors, particularly early in therapy, so I need to balance this potential signal against the overall null finding in the larger datasets and avoid overinterpreting subgroup effects [^6db93262] [^07d4ccbe]. But wait, what if I'm missing a confounder like indication or comorbidity? The JAMA analyses adjusted extensively and still found a consistent 30–35% relative increase, which strengthens confidence in a class effect rather than agent-specific toxicity [^6db93262].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts where the risk may be magnified. Perioperative and procedural settings carry additive bleeding risk with SSRIs, and interventional guidelines advise multidisciplinary discussion rather than routine discontinuation; observational surgical cohorts show small increases in intraoperative blood loss without more transfusions, but risk stratification is prudent, especially for neuraxial procedures and high-risk surgeries [^4f2ecbd6] [^e2265235] [^6e5e5893]. In pregnancy, third-trimester SSRI exposure is associated with a modest increase in postpartum hemorrhage, so anticipatory use of uterotonics and close monitoring are reasonable; in older adults, polypharmacy and fall risk compound bleeding, so I should double-check for other hemostasis-impairing drugs like NSAIDs and antiplatelets before concluding the SSRI is the sole driver [^3684857d] [^57d76e91].

> I need to ensure the time course is front and center in counseling. The excess bleeding risk is most pronounced in the first 30–180 days of concomitant use, then tends to plateau; this argues for heightened vigilance during initiation and dose changes, and it helps frame risk–benefit discussions when starting or adjusting either agent [^6db93262] [^2362d618]. Let me verify that this aligns with platelet biology: yes, platelet serotonin depletion and functional impairment accrue over 2–3 weeks, consistent with the early hazard period seen in the epidemiology [^2362d618].

> Now, I will translate this into practical management, but I should confirm each step against guidelines and labels. First, screen for bleeding risk factors and concomitant medications that further impair hemostasis, especially NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and CYP2C19 inhibitors, and consider gastroprotection with PPIs in patients at GI bleed risk; second, if an SSRI is necessary, prefer agents with fewer CYP interactions when combined with warfarin, and consider DOACs when appropriate, recognizing the relative risk increment persists; third, monitor closely in the first 3–6 months, reinforce bleeding precautions, and teach patients to report melena, hematuria, hematemesis, or neurologic symptoms promptly; finally, if bleeding risk is high and psychiatric indications allow, consider non-serotonergic alternatives like bupropion, acknowledging that evidence for lower bleeding risk is suggestive but not definitive, and that mirtazapine may not confer a clear advantage over SSRIs in some analyses [^ab4fe15d] [^2d6760e4] [^919bce1e]. Hold on, I should verify that bupropion truly lacks platelet effects; platelet function studies suggest minimal serotonin transporter interaction, supporting its use when bleeding risk is paramount, though clinical bleeding data are limited [^582db051].

> I should double-check for conflicting data so I don't overgeneralize. The ROCKET AF analyses did not find a statistically significant increase in major bleeding with SSRIs, although point estimates were directionally higher, especially with warfarin; this discrepancy likely reflects differences in definitions, ascertainment, and statistical power, so I should present this as uncertainty rather than contradiction and emphasize that the weight of contemporary, large-scale observational data supports a modest increase in major bleeding with SSRI–OAC coadministration [^a7b88c1b] [^4aa15b87] [^6db93262]. Let me reconsider: given convergent signals across multiple datasets and the mechanistic plausibility, it is reasonable to act on the 30–35% relative increase while acknowledging absolute risks are low and modifiable by patient selection and monitoring [^6db93262].

> Finally, I need to ensure the counseling points are concrete. Patients should be told that SSRIs can make bruising and bleeding easier, that the risk is higher when combined with blood thinners, that most bleeding is gastrointestinal and often preventable with precautions, and that early symptoms like black stools, bloody vomit, or severe headache warrant urgent evaluation; clinicians should coordinate across specialties when planning procedures or adding new hemostasis-impairing drugs, and document shared decision-making when continuing SSRIs with anticoagulants in high-risk patients [^fe064bc3] [^4f2ecbd6] [^e2265235]. If I missed anything critical, I should verify against FDA labels and contemporary reviews, but the core message stands: the interaction is real, modest in magnitude, time-limited early in coadministration, and manageable with risk stratification, monitoring, and patient education [^6db93262] [^ab4fe15d].

---

SSRIs and SNRIs increase bleeding risk, especially with **warfarin, DOACs, or antiplatelets** [^6db93262], due to impaired platelet aggregation and pharmacokinetic interactions [^ab4fe15d]. The risk is highest early in therapy and with NSAIDs or aspirin [^6db93262] [^2d6760e4]. Use the lowest effective doses, monitor for bleeding, and consider PPIs for GI protection [^2d6760e4] [^b9162106]. If bleeding risk is high, consider bupropion or mirtazapine [^9a3cb3ca] [^582db051].

---

## Mechanisms of interaction

SSRIs/SNRIs impair hemostasis via **platelet dysfunction** and pharmacokinetic interactions:

- **Platelet serotonin depletion**: SSRIs/SNRIs inhibit platelet serotonin reuptake, reducing granule serotonin and impairing aggregation and vasoconstriction [^2d6760e4] [^87c19596].

- **Pharmacokinetic interactions**: Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine inhibit CYP2C9/2C19, increasing warfarin levels and bleeding risk [^ab4fe15d] [^46d06fad].

- **Additive effects**: Combined use with anticoagulants/antiplatelets produces additive bleeding risk [^6db93262] [^2d6760e4].

---

## Clinical evidence of increased bleeding risk

Multiple studies and meta-analyses show increased bleeding with SSRIs/SNRIs, especially with anticoagulants:

| **Study type** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|
| Meta-analysis | SSRIs increase upper GI bleeding ~2-fold; risk rises with NSAIDs/antiplatelets [^2d6760e4] [^c0a878c3] |
| Nested case-control | SSRI + OACs increase major bleeding 33% (IRR 1.33); highest early in therapy [^6db93262] [^2362d618] |
| Cohort | SSRI + warfarin increases major bleeding vs warfarin alone (OR 2.6) [^efd94e92] |
| Meta-analysis | SSRI exposure increases intracranial hemorrhage risk (RR 1.48) [^f1219528] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the increased risk, **clinicians should**:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate bleeding risk factors (age, renal/hepatic impairment, GI ulcers, NSAID use) before prescribing SSRIs/SNRIs with anticoagulants [^46d06fad].

- **Dose optimization**: Use the lowest effective doses of both agents [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for bleeding (bruising, epistaxis, hematuria, melena) and check INR more frequently when starting or changing SSRIs with warfarin [^1705b485].

- **Gastroprotection**: Consider PPIs for patients at GI bleed risk [^2d6760e4] [^b9162106].

- **Alternative antidepressants**: Consider bupropion or mirtazapine in high-risk patients, though evidence is limited [^9a3cb3ca] [^919bce1e].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios

- **Perioperative settings**: SSRIs/SNRIs increase surgical bleeding; multidisciplinary planning is advised [^4f2ecbd6] [^e2265235].

- **Pregnancy**: Third-trimester SSRI use increases postpartum hemorrhage risk; monitor closely and use uterotonics [^3684857d].

- **Elderly**: Higher bleeding risk due to polypharmacy and comorbidities; monitor closely [^57d76e91].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Assess bleeding risk**: Before combining SSRIs/SNRIs with anticoagulants [^46d06fad].

- **Use lowest effective doses**: Of both agents [^notfound].

- **Monitor for bleeding**: Especially early in therapy [^6db93262].

- **Consider gastroprotection**: With PPIs in high-risk patients [^2d6760e4] [^b9162106].

- **Consider alternatives**: Bupropion or mirtazapine if bleeding risk is high [^9a3cb3ca] [^582db051].

---

SSRIs and SNRIs increase bleeding risk with anticoagulants via platelet effects and pharmacokinetic interactions; **careful risk assessment, dosing, monitoring, and gastroprotection** mitigate harm, and alternative antidepressants can be considered when risk is high.

### Clinical management of bleeding risk with antidepressants [^9a3cb3ca]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

This nonsystematic review describes risk of bleeding in treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and provide recommendations for the management of patients at risk of bleeding.

Data Sources

Articles were identified by English-language MEDLINE search published prior to June 2018 using the terms SRI, serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, OR antidepressive agents, AND hemorrhage OR stroke.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Meta-analyses were utilized to identify information regarding risk of bleeding with antidepressants. Individual studies were included if they had information regarding bleeding risk with specific SRIs, timing of risk, or risk with medications of interest.

Data Synthesis

SRIs increase risk of bleeding by 1.16- to 2.36-fold. The risk is synergistic between SRIs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; odds ratio [OR] range between studies 3.17–10.9). Acid-reducing medications may mitigate risk of gastrointestinal bleeds in chronic NSAIDs and SRI users (OR range between studies 0.98–1.1). Antidepressants with low or no affinity for the serotonin transporter, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, may be appropriate alternatives for patients at risk of bleeding. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review includes data regarding bleeding risk for specific antidepressants, concomitant medications, and risk related to duration of SRI use. Considerations and evidence-based recommendations are provided for management of SRI users at high bleeding risk.

Conclusions

Clinicians must be aware of the risk of bleeding with SRI use, especially for patients taking NSAIDs. Patient education is prudent for those prescribed NSAIDs and SRIs concurrently.

### Clinical impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors therapy with bleeding risks [^f833b901]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extensively used for the treatment of multiple psychiatric conditions. In vitro and ex vivo data with these agents indicate they may have varying degrees of antiplatelet activity via multiple receptors. Reports of bleeding in patients receiving SSRIs appeared soon after their introduction. A review of the literature suggests SSRI therapy may increase the risk of bleeding especially with concomitant aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Clinicians should exercise caution when prescribing these agents in high risk patients and maintain awareness of the potential contribution of SSRIs to unexplained bleeding episodes.

### Detecting drug interactions from adverse-event reports: interaction between paroxetine and pravastatin increases blood glucose levels [^055a4879]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

The lipid-lowering agent pravastatin and the antidepressant paroxetine are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. Unexpected interactions between them could have important public health implications. We mined the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) for side-effect profiles involving glucose homeostasis and found a surprisingly strong signal for comedication with pravastatin and paroxetine. We retrospectively evaluated changes in blood glucose in 104 patients with diabetes and 135 without diabetes who had received comedication with these two drugs, using data in electronic medical record (EMR) systems of three geographically distinct sites. We assessed the mean random blood glucose levels before and after treatment with the drugs. We found that pravastatin and paroxetine, when administered together, had a synergistic effect on blood glucose. The average increase was 19 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) overall, and in those with diabetes it was 48 mg/dl (2.7 mmol/l). In contrast, neither drug administered singly was associated with such changes in glucose levels. An increase in glucose levels is not a general effect of combined therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and statins.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^2a1a0b69]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) safety in obsessive-compulsive disorder — SSRIs may be associated with increased intra-operative blood loss in patients also taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, along with clomipramine, may interact with anesthetics and opiate pain relievers; patients should inform their surgeon and anesthesiologist if they are taking an SRI. A drug discontinuation syndrome with dizziness, nausea/vomiting, headache, lethargy, agitation, insomnia, myoclonic jerks, and paresthesias may occur if medication is suddenly stopped, and it is most often seen after rapid discontinuation or tapering of venlafaxine; for these medications, a slow taper over several weeks or more will minimize discontinuation symptoms, and if symptoms occur, raising the dose and slowing the taper may bring relief.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and increased bleeding risk: are we missing something? [^d9df69e2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first line agents to treat clinical depression. Although these medications exhibit a favorable safety profile, there are multiple case reports, registries, and uncontrolled studies suggesting that use of SSRIs might be associated in the increased risk of bleeding events. There is also emerging evidence that these side effects of SSRIs are due to blockade of serotonin reuptake in platelets and subsequent platelet dysfunction.

Methods

The analysis of evidence linking SSRIs with bleeding episodes to define the prevalence, specific clinical characteristics, and estimated risk when SSRIs are used in combination with antiplatelet agents or/and anticoagulants.

Results

There are over 120 MEDLINE-cited peer-reviewed research papers and more than 50000 Web pages devoted to SSRI-related bleeding events.

Conclusion

Independently of the brand, use of SSRIs is indeed associated with increased bleeding risk. Although such complications are rare, their frequency is growing, and physicians should be aware of SSRI-induced hemorrhages, especially in patients with hereditary platelet defects, and those treated with antiplatelet agents. Prospective studies are urgently needed to determine whether SSRIs will yield additional bleeding risks when used long term concomitantly with aspirin or clopidogrel.

### Are the antiplatelet and profibrinolytic properties of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors relevant to their brain effects? [^7de8be6d]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The serotonin transporter (SERT) is found in neuron and platelet membranes. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed for severe depression. They may at least partly counteract the effects of serotonin on the vascular biology system, can lower agonists-induced platelet activation, aggregation and procoagulant activity in vitro, thus modulating platelet thrombogenicity. Other effects, such as those mediated through PAI-1 modulation, may indirectly influence neurobiology-relevant mechanisms involved in depression. Patients receiving SSRIs are at increased bleeding risk and decreased risk of arterial occlusive events, such as myocardial infarction, compared to those using non-SSRI antidepressants. The objectives of this review were to highlight antiplatelet and profibrinolytic properties of SSRIs and discuss the potential role of these activities in the context of SSRI brain effects.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) bleeding risk: considerations for the consult-liaison psychiatrist [^d6fdcaa6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To present a clinically oriented review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-related bleeding issues commonly addressed by consult-liaison psychiatrists.

Recent Findings

Concomitant medical, surgical, or hospital-based conditions exacerbate the risk of SSRI-related bleeding even though a review of the literature suggests it is only marginally elevated. Psychiatrists and other clinicians need to consider these conditions along with antidepressant benefits when answering the question: to start, hold, continue, or change the antidepressant? Where an evidence base is limited, mechanistic understanding may help consult-liaison psychiatrists navigate this terrain and collaborate with other medical specialties on responsible antidepressant management. Most often, the risk is cumulative; data are not directly applicable to complex clinical situations. This review incorporates a hematologic perspective and approach to bleeding risk assessment along with extant data on SSRI-induced bleeding risk ad specific medical conditions.

### Do SSRIs cause gastrointestinal bleeding? [^a3c277cd]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) can inhibit uptake, and therefore storage, of serotonin by platelets. This is significant because release of serotonin from platelets augments their aggregation; so use of SSRIs could, in theory, predispose patients to bleeding disorders. Case reports have suggested a link between SSRIs and easy bruising, nosebleeds, menorrhagia, petechial, ocular, small bowel, rectal and cerebral haemorrhages, and a prolonged bleeding time. Also, the summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) for all SSRIs include warnings about use in patients with a history of bleeding disorders or concomitant use with drugs known to affect platelet function. Here we review the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the use of SSRIs.

### Apixaban [^91fd7fac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Apixaban tablets can cause bleeding which can be serious and rarely may lead to death. This is because apixaban tablets are a blood thinner medicine that reduces blood clotting.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take apixaban tablets and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

- aspirin or aspirin-containing products

- long-term (chronic) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- warfarin sodium (COUMADIN®, JANTOVEN®)

- any medicine that contains heparin

- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- other medicines to help prevent or treat blood clots

Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

While taking apixaban tablets:

- you may bruise more easily

- it may take longer than usual for any bleeding to stop

 Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding when taking apixaban tablets:

- **Unexpected bleeding, or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as**:

- unusual bleeding from the gums

- nosebleeds that happen often

- menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

- bleeding that is severe or you cannot control

- red, pink, or brown urine

- red or black stools (looks like tar)

- cough up blood or blood clots

- vomit blood or your vomit looks like coffee grounds

- unexpected pain, swelling, or joint pain

- headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

- Apixaban tablets are not for patients with artificial heart valves.
- Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma). People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like apixaban tablets, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:

### Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of abnormal bleeding [^b9162106]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) increase the risk of abnormal bleeding by lowering platelet serotonin and hence the efficiency of platelet-driven hemostasis; by increasing gastric acidity and possibly gastric ulceration; and by other mechanisms. The upper gastrointestinal tract is the commonest site of SRI-related abnormal bleeding; bleeding at this location may be increased by concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and by treatment with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs. Bleeding at this location may be reduced by concurrent administration of acid-suppressing drugs.

### Is third trimester serotonin reuptake inhibitor use associated with postpartum hemorrhage? [^991e86ed]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

As serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) use may decrease platelet function, previous research has shown a relationship between SRI use and an increased risk for bruising and bleeding. The literature regarding the association between SRI use during pregnancy and increased bleeding at delivery, referred to as postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), is mixed. In secondary analyses from two prospective observational studies of pregnant women with mood disorders, 263 women were exposed to an SRI (n = 51) or not (n = 212) in the third trimester. To be precise, we used the terminology estimated blood loss (EBL) > 600 cc rather than the term PPH because the current definition of PPH differs. The occurrence of EBL > 600 cc was determined using the Peripartum Events Scale (PES) completed from obstetrical records by a blinded medically trained member of the study team. EBL > 600 cc occurred in 8.7% of women in this cohort. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of EBL > 600 cc in the 24 h after delivery in women taking SRIs during the third trimester (9.8%) compared to non-exposed women (8.5%). Utilizing generalizing estimating equations, the odds of EBL > 600 cc in each group were not significantly different (OR 1.17, CI-0.41–3.32, p = 0.77). When the SRI group was limited to women with exposure at the time of delivery, the difference in the odds of EBL > 600 cc was unchanged (OR 1.16, CI = 0.37–3.64, p = 0.79). In population, both third trimester and use at delivery of SRIs during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of excessive blood loss.

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^ab4fe15d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The increased risk of major bleeding with the concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs may occur through multiple mechanisms of action. During hemostasis, serotonin is released by platelets to enhance platelet activation and aggregation and prime them to interact with coagulation factors. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors block the serotonin reuptake transporter on platelet membranes and reduce serotonin content within platelets by up to 80% to 90%, decreasing the potency of hemostasis over time. In addition, some SSRIs, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, inhibit the 1A2 and 2C9 isozymes of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme, which play a key role in the metabolism of warfarin. Nonetheless, the interaction analysis suggests that the joint association of SSRIs and OACs is mainly owing to their individual risks of major bleeding; hence, any additional risk posed by pharmacokinetic interaction is likely minimal.

Although the increased risk of major bleeding does not suggest withholding treatment with either SSRIs or OACs, measures can be taken to mitigate this risk. Studies suggest that DOACs have lower potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with SSRIs than VKAs, and guidelines also recommend them over VKAs for the management of nonvalvular AF. Taken together with the findings in this study, DOACs may also be preferred for patients concomitantly using SSRIs. On the other hand, the risk of major bleeding was similar between SSRIs with more potent inhibition and SSRIs with less potent serotonin inhibition; thus; changing the SSRI may not be associated with bleeding risk. Finally, coprescription of proton pump inhibitors has also been suggested to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Overall, risk factors for bleeding should be monitored and managed to improve the safety of the concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs. Close monitoring is particularly essential within the first few months of concomitant use.

### Association between haemorrhages and treatment with selective and non-selective serotonergic antidepressants: possible implications of quantitative signal detection [^9ada339c]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

Inhibition of serotonin uptake in platelets seems to be the crucial mechanism underlying SSRI-associated haemorrhages. This effect is also present in antidepressants featuring non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (non-SSRI). Impact of selectivity of serotonin reuptake and/or affinity to the serotonin reuptake transporter on the bleeding risk have not yet been studied sufficiently. We retrieved country- and SSRI-/non-SSRI-specific data from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre and used a case/non-case approach to calculate substance-specific reporting odds ratios (ROR) to evaluate the statistical association of treatment with SSRI/non-SSRI and haemorrhages. Country-specific analysis revealed no clear trends towards an increased risk of bleeding related to particular agents of group SSRI/non-SSRI (sporadically ROR > 1 for citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, St. John's wort). There was a clear trend in the total dataset towards a "reduced protective effect" (suggested by ROR < 1) on the development of haemorrhages with agents featuring comparatively high affinity to the 5-HTT and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (as with escitalopram, citalopram, duloxetine or venlafaxine) in comparison to agents with lower affinity or non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibition (as with mirtazapine or doxepin). Comparison of group-specific aggregated data (SSRI vs. non-SSRI) revealed significant differences regarding the "protective effect" on the development of haemorrhages between groups SSRI vs. non-SSRI in favour of non-SSRI in nearly all countries as well as in the total dataset. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that agents with increased affinity to the 5-HTT and/or selective serotonin reuptake inhibition may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

### Rizatriptan [^2fe3f724]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.7 Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including rizatriptan benzoate particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms can occur within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Rizatriptan benzoate treatment should be discontinued if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure

Significant elevation in blood pressure, including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems, has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension receiving 5-HT1agonists, including rizatriptan benzoate. In healthy young adult male and female patients who received maximal doses of rizatriptan benzoate (10 mg every 2 hours for 3 doses), slight increases in blood pressure (approximately 2–3 mmHg) were observed. Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)].

### Association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use and blood transfusion risk in older adults after hip fracture: a cohort study [^12de4bd7]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical method

A statistical plan discussed between clinicians and statistical analyst was performed prior to the start of the study. Data are expressed as mean ± SD for Gaussian variables, median and 25% to 75% interquartile range for non-Gaussian or discrete variables, and number (with percentages) for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics between groups were compared using the Student t- test or Mann–Whitney U test for quantitative variables, and the Chi square test or Fisher's exact test for qualitative variables, as appropriate.

The primary endpoint was analyzed using a logistic regression model. The variables retained for multivariate analysis were age, sex, CCI, functional status, institutionalization, low albumin level, as well as variables known to increase the risk of transfusion, namely: polypharmacy, baseline antiplatelet therapy, intertrochanteric fracture (versus cephalic fracture), and hemoglobin level at hospital admission. Stratification by year of enrollment was discussed, and ultimately not performed, as the number of patients on SSRI by year and by type of SSRI did not differ between years of enrollment (Additional files 2 & 3). To test the synergy between SSRI use and antiplatelet therapy on RBC transfusion risk, we a priori planned to calculate an adjusted interaction OR by introducing an interaction term in the logistic regression model between SSRI use and antiplatelet therapy use.

### Avoiding serotonin syndrome: the nature of the interaction between tramadol and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^935c063a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the nature of the interaction between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tramadol to mitigate or avoid serotonin syndrome.

Data Sources

PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from January 1990 to August 2012 were searched. Key words used were tramadol, antidepressive agents, antidepressants, drug interactions, selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, and serotonin syndrome.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Only English-language studies were included. No randomized controlled trials were identified. Review articles, case reports, and 1 case series that identified the scope of interaction between tramadol and SSRIs were evaluated. Review articles evaluating the role of pharmacogenetics in the use of tramadol, SSRIs, and serotonin syndrome were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Published documentation describing the interaction between tramadol and SSRIs and its relevance to serotonin syndrome is limited to a few case reports and 1 case series. While both tramadol and SSRIs increase the amount of serotonin in the brain, the interaction is much more complicated. Tramadol is metabolized through CYP2D6 enzymes and all SSRIs are inhibitors of these enzymes. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 can increase the concentration of tramadol in the blood and thus increase its effects on serotonin in the brain, contributing to the development of serotonin syndrome. CYP2D6 poor metabolizers are at a greater risk of serotonin syndrome and an inadequate analgesic effect.

Conclusions

Coadministration of tramadol and SSRIs has caused serotonin syndrome. An attempt should be made to identify individuals who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and avoid this combination in those patients. When SSRIs and tramadol must be used in combination, it is critical that patients be aware of the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, should they occur.

5.7 Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome may occur with triptans, including zolmitriptan, particularly during co-administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAO inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.5)]. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The onset of symptoms usually rapidly occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication. Discontinue zolmitriptan if serotonin syndrome is suspected [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

5.8 Increase in Blood Pressure

Significant elevations in systemic blood pressure have been reported in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists including patients without a history of hypertension; very rarely, these increases in blood pressure have been associated with serious adverse reactions. In healthy subjects treated with 5 mg of zolmitriptan, an increase of 1 and 5 mmHg in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was seen. In a study of patients with moderate to severe liver impairment, 7 of 27 patients experienced 20 to 80 mmHg elevations in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure after a dose of 10 mg of zolmitriptan.

As with all triptans, blood pressure should be monitored in zolmitriptan-treated patients. Zolmitriptan is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)].

### Impact of an interaction between clopidogrel and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^24fc7cf5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is a pro-drug that requires activation by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. Patients receiving clopidogrel are often treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for co-existing depression. SSRIs that inhibit the CYP2C19 enzyme have the potential to reduce the effectiveness of clopidogrel. Using 5 US databases (1998 to 2013), we conducted a cohort study of adults who initiated clopidogrel while being treated with either an SSRI that inhibits CYP2C19 (fluoxetine and fluvoxamine) or a noninhibiting SSRI. Patients were matched by propensity score and followed for as long as they were exposed to both clopidogrel and the index SSRI group (primary analysis) or for 180 days after clopidogrel initiation (sensitivity analysis). Outcomes included a composite ischemic event (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or a revascularization procedure) and a composite major bleeding event (gastrointestinal bleed or hemorrhagic stroke). The final propensity score-matched cohort comprised 9,281 clopidogrel initiators on CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRIs and 44,278 clopidogrel initiators on a noninhibiting SSRIs. Compared with those treated with a noninhibiting SSRI, patients on a CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRI had an increased risk of ischemic events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.24), which was more pronounced in patients ≥ 65 years (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.48). The HR for major bleeding was 0.76 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.17). In conclusion, the findings from this large, population-based study suggest that being treated with a CYP2C19-inhibiting SSRI when initiating clopidogrel may be associated with slight decrease in effectiveness of clopidogrel.

Drug Interactions

See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with indomethacin.

Table 2 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Indomethacin

Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis

Clinical Impact:

· Indomethacin and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of indomethacin and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.

· Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.

Intervention:

Monitor patients with concomitant use of indomethacin extended-release with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Aspirin

Clinical Impact:

Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility.

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI)

[See Dosage and Administration (2.9, 2.10), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

7.2 CNS Acting Drugs

Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of fluoxetine and such drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with fluoxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of fluoxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDS, Aspirin, Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

7.5 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

There are no clinical studies establishing the benefit of the combined use of ECT and fluoxetine. There have been rare reports of prolonged seizures in patients on fluoxetine receiving ECT treatment.

7.6 Potential for Other Drugs to affect Fluoxetine

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^6db93262]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and oral anticoagulants (OACs) and the risk of major bleeding among patients with atrial fibrillation compared with OAC use alone?

Findings

In this nested case-control study comprising 42 190 cases with major bleeding matched to 1 156 641 controls, concomitant SSRI and OAC use was associated with a 33% increased risk of major bleeding compared with OAC use alone; this risk was highest in the first few months of concomitant use and was substantially lower after 6 months.

Meaning

This study suggests that concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs may be a risk factor for bleeding and should be closely monitored, particularly within the initial months of treatment.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bleeding risk in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: an analysis from the ROCKET AF trial [^87f9a3bd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment with oral anticoagulants, including warfarin and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, significantly decreases the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but also increases the risk of bleeding. 1, 2 The risk of bleeding on oral anticoagulants depends on multiple patient factors, including the use of concomitant medications. Because of their relatively favorable side‐effect profiles, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommended by guidelines as first‐line therapy for depressive and anxiety disorders, particularly in the elderly. 3, 4, 5 As a result, SSRIs may be prescribed along with oral anticoagulants in patients with AF, a condition particularly common in older individuals. 6 A concern is that SSRIs have been linked to increased risk of bleeding. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Indeed, the product information for SSRIs includes a warning about possible increased bleeding risk. 17 This increase in bleeding risk is thought to be due to serotonin's role in platelet aggregation, which is inhibited by SSRIs, as well as to a direct decrease in platelet adhesion to both collagen and fibrinogen. 11, 18, 19, 20 Further, SSRIs inhibit the cytochrome P450 metabolic pathway, potentially increasing warfarin's effect. 21, 22, 23 Several studies have reported that the combination of warfarin and SSRIs leads to an increased risk of major hemorrhage. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 No study has yet examined the possible drug‐drug interaction between SSRIs and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. In the current study, we use the experience of the ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Embolism and Stroke Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) (NCT00403767) randomized trial 29 to assess whether SSRIs increased the risk of bleeding in both patients treated with the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban and those treated with warfarin, adjusted to achieve a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0).

### Cerebrovascular effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: a systematic review [^54c6b9e2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

An understanding of cerebro-vascular effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is essential, since SSRIs are a widely used antidepressant, serotonin is a vasoactive and thrombostatic amine, and there is a bidirectional relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search was performed to identify published reports over the period of 1966 through 2003, using the terms SSRIs and antidepressants matched with the terms platelets, coagulation, anticoagulation, bleeding, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, embolism, cerebral ischemia, stroke, cerebrovascular accident, acute and chronic cerebrovascular disease, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular disorder, and cerebral circulation. Adverse event reports collected from the World Health Organization (WHO), manufacturers, and the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) were also examined.

Data Synthesis

Two case-control studies failed to show an association between SSRI use and intracranial hemorrhage, and of these, 1 showed no association with ischemic stroke. Sixteen studies of SSRI treatment in poststroke patients found no significant cerebrovascular adverse reactions. The WHO data have shown several hundred cases of SSRI-associated cerebrovascular disease, but definitive causal relationships remain undetermined. Four cases of vasoconstrictive stroke related to drug interactions between SSRIs and other serotonergic drugs have been reported. PDR and manufacturer reference sources categorized cerebrovascular reaction as an infrequent or rare adverse event related to SSRI use.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that SSRI treatment has a very low rate of cerebrovascular adverse reaction. Pharmacovigilance is required in the use of SSRIs in high-risk populations for bleeding and vasoconstrictive stroke. More research is warranted to examine the variability of pharmacologic and genetic factors, depressive illness, and stroke on the antiplatelet and vasospastic effects of SSRIs and their significance to cerebrovascular protection or adverse reactions.

### Diclofenac sodium [^6e182b64]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hematologic Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.

NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).

### Augmenting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with clomipramine in obsessive-compulsive disorder: benefits and risks [^ad57f9f1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

A small body of literature suggests that clomipramine may usefully augment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients who do not respond to SSRI monotherapy. The combination, however, is associated with the risk of clinically significant drug interactions. Clomipramine can raise the blood levels and hence the adverse effects of most SSRIs, and many SSRIs can raise the blood levels and hence the adverse effects of clomipramine. The latter situation is more important because certain dose-dependent adverse effects of clomipramine, such as seizures, can be life-threatening. This article presents an evidence-based discussion of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic adverse effects of the SSRI-clomipramine combination along with suggestions for dosing and monitoring when the combination is used in OCD.

### The management of major depressive disorder: synopsis of the 2022 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^2646241b]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder — monoamine oxidase inhibitor safety and interactions: Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have a low therapeutic index and, when combined with foods high in tyramine or certain serotonergic or sympathomimetic medications, carry the risk of potentially life-threatening hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. Severe interactions can occur with tyramine intake, the risk of serotonin syndrome with multiple serotonergic agents is greatest when one or both agents are an MAOI, and sympathomimetic agents can precipitate hypertensive crisis when combined with MAOIs. All patients offered a TCA or MAOI should receive education about safety, side effects, and relevant drug-drug and drug-food interactions, and while not suggested as initial treatment strategies, TCAs and MAOIs continue to be effective for complex MDD.

### Drug-drug interactions in an era of multiple anticoagulants: a focus on clinically relevant drug interactions [^46d06fad]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants are commonly prescribed but high risk to cause adverse events. Skilled drug interaction management is essential to ensure safe and effective use of these therapies. Clinically relevant interactions with warfarin include drugs that modify cytochrome 2C9, 3A4, or both. Drugs that modify p -glycoprotein may interact with all direct oral anticoagulants, and modifiers of cytochrome 3A4 may interact with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and serotonergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can increase risk of bleeding when combined with any oral anticoagulant, and concomitant use should be routinely assessed. New data on anticoagulant drug interactions are available almost daily, and therefore, it is vital that clinicians regularly search interaction databases and the literature for updated management strategies. Skilled drug interaction management will improve outcomes and prevent adverse events in patients taking oral anticoagulants.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^019fbbce]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

In all cases, it is important to discuss and document potential benefits and harms with patients and their families, and the lack of robust evidence or marketing authorisation for any drug treatment other than fluoxetine 20 mg once daily. The practicality of blood monitoring in local services may imply that it is not feasible to prescribe antipsychotics and (especially) lithium. It is also important to discuss marketing authorisation regulations for potential antidepressants in your own country (for example in the United Kingdom, marketing authorisation for adolescent depression is only present for fluoxetine). If you are unsure, it is important to discuss cases with your consultant peers and to document this.

If a patient has severe side effects (such as suicidality) on one SSRI, is it safe to try a second SSRI?

While the majority of adolescents given an SSRI have mild, transient side effects, a small number of patients have rarer and more dangerous side effects, including suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, and clotting abnormalities. Many patients and their families (and their prescribers) will choose to stop the medication in this situation.

There is then the question of whether another SSRI should be used. There is no published evidence regarding this. However, in consensus discussions, several psychiatrists have tried the patient on a second SSRI and this has not led to the same side effect. It is likely the patient will have increased risk of, for example, suicidality on a second SSRI compared to a patient who has never had an SSRI, but it could be worth trying, especially in more severe depression which itself carries significant suicide risk. As always, it is important to discuss potential benefits and risks with patients and families and make decisions jointly. It is essential to document these discussions. It is also especially important to follow these patients up regularly when starting a second SSRI and have a clear plan in place for what is to be done if these side effects recur. If unsure, discuss the case with consultant peers and document this.

It is also important to take into account the pharmacological profile of the first and second SSRI. Among the SSRIs, sertraline and citalopram/escitalopram have significantly higher 5-HT specificity than fluoxetine. So, if sertraline caused dangerous side effects, it would be better to try the more different fluoxetine than citalopram as second line.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^84abc905]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Risk of Bleeding

XARELTO increases the risk of bleeding, including in any organ, and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe XARELTO to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding.

Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue XARELTO in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years.

Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y12platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

Concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

Risk of Hemorrhage in Acutely Ill Medical Patients at High Risk of Bleeding

Acutely ill medical patients with the following conditions are at increased risk of bleeding with the use of XARELTO for primary VTE prophylaxis: history of bronchiectasis, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary hemorrhage, active cancer (i.e., undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment), active gastroduodenal ulcer in the three months prior to treatment, history of bleeding in the three months prior to treatment, or dual antiplatelet therapy. XARELTO is not for use for primary VTE prophylaxis in these hospitalized, acutely ill medical patients at high risk of bleeding.

Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect

An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available. Because of high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of rivaroxaban. Use of procoagulant reversal agents, such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa, may be considered but has not been evaluated in clinical efficacy and safety studies. Monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using a clotting test (PT, INR or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not recommended.

### Serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants and abnormal bleeding: a review for clinicians and a reconsideration of mechanisms [^2d6760e4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally believed that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs increase the risk of abnormal bleeding and decrease the risk of ischemic heart disease events by blocking the uptake of serotonin into platelets, leading to an impairment in the platelet hemostatic response.

Objective

To perform a detailed qualitative review of existing literature on the association of abnormal bleeding with the use of SSRIs.

Data Sources

We conducted a PubMed search during June 2009 using the search terms antidepressants and SSRIs (including the names of individual SSRIs: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and escitalopram) in association with bleeding, platelets, hemostasis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, antiplatelet drugs, proton pump inhibitors, peptic ulcer, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, surgery, tooth extraction, dental bleeding, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and other terms related to the field. We then searched the reference lists of identified studies.

Study Selection

We provide a qualitative discussion of all studies that would inform clinicians about the mechanisms of bleeding and bleeding risks associated with these drugs in different clinical contexts.

Results

Epidemiologic studies show that SSRI use is associated with roughly doubled odds of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; bleeding at other sites has been less commonly described, as has a possibly increased risk of bleeding associated with surgical procedures. The risk of SSRI-associated GI bleeding is increased with the concurrent use of NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents and is decreased by concurrent proton pump inhibitors. The risk of bleeding is increased in patients with cirrhosis of the liver or liver failure. There is, curiously, little literature on use of SSRIs and menstrual or postpartum blood loss. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear protective against ischemic heart disease events. The data are too limited to allow interpretations about influences on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusions

On the basis of the findings of our literature search, we suggest that SSRI-induced increase in gastric acid secretion may explain the GI bleeding risk and that SSRI-related effects on platelet reactivity, endothelial reactivity, and inflammatory markers may explain the ischemic heart disease protective effect. Because the absolute risk of GI bleeds with SSRIs is low, precautions are probably necessary only in high-risk patients, such as those with acid-peptic disease and those with a history of bleeds. We discuss management issues and areas for future research.

### Desvenlafaxine [^1705b485]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Elevated Blood Pressure

Patients receiving desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets should have regular monitoring of blood pressure since increases in blood pressure were observed in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Pre-existing hypertension should be controlled before initiating treatment with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. Caution should be exercised in treating patients with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular, or cerebrovascular conditions that might be compromised by increases in blood pressure. Cases of elevated blood pressure requiring immediate treatment have been reported with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets.

Sustained blood pressure increases could have adverse consequences. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, either dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.4 Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SNRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to SSRIs and SNRIs have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor coagulation indices when initiating, titrating, or discontinuing desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets.

5.5 Angle Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Avoid use of antidepressants, including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor interactions and risks in obsessive-compulsive disorder are characterized by limited important drug–drug interactions for "citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline", yet vigilance for "the risk of serotonin syndrome from adding an SSRI to an MAOI, tramadol, meperidine, or dextromethorphan". For up-to-date interaction information, clinicians can consult "the federal National Library of Medicine database… which is also accessible by entering the term 'pubmed' in a search engine".

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^675b159c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based, nested case-control study, the concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs was associated with a 33% increased risk of major bleeding. The association was the strongest for the first few months of concomitant use. The overall risk remained consistent regardless of age, sex, potency of SSRIs, history of major bleeding, or chronic kidney disease as well as type of OAC. Concomitant use was individually associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and other major bleeding. Interaction between SSRIs and OACs, if any, was limited.

In light of these findings, the risk of major bleeding may be a pertinent safety consideration for patients using SSRIs and OACs concomitantly. This finding has been echoed in the summary of product characteristics for different OACs, which describes SSRIs as interacting drugs given that they independently increase the risk of bleeding. Although clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder have acknowledged the risk of bleeding associated with SSRIs, the potential for interaction with OACs was either not discussed or based on very limited evidence. Likewise, guidelines from Canadian, US, and European cardiology associations for the management of AF suggest consideration of drug-drug interactions when prescribing OACs, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs being the only class of drugs cited. Although the European Heart Rhythm Association lists SSRIs as drugs with pharmacodynamic interactions with DOACs, no evidence was cited.

In the assessment of interaction, a small superadditive interaction may have been present, although the estimate was not statistically significant (relative excess risk due to interaction [RERI], 0.10; 95% CI, −0.07 to 0.27) (eTable 6 in Supplement 1). Based on the estimated RERI, the interaction may be associated with approximately 5% of all major bleeding. In addition, there was limited evidence of a multiplicative interaction. Results from sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis (eTables 7–10 in Supplement 1). Finally, the association remained in the time-conditional propensity score–matched analysis, although slightly attenuated (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08–1.40) (eTable 11 in Supplement 1), and was consistent in the post hoc analysis (eTable 12 in Supplement 1).

### Can we recommend mirtazapine and bupropion for patients at risk for bleeding? a systematic review and meta-analysis [^919bce1e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Mirtazapine and bupropion, which commonly lack serotonin reuptake inhibition, have been recommended as alternatives for patients who are at risk for bleeding. However, the evidence for these recommendations is insufficient.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search, systematic review, and meta-analysis to investigate an evidence-based approach for the bleeding risks of mirtazapine and bupropion. From 1946 to May 2017, a total of 3981 studies were searched from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Among the studies, two independent reviewers selected studies per predefined eligibility criteria.

Results

A total of five meta-analyses were conducted. Patients taking mirtazapine were at a greater risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.01–1.38) than those who did not take antidepressants. No differences were observed in the bleeding risk between mirtazapine and SSRI or between bupropion and SSRI.

Limitations

The number of studies included in the meta-analysis was small.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that it is premature to recommend mirtazapine and bupropion for patients who have a bleeding risk. More studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-ups are warranted.

### Diclofenac sodium, capsaicin (flexipak) [^eb23fac4]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Drug Interactions

Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis:

Clinical Impact:

Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.

Intervention:

Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see PRECAUTIONS; Hematological Toxicity).

Aspirin:

Clinical Impact:

Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration, and Perforation).

Intervention:

Concomitant use of diclofenac and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug interactions in patients receiving statins [^6771b20d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Elderly patients commonly receive statin drugs for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Elderly patients also commonly receive antidepressant drugs, usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for the treatment of depression, anxiety, or other conditions. SSRIs are associated with many pharmacokinetic drug interactions related to the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic pathways. There is concern that drugs that inhibit statin metabolism can trigger statin adverse effects, especially myopathy (which can be potentially serious, if rhabdomyolysis occurs). However, a detailed literature review of statin metabolism and of SSRI effects on CYP enzymes suggests that escitalopram, citalopram, and paroxetine are almost certain to be safe with all statins, and rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, and pravastatin are almost certain to be safe with all SSRIs. Even though other SSRI-statin combinations may theoretically be associated with risks, the magnitude of the pharmacokinetic interaction is likely to be below the threshold for clinical significance. Risk, if at all, lies in combining fluvoxamine with atorvastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin, and even this risk can be minimized by using lower statin doses and monitoring the patient.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^87c19596]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Past research has shown positive associations between depression and platelet reactivity, and negative associations between antidepressant use and platelet reactivity. These studies, however, have predominantly been performed in small sample sizes and have utilized heterogenous platelet function assays, leading to inconsistent results.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Our study looked at the effects of depression and antidepressant use, respectively, on platelet reactivity using five distinct platelet function assays across multiple agonists in a large sample size.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Our study shows that antidepressants, particularly those affecting the serotonergic system, have a clear inhibitory effect on platelets in a large, predominantly healthy population. These results spanned multiple platelet reactivity traits derived from a range of platelet agonists. The strongest result of serotonin drugs associating with decreased thromboxane receptor activation was replicated in a distinct Hispanic population. We also show significant associations in an aspirin‐taking subset indicating a synergistic platelet inhibitory effect with concurrent antidepressant and aspirin use. Future researchers employing platelet assays should account for antidepressant use as well as other antiplatelet medications.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Our results indicate that the antiplatelet effect of serotonin‐affecting antidepressants may increase the risk of adverse bleeding or decrease the risk of thrombosis. These results may inform future prospective studies of antidepressant use and bleeding, and thrombotic events, respectively, and may ultimately suggest platelet function testing in clinic for prescription and monitoring of antidepressants.

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^8b065099]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this large population-based, nested case-control study of patients with AF, the concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding compared with OACs alone. To minimize the risk of bleeding, individual modifiable risk factors should be controlled, and patients should be closely monitored, particularly during the first few months of concomitant use.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^e8a02394]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The risks of using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. The drug-drug interactions sections of fluoxetine and olanzapine are applicable to olanzapine and fluoxetine. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

[see Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.2 CNS Acting Drugs

Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of olanzapine and fluoxetine and other CNS-active drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with olanzapine and fluoxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of olanzapine and fluoxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics. Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when olanzapine and fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued.

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with venlafaxine extended-release tablets increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of venlafaxine extended-release tablets and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]

7.11 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAID's, Aspirin, and Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These studies have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRI's and SNRI's are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when venlafaxine extended-release tablets are initiated or discontinued [s ee Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

7.12 Electroconvulsive Therapy

There are no clinical data establishing the benefit of electroconvulsive therapy combined with venlafaxine extended-release tablets treatment.

7.13 Postmarketing Spontaneous Drug Interaction Reports

There have been reports of elevated clozapine levels that were temporally associated with adverse reactions, including seizures, following the addition of venlafaxine.

There have been reports of increases in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or INR when venlafaxine was given to patients receiving warfarin therapy.

7.14 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^2362d618]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios of major bleeding associated with concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs compared with OAC use alone, adjusting for the covariates listed. In a nested case-control approach, odds ratios are unbiased estimators of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with very limited loss in precision. In secondary analyses, we assessed whether the risk of major bleeding varied according to age, sex, chronic kidney disease, history of bleeding, type of OAC (DOACs or VKAs), and potency of SSRIs (strong or moderate serotonin reuptake inhibitors based on the dissociation constant). Next, among patients continuously exposed to OACs and concomitantly exposed to SSRIs and OACs at the index date, we investigated whether the risk of major bleeding varied with the duration of continuous concomitant use of SSRIs in 3 prespecified categories (≤ 30 days, 31–180 days, or > 180 days) compared with OAC use alone. These categories were selected because SSRIs were reported to exert antiplatelet action as early as 2 to 3 weeks after initiation. We defined continuous exposure to SSRIs and OACs separately, allowing a 30-day grace period between consecutive prescriptions where patients were still considered exposed. Patients were then considered concomitant users on any given day if exposed to both drugs on that day. In addition, we used a restricted cubic spline with 5 interior knots to produce a smooth curve of the IRR as a function of continuous duration of use. We also estimated the risk in specific anatomical locations, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and other major bleeding. We assessed the risk of any bleeding associated with concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs. For this analysis, we repeated the selection of cases and controls already described, with cases defined using relevant diagnostic codes in primary electronic medical records. Finally, we assessed whether an interaction was present between SSRIs and OACs with respect to the risk of major bleeding on both the additive and multiplicative scales (eMethods 1 in Supplement 1). In other words, we assessed whether the joint association of the 2 exposures departed from the sum or product of their individual associations with the risk of bleeding, although an additive interaction has been described as most indicative of biological or mechanistic interaction.

### Interactions between classic psychedelics and serotonergic antidepressants: effects on the acute psychedelic subjective experience, well-being and depressive symptoms from a prospective survey study [^591a8e42]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is a resurgence of research into the use of classic psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N, N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and mescaline within clinical settings. Growing evidence suggests that psychedelics administered in controlled settings can produce rapid and sustained symptom improvements in depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety disorders.

In current clinical research involving psychedelic drugs, many subjects are psychiatric patients who may have been using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications (e.g. to treat symptoms of depression, anxiety, OCD or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) for extended periods of time prior to the clinical study, due to their widespread prescription in psychiatric populations. SSRIs and SNRIs, which are classes of drugs that belong to the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) category, exert their effects by blocking serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. This blockade is thought to enhance the serotonin 1A (5-HT 1A) receptor signalling pathway, which fosters stress tolerance and resilience.

Given the lack of established safety data for combined psilocybin and SRIs, patients are typically required to stop taking SRIs for at least 2 weeks before the start of the trial. This precaution is taken in part due to both a lack of fully established evidence for safety and to previous case reports that suggest chronic use of SRIs can reduce the therapeutically important subjective effects of psychedelics. More precisely, an early study published two case reports on the interaction between SRIs and psychedelics. Both patients reported a diminished subjective sensitivity to either psilocybin or LSD. Another early observational study investigated the possible interaction between chronically used SRIs and LSD in subjects who volunteered to be interviewed via standardised questionnaires. It was found that 88% of the patients reported a decreased LSD experience or a virtual elimination of their response to LSD after using SRIs for over 3 weeks, displaying congruent results to the ones reported by.

### Nonvitamin K anticoagulants: risk of bleeding when interacting with other medications: a cohort study from Medicare [^57d76e91]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

After over 50 years of warfarin use for antithrombotic treatment and prophylaxis the first nonvitamin K antagonist (NVKA), dabigatran, was approved by the FDA in 2010. Since then, three other NVKAs have been approved — rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. Compared to VKAs, NVKAs have shown to reduce the risk of bleeding while maintaining adequate antithrombotic efficacy in both clinical trials and real‐world studies. In the last decade, NVKA use has increased worldwide due to their safety profile, with no monitoring and dose‐adjusting needed.

Polypharmacy is a common issue among elderly, with up to 44% prevalence, especially with those receiving NVKA. Previous research has reported rates of polypharmacy among these patients as high as 60%. Polypharmacy is a risk factor for bleeding in the elderly due to potential drug–drug interactions. Patients with an indication for NVKAs may have concomitant exposure to antiplatelets (e.g. coronary heart disease), nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. osteoarthritis, migraine, pain, etc.), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia… etc.), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Drug interactions in anticoagulated patients are clinically relevant as these can increase either the risk of stroke (i.e. lack of efficacy) or the risk of bleeding.

Pharmacokinetic interactions lead to changes in plasma drug concentration, as the interaction can alter the NVKA metabolic pathway (i.e. CYP3A4/P‐glycoprotein). Antiepileptics, such as carbamazepine, induce CYP3A4 and are associated with lack of anticoagulant efficacy due to a decrease in anticoagulant levels. Pharmacodynamic interactions, due to an overlap in the mechanism of action, lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Increased risk of bleeding has been shown for antiplatelets (e.g. clopidogrel, dipyridamole, prasugrel, etc.), NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, etc.), SSRIs (e.g. paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram, etc.), and systemic glucocorticoids (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone, etc.). On the other hand, PPIs reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding when used with oral anticoagulants.

The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of bleeding among a Medicare population receiving NVKA and exposed to potentially interacting medications.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use in pregnancy and risk of postpartum hemorrhage [^3684857d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may predispose to postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) by interfering with platelet-mediated hemostasis and serotonin-mediated myometrial contractility. A meta-analysis of 8 observational studies found that, regardless of drug class, gestational exposure to antidepressants was associated with a small (odds ratio, 1.25) but statistically significantly increased risk of PPH; however, this finding was true only when antidepressant exposure was proximal to the date of delivery. A recent, moderately large, nationally representative, Swedish observational study also found that gestational exposure to SSRIs was associated with a significantly increased risk of PPH; the crude number needed to harm was 48. For reasons related to the methodology employed, it is possible that the risk was underestimated in this study. The findings of the meta-analysis and of the observational study are examined with a view to help readers understand how to critically read and interpret the research literature in the field. A reasonable viewpoint is that the increase in risk of PPH associated with gestational exposure to SSRIs is smaller than the increase in risk associated with obstetric risk factors for PPH; nevertheless, following precautionary measures would be wise. Such measures would include the routine administration of a uterotonic agent immediately after delivery to all women who have received serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment during the month preceding delivery; the choice of uterotonic agent would depend on local hospital protocols. Women at risk should also be closely monitored for continued blood loss during the first 24 hours after delivery.

There are no long-term cardiovascular outcome data; an FDA-mandated trial showed no significant increase in events at planned interim analyses but was terminated early after confidential results at the 25% interim analysis, and a subsequent trial was terminated early for poor recruitment and inadequate power, so long-term cardiovascular safety remains unclear. Patients should be observed for neuropsychiatric adverse effects, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially in individuals younger than 24 years, and patients and families should be counseled for these reactions.

7.3 Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

Serious adverse reactions such as serotonin syndrome have been reported in patients treated with a SSRI and a concomitant monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in patients started on an SSRI who recently received an MAOI and in patients started on an MAOI who recently received an SSRI. Therefore, concomitant use of MAOIs with BRISDELLE or use of BRISDELLE and an MAOI within 14 days of each other is contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Serotonergic Drugs

If concomitant use of BRISDELLE with other serotonergic drugs (e.g., other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) is clinically warranted, consider the increased risk of serotonin syndrome and carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

An interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are co-administered. Adverse reactions, consisting primarily of headache, nausea, sweating, and dizziness, have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking paroxetine. Consequently, concomitant use of BRISDELLE with tryptophan is not recommended.

Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)

Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs are concomitantly administered with NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin. or other drugs that affect coagulation. There may be a pharmacodynamic interaction between paroxetine and warfarin that causes an increased bleeding diathesis despite unaltered prothrombin time. Carefully monitor patients receiving warfarin therapy when BRISDELLE is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Dietary restrictions and drug interactions with monoamine oxidase inhibitors: an update [^50c94107]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are effective treatments for depression that has atypical features or that has failed to respond to other antidepressants. However, MAOIs are underused because clinicians are concerned about dietary and drug interactions with this class of medication. Hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome can occur in rare cases due to interactions between MAOIs and foods containing tyramine as well as interactions with serotonergic and sympathomimetic agents. A better understanding of the foods and drugs that can cause adverse reactions, as well as knowledge of newer MAOIs with mechanisms of action and delivery methods that reduce these risks, may help clinicians to consider the use of these medications, when appropriate, in their patients with depression.

### Use of serotonergic antidepressants and bleeding risk in orthopedic patients [^6e5e5893]. Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been associated with an increased bleeding tendency. Information on the impact of a possible impaired hemostasis associated with the perioperative use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is limited. This study aimed to determine the association between the perioperative use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the amount of blood loss during surgery and perioperative transfusion requirements.

Methods

The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients who underwent elective primary total hip arthroplasty in two hospitals from the period of July 1, 2004 until July 1, 2008. The index group included all users of both serotonergic and nonserotonergic antidepressants. The reference group included a random sample (ratio 1:3) of nonusers. The primary outcome was the amount of intraoperative blood loss. The requirement for blood transfusion was a secondary outcome. The outcomes were adjusted for confounding factors (comorbidity and comedication) using regression techniques.

Results

The index group included 66 users of serotonergic and 29 users of nonserotonergic antidepressants, and the reference group included 285 patients. After adjustment for confounding factors, mean blood loss during surgery was significantly higher in the users of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors when compared with the reference group: 95 mL (95% CI 9–181). Mean blood loss in the users of nonserotonergic antidepressants did not differ from the reference group. Users of antidepressants did not have a higher risk for transfusion.

Conclusions

Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty who continue the use of serotonergic antidepressants show a significantly higher, but clinically unimportant, intraoperative blood loss, without an increase in perioperative transfusion requirements.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^46ab0ab3]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder — monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): The side-effect burden of MAOIs can be significant and includes cardiovascular problems and weight gain, as well as potentially severe drug-drug interactions and dietary restrictions associated with nonselective MAOIs or high-dose selective MAOIs, and this burden combined with the relative lack of evidence for MAOI efficacy argues against the use of these medications except in severely ill OCD patients who have failed most or all first-line treatments and most second-line treatments.

### FDA approves drug to treat, help prevent types of blood clots… [^3ed93853]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Action FDA has approved Xarelto as tablets and an oral suspension to treat venous thromboembolism, or blood clots that form in the veins, and reduce the risk of VTE recurring in pediatric patients from birth to younger than 18 years who have received at least five days of injectable or intravenous treatment for blood clots. Effectiveness The effectiveness of Xarelto to treat and reduce the risk of recurrent VTE was studied in pediatric patients with confirmed VTE. After an initial period, 500 pediatric patients were randomly assigned to receive either Xarelto or standard-of-care medications for three months. At the end of the study, 1. 2% of patients in the Xarelto treatment group had signs or symptoms of recurrent VTE, compared with
3. 0% of patients in the standard-of-care group.

The effectiveness of Xarelto to prevent blood clots after the Fontan procedure was studied in pediatric patients between ages two and eight years with congenital heart disease who had a recent Fontan surgical procedure. In Part A of the study, patients received Xarelto for one year; in Part B, patients were randomly assigned to receive Xarelto or aspirin for one year. At the end of the study, 8. 3% of patients in Part A had a blood clot. In Part B, 1. 6% of patients who received Xarelto had a blood clot compared to
8. 8% of patients who received aspirin. Xarelto was not studied and is not recommended for children younger than six months old who were born prematurely, have fed by mouth for less than 10 days, or weigh less than 5. 7 pounds.

Patients who receive neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture while taking medication to treat or prevent blood clots, such as Xarelto, are at risk of developing a hematoma, which can result in long-term or permanent paralysis. The most common side effects of Xarelto in children include bleeding, cough, vomiting and gastroenteritis. See the prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Xarelto. Designations Xarelto received priority review for this indication.

### International committee on mental health in cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety [^52b6db1c]. Thorax (2016). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — pharmacologic management of depression and anxiety prioritizes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are recommended by virtually all published guidelines as first-line medications for both depression and anxiety; among options, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are described as more likely to be available inexpensively, covered by health plans, have regulatory approvals in a variety of age groups and minimise the potential for medication interactions and side effects. Because the pharmacokinetics of medications may be altered in cystic fibrosis (CF), optimal dose adjustment requires close monitoring of therapeutic benefits, adverse effects and medical status; dose reduction may be required in individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, treatment-emergent adverse effects or drug–drug interactions, whereas dose increases may be required for those with impaired absorption or enhanced hepatic metabolism, partial response to treatment or drug–drug interactions, and therapeutic drug monitoring of blood levels, when available, may supplement clinical monitoring. Clinicians should address the medical and psychiatric history and ensure that patients are informed of medications used for CF; when used with lumacaftor, the doses of citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline may need to be increased. Linezolid is not recommended for use with serotonergic antidepressants when alternatives are readily available; when both are clinically necessary, the lowest effective doses should be used, with informed consent and monitoring for serotonin syndrome. QTc prolongation is more likely with citalopram than other SSRIs, and electrocardiogram (EKG) and electrolyte monitoring can be considered when simultaneous use of multiple medications known to prolong the QTc is clinically necessary.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^48e1e574]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The risks of using olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. The drug-drug interactions sections of fluoxetine and olanzapine are applicable to olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. As with all drugs, the potential for interaction by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic drug inhibition or enhancement, etc.) is a possibility. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

[See Dosage and Administration (2.4, 2.5), Contraindications (4.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.2 CNS Acting Drugs

Caution is advised if the concomitant administration of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and other CNS-active drugs is required. In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)]. Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics. Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules are initiated or discontinued.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and brain hemorrhage: a meta-analysis [^f1219528]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We synthesized the epidemiologic evidence concerning selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) exposure and the risk of CNS hemorrhage.

Methods

We searched for controlled observational studies comparing SSRI therapy with a control group not receiving SSRIs. We used DerSimonian and Laird fixed effect models to compute summary risk associations.

Results

Intracranial hemorrhage was related to SSRI exposure in both unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22–1.78) and adjusted analyses (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.26–1.81). Intracerebral hemorrhage was also associated with SSRI exposure in both unadjusted (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.46–1.91) and adjusted (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.23–1.65) analyses. In a subset of 5 studies (3 of intracranial hemorrhage and 1 each reporting hemorrhagic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage), SSRI exposure in combination with oral anticoagulants was associated with an increased risk of bleeding compared with oral anticoagulants alone (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.33–1.83). When all studies were analyzed together, increased risk was seen across cohort studies (1.61, 95% CI 1.04–2.51), case-control studies (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.20–1.49), and case-crossover studies (OR 4.24, 95% CI 1.95–9.24).

Conclusions

SSRI exposure is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral and intracranial hemorrhage, yet given the rarity of this event, absolute risks are likely to be very low.

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^2e8505a3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antidepressant medications are among the most frequently prescribed class of drugs worldwide, with up to 19% of individuals aged 60 years or older in the US reporting use of an antidepressant over the past 30 days. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most widely used antidepressant medications and are often recommended over other classes of antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder due to their comparable efficacy and favorable safety profile. However, SSRIs have been shown to increase the risk of major bleeding, possibly owing to their inhibition of platelet activation during hemostasis. Although the absolute risk remains low for most individuals who use SSRIs, coprescription with drugs such as oral anticoagulants (OACs) may be consequential. Concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs is common given the prevalence of mental health disorders.

Some observational studies have assessed the association between concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs and the risk of major bleeding. However, some had notable limitations, including exposure misclassification, possible informative censoring, residual confounding, and limited statistical power. Gaps in evidence that may inform the coprescription of SSRIs and OACs include whether the risk varies with demographic or clinical characteristics or between direct OACs (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). In addition, data on the risk of specific types of major bleeding are limited.

To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a population-based, nested case-control study to assess whether the concomitant use of SSRIs and OACs was associated with the risk of major bleeding compared with OAC use alone among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We also assessed whether the risk varied by duration of use, relevant demographic and other risk factors, potency of SSRIs, and OAC type.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and risk of hemorrhagic stroke [^9af7b71a]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are widely prescribed. Several reports have observed an increased bleeding risk associated with SSRI use, which is hypothesized to be secondary to their antiplatelet effect.

Methods

We tested the hypothesis that SSRIs increase the risk for or potentiate the risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with antiplatelets and anticoagulants.

Results

In multivariate analysis, we found no increased risk associated with SSRI use for intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio = 1.1, 95% CI: 0.7 to 1.8; P = 0.63) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (odds ratio = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4 to 1.0; P = 0.054). In addition, potentiation of risk with warfarin or antiplatelets was not observed.

Conclusions

Further studies with larger populations would be needed to exclude a small increase in intracranial hemorrhage risk with SSRI use.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics for Patients Classified by SSRI Use at Any Time

Table 2
Baseline Characteristics for Patients Who Used an SSRI at Any Time and Their Matched No‐SSRI Cohort

The average follow‐up on treatment for safety outcomes for patients on SSRIs was 1.6 years for both patients on SSRIs and the matched SSRI nonusers. The rate of major/NMCR bleeding was 18.57 events per 100 patient‐years versus 16.84 events per 100 patient‐years for matched comparators, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.95–1.43). The aHR for the much less common end point of major bleeds was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.94–1.99) (Table 3). Event rates stratified by rivaroxaban versus warfarin are presented in Table 4. The aHRs for SSRI versus no‐SSRI exposure for safety outcomes in patients taking rivaroxaban (aHR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.82–1.51] for major/NMCR bleeds and 1.13 [95% CI, 0.62–2.06] for major bleeds) were similar to those in patients taking warfarin (aHR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.91–1.60] for major/NMCR bleeds and 1.58 [95% CI, 0.96–2.60] for major bleeds), with no evident interaction of effect (Table 5). There were relatively few efficacy events among the matched pairs. The aHR for all stroke and non‐CNS embolism, SSRI/no‐SSRI, was 1.23 with a wide CI (0.76–2.00) and for ischemic stroke alone was 1.20 (0.69–2.09) (Table 3). For stroke/non‐CNS embolism, the point estimate aHR for SSRI versus no‐SSRI was higher among patients randomized to rivaroxaban (aHR, 1.61) than among patients randomized to warfarin (aHR, 1.09), but the CIs were wide and highly overlapping and the test for interaction was statistically nonsignificant (Table 5). This was similarly true for the more limited efficacy outcome of ischemic stroke. Among the matched pairs, the effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin was also not significantly different among SSRI users and their nonuser comparators. The aHR for rivaroxaban versus warfarin for major/NMCR bleeds was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.72–1.35) for patients taking SSRI versus 1.07 (95% CI, 0.83–1.38) for the no‐SSRI comparators. For stroke/non‐CNS embolism, the aHR of rivaroxaban versus warfarin was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.33–1.68) among patients taking SSRIs and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.24–1.03) among no‐SSRI comparators (interaction P = 0.44) (Table 5).

### Antiplatelet drug interactions [^f2f59231]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Both laboratory studies in healthy volunteers and clinical studies have suggested adverse interactions between antiplatelet drugs and other commonly used medications. Interactions described include those between aspirin and ibuprofen, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the thienopyridine, clopidogrel, and drugs inhibiting CYP2C19, notably the proton pump inhibitors (PPI) omeprazole and esomeprazole. Other interactions between thienopyridines and CYP3A4/5 have also been reported for statins and calcium channel blockers. The ibuprofen/aspirin interaction is thought to be caused by ibuprofen blocking the access of aspirin to platelet cyclo-oxygenase. The thienopyridine interactions are caused by inhibition of microsomal enzymes that metabolize these pro-drugs to their active metabolites. We review the evidence for these interactions, assess their clinical importance and suggest strategies of how to deal with them in clinical practice. We conclude that ibuprofen is likely to interact with aspirin and reduce its anti-platelet action particularly in those patients who take ibuprofen chronically. This interaction is of greater relevance to those patients at high cardiovascular risk. A sensible strategy is to advise users of aspirin to avoid chronic ibuprofen or to ingest aspirin at least 2 h prior to ibuprofen. Clearly the use of NSAIDs that do not interact in this way is preferred. For the clopidogrel CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 interactions, there is good evidence that these interactions occur. However, there is less good evidence to support the clinical importance of these interactions. Again, a reasonable strategy is to avoid the chronic use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19, notably PPIs, in subjects taking clopidogrel and use high dose H2 antagonists instead. Finally, anti-platelet agents probably interact with other drugs that affect platelet function such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and clinicians should probably judge patients taking such combination therapies as at high risk for bleeding.

### Unapproved pharmaceutical ingredients included in dietary supplements associated with US food and drug administration warnings [^ad029b24]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Dapoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that has not been approved by the FDA, was also detected in adulterated sexual enhancement supplements. The use of off-label antidepressant SSRIs to treat premature ejaculation is common; however, antidepressants can increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults. The FDA data show that anyone consuming sexual enhancement dietary supplements has the potential to be unknowingly consuming PDE5 inhibitors or SSRIs, risking interaction with other medications or preexisting health conditions.

Tainted weight loss supplements were commonly adulterated with sibutramine or phenolphthalein. Sibutramine has the potential to substantially increase blood pressure or pulse rate in some patients. This presents a risk to patients with a history of heart disease or stroke. Six dietary supplements marketed for weight loss were found to contain both sibutramine and sildenafil, which lowers blood pressure. These drugs may be included in the same dietary supplement in efforts to counteract each other's effects. Studies indicate that phenolphthalein presents a potential carcinogenic risk and may also lead to gastrointestinal disturbances or irregular heartbeat. It was removed from over-the-counter laxative products in the United States in 1999.

Fluoxetine was also found in adulterated weight loss supplements. Fluoxetine, an SSRI antidepressant like dapoxetine, has been associated with serious adverse effects, including suicidal thinking, abnormal bleeding, and seizures. Although ephedrine was only identified in 2 weight loss supplements, it is an ingredient that the FDA banned in 2004. Even though a number of deaths were attributed to dietary supplements that contained ephedrine, it was still detected in weight loss supplements 6 and 8 years following the ban.

In 2009, 66 muscle building products were recalled in 1 release, contributing substantially to the high number of products associated with a warning that year. Following this recall, muscle building products were rarely reported as adulterated by the FDA. Most adulterated muscle building products contained anabolic steroids or steroid-like substances. Anabolic steroids have been associated with liver injury, hair loss, altered mood, kidney damage, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. Some muscle building products contained aromatase inhibitors. Use of aromatase inhibitors can lead to decreased bone maturation and growth, infertility, aggressive behavior, kidney failure, and liver dysfunction. These products pose a danger to consumers, especially young people and athletes who are often the target market for muscle building products.

### Concomitant use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with oral anticoagulants and risk of major bleeding [^35ae55f7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

This study has notable strengths. First, the selection of a large study population from routine care settings enhanced generalizability and provided sufficient statistical power to generate precise estimates in primary and secondary analyses. Second, selection bias was unlikely because we analyzed a well-defined cohort and used a nested case-control approach. Third, the assessment of additive and multiplicative interactions provided evidence suggesting that any biological interaction between use of SSRIs and OACs and the risk of major bleeding may only be marginally synergistic.

This study also has some limitations. Residual confounding may affect the results given the observational nature of the study. The baseline risk for major bleeding may differ between patients concomitantly using SSRIs and those who were not. To mitigate potential bias, we adjusted for several potential confounders, including some lifestyle risk factors (such as BMI, smoking, and alcohol abuse). Furthermore, the results remained consistent in the time-conditional propensity score–matched analysis and in a post hoc analysis adjusted for additional comedications. Another consideration is that prescriptions recorded in the CPRD are those issued by general practitioners; hence, misclassification of exposure is possible if patients do not follow the treatment regimen. Prescriptions also do not include those issued by specialists, although AF as well as mild and moderate depression are managed mainly by general practitioners in the UK. To explore the potential for misclassification, we varied the exposure assessment window in sensitivity analyses, which produced results consistent with the main results. Finally, outcome misclassification through inaccurate recording of bleeding in the Hospital Episodes Statistics repository may occur. In addition, the physician's judgment may be influenced by knowledge of patient treatment. To mitigate bias, we considered only primary diagnoses and did not include elective hospitalizations.

7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with SYMBYAX increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for VMS — evidence: There is a strong, consistently reported placebo effect, which averages 30% (range, 4–57%). Clinical trials of paroxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, citalopram, and escitalopram demonstrate reductions in hot flash frequency ranging from 25 to 69%, and the composite score of hot flash frequency and severity is reduced by 27–61%. Other agents such as sertraline and fluoxetine show non-statistically significant trends. Meta-analyses and a Cochrane review concluded that SSRIs and SNRIs exert mild-to-moderate effects in women with a history of breast cancer, with similar efficacy to healthy menopausal women, although studies are small. Caution is advised with paroxetine in patients taking tamoxifen because of drug–drug interaction, and the only FDA-approved agent in this class is low-dose paroxetine mesylate.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^21d6b492]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Antidepressants

In 1950s, the antidepressant effects of MAOIs were first discovered when tuberculosis patients were treated with iproniazid. Shortly after iproniazid treatment initiation, patients experienced an antidepressant-like effect with elevated mood. Subsequently, it was shown that iproniazid is a MAOI, with the ability to inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase to catabolise monoamines, preventing monoamine depletion in the brain. Since then, it has been hypothesised that a depletion in other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin contributes to cause MDD. There are different classes of antidepressant drugs, and, primarily, they have been known to work by modulating neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Older generation antidepressants include MAOIs and tricyclics (TCAs), whereas newer types of antidepressants have greater specificity and include selective reuptake inhibitors (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Other antidepressants include tetracyclics and serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors.

Currently, non-selective MAOIs on the market include phenelzine (Nardil), isocarboxazid (Marplan) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). Selective MAOIs include selegiline (Emsam) and clorgyline. However, the use of such drugs declined because of their serious side effects, such as those related to food and drug interactions. MAOIs are used as a third or fourth line of the therapy when other types of therapy have failed.

The therapeutic action of TCAs is known to occur via inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. These include imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Elavil), nortiptyline (Allegron), trimipramine (Surmontil), protriptyline (Concordin) and iprindole (Prondol). However, TCAs have multiple nonspecific actions that are associated with side effects. These nonspecific actions include anticholinergic–antimuscarinic (M1), α-1 adrenergic antagonistic and antihistaminergic activities (H1). Furthermore, large doses of TCAs inhibit sodium channels, leading to lethal cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. For this reason, TCA antidepressants are used with caution in patients with high risk of CVD. Moreover, TCA-induced weight gain is one of the main reasons for the discontinuation of treatment within 1 month.

### A critical review of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-associated bleeding: balancing the risk of treating hepatitis C-infected patients [^91bd2e56]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are increasingly being used to treat interferon-associated side effects in patients receiving hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy. Because there is an increased risk of bleeding in HCV-infected patients who have developed cirrhosis and either portal hypertension or hepatic failure or both, we critically reviewed the literature on SSRI-associated bleeding.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We performed a MEDLINE search of literature from 1966 to the present using hemorrhage, SSRI, and antidepressants as search terms and followed up on relevant citations. We reviewed 6 retrospective studies, 5 of which were case-control studies, and 18 case reports of bleeding in 37 people. Our review is supplemented with a case report of a possible connection between SSRI treatment and a fatal gastrointestinal bleed in an HCV-infected man.

Data Synthesis

Bleeding events in 12/18 reports (67%) describing 19/24 people (79%) were closely associated with the use of SSRIs.

Conclusion

Combining aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with SSRIs for the treatment of interferon-associated neuropsychiatric side effects increases the risks of hemorrhage in patients with HCV who have developed cirrhosis and either portal hypertension or hepatic failure or both. We recommend that clinicians exercise caution when prescribing medications that can promote spontaneous bleeding to patients with multiple risk factors for internal hemorrhage.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bleeding risk in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: an analysis from the ROCKET AF trial [^097b8271]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There is concern that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (s) substantially increase bleeding risk in patients taking anticoagulants.

Methods and Results

We studied 737 patients takings in thetrial of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke/systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. These patients were propensity score matched 1:1 to 737 patients not takings. The primary outcome measure was major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding events, the principal safety outcome in. Over a mean 1.6 years of follow‐up, the rate of major/bleeding was 18.57 events/100 patient‐years forusers versus 16.84 events/100 patient‐years for matched comparators, adjusted hazard ratio of 1.16 (95%0.95–1.43). Thes were similar in patients taking rivaroxaban (1.11 [95%0.82–1.51]) and those taking warfarin (1.21 [95%0.91–1.60]). For the rarer outcome of major bleeding, theforusers versus those not takings was 1.13 (95%0.62–2.06) for rivaroxaban; for warfarin, thewas higher, at 1.58 (95%, 0.96–2.60) but not statistically significantly elevated.

Conclusions

We found no significant increase in bleeding risk whens were combined with anticoagulant therapy, although there was a suggestion of increased bleeding risk withs added to warfarin. While physicians should be vigilant regarding bleeding risk, our results provide reassurance thats can be safely added to anticoagulants in patients with.

### Effects of antidepressant type on allostatic load of male and female psychiatric outpatients [^7f3a4ba2]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Sex differences and antidepressant use are not systematically accounted for in studies measuring physiological dysregulations associated with chronic stress and allostatic load (AL) in neuropsychiatry. Critically, assessing commonly prescribed antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) could help monitor potential iatrogenic effects on AL and health that are associated with prolonged antidepressant use. The objective of this exploratory analysis was to investigate how male and female psychiatric outpatients using either SSRIs or SNRIs differ in their AL indices. To achieve this, we used data from a larger project collecting administrative, medical, and biological data among psychiatric outpatients of the Anjou Clinic for Mood and Anxiety Disorders, based in Montreal, Canada (n = 116). Sociodemographic variables included age and birth-assigned sex. We calculated AL using 10 biomarkers reflecting cardiovascular (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse) and metabolic (glucose, creatinine, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol/HDL ratio, triglycerides, body mass index) functioning. Psychiatric medications were classified using the Anatomical and Therapeutic Classification system. We found that relative to female outpatients, male outpatients showed significantly higher AL levels. In addition, relative to SSRI users, SNRI users had significantly higher AL levels. However, there were no interactions effects between birth-assigned sex and antidepressant types on AL. We discuss the potential clinical implications of our findings, as well as directions for future studies that aim to investigate AL among male and female patients using antidepressants.

### Drug-drug interactions involving classic psychedelics: a systematic review [^269d7ae9]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Serotonin reuptake inhibitors

Interestingly, the blocking of serotonin reuptake transporters with SSRIs, such as fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine, reduced the effects of LSD as reported in one study. Moreover, fluoxetine also delayed the onset of LSD effects in nearly half of the participants in the same study and was shown to markedly decrease sensitivity to LSD in one case report. SSRIs can also result in DDI at the pharmacokinetic level as some of them, such as fluoxetine, are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 enzymes, which can modulate the effects of psychedelics that are being metabolised by such enzymes. For example, CYP2D6 enzymatic activity is already known to influence the effects of LSD. Considering this, one might have expected a stronger and more prolonged response from LSD instead of reduced effects. However, ultimately this could involve an interplay between various molecular actions, including interactions with enzymes, receptor availability and other molecular factors.

Trazodone, which was previously described to reduce LSD effects as it is a 5-HT 2A antagonist, is also a serotonin receptor antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) that might have a role in the observed effects as well. Potentially, SSRIs and SARIs that increase extracellular serotonin by inhibiting its uptake can then attenuate the effects of psychedelics via receptor competition with the endogenous serotonin. In addition, it has been shown that repeated administration of SSRIs desensitises 5-HT 2A receptors which may reduce the cell's response to psychedelics by binding to these receptors. Chronic SSRI use can also increase serotonin release via desensitisation of 5-HT 1A raphe autoreceptors.

However, one SSRI, escitalopram, did not have an effect on psilocybin-induced positive mood or mind-altering effects (depersonalisation, oceanic boundlessness or euphoria), but it did reduce ego disintegration and anxiety. The authors hypothesised that while LSD does not affect the serotonin transporter, psilocin has a weak inhibitory effect on it. This distinction in pharmacology could lead to different interactions between antidepressants and LSD compared to psilocybin, explaining the differences in response. Although this study offers important insights into the safety of administering psilocybin to patients taking escitalopram, it is crucial to bear in mind that the treatment phase of this study was 14 days. Longer treatment periods with escitalopram, which may often last for years, could lead to distinct outcomes due to molecular changes that occur over extended periods.

### Diclofenac sodium topical (diclofenac sodium 1.5%) [^2c42f867]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Hematologic Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect on erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with diclofenac sodium has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.

NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Co-morbid conditions such as coagulation disorders, concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding [see DRUG INTERACTIONS (7)].

The effects of diclofenac sodium on platelet function were studied in 10 healthy subjects administered 80 drops four times a day for 7 days. There was no significant change in platelet aggregation following one week of treatment [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.4)].

5.13 Masking of Inflammation and Fever

The pharmacological activity of diclofenac sodium in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.

5.14 Laboratory Monitoring

Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)].

### Vorapaxar (Zontivity) [^d7b08599]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Like other antiplatelet agents, ZONTIVITY increases the risk of bleeding. (5.1)
Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers. (5.2)

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Antiplatelet agents, including ZONTIVITY, increase the risk of bleeding, including ICH and fatal bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

ZONTIVITY increases the risk of bleeding in proportion to the patient's underlying bleeding risk. Consider the underlying risk of bleeding before initiating ZONTIVITY. General risk factors for bleeding include older age, low body weight, reduced renal or hepatic function, history of bleeding disorders, and use of certain concomitant medications (e.g., anticoagulants, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDS], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) increases the risk of bleeding [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of warfarin or other anticoagulants.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), or other surgical procedures.

Withholding ZONTIVITY for a brief period will not be useful in managing an acute bleeding event because of its long half-life. There is no known treatment to reverse the antiplatelet effect of ZONTIVITY. Significant inhibition of platelet aggregation remains 4 weeks after discontinuation [see Overdosage (10) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].

5.2 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors or Inducers

Strong CYP3A inhibitors increase and inducers decrease ZONTIVITY exposure. Avoid concomitant use of ZONTIVITY with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Anticoagulants and psychotropic medications are commonly prescribed together. Thus, the potential for interaction exists. Whereas thrombolytics and heparins are implicated in few pharmacokinetic interactions, warfarin and platelet inhibitors have been implicated in various interactions with psychotropic medications.

### Diclofenac potassium (Cambia) [^efed770e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.13	Hematologic Toxicity

Anemia has occurred in NSAID-treated patients. This may be due to occult or gross blood loss, fluid retention, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. If a patient treated with CAMBIA has any signs or symptoms of anemia, monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit.

NSAIDs, including CAMBIA, may increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of warfarin and other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) may increase this risk. Monitor these patients and any patient who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function for signs of bleeding [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.14	Masking of Inflammation and Fever

The pharmacological activity of CAMBIA in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of diagnostic signs in detecting infections.

5.15 Laboratory Monitoring

Because serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms or signs, consider monitoring patients on long-term NSAID treatment with a CBC and a chemistry profile periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.6)].

Discontinue CAMBIA if abnormal liver tests or renal tests persist or worsen.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^c0a878c3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

While it seems clear that serotonin transporter (SERT)–acting drugs inhibit platelets, research on the clinical significance of such inhibition is much less concordant. There are two primary implications regarding the platelet inhibitory effect of serotonin‐affecting ADs in the clinic. The first is that serotonin‐affecting ADs, most commonly SSRIs, can increase the risk of adverse bleeding. In a recent meta‐analysis of bleeding risk pertaining to SSRI use, SSRIs were associated with a 41% and 36% increase of bleeding in case‐control studies and cohort studies, respectively. This increased risk was associated with concurrent nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drug use and found to be mainly gastrointestinal (GI)‐related. However, an odds ratio of 1.16 was observed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), a serious adverse bleeding event. It is important to note that many of the studies included in this meta‐analysis were comprised of high‐risk populations, such as surgical patients, who are more prone to bleeds. Additionally, SSRIs have been implicated in higher risk for endoscopic mucosal injuries and GI duodenal perforation when used in combination with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, which may suggest that the increased risk of GI bleeds with SSRI treatment is not entirely antiplatelet in nature, but rather due in part to GI toxicity. Another interesting critique of past studies citing increased risk of bleeding on SSRIs, particularly in the context of ICH, is the extent to which covariates are adjusted for. In a study which adjusted for many covariates, including the concurrent diagnosis of depression, no association was found between ICH and SSRI use, suggesting that depression's link to unfavorable lifestyle factors such as lack of adherence to medical treatment, lack of exercise, poor diet, or increased risk of alcohol and drug use may have confounded past positive association results with ICH in SSRI users.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^6532c2bc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Tinnitus — patient information on dietary supplements (Table 16): No dietary supplement or herb has been approved for the treatment of tinnitus, and none has been shown to cure tinnitus, and such supplements are readily available and, at present, do not need US Food and Drug Administration approval. Dietary supplements can cause side effects, especially when taken along with conventional medications or other supplements, and ginkgo biloba can interact with other blood thinners to cause serious bleeding and can worsen bleeding risk in patients with underlying clotting disorders. Patients with tinnitus should discuss use of dietary supplements with their physician or other health care practitioner to minimize the risk of side effects, and clinicians should counsel tinnitus patients about the use of supplements.

### Serotonin-affecting antidepressant use in relation to platelet reactivity [^582db051]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The results of our study could lend support to either hypothesis of clinical relevance. The role of platelets in arterial thrombosis is well established, and platelets have long been a proven drug target for secondary CVD prevention and management. Thus, it follows that the antiplatelet effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs could lead to improvements in cardiovascular health. Given that CVD and depression are often comorbid, adding a serotonin‐affecting AD to the regimen of those at high risk for thrombosis may bear parallels to dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and an ADP inhibitor, which has been found to decrease the risk of secondary cardiovascular events when compared with aspirin alone. Conversely, it is intuitive that inhibiting platelets too much could eventually lead to adverse bleeding. Use of aspirin in primary prevention has grown out of favor in recent years. Still, whether aspirin or other antiplatelet therapy combinations are applied in primary or secondary prevention, our results suggest there could be synergistic pharmacodynamic effects of serotonin‐affecting ADs with these medications that might be beneficial in patients at high risk for thrombosis, while also potentially increasing the likelihood of bleeding outcomes, a trade‐off that might not be overall favorable in low‐risk individuals. While it is unlikely that SSRIs significantly increase the risk of bleeding in the general population, those at a higher risk for bleeding may benefit more from a nonserotonergic AD such as the NDRI bupropion, which has been shown to be well tolerated and which seemed to exert minimal effects on platelets in our study. Overall, future large‐scale, comprehensively controlled studies of serotonin‐affecting AD use and both bleeding and cardiovascular event risk, respectively, are needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of serotonin‐affecting AD's antiplatelet effects.

### Desvenlafaxine succinate (Pristiq) [^fe064bc3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Advise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Concomitant Medication

Advise patients taking PRISTIQ not to use concomitantly other products containing desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine. Healthcare professionals should instruct patients not to take PRISTIQ with an MAOI or within 14 days of stopping an MAOI and to allow 7 days after stopping PRISTIQ before starting an MAOI [see Contraindications (4)].

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of PRISTIQ with other serotonergic agents (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, amphetamines, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort supplements) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elevated Blood Pressure

Advise patients that they should have regular monitoring of blood pressure when taking PRISTIQ [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Increased Risk of Bleeding

Inform patients about the concomitant use of PRISTIQ with NSAIDs, aspirin, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other coagulants because the combined use of has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their healthcare providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the-counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Activation of Mania/Hypomania

Advise patients, their families and caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Discontinuation Syndrome

Advise patients not to abruptly stop taking PRISTIQ without talking first with their healthcare professional. Patients should be aware that discontinuation effects may occur when stopping PRISTIQ, and a dose of 25 mg per day is available for discontinuing therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bleeding risk in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: an analysis from the ROCKET AF trial [^f77b94c6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Our study has several notable limitations and strengths. The use of SSRIs in ROCKET AF was driven by clinical judgment and not randomized allocation. However, because SSRIs are not usually included as a major interacting drug with vitamin K antagonists or rivaroxaban, there is reduced concern about "confounding by contraindication". Moreover, our propensity score matched approach resulted in a good balance of observed potential confounders. Still, in any nonrandomized assessment of drug effect, there may be residual confounding. As part of a large randomized trial, our study benefited from the careful prospective data collection, close follow‐up, and formal adjudication of bleeding events by a committee blinded to oral anticoagulant assignment. In a formal sense, however, our results are not necessarily generalizable beyond the types of patients we analyzed in ROCKET AF. Although the end point of major/NMCR bleeding events is not as clinically important as major bleeding events alone, major/NMCR bleeding events were the primary safety outcome of the ROCKET AF trial and provide a more statistically powerful assessment of SSRI effect. Studies have reported that bleeding risk with SSRIs was associated with degree of inhibition of serotonin reuptake. 24 We had too few users of strong and weaker serotonin reuptake inhibitors to test this effect. More generally, we assessed SSRIs as a class and cannot assess the effect of individual SSRI agents.

In conclusion, we did not find a significantly increased risk of bleeding among patients in ROCKET AF assigned to either warfarin or rivaroxaban anticoagulant therapy who also took SSRIs. Both anticoagulants and SSRIs are used among predominantly older patients with AF, and their concurrent use is not uncommon. In general, our findings provide some reassurance that the addition of SSRIs to oral anticoagulants does not substantially increase the risk of bleeding. This reassurance has to be tempered somewhat, given the modestly elevated, but statistically nonsignificant, aHR for major bleeding we observed for the addition of SSRIs to warfarin and the upper bound of the hazard ratio CI.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — bleeding risk signals: SSRIs decrease platelet serotonin uptake and have been associated with surgical bleeding in breast and orthopedic surgery and with increased gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with antiplatelet therapy. In a large epidemiologic study, combined SSRI use with NSAIDs or low-dose aspirin increased the observed/expected ratios of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to 12.2 (95% CI, 7.1–19.5) and 5.2 (95% CI, 3.2–8.0), respectively. Although routine discontinuation is not advocated, for high-risk patients multidisciplinary discussion with the treating physician may aid decision-making.

### Association of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with the risk for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage [^07d4ccbe]. JAMA Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase the risk for spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an effect that is in theory linked to the strength of inhibition of serotonin reuptake of an antidepressant. However, whether antidepressants that are strong inhibitors of serotonin reuptake actually increase the risk for ICH and the effect of concomitant use of antithrombotics are unknown.

Objectives

To assess the risk for ICH associated with the use of SSRIs compared with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) among new users of antidepressants and according to the relative affinity of the antidepressant for the serotonin transporter and to assess whether concomitant use of antithrombotics modifies this risk.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based cohort study included new users of antidepressants 18 years or older from January 1, 1995, to June 30, 2014. More than 650 general practices in the United Kingdom contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink enrolled patients. with use of a nested case-control approach, each case of a first ICH identified during follow-up was matched with as many as 30 control individuals by age, sex, calendar time, and duration of follow-up. Follow-up was completed on October 31, 2014.

Interventions

Current use of SSRIs compared with TCAs and strong compared with weak serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence rate ratios (RRs) of ICH.

Results

Among a cohort of 1 363 990 incident users of antidepressants (36.8% male; 63.2% female; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [18.5] years), 3036 cases of ICH were identified during follow-up and matched to 89 702 controls. Current SSRI use was associated with an increased risk for ICH (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02–1.35) relative to TCAs, highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04–1.99), and translating in very few additional events. Similarly, the risk was increased by 25% with strong inhibitors (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.54) and highest during the first 30 days of use (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.90–3.12). Concomitant use of anticoagulants may increase the risk substantially (RR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.89–3.39).

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of SSRIs and more generally of antidepressants with strong inhibition of serotonin reuptake are associated with an increased risk for ICH, particularly in the first 30 days of use and when used concomitantly with oral anticoagulants.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and bleeding risk in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation: an analysis from the ROCKET AF trial [^4aa15b87]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In our current analysis from the ROCKET AF randomized trial, we assessed the risk of major plus NMCR bleeding due to the addition of SSRIs to anticoagulants for patients with AF. To reduce confounding, we used a propensity score matched analysis with additional adjustment for potential confounders in Cox regression models. Our study provides estimates of SSRI effect when combined with the non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban, as well as with a standard warfarin regimen aimed at an INR target of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). The aHR for major/NMCR bleeds was 1.16 (95% CI, 0.95–1.43) among patients taking either trial anticoagulant. When examined according to allocated anticoagulant, the aHR was 1.21 (95% CI, 0.91–1.60) for patients taking warfarin and 1.11 (95% CI, 0.82–1.51) for those taking rivaroxaban, with no significant interaction between taking SSRIs and type of anticoagulant. For the much less common outcome of major bleeding, the aHR was a nonsignificant 1.37 (95% CI, 0.94–1.99) with aHRs of 1.13 (95% CI, 0.62–2.06) for patients assigned to rivaroxaban and 1.58 (95% CI, 0.96–2.60) for patients assigned to warfarin, but with a nonsignificant test for interaction. If SSRIs conferred an additional anticoagulant effect, we might expect a reduced rate of stroke/non‐CNS embolism among SSRI users. In fact, we observed a small, statistically nonsignificant increase in the rate of efficacy events in patients taking SSRIs, although the precision of this estimate was limited by the small number of events. Finally, viewing the results from the alternate perspective, there was no significant difference due to SSRI status in the comparison of rivaroxaban versus warfarin.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescribing and interactions include that concomitant administration of SSRIs with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated because of increased risk of serotonin syndrome, SSRIs (especially citalopram) also may interact with drugs that prolong the QT interval, and fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline inactivate the enzymes that metabolize by CYP2D6, with fluvoxamine interacting with CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6; citalopram/escitalopram may have the least effect on CYP450 isoenzymes. Citalopram may cause QT prolongation with serious arrhythmias and sudden death at daily doses exceeding 40 mg/d and should be avoided in patients with long QT syndrome, paroxetine has been associated with increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to other SSRIs, and as noted below, fluvoxamine may have greater potential for drug–drug interactions. When starting a second non-MAOI serotonergic drug, caution entails starting at a low dose, increasing the dose slowly, and monitoring for symptoms, especially in the first 24 to 48 hours after dosage changes.
