## Question

Thrombocytopenia management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding pseudothrombocytopenia. Then, I should classify severity and urgency. Next, I will determine the etiology and mechanism to guide therapy. After that, I need to set treatment thresholds by context, including ITP, acute leukemia, and pregnancy. Then, I will outline first-line therapies, followed by second-line and special-population strategies. Finally, I should address monitoring, transfusion thresholds, and procedure planning, and close with a concise algorithmic summary that aligns with major guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, because EDTA-related platelet clumping can artifactually lower the automated count; I should verify with a peripheral smear and, if needed, citrate-anticoagulated samples before labeling someone as thrombocytopenic, and I should also review the CBC indices and blood film for schistocytes, blasts, or dysplasia that would redirect the differential toward TMA, leukemia, or MDS respectively [^notfound].

> Next, I should review severity and clinical context to triage urgency; I need to check for life-threatening bleeding, neurologic symptoms, or active major hemorrhage, and I should confirm whether the presentation is new-onset versus chronic, outpatient versus inpatient, and whether there are complicating comorbidities or medications such as anticoagulants that increase bleeding risk, since these factors shift thresholds for admission and intervention [^113GsTiC] [^113h8nQU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should categorize the likely mechanism because management diverges substantially: decreased production (MDS, aplastic anemia, chemotherapy), increased destruction (ITP, TTP/HUS, DIC, HIT), sequestration (hypersplenism), or dilutional/consumptive states (massive transfusion, sepsis), and I must keep in mind that drug-induced thrombocytopenia is common and requires prompt medication review and discontinuation when suspected [^116PPrYK] [^114smUyv].

> I will now examine etiologies that demand urgent action: HIT with a 50% or greater platelet drop and thrombosis risk requires immediate heparin cessation and initiation of a non-heparin anticoagulant; TTP/HUS mandates urgent plasma exchange; and catastrophic APS needs aggressive anticoagulation and supportive care, so I should double-check for these patterns before proceeding with routine ITP management [^1146MdPx].

> Let me consider ITP-specific treatment thresholds in adults; for newly diagnosed ITP, I should confirm that observation without steroids is reasonable at platelet counts of 30 × 10⁹/L or higher if asymptomatic or with only minor mucocutaneous bleeding, whereas at counts below 30 × 10⁹/L, a short course of corticosteroids is suggested, with shared decision-making about risks and comorbidities, and I need to ensure close follow-up and patient education if managing as an outpatient [^112JyWuG] [^11459Ux2] [^115kN1dN].

> Wait, I should verify admission thresholds; in adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelets below 20 × 10⁹/L, admission is suggested, but once the diagnosis is established and reliable follow-up is assured, outpatient management is reasonable even at low counts, so I must balance diagnostic uncertainty, social determinants, and bleeding phenotype when deciding on hospitalization [^1117SQQf] [^112sUSip] [^114AGyEi].

> For children with ITP, I need to ensure I apply the higher observation threshold; most can be managed as outpatients even with counts below 20 × 10⁹/L if there is no or only mild skin bleeding, reserving admission for diagnostic uncertainty, social barriers, or unreliable follow-up, and I should confirm that first-line therapy favors corticosteroids over IVIG when treatment is indicated for non–life-threatening bleeding or quality-of-life impairment [^114Lnky9] [^112ryBN8] [^113XhQNn].

> Now, I should review first-line therapies for ITP; corticosteroids remain the cornerstone with options like prednisone or dexamethasone pulses, and I should confirm that IVIG or anti-D can be used when a rapid rise is needed or steroids are contraindicated, while remembering that many adults relapse after steroid taper and that patient-reported outcomes and side-effect monitoring should be built into care plans [^116EAqos] [^115cE4iR] [^11459Ux2].

> Hold on, I should verify second-line choices; ASH 2019 suggests a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (eltrombopag or romiplostim) in preference to rituximab for most adults, while acknowledging that rituximab, fostamatinib, or splenectomy remain reasonable alternatives depending on patient preferences, comorbidities, access, and tolerance, and I need to emphasize that comparative head-to-head data are limited and decisions should be individualized [^111D26Sr] [^117MXzwT] [^114jkywA].

> Let me reconsider pediatric second-line preferences; I should confirm that TPO-RAs are favored over rituximab in children when second-line therapy is indicated, aligning with the general shift away from splenectomy and toward steroid-sparing agents, while still engaging families in shared decision-making given differing routes, toxicities, and remission expectations [^114Zg8ux] [^116pGhdm].

> Next, I should review special populations; in pregnancy, most thrombocytopenia is gestational and benign, but I need to distinguish GT from ITP, preeclampsia/HELLP, and TMAs, and for ITP in pregnancy I should prefer IVIG or corticosteroids, avoid splenectomy during pregnancy, and coordinate peripartum planning with obstetrics and anesthesia, including neonatal platelet surveillance and consideration of NAT exclusion if neonatal thrombocytopenia is severe [^116AKhV4] [^116a7Ffg] [^113XG97K].

> For acute leukemia and hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, I should confirm prophylactic transfusion thresholds; empiric platelet transfusion is recommended when the count is below 10 × 10⁹/L, with a higher threshold of 20 × 10⁹/L or more for active bleeding, and I need to check for alloimmunization if refractory, using cross-matching, HLA-matched platelets, or HLA avoidance strategies, and I should remember leukoreduction to reduce alloimmunization risk [^111jiqBh] [^114D2R8g] [^113t69De] [^112hLtVx].

> I should double-check procedure-related thresholds; evidence is limited and decisions should be individualized, but many centers use pragmatic cutoffs such as 50 × 10⁹/L for most invasive procedures and higher thresholds for neurosurgical or ophthalmic interventions, balancing bleeding risk against transfusion harms and considering pharmacologic adjuncts like tranexamic acid or desmopressin when appropriate [^115xKJwz] [^115xBXaC].

> Let me verify monitoring and follow-up; newly diagnosed ITP patients started on steroids require frequent platelet checks and assessment of steroid toxicities including mood, sleep, glucose, and bone health, and all patients should receive education on bleeding precautions, medication interactions, and when to seek urgent care, with structured pathways improving adherence to guideline-concordant care in pediatrics [^11459Ux2] [^113zg6WR].

> But wait, what if the patient has cancer-associated VTE with thrombocytopenia; I need to ensure anticoagulation is individualized, often using reduced-dose regimens or temporary interruption based on platelet nadir and bleeding risk, recognizing that both thrombosis and bleeding risks are elevated and that high-quality evidence is sparse, so shared decision-making and close surveillance are essential [^116YRPLg].

> Finally, I should synthesize an algorithm: confirm true thrombocytopenia and exclude emergencies like HIT, TTP/HUS, and catastrophic APS; classify mechanism and severity; apply context-specific thresholds (observe ITP ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L if well, treat most < 30 × 10⁹/L, admit new ITP < 20 × 10⁹/L, transfuse leukemia < 10 × 10⁹/L); initiate first-line therapy tailored to etiology (steroids/IVIG/anti-D for ITP, plasma exchange for TTP, non-heparin anticoagulation for HIT); escalate to TPO-RAs or rituximab for refractory ITP with shared decision-making; and coordinate procedures and pregnancy-specific plans, ensuring longitudinal monitoring and patient education throughout [^116EAqos] [^111jiqBh] [^1146MdPx] [^116AKhV4].

Thrombocytopenia management is guided by **platelet count, bleeding, and etiology** [^115pP14b] [^113h8nQU]. For counts ≥ 30×10⁹/L without bleeding, **observe and avoid steroids** [^112JyWuG]; for counts < 30×10⁹/L or with bleeding, use **corticosteroids or IVIG** [^11459Ux2] [^116pGhdm]. In life-threatening bleeding, give **platelets, IVIG, and corticosteroids** [^notfound]. For refractory ITP, use TPO-RAs or rituximab; reserve splenectomy for selected cases [^111D26Sr] [^117MXzwT]. In pregnancy, favor corticosteroids or IVIG; avoid splenectomy and TPO-RAs unless necessary [^116AKhV4]. For HIT, stop heparin and start a non-heparin anticoagulant [^1146MdPx]. In acute leukemia, transfuse at < 10×10⁹/L, or < 20×10⁹/L if bleeding or high risk [^111jiqBh]. Always address the cause and monitor for bleeding and treatment toxicity [^113h8nQU].

---

## General principles of management

- **Confirm true thrombocytopenia**: Rule out pseudothrombocytopenia (platelet clumping) with a peripheral smear [^notfound].
- **Identify the cause**: Use history, exam, and labs to distinguish immune, drug-induced, infection-related, marrow failure, or sequestration etiologies [^113h8nQU].
- **Assess bleeding risk**: Base decisions on platelet count, bleeding history, comorbidities, and medications [^112JyWuG].
- **Treat the underlying cause**: Remove offending drugs, treat infections, or address marrow failure [^114smUyv].

## Platelet transfusion thresholds

| **Clinical scenario** | **Platelet count threshold** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| No bleeding, stable | < 10×10⁹/L | Transfuse to prevent spontaneous bleeding [^114D2R8g] |
| Active bleeding, high risk, or invasive procedures | < 20×10⁹/L | Higher thresholds for neurosurgery/ophthalmic procedures [^notfound] |
| Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) | Generally avoid transfusion unless severe bleeding | Transfused platelets are rapidly destroyed [^notfound] |

## Management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)

### First-line therapy

- **Observation**: For ≥ 30×10⁹/L without bleeding [^112JyWuG].
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone or dexamethasone for < 30×10⁹/L or with bleeding [^115tWvzE].
- **IVIG**: Rapid effect for severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding [^113mhdD2].
- **Anti-D immunoglobulin**: Alternative to IVIG in Rh-positive patients [^notfound].

---

### Second-line therapy

- **TPO receptor agonists**: Eltrombopag or romiplostim for refractory ITP [^111D26Sr] [^117MXzwT].
- **Rituximab**: For refractory cases or intolerance to TPO-RAs [^116EAqos].
- **Splenectomy**: For refractory cases; declining use due to TPO-RAs [^116pGhdm].

---

### Special considerations

For severe bleeding, combine **platelets, IVIG, and corticosteroids** [^113mhdD2]. In pregnancy, prefer corticosteroids or IVIG; avoid splenectomy and TPO-RAs unless necessary [^notfound].

---

## Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

- **Stop heparin**: Immediately stop all heparin sources [^1146MdPx].
- **Start non-heparin anticoagulation**: Argatroban, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux [^1146MdPx].
- **Monitor platelets**: Until recovery and thrombosis risk declines [^notfound].

---

## Management of thrombocytopenia in acute leukemia

Transfuse at **< 10×10⁹/L** if there is no bleeding, or at **< 20×10⁹/L** if there is bleeding or high risk [^111jiqBh]. For alloimmunization, use HLA-matched or cross-matched platelets [^113t69De].

---

## Management of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy

Gestational thrombocytopenia requires **no treatment** beyond observation [^notfound]. For ITP in pregnancy, use corticosteroids or IVIG; avoid splenectomy and TPO-RAs unless necessary [^notfound]. Delivery planning should coordinate with obstetrics and anesthesia to balance maternal and fetal risks [^116AKhV4].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **platelet counts** and bleeding symptoms, and adjust therapy accordingly [^115pP14b]. Monitor for treatment toxicity — including steroid side effects, **thrombosis with TPO-RAs**, and infection risk with immunosuppression [^11459Ux2]. Provide patient education on **bleeding precautions** and when to seek care [^114AGyEi].

---

Thrombocytopenia management is individualized by **count, bleeding, and etiology**, with observation for low risk and corticosteroids or IVIG for higher risk or bleeding; escalate to TPO-RAs or rituximab if refractory, and address special contexts like HIT, pregnancy, and leukemia.

In 1996 and 2011, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) supported efforts to create guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). These guidelines used different approaches to arrive at recommendations for testing and treatment. Despite differences in methodology, in both cases there was a paucity of randomized trials to inform recommendations. As data on the diagnosis and management of ITP expands, the ASH Committee on Quality is dedicated to maintaining updated guidelines representing recent evidence and guideline methodology. Here, we will review the updated ASH guidelines on ITP with a focus on recommendations with new understanding and future research to close knowledge gaps.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

### International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^116bvYQZ]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) require updating largely due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents, and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain principally dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence. This consensus document aims to report on new data and provide consensus-based recommendations relating to diagnosis and treatment of ITP in adults, in children, and during pregnancy. The inclusion of summary tables within this document, supported by information tables in the online appendices, is intended to aid in clinical decision making.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

This document aims to provide practical guidance for the assessment and management of patients with thrombocytopenia, with a particular focus on immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), during the COVID-19 pandemic. The intention is to support clinicians and, although recommendations have been provided, it is not a formal guideline. Nor is there sufficient evidence base to conclude that alternative approaches to treatment are incorrect. Instead, it is a consensus written by clinicians with an interest in ITP or coagulation disorders and reviewed by members of the UK ITP forum.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^112KEDJ3]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^113971re]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

Background

Despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there are minimal data from randomized trials to assist physicians with the management of patients.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the management of ITP.

Methods

In 2015, ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 8 adult clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel reviewed the ASH 2011 guideline recommendations and prioritized questions. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence (up to May 2017) and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non-life-threatening bleeding. Management approaches included: observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations for various management approaches. In general, strategies that avoided medication side effects were favored. A large focus was placed on shared decision-making, especially with regard to second-line therapy. Future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^114ffMQp]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is commonly encountered in clinical practice. In 1996 the American Society of Hematology published a landmark guidance paper designed to assist clinicians in the management of this disorder. Since 1996 there have been numerous advances in the management of both adult and pediatric ITP. These changes mandated an update in the guidelines. This guideline uses a rigorous, evidence-based approach to the location, interpretation, and presentation of the available evidence. We have endeavored to identify, abstract, and present all available methodologically rigorous data informing the treatment of ITP. We provide evidence-based treatment recommendations using the GRADE system in those areas in which such evidence exists. We do not provide evidence in those areas in which evidence is lacking, or is of lower quality — interested readers are referred to a number of recent, consensus-based recommendations for expert opinion in these clinical areas. Our review identified the need for additional studies in many key areas of the therapy of ITP such as comparative studies of "front-line" therapy for ITP, the management of serious bleeding in patients with ITP, and studies that will provide guidance about which therapy should be used as salvage therapy for patients after failure of a first-line intervention.

### Updated International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^115ejBWh]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, there have been numerous developments and changes in treatment practices for the management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This article is an update of the International Consensus Report published in 2010. A critical review was performed to identify all relevant articles published between 2009 and 2018. An expert panel screened, reviewed, and graded the studies and formulated the updated consensus recommendations based on the new data. The final document provides consensus recommendations on the diagnosis and management of ITP in adults, during pregnancy, and in children, as well as quality-of-life considerations.

### The management of antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome patients with thrombocytopenia: a clinical conundrum [^1122Bor8]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) consisting of aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist is a fundamental component of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management, with longstanding endorsements by both the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of both stent thrombosis and spontaneous ischaemic events, at the cost of an increased bleeding risk. The management of antiplatelet therapy in ACS patients with thrombocytopenia poses a particular challenge for physicians, as they are at higher risk of both bleeding and, paradoxically, ischaemic events. Unfortunately, there are currently no guideline recommendations or consensus reports to guide clinicians on the management of this cohort. In this setting, we examine the evidence to date and provide our opinion on future directions and management strategies for this group (Figure 1).

### Management of hemostatic complications in acute leukemia: guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^111jiqBh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute myeloid leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of thrombocytopenia, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to administer empiric platelet transfusion (one standard adult unit) for a daily platelet count < 10×10⁹/L in patients with acute leukemia without active bleeding or coagulopathy. Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.

### Practical guide to the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114WNZwX]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction to heparin associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombotic risk, and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the frequent use of heparin and the common occurrence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of HIT is a recurrent challenge in everyday inpatient care. This article presents practical guidance and tools to support the individual clinician providing evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. The optimal diagnostic evaluation requires the stepwise use of risk-stratification tools and laboratory assays. Management requires the selection and use of nonheparin anticoagulation in these complex patients with both increased thrombotic risk and possible concurrent increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. Each step in the diagnostic and management process has important nuances and complexities, many of which vary based on patient characteristics and institutional resources. Given the many challenges of HIT care, truly practical management is best achieved when tools are implemented to support the delivery of consistent, high quality, and cost-effective care across health systems.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^115cE4iR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### A review of the management of childhood immune thrombocytopenia: how can we provide an evidence-based approach? [^111fZnqi]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Most children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have transiently low platelet counts and do not suffer from bleeding. Treatments with steroids, immunosuppression or splenectomy are not thought to be curative and may create more problems than the low platelet count. Consequently, many children do not receive treatment unless there is bleeding. However, although registry data looks promising, this approach outcome is not consistent between countries, or even between centres in the same country, leading to confusion for both physicians and families. Reaching a consensus for the management of paediatric ITP is further complicated by the lack of a diagnostic test and by the heterogeneity of the disease; for example, although most children remain relatively asymptomatic and go into an early remission, some patients have significant bleeding and others do not go into spontaneous remission. This review assesses the available evidence to guide physicians and families on making management decisions, showing the wide range of treatment choices, and the different approaches between countries and considers methods by which further information could be acquired to provide a more stratified approach to management.

### Perioperative thrombocytopenia: evidence, evaluation, and emerging therapies [^115xKJwz]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^1111cZtM]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — panel, scope, and key emphases: In 2016, ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel including 9 clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives, used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach with evidence-to-decision frameworks to appraise evidence up to May 2017, and agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non–life-threatening bleeding; management approaches included observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists. The background notes minimal randomized-trial data to assist management, and the conclusions state there was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations, that strategies avoiding medication side effects were favored, that a large focus was placed on shared decision-making (especially second-line therapy), and that future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

Regarding medical management for acute myeloid leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of thrombocytopenia, ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using one of the following approaches in HLA-alloimmunized patients refractory to platelet transfusion:

- platelet cross-matching

- HLA matching

- HLA avoidance.

### How I diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia in geriatric patients [^116gaxyX]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia in older individuals is a common but diagnostically challenging condition that has variable clinical impact to those who are affected. Diagnostic approach requires evaluation of the preexisting clinical conditions, detailed review of medications, and assessment for disorders that warrant urgent treatment. In this article, we describe a systematic approach to diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and present a schematic review for management strategies. Three clinical scenarios are presented that are relevant for their prevalence and management challenges in an older adult population. The first scenario addresses primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and reviews different treatment options. The second one addresses complications of thrombocytopenia in management of the myelodysplastic syndrome. The last one reviews diagnostic challenges of drug-induced ITP.

### Current management of immune thrombocytopenia [^115pP14b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune-mediated condition that results from antibody-mediated destruction of platelets and impaired megakaryocyte platelet production. ITP patients exhibit severe thrombocytopenia and are at risk for significant hemorrhage. Few randomized trials exist to guide management of patients with ITP. Ultimately, each patient requires an individualized treatment plan that takes into consideration the platelet count, bleeding symptoms, health-related quality of life, and medication side effects. This article provides an up-to-date review of management strategies drawing on links between the expanding amounts of clinical trial data and associated biology studies to enhance understanding of the disease heterogeneity with regard to the complex pathogenesis and response to treatment.

### Pediatric ITP: is it different from adult ITP? [^11553zo4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has historically been thought to occur in 2 distinct forms: childhood ITP and adult ITP. This division is based largely on the presumption that childhood ITP is often benign and self-limited, whereas ITP in adults tends to be more chronic and difficult to treat. Although data exist to justify a different approach to the diagnosis and treatment in young children and the elderly, ITP in older children, adolescents, and younger adults is likely to share more similar pathology. This article will highlight the most recent data describing the natural history, diagnostic approach, management strategies, and disease-related outcomes in children and adults with ITP. These data reveal many unexpected similarities between the 2 groups, while confirming some of the more well-described differences. Discussion of these findings aims to highlight similarities and differences between ITP in children and adults, which will underscore important areas of future research and/or changes in management guidelines.

Conclusions

The 2019 ASH guidelines on the management of ITP continue to be relevant and important, including recommendations related to second-line therapy for adults. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to justify a revision of the entire guideline at this time. We also recognize, however, that the 2019 recommendations on second-line therapy for adults were the result of paired comparisons of splenectomy, rituximab, and the TPO-RAs, and were based on a heterogeneous patient population. This resulted in discordant recommendations. Therefore, we recommend that a focused revision on second-line therapy for adults be conducted. We appreciate that due to the absence of comparative randomized trials and the lack of reporting on prioritized patient–related outcomes, recommendations on second-line therapy will likely remain highly dependent on patient values and preferences even with additional clinical trials. Preference for agents may also change with the prioritization of different outcomes and clinical contexts, such as the desire to avoid immunosuppression in the era of COVID-19. The updated search conducted here also identified alternate methodological approaches that would allow comparisons across several treatment strategies. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach also outlines a methodology for multiple comparisons that applies the evidence to the decision framework. Use of these methods and refinement of the population of interest may clarify the existing recommendations. This would also provide the opportunity to be inclusive of avatrombopag and fostamatinib, discussed above, as well as novel agents currently in clinical trial development. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. This update will involve the selection of a guideline panel, determination of appropriate questions, conduct of relevant literature searches, application of GRADE methodology, and publication of final recommendations. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Diagnosis and classification of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia [^115DBSVH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP, has been recognized as a clinical entity for centuries, and the importance of humoral mechanisms in the pathophysiology of ITP has been recognized for decades. Despite the long history of the syndrome, progress in understanding its epidemiology and management has been hindered by inconsistencies in nomenclature and classification schema together with the inherent heterogeneity in characteristics of global populations and ITP-associated disorders. In the past decade, great strides have been made in devising a common language for caregivers and investigators alike through standardization definitions and outcome measures, while new tools have become available for management of its clinical manifestations. In 2009, an International Working Group presented proposed standards for definitions, classification criteria, and outcome measures. The American Society of Hematology adopted these standards in 2011, including them in that body's guideline for immune thrombocytopenia. Despite the progress made so far, 20th century interventions such as corticosteroids and IVIg remain the mainstay of therapy. However, advances in treatment have led to the introduction of targeted therapies for select patients with chronic disease. In this paper, we review aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of ITP and discuss the recent changes in guidelines for nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Treatment of VTE in the thrombocytopenic cancer patient [^116YRPLg]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a frequent complication in patients with cancer, mostly due to the myelosuppressive effects of antineoplastic therapies. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer is increased despite low platelet counts. The management of cancer-associated VTE in patients with thrombocytopenia is challenging, as the risk of both recurrent VTE and bleeding complications is high. Moreover, the time-dependent nature of thrombocytopenia over the course of antineoplastic therapies further complicates the management of patients in clinical practice. In the absence of evidence from high-quality studies, the management of anticoagulation therapy for VTE must be personalized, balancing the individual risk of VTE progression and recurrence against the risk of hemorrhage. In the present case-based review, we highlight the clinical challenges that arise upon managing cancer-associated VTE in the setting of present or anticipated thrombocytopenia, summarize the available evidence, and provide a comparative overview of available guidelines.

### State of the art-how I manage immune thrombocytopenia [^116pGhdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rapidly evolving. Over the last 15 years, a number of novel treatments have improved practice, with many steroid-sparing agents and a reduction in the progression to splenectomy. Although this has improved clinical care, many therapeutic challenges remain. There is no diagnostic test, no biomarkers to direct treatment and few comparative studies to help management decisions. Development of up to date guidelines is difficult with little high-grade evidence. First line treatment continues to be steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) although both are often poorly tolerated and not curative. Common second line treatments include rituximab, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag. There are no comparative studies to decide between these agents and treatment is generally individualized, depending on comorbidity. Use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients with chronic disease, although the exact position of splenectomy is subject to debate. Further understanding of the cause of disease in individual patients may help guide treatment. Randomized controlled studies of common treatments and novel treatments for refractory patients are urgently needed.

### Diagnosis and management of maternal thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^1121u5bd]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in pregnancy, occurring in approximately 7–10% of pregnancies. It may be a diagnostic and management problem, and has many causes, some of which are specific to pregnancy. Although most cases of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy are mild, and have no adverse outcome for either mother or baby, occasionally a low platelet count may be part of a more complex disorder with significant morbidity and may be life-threatening. Overall, about 75% of cases are due to gestational thrombocytopenia, 15–20% secondary to hypertensive disorders; 3–4% due to an immune process, and the remaining 1–2% made up of rare constitutional thrombocytopenias, infections and malignancies. In this review, a diagnostic approach to investigating thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is presented, together with antenatal, anaesthetic and peri-natal management issues for mother and baby, followed by a detailed discussion on the specific causes of thrombocytopenia and the management options in each case.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^116AKhV4]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy, encountered in ∼10% of pregnancies. There are many possible causes, ranging from benign conditions that do not require intervention to life-threatening disorders necessitating urgent recognition and treatment. Although thrombocytopenia may be an inherited condition or predate pregnancy, most commonly it is a new diagnosis. Identifying the responsible mechanism and predicting its course is made challenging by the tremendous overlap of clinical features and laboratory data between normal pregnancy and the many potential causes of thrombocytopenia. Multidisciplinary collaboration between hematology, obstetrics, and anesthesia and shared decision-making with the involved patient is encouraged to enhance diagnostic clarity and develop an optimized treatment regimen, with careful consideration of management of labor and delivery and the potential fetal impact of maternal thrombocytopenia and any proposed therapeutic intervention. In this review, we outline a diagnostic approach to pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia, highlighting the subtle differences in presentation, physical examination, clinical course, and laboratory abnormalities that can be applied to focus the differential. Four clinical scenarios are presented to highlight the pathophysiology and treatment of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy: gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, and immune thrombocytopenia.

Introduction

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. The guidelines addressed the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP as well as persistent and chronic ITP with regard to hospitalization, observation, and treatment selection of both first- and second-line agents. The guidelines also carried forward recommendations from the 2011 ASH guidelines for ITP related to diagnostic testing in patients with ITP, management of Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles mumps rubella vaccine–associated ITP. This review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts was requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision.

If heparin was received "in the 30 days before the current course of heparin, the ASH guideline panel suggests platelet count monitoring beginning on day 0 (the day heparin is initiated)". If no heparin was received in the prior 30 days, the panel "suggests monitoring the platelet count from day 4 until day 14 or until heparin is stopped, whichever occurs first, if practicable".

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^1172mBD5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^116reRJY]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), its secondary forms, and choice of second-line treatment options. We very briefly summarize first-line treatment and then utilize a case-based approach. We first explore persistent, chronic ITP in a younger female. We consider many possibilities beyond primary ITP e.g. hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic infection, and anemia, and how to approach their diagnosis and management. The journey continues throughout pregnancy and the post-partum period and eventually includes fourth-line treatment after a late relapse. We then consider an older male, emphasizing differences in diagnostic considerations and management. The focus is on initiation and continuation of second-line treatment, the pros and cons of each option, and briefly the impact of treatment choices related to the endemic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. During the review of potential second-line treatment options, we also briefly touch upon novel treatments. Finally, there is a short section on refractory disease drawn from our previous extensive review published in February 2020. 1 The clinical nature of the discussions, replete with figures and tables and with the interspersion of pearls regarding efficacy and toxicity at different ages and genders, will serve the reader in the management of "typical" adult patients who develop persistent and chronic ITP.

### Insights on treatment of adult ITP: algorithm for management and role of multimodal therapy [^114dntzB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is continuously evolving with the development and introduction of newer therapies and a better understanding of the disease. Corticosteroids still represent the cornerstone of first-line treatment. Patients who fail to achieve remission with a short course of corticosteroids require subsequent therapy. Most guidelines recommend starting with either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), rituximab, or fostamatinib since these agents have been investigated in randomized trials and have well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles. Patients' involvement to reach a shared decision regarding choice of therapy is essential as these treatments have different modes of administration and mechanisms of action. Less than 10% will fail to respond to and/or be intolerant of multiple second-line therapeutic options and thus be considered to have refractory ITP and require a third-line therapeutic option. Such patients may require drugs with different targets or a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Combining a TPO-RA and an immunomodulatory agent may be an appropriate approach at this stage. Many studies have been conducted during the last 2 decades investigating the efficacy and safety of combinations strategies for first and later lines of therapies. Yet none of these are recommended by current guidelines or have gained wide acceptance and consensus.

### Management of thrombocytopenia in cancer [^113tvaDK]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in cancer patients and can have different and/or multifactorial pathogenesis. While in solid tumors it occurs often as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment, it is frequently observed at diagnosis in patients with hematological malignancies being aggravated to a potentially life-threatening level during chemotherapy. Other associated conditions (infections, drugs, consumption coagulopathy etc.) can add to influence the degree of thrombocytopenia and the inherent risk of bleeding and they should be recognized and corrected to improve platelet count. Platelet transfusion remains the cornerstone of treatment, but its use should always be weighted taking into consideration the actual risk of bleeding to avoid inappropriate use and wasting of resources. While in hematological malignancies a threshold level of 10,000 platelets/μL is widely accepted as the minimal level prompting prophylactic platelet transfusion, this limit is less frequently observed in patients with solid tumors and platelet transfusions are usually administered for a few days, possibly at a higher platelet level. Alternative treatments for the latter patients including thrombopoietin-mimetic agents are increasingly used and found to be promising.

### Traditional and new approaches to the management of immune thrombocytopenia: issues of when and who to treat [^111cexsD]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and management of chronic ITP requires experience and the appropriate use of the laboratory despite the absence of a diagnostic test for ITP. Consideration of secondary ITP is important because identification of immunodeficiency infections or of lymphoproliferative disorders would change the management approach to a given patient. The development of newer therapies such as rituximab and the thrombopoietic agents has had a major impact on the management of ITP. In the future, combinations of agents may be a critical approach although the schedule and dosing remains difficult to establish. Finally, current studies to augment therapy in newly diagnosed ITP patients to prevent chronic disease may lessen the number of patients in chronic disease category.

The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### How to manage ITP with life-threatening bleeding [^116qorcN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

While immune thrombocytopenia often presents with mild bleeding manifestations or surprising findings of thrombocytopenia on routine complete blood counts in patients without symptoms, some patients can present with new thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding. Emergent assessment and treatment are needed to prevent substantial morbidity and even mortality. These patients present to the emergency room with bleeding, and hematologists are subsequently consulted. Understanding the approach to making the diagnosis and excluding other life-threatening illnesses is essential, as is rapid initiation of treatment in the bleeding patient even when the diagnosis of immune- mediated thrombocytopenia is tentative. Using a case-based format, we review how to approach and treat patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

### Assessing thrombocytopenia in the intensive care unit: the past, present, and future [^1151n1u4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is common among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute, including thrombin-mediated platelet activation, dilution, hemophagocytosis, extracellular histones, ADAMTS13 deficiency, and complement activation. From the clinical perspective, the development of thrombocytopenia in the ICU usually indicates serious organ system derangement and physiologic decompensation rather than a primary hematologic disorder. Thrombocytopenia is associated with bleeding, transfusion, and adverse clinical outcomes including death, though few deaths are directly attributable to bleeding. The assessment of thrombocytopenia begins by looking back to the patient's medical history and presenting illness. This past information, combined with careful observation of the platelet trajectory in the context of the patient's clinical course, offers clues to the diagnosis and prognosis. Management is primarily directed at the underlying disorder and transfusion of platelets to prevent or treat clinical bleeding. Optimal platelet transfusion strategies are not defined, and a conservative approach is recommended.

Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For conditional recommendations, for patients "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not", for clinicians "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients; the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", and for policy makers "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders".

### Management of bleeding and of invasive procedures in patients with platelet disorders and / or thrombocytopenia: guidelines of the Italian Society for Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET) [^115xBXaC]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

The optimal management of bleeding or its prophylaxis in patients with disorders of platelet count or function is controversial. The bleeding diathesis of these patients is usually mild to moderate: therefore, transfusion of platelet concentrates may be inappropriate, as potential adverse effects might outweigh its benefit. The availability of several anti-hemorrhagic drugs further compounds this problem, mainly because the efficacy/suitability of the various treatment options in different clinical manifestations is not well defined. In these guidelines, promoted by the Italian Society for Studies on Haemostasis and Thrombosis (Società Italiana per lo Studio dell'Emostasi e della Trombosi [SISET]), we aim at offering the best available evidence to help the physicians involved in the management of patients with disorders of platelet count or function. Literature review and appraisal of available evidence are discussed for different clinical settings and for different available treatments, including platelet concentrates (PC), recombinant activated factor VII, desmopressin, antifibrinolytics, aprotinin and local hemostatic agents.

For clinicians, strong recommendations state "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional recommendations advise "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy-makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations; adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders; performance measures should assess whether decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and conditional recommendations state "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research; an evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than the strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps".

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018? [^113Y9q7r]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed, (2) current test methods need to be improved, or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.

### ITP in the 21st century [^115ANVXe]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2006). Low credibility.

Immune (or idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is commonly encountered by the practicing hematologist. Clinical management decisions have traditionally been guided by individual training and past experience. Input from the literature has been more from observational reports of case series than from scientific results of hypothesis-driven research. Practice guidelines and several surveys of clinical hematology practice have highlighted important questions in the field, and in the past 5 to 10 years both clinical and laboratory investigations have produced valuable new information. Thrombopoietin levels are normal or only slightly increased in ITP, and stimulation of thrombopoiesis appears to be a promising new therapeutic approach in clinical trials. Chronic, refractory ITP in children or adults remains a challenge for the hematologist. It is this group that has the greatest risk of serious bleeding, particularly among the elderly. The anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody, anti-CD20, has shown benefit in phase I/II clinical trials in patients who had failed a number of previous therapeutic modalities. The standard for clinical research into therapy for ITP has become evidence-based medicine, and more prospective, randomized clinical trials are being completed by multi-institutional study groups.

### Impact of baseline thrombocytopenia on early outcomes in patients with acute venous thromboembolism [^114ZTb28]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The occurrence of a venous thromboembolism (VTE) event among patients with thrombocytopenia is not uncommon, particularly in the setting of cancer. While for the general population VTE management in clinical practice is well‐established, with clear guidelines guiding treatment decisions, however, a substantial gap exists when it comes to addressing VTE in patients with thrombocytopenia. Actually, these patients are frequently excluded from randomized clinical trials, which constitute the gold standard for establishing treatment guidelines. This exclusion, justified by prioritizing patient safety, leaves clinicians with a significant dilemma when facing VTE patients presenting with thrombocytopenia. As a result, the optimal approach to managing VTE in this vulnerable population remains an uncharted territory within the realm of evidence‐based medicine.

This study used routine practice data from the RIETE (Registro Informatizado Enfermedad TromboEmbólica) registry, the world's largest registry of VTE patients, to explore how thrombocytopenia impacts the early incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism (PE), VTE recurrences, and major bleeding events depending on the initial presentation, either as isolated lower‐limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or as PE. Our findings aim to enhance the decision‐making process for clinicians treating VTE in patients with thrombocytopenia.

Consider using a higher transfusion threshold (such as ≥ 20×10⁹/L) in patients with active bleeding, as determined by clinical factors, including the degree of hemorrhage, site of hemorrhage, and responsiveness to platelet transfusion.

Including the excluded

The reported prevalence and incidence of thrombocytopenia among patients with ACS has varied depending on the definition and the nature of the study. Observational evidence suggests that baseline thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count of < 150 × 10⁹/L, is present in approximately 5% of ACS patients, whereas incident thrombocytopenia can be expected in 13% of patients. Incident thrombocytopenia can be seen more frequently in patients who are older or have diabetes, renal insufficiency, heart failure, or prior cardiovascular disease.

Despite making up a substantial proportion of ACS patients in clinical practice, these patients have been excluded or under-represented in important clinical trials evaluating antiplatelet therapies in ACS patients. Patients with thrombocytopenia were excluded from the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON–TIMI) 38, the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, the Cangrelor versus standard therapy to acHieve optimal Management of Platelet InhibitiON (CHAMPION) PHOENIX trial, and represented only 0.8% of the participants in the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial.

### Drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^114smUyv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia was first described in the 19th century, yet our understanding of its pathogenesis continues to evolve. The list of drugs implicated in drug-induced thrombocytopenia is extensive and growing. Many, if not most, of these medications induce thrombocytopenia by immune mechanisms. Because the degree of thrombocytopenia can put patients at risk for serious bleeding, a prompt diagnosis is key to clinical management. The laboratory approach to diagnosing drug-induced thrombocytopenia is 2-pronged. First, nondrug causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out. Second, testing for drug-dependent platelet antibodies, available at specialized reference laboratories, often can identify the offending medication, although usually not in time for initial clinical management. Once a medication is suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, it must be discontinued promptly, and the patient should be monitored closely. Thrombocytopenia generally resolves quickly after offending medication withdrawal, and the prognosis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia is then excellent.

NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes — management of thrombocytopenia notes that severe thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk for bleeding events and is currently managed with platelet transfusions. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia in patients with MDS may be attributed to decreased platelet production related to endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO) pathways and increased destruction of bone marrow megakaryocytes or circulating platelets. Compared with healthy individuals, patients with MDS have increased endogenous TPO levels and decreased TPO receptor sites per platelet. High endogenous TPO levels correlated with decreased platelet counts in patients with RA, but not in patients with MDS-EB or MDS-EB-T.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in the critical care setting: diagnosis and management [^115xkS1C]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia is a common occurrence in critical illness, reported in up to 41% of patients. Systematic evaluation of thrombocytopenia in critical care is essential to accurate identification and management of the cause. Although sepsis and hemodilution are more common etiologies of thrombocytopenia in critical illness, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is one potential etiology that warrants consideration.

Objective

This review will summarize the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of HIT, describe the diagnostic process, and review currently available treatment options.

Data Source

MEDLINE/PubMed search of all relevant primary and review articles.

Data Synthesis and Conclusions

HIT is a clinicopathologic syndrome characterized by thrombocytopenia (≥ 50% from baseline) that typically occurs between days 5 and 14 after initiation of heparin. This temporal profile suggests a possible diagnosis of HIT, which can be supported (or refuted) with a strong positive (or negative) laboratory test for HIT antibodies. When considering the diagnosis of HIT, critical care professionals should monitor platelet counts in patients who are at risk for HIT and carefully evaluate for, a) temporal features of the thrombocytopenia in relation to heparin exposure; b) severity of thrombocytopenia; c) clinical evidence for thrombosis; and d) alternative etiologies of thrombocytopenia. Due to its prothrombotic nature, early recognition of HIT and prompt substitution of heparin with a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., argatroban or lepirudin) or the heparinoid danaparoid (where available) reduces the risk of thromboembolic events, some of which may be life-threatening.

In those with a platelet count of ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L who have no or mild bleeding, the panel also suggests against admission and in favor of outpatient management (conditional recommendation). A remark states that for patients with uncertainty about the diagnosis, those with social concerns, those who live far from the hospital, or those for whom follow-up cannot be guaranteed, admission to the hospital may be preferable.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^111fXyuU]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

A mild thrombocytopenia is relatively frequent during pregnancy and has generally no consequences for either the mother or the fetus. Although representing no threat in the majority of patients, thrombocytopenia may result from a range of pathologic conditions requiring closer monitoring and possible therapy. Two clinical scenarios are particularly relevant for their prevalence and the issues relating to their management. The first is the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia and the differential diagnosis between primary immune thrombocytopenia and gestational thrombocytopenia. The second is thrombocytopenia associated with preeclampsia and its look-alikes and their distinction from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. In this review, we describe a systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of these disease entities using a case presentation format. Our discussion includes the antenatal and perinatal management of both the mother and fetus.

### Platelet transfusion for patients with cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^111xTyNy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide evidence-based guidance on the use of platelet transfusion in people with cancer. This guideline updates and replaces the previous ASCO platelet transfusion guideline published initially in 2001. Methods ASCO convened an Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of the medical literature published from September 1, 2014, through October 26, 2016. This review builds on two 2015 systematic reviews that were conducted by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines. For clinical questions that were not addressed by the AABB and the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines (the use of leukoreduction and platelet transfusion in solid tumors or chronic, stable severe thrombocytopenia) or that were addressed partially (invasive procedures), the ASCO search extended back to January 2000. Results The updated ASCO review included 24 more recent publications: three clinical practice guidelines, eight systematic reviews, and 13 observational studies. Recommendations The most substantial change to a previous recommendation involved platelet transfusion in the setting of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Based on data from randomized controlled trials, adult patients who undergo autologous stem-cell transplantation at experienced centers may receive a platelet transfusion at the first sign of bleeding, rather than prophylactically. Prophylactic platelet transfusion at defined platelet count thresholds is still recommended for pediatric patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation and for adult and pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Other recommendations address platelet transfusion in patients with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors or in those who undergo invasive procedures. Guidance is also provided regarding the production of platelet products, prevention of Rh alloimmunization, and management of refractoriness to platelet transfusion (www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki).

### Contemporary management of primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults [^113mhdD2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a syndrome of diverse disorders that have in common immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but that differ with respect to pathogenesis, natural history and response to therapy. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or as a sequela of a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP). Primary ITP remains a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from non-autoimmune etiologies of thrombocytopenia and secondary causes of ITP. The traditional objective of management is to provide a hemostatic platelet count (> 20–30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ in most cases) while minimizing treatment-related toxicity, although treatment goals should be tailored to the individual patient and clinical setting. Corticosteroids, supplemented with either intravenous immune globulin G or anti-Rh(D) as needed, are used as upfront therapy to stop bleeding and raise the platelet count acutely in patients with newly diagnosed or newly relapsed disease. Although most adults with primary ITP respond to first-line therapy, the majority relapse after treatment is tapered and require a second-line approach to maintain a hemostatic platelet count. Standard second-line options include splenectomy, rituximab and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, romiplostim and eltrombopag. Studies that directly compare the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of these approaches are lacking. In the absence of such data, we do not favor a single second-line approach for all patients. Rather, we consider the pros and cons of each option with our patients and engage them in the decision-making process.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^112HUWgt]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia develops in 5% to 10% of women during pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period. A low platelet count is often an incidental feature, but it might also provide a biomarker of a coexisting systemic or gestational disorder and a potential reason for a maternal intervention or treatment that might pose harm to the fetus. This chapter reflects our approach to these issues with an emphasis on advances made over the past 5 to 10 years in understanding and managing the more common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Recent trends in the management of immune thrombocytopenia translate into more women contemplating pregnancy while on treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists, rituximab, or mycophenylate, which pose known or unknown risks to the fetus. New criteria to diagnose preeclampsia, judicious reliance on measurement of ADAMTS13 to make management decisions in suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, new evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of anticomplement therapy for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome during pregnancy, and implications of thrombotic microangiopathies for subsequent pregnancies are evolving rapidly. The goals of the chapter are to help the hematology consultant work through the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy based on trimester of presentation, severity of thrombocytopenia, and coincident clinical and laboratory manifestations, and to provide guidance for dealing with some of the more common and difficult diagnostic and management decisions.
