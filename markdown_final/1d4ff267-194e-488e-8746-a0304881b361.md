## Question

In a patient with a reported amoxicillin allergy with an unknown reaction, what is the next best step?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next best step for managing a patient with a reported amoxicillin allergy when the reaction is unknown. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "unknown reaction" typically means and how to risk stratify such histories. Then, I should verify whether contemporary guidelines endorse direct oral challenge versus skin testing for low-risk or unknown histories. Next, I will evaluate the strength of trial and meta-analytic evidence supporting direct amoxicillin challenge in low-risk patients. Finally, I should outline the practical challenge procedure, consider exceptions for higher-risk histories, and think about follow-up, resensitization, and documentation to support delabeling and antimicrobial stewardship.

> Let me first clarify what "unknown reaction" implies. Many patients cannot recall details of a "penicillin" or "amoxicillin" allergy; such vague or non-specific histories are common and often low predictive value for true IgE-mediated allergy, especially when remote in time, but I should confirm timing and any severe features rather than assume low risk by default [^113D4Zbx] [^115Y2pUS]. Wait, I initially thought "because we have no severity or timing, the safest interpretation is low risk", but hold on, that is backwards; I need to check for red flags such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, respiratory compromise, hypotension, or severe cutaneous adverse reactions before assigning low risk, and only if these are absent and the event is remote would a low-risk classification be appropriate [^114t3m1G].

> Next, I should review how to risk stratify an "unknown" amoxicillin allergy. Let me think about the core elements: time since reaction, symptom phenotype, need for emergency care, and comorbid atopy or multiple drug allergies. Low-risk typically includes remote benign cutaneous eruptions or unknown reactions without systemic features, whereas high-risk includes immediate systemic symptoms, anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, or severe delayed reactions such as SJS/TEN or DRESS; the likelihood of true allergy increases with convincing high-risk features, and it declines as histories become vague and remote, especially in children and over time due to loss of sensitization [^113D4Zbx] [^115Y2pUS]. I should double-check that these frameworks align with trial inclusion criteria before moving to a direct challenge recommendation.

> I will now examine whether guidelines endorse a direct oral amoxicillin challenge for low-risk or unknown histories. The 2022 AAAAI practice parameter specifically allows a direct amoxicillin challenge for adults with distant benign cutaneous reactions and supports direct challenges in low-risk penicillin allergy evaluations, while reserving skin testing for anaphylaxis or recent likely IgE-mediated reactions; this aligns with historical BSACI guidance that skin testing is most useful when the history suggests IgE-mediation and that a negative skin test should be followed by challenge to confirm tolerance [^115HSywW] [^1135ZxjZ] [^114t3m1G] [^116JM5WG]. I should confirm these match the patient's risk tier once the key elements of the history are verified [^1135ZxjZ].

> But wait, what does the experimental evidence say about skipping skin testing in low-risk patients. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a two-step direct challenge to amoxicillin was non-inferior in safety and efficiency compared with penicillin skin testing followed by challenge in predefined low-risk patients with cutaneous-only or unknown remote reactions; positive challenge reactions were minor and observation times were shorter with direct challenge by several minutes on average [^111CydWg]. A meta-analysis of 23 studies found that approximately 94% of patients with a reported penicillin allergy tolerated a direct dose challenge, with the remainder having mostly mild, non-anaphylactic reactions, which supports the safety of direct challenge in appropriately selected low-risk cohorts [^1162mEkJ]. Let me also note a prospective trial showing very low rates of mild reactions with graded amoxicillin challenge without prior skin testing, further reinforcing safety in non–life-threatening historical reactions [^111R8efY].

> Given this, I should confirm the recommended next step for a truly low-risk unknown history. If the history confirms no prior anaphylaxis, no severe cutaneous adverse reaction, and the event was remote, the best next step is a supervised direct oral amoxicillin challenge, either single-step or two-step, performed in an outpatient setting with appropriate monitoring and rescue medications available, which is consistent with AAAAI 2022 recommendations and RCT protocols [^115HSywW] [^1135ZxjZ] [^111CydWg]. If the history reveals high-risk features or a recent likely IgE reaction, I should pivot to penicillin skin testing with major and minor determinants followed by a graded challenge if negative, rather than proceeding directly to oral challenge, to reduce risk and to maintain diagnostic accuracy [^114t3m1G] [^116JM5WG] [^1135ZxjZ].

> Now, I need to outline the practical procedure for a direct oral challenge. Let me verify the typical approach: for a two-step challenge, give roughly 1/10 of the target amoxicillin dose, observe 30 minutes, then the full dose with an additional 30–60 minutes of observation; for a single-step challenge, give the full weight-appropriate dose with 60 minutes of observation, ensuring epinephrine, antihistamines, and resuscitation capacity are on hand; provide instructions for recognizing and reporting delayed rashes over 24–72 hours after discharge, since benign delayed maculopapular exanthems can occur [^111CydWg] [^115HSywW] [^1135ZxjZ]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric feasibility and safety; prospective pediatric data using drug provocation testing confirm low reaction rates with standardized protocols when severe index reactions are excluded, supporting use in children with low-risk or unknown remote reactions under supervision [^113AFvLR].

> Let me consider the pathway if the patient is not clearly low risk. I should confirm that penicillin skin testing with both the major determinant and minor determinant mixture, plus amoxicillin where available, improves sensitivity; if skin testing is negative, an observed oral amoxicillin challenge remains necessary because the challenge is the reference standard to confirm tolerance, whereas positive skin tests should prompt avoidance or desensitization if a β-lactam is absolutely required [^111WoAJA] [^116JM5WG] [^114t3m1G]. I need to ensure that recent or severe immediate reactions are directed to skin testing first per AAAAI 2022, reserving direct challenges for low-risk histories only, to minimize the risk of serious reactions during evaluation [^1135ZxjZ].

> But what if therapy cannot wait or an alternative β-lactam is needed while evaluation proceeds. Let me reconsider cross-reactivity guidance: later-generation cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains can often be given, and carbapenems appear safe even in patients with IgE penicillin histories, often without testing or additional precautions; some centers use test-dose strategies for added caution, but guideline updates increasingly allow direct administration in many scenarios, which can be helpful when urgent coverage is needed and amoxicillin evaluation is pending [^116QU3xv] [^113xhrcn] [^117U3K23] [^115KCBCH]. I should double-check that the selected cephalosporin has a non–cross-reactive side chain to amoxicillin to reduce risk further, consistent with modern structure-based cross-reactivity principles [^116QU3xv].

> I should also review resensitization and follow-up. Although loss of sensitization over time is common, resensitization after initial negative testing can rarely occur, especially after severe immediate reactions; international consensus suggests considering retesting 2–4 weeks after the initial evaluation for patients with severe immediate histories who had negative results including drug challenge, and educating all patients about delayed rashes and when to seek care after challenge is prudent [^1116Wzeq] [^112CRMFf]. Wait, let me verify that routine retesting is not required for low-risk patients with negative challenges; data suggest resensitization is uncommon, so routine retesting is not typically necessary outside higher-risk phenotypes or special circumstances, but clinical vigilance remains appropriate [^112CRMFf].

> Finally, I need to ensure thorough documentation and delabeling. After a tolerated challenge, the penicillin or amoxicillin allergy label should be removed in the medical record, with clear notes on the challenge protocol and outcome, because persistent inaccurate labels drive broader-spectrum prescribing, increased costs, antimicrobial resistance, and worse outcomes; delabeling programs and provider education improve stewardship and patient care across outpatient, inpatient, surgical, and obstetric contexts [^1147NCUb] [^115uPo2Y] [^112MusQz]. Let me double-check that counseling includes future β-lactam use guidance, reinforcement that immediate reactions are unlikely after a negative supervised challenge, and instructions to return if any new reaction occurs so the record stays accurate and up to date [^1147NCUb].

For a patient with a reported amoxicillin allergy with an unknown reaction, the next best step is to **obtain a detailed allergy history** [^1135ZxjZ] to characterize the reaction and guide risk stratification [^113D4Zbx] [^115Y2pUS]. If the history suggests a low-risk reaction (e.g. benign rash, remote reaction) [^111CydWg], proceed with a **direct oral amoxicillin challenge** [^111R8efY] [^115HSywW] in a monitored setting. If it suggests a high-risk reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous reaction) [^1135ZxjZ], perform penicillin skin testing with major and minor determinants [^112VGsGT], followed by a graded challenge if negative [^1122ipg2]. Avoid amoxicillin and use alternative antibiotics only if the allergy is confirmed or testing is unavailable [^113xhrcn] [^114cHE93].

---

## Step 1: obtain a detailed allergy history

The first and most critical step is to **obtain a detailed allergy history** [^113PW5yR] to characterize the reported reaction. Key elements to document include:

- **Type of reaction**: Immediate (within 1 hour) [^112CRMFf], delayed (after 1 hour), or unknown timing.

- **Clinical features**: Rash, urticaria, angioedema, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, anaphylaxis, or other systemic symptoms [^116d4RpN].

- **Severity**: Mild (benign rash), moderate (urticaria, angioedema), severe (anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) [^1135ZxjZ].

- **Timing**: Time elapsed since the reaction occurred [^114m2cfN].

- **Previous tolerance**: Any subsequent exposures to amoxicillin or other beta-lactams [^1172WSHK] without reaction.

A structured allergy history [^1135ZxjZ] allows for **risk stratification** [^113D4Zbx] and guides subsequent management steps [^115Y2pUS].

---

## Step 2: risk stratification

Based on the detailed allergy history, patients can be stratified into **low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk categories**:

| **Risk category** | **Clinical features** | **Recommended next step** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk | - Benign rash <br/> - Remote reaction (> 10 years ago) <br/> - Unknown reaction without severe features | Direct oral amoxicillin [^111R8efY] challenge [^111CydWg] [^115HSywW] |
| Moderate-risk | - Urticaria <br/> - Angioedema <br/> - Non-anaphylactic reactions | Penicillin skin testing [^1135ZxjZ] followed by graded challenge if negative [^112VGsGT] [^111WoAJA] |
| High-risk | - Anaphylaxis <br/> - Severe cutaneous reactions (SJS, TEN) <br/> - Organ involvement | - Avoid amoxicillin [^1135ZxjZ] <br/> - Consider alternative antibiotics [^113xhrcn] or desensitization if necessary [^1143HUu8] [^112VGsGT] |

## Step 3: diagnostic testing

### Penicillin skin testing

Penicillin skin testing is the **gold standard** for evaluating suspected IgE-mediated penicillin allergies. It involves testing with major and minor determinants (penicilloyl-polylysine and minor determinant mixture) and amoxicillin [^115qWBSe] [^112VGsGT]. A negative skin test has a high negative predictive value (97–99%) for immediate hypersensitivity reactions [^111WoAJA].

---

### Direct oral amoxicillin challenge

For patients with low-risk histories, a **direct oral amoxicillin challenge** without prior skin testing is safe and effective [^111CydWg]. It consists of administering a graded dose of amoxicillin [^111R8efY] under medical supervision [^1148HMe1] with observation for reactions.

---

## Step 4: management based on test results

Based on test results, a **negative skin test or oral challenge** indicates amoxicillin can be safely administered [^1135ZxjZ], whereas a **positive skin test or oral challenge** confirms allergy; avoid amoxicillin and consider alternative antibiotics (e.g. cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains [^1172WSHK], carbapenems [^113xhrcn], aztreonam) [^114cHE93].

---

## Step 5: documentation and patient education

Regardless of the outcome, it is essential to **document the results** [^1147NCUb] of the allergy evaluation clearly in the patient's medical record. Provide the patient with written information about the results and implications for future antibiotic use [^112MusQz].

---

## Summary of recommended approach

1. **Obtain a detailed allergy history** to characterize the reaction [^113PW5yR].

2. **Risk stratify** the patient based on clinical features and timing [^113D4Zbx].

3. **Perform penicillin skin testing** for moderate-risk or high-risk patients [^1122ipg2].

4. **Conduct a direct oral amoxicillin challenge** for low-risk patients [^115HSywW].

5. **Document results clearly** and educate the patient [^1147NCUb].

---

The next best step for a patient with a reported amoxicillin allergy with an unknown reaction is to **obtain a detailed allergy history**, **risk-stratify** [^115Y2pUS], and perform appropriate diagnostic testing (skin testing or direct oral challenge) to confirm or exclude true allergy [^116d4RpN].

### Relationship of reaction history to positive penicillin skin tests [^113D4Zbx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Previous data suggest that up to one-third of patients classified as allergic based on positive penicillin skin tests have a vague reaction history. Direct oral challenge (DOC) has been recommended for patients with a low-risk reaction history. A variety of published models stratify reaction risk to guide the use of DOC.

- **Objective**: To reassess the proportion of penicillin skin test-positive patients with vague or low-risk reaction histories and evaluate the relationship between the reaction risk history and the likelihood of positive skin test results.

- **Methods**: We identified patients who underwent penicillin allergy evaluation over a 5-year period. We recorded drug reaction history, demographic variables, skin testing, and challenge results. Matched controls whose skin tests were negative were identified for skin test-positive patients. Drug reaction histories were assigned a risk category based on two previously published risk stratification models. We used logistic regression to investigate whether reaction history risk was associated with positive skin test results.

- **Results**: Penicillin skin testing was performed in 3382 patients; 207 (6.1%) were positive. Positive skin tests were more frequent in outpatients (P < .001), younger patients (P < .001), and female patients (P < .001). Percentages of each risk category in each model were similar in cases versus matched controls. The likelihood for positive skin tests increased with a high-risk reaction history in one stratification model.

- **Conclusion**: Our data confirm that a substantial proportion of patients who undergo evaluation have a positive penicillin skin test result, linked with specific demographic factors and risk histories.

### Safety and outcomes of oral graded challenges to amoxicillin without prior skin testing [^111R8efY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Unconfirmed penicillin allergy poses substantial public health consequences. The most widely accepted protocol to evaluate penicillin allergy is skin testing followed by an amoxicillin challenge.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety of direct oral graded challenges to amoxicillin.

- **Methods**: A prospective single-blind clinical trial with historical controls of patients aged 7 years and older with historical non-life-threatening reactions to penicillin was conducted. Patients received a placebo followed by a 2-step graded challenge to amoxicillin. The allergic reaction rate was compared with the rate observed in our previous study that included skin testing and with the currently reported penicillin allergy prevalence in the US population.

- **Results**: Of the 155 participants who completed an amoxicillin challenge, 120 patients (77.4%) experienced no reaction, whereas 31 patients (20%) experienced nonallergic reactions to either placebo (n = 16) or amoxicillin (n = 15). Four patients (2.6%) developed mild allergic reactions. Significantly (P = 0.03) fewer patients (4 of 155, 2.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0%, 6.5%) were determined to be allergic compared with 14 of 170 subjects (8.2%, 95% CI: 5.0%, 13.4%) in our previous study where patients were determined to be allergic based on either positive skin tests (n = 11) or allergic challenge reactions after negative skin tests (n = 3). This 2.6% reaction rate was also significantly less than the 10% reported US prevalence of penicillin allergy (P = 0.003).

Placebo-controlled oral graded challenges to amoxicillin with safety and efficacy considerations provide an alternative approach, enhancing the understanding of penicillin allergy prevalence.

### Comparing direct challenge to penicillin skin testing for the outpatient evaluation of penicillin allergy: A randomized controlled trial [^111CydWg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). High credibility.

Direct challenge (DC) may be a safe and effective alternative to penicillin skin testing (PST) in low-risk patients.

- **Objective**: To complete a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing PST followed by a challenge to amoxicillin versus a 2-step DC to amoxicillin without preceding skin testing in a predefined low-risk patient population.

- **Methods**: Penicillin allergy histories were reviewed in patients presenting to an outpatient allergy/immunology practice from April 2018 to August 2018. Patients 5 years or older with a cutaneous-only or unknown reaction (> 1 year ago for those aged 5–17 years, > 10 years ago for those 18 years or older) were randomized 1:1 to PST or 2-step DC. All children younger than 5 years underwent DC, and patients with extracutaneous reaction histories underwent PST. All groups were monitored 30 minutes after administration of amoxicillin.

- **Results**: Penicillin allergy was reported in 363 of 2465 (14.7%) patients, of which 185 consented to further evaluation. Thirteen patients younger than 5 years underwent DC; all were negative. Thirteen patients with angioedema and/or extracutaneous symptoms underwent PST; 2 of 13 patients had a positive PST result. A total of 159 patients were randomized to DC (49.7%) or PST (50.3%). PST result was negative in 70 of 80 (87.5%) patients; all 70 patients had a negative amoxicillin challenge. DC was negative in 76 of 79 (96.2%) patients; positive DC reactions were minor. Average time for patients undergoing PST was 72.7 ± 5.3 minutes and for patients undergoing DC was 66.7 ± 4.8 minutes.

### Penicillin allergy evaluation: A prospective, multicenter, open-label evaluation of a comprehensive penicillin skin test kit [^112VGsGT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Ten percent of the population claims an allergy to penicillin, but 90% of these individuals are not allergic. Patients labeled as penicillin-allergic have higher medical costs, longer hospital stays, and are more likely to be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and develop drug-resistant bacterial infections. Most penicillin skin test reagents are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or readily available to evaluate patients labeled penicillin-allergic.

- **Objective**: To determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of the Penicillin Skin Test Kit containing the major allergenic determinant (penicilloyl polylysine), a minor determinant mixture (penicillin G, penicilloate, penilloate), and amoxicillin, produced according to Food and Drug Administration standards.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label investigation of penicillin skin testing using the Penicillin Skin Test Kit. Skin test-negative subjects were challenged with 250 mg amoxicillin, whereas skin test-positive patients were not challenged. The primary end point was NPV of the Penicillin Skin Test Kit, defined as the percentage of subjects with negative skin test results who did not experience an IgE-dependent reaction within 72 hours of amoxicillin challenge.

- **Results**: In total, 455 patients with a history of penicillin allergy underwent skin testing, and 63 (13.8%) had one or more positive test results; 65% of the positive test results were to the minor determinant mixture and/or amoxicillin alone. In the per protocol group of 373 skin test-negative subjects, 8 developed pote

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^1135ZxjZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in evaluating penicillin allergy, AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering penicillin skin testing in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent reaction suspected to be IgE-mediated.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^114m2cfN]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of allergic reactions to penicillins (AR-PEN) is very complex, as there is a loss of sensitization over time, which leads to negative skin tests (STs) and specific IgE in serum, and even to tolerance to the drug involved. However, STs may become positive after subsequent exposure to the culprit drug (resensitization), with the risk of inducing potentially severe reactions. The exact rate of resensitization to penicillins is unknown, ranging from 0% to 27.9% in published studies.

- **Objectives**: To analyze the rate of resensitization in patients with suggestive AR-PEN by repeating STs (retest) after an initial evaluation (IE).

- **Material and methods**: Patients with suspected AR-PEN were prospectively evaluated between 2017 and 2020. They underwent STs, and a randomized group also underwent a drug provocation test (DPT) with the culprit. Only patients with negative STs and/or DPT were included. All included cases were retested by STs at 2–8 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 545 patients were included: 296 reporting immediate reactions (IRs) and 249 non-immediate reactions (NIRs). Eighty (14.7%) cases had positive results in retest (RT+): 63 (21.3%) IRs and 17 (6.8%) NIRs (p < 0.0001). The rate of RT+ was higher in anaphylaxis compared with all other reactions (45.8% vs 9.1%, p < 0.0001). The risk of RT+ was higher from the fifth week after IE (OR: 4.64, CI: 2.1–11.6; p < 0.001) and increased with the patient's age (OR: 1.02; CI: 1.01–1.04; p = 0.009).

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^114t3m1G]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing with penicillins. If the skin testing is negative, challenge testing should be conducted to exclude allergy to penicillin if a patient with a clinical history of cephalosporin allergy requires penicillin.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^1141u2Qz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for drug allergy, particularly concerning the choice of an alternative agent, the 2022 guidelines from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) recommend considering the administration of penicillins without testing or additional precautions in patients with a history of an unverified non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy.

### Is a reported penicillin allergy sufficient grounds to forgo the multidimensional antimicrobial benefits of β-lactam antibiotics [^116nTYfo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with a reported penicillin allergy are not allergic when tested or challenged. Penicillin allergy testing has been shown to significantly reduce annual healthcare expenditures. Data have emerged showing β-lactams have multidimensional antibacterial effects in vivo, far beyond what is appreciated in standard bacteriological susceptibility testing media. These include enhancing bacterial killing by the innate immune system. Supporting the clinical relevance of these secondary underappreciated effects are recent clinical and pharmacoeconomic analyses that show worse outcomes in patients with reported penicillin allergies who receive non-β-lactam antibiotics compared to their non-penicillin-allergic counterparts. This is particularly relevant in the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This article reviews the tremendous advantages offered by β-lactam therapy and makes a strong case that the debunking of false penicillin allergies through a detailed allergy history and penicillin allergy testing should be a vital component of antimicrobial stewardship practices.

### Low frequency of allergy referral for penicillin allergy evaluation in an urban Boston primary care setting [^1147NCUb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health crisis, further perpetuating racial and ethnic health disparities. People reporting penicillin allergy are at increased risk of antibiotic-resistant infections, mortality, and increased health care costs. Once a patient is labeled in the electronic medical record (EMR) as having a penicillin allergy, many clinicians avoid prescribing β-lactam antibiotics due to concerns regarding cross-reactivity, even though this concern is largely unwarranted. Removing an inaccurate penicillin allergy label from a patient's EMR can improve clinical outcomes. Although 10% of people report having a penicillin allergy, up to 95% of those who report a penicillin allergy do not have a true IgE-mediated reaction and are able to tolerate penicillin. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, and international allergy organizations recommend penicillin allergy delabeling (removal of inaccurate penicillin allergy labels).

### Antibiotic choice for group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin, unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis.

Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines. There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS positive mothers. Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic.

As such, in August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact to neonates born to mothers with a reported penicillin allergy.

### Antibiotic allergy [^116d4RpN]. Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the most common cause of life-threatening immune-mediated drug reactions considered off-target, including anaphylaxis, organ-specific reactions, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. However, many antibiotic reactions documented as allergies were either unknown or not remembered by the patient, involved cutaneous reactions unrelated to drug hypersensitivity, resulted from drug-infection interactions, or were due to drug intolerances. Although such reactions pose negligible risk to patients, they currently represent a global threat to public health. Antibiotic allergy labels result in the displacement of first-line therapies for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. A penicillin allergy label, in particular, is associated with increased use of broad-spectrum and non-β-lactam antibiotics, leading to increased adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Most patients labeled as allergic to penicillins are not allergic when appropriately stratified for risk, tested, and re-challenged. Given the public health importance of penicillin allergy, this review provides a global update on antibiotic allergy epidemiology, classification, mechanisms, and management.

### Understanding penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity, and antibiotic selection in the preoperative setting [^115uPo2Y]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). High credibility.

Penicillin allergies are reported by 8% to 15% of the US population, but up to 95% of these allergies do not correspond to a true allergy when tested. Recent studies have demonstrated that having a penicillin allergy label (PAL) results in a 50% increased odds of surgical site infection among patients reporting a penicillin allergy, entirely attributable to the use of a beta-lactam alternative antibiotic, primarily clindamycin or vancomycin. This study provides a review of the prevalence of PAL, cross-reactivity with cefazolin, immunogenic components of cefazolin and penicillin, and guidelines for preoperative antibiotic selection in patients with PALs.

On understanding these principles, a new set of guidelines and a risk stratification tool are proposed for assessing allergies and determining appropriate antibiotic choice, dosage, and timing in the orthopaedic preoperative setting.

### Elective penicillin skin testing in a pediatric outpatient setting [^117KDGzJ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Adverse reactions associated with penicillin-type antibiotics are common in pediatric practice, leading to the subsequent unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy represents only a fraction of these adverse reactions.

- **Objectives**: To examine (1) the trend of penicillin skin test reactivity during a recent 10-year interval, (2) the relative distribution of specific reagents related to a positive skin test result, and (3) skin test reactivity as a function of reaction history.

- **Methods**: Penicillin testing using three reagents — benzylpenicilloyl polylysine, penicillin G, and sodium penicilloate (penicillin A) — was conducted in a prospective study of 359 consecutive patients referred to an outpatient pediatric allergy clinic between January 1, 1993, and May 31, 2003. We also retrospectively reviewed penicillin skin test results for 562 children previously tested between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1992.

- **Results**: Between 1993 and 2003, the prevalence of penicillin skin test sensitivity markedly declined. Of all the positive skin test results between 1979 and 2002, either penicillin G or sodium penicilloate or both identified 34%, with sodium penicilloate alone responsible for 8.5%. The rate of positive skin test reactions was not significantly different between patients with vs. without a history of suggestive IgE-mediated reactions.

- **Conclusions**: A marked decline in penicillin skin test sensitivity in the pediatric age group is identified. The minor determinant reagents, penicillin G and sodium penicilloate, are both necessary for testing.

### Penicillin skin testing in hospitalized patients with β-lactam allergies: Effect on antibiotic selection and cost [^1156ftC2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

A history of a penicillin allergy generally leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that may increase complications and cost.

- **Objective**: To determine the cost-effectiveness of performing penicillin skin testing (PST).

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on adult inpatients with a β-lactam allergy who underwent PST and an oral challenge performed by an allergist. The primary outcome was overall antibiotic cost savings for patients switched to a β-lactam antibiotic (BLA). Secondary outcomes included subsequent admissions that required antibiotics and the total number of days a BLA was prescribed.

- **Results**: Fifty patients had PST performed (mean age, 62 years). The most common β-lactam allergy reported was penicillin (92%). Cutaneous reactions were reported in 54% of patients, and 56% had a reaction more than 20 years ago. Fifty percent of patients had aztreonam prescribed before PST. The results of PST were negative in all patients, and one patient had anaphylactic symptoms during the oral amoxicillin challenge (98% skin test or oral challenge negative). Thirty-seven patients (75.5%) were changed to a BLA. Overall cost savings were $11,005 ($297 per patient switched to a BLA). There were 31 subsequent admissions that required antibiotics for patients who tested negative on skin tests and oral challenges. A BLA was prescribed in 22 of 31 readmissions, totaling 147 days of BLA therapy.

- **Conclusion**: After the implementation of a PST protocol, we observed a decrease in non-BLA use in patients with previously documented β-lactam allergy. PST is a safe and cost-effective strategy to optimize antibiotic therapy.

### Antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions and approaches to desensitization [^116LBeSN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Before initiating antibiotic therapy, drug hypersensitivity is an important consideration, and a common strategy is to avoid giving patients medications when a high likelihood of severe reactions exists. With an increase in antibiotic resistance and a decrease in novel antibiotics, there is greater pressure to consider antibiotics in patients with a history of adverse reactions. The major concerns include IgE-mediated, or type I, reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Some antibiotics with similar characteristics, such as cephalosporins and penicillins, may be given safely to patients with a certain allergy profile. There is still greater concern when considering antibiotics for patients with a reported allergy. Desensitization is a strategy to safely induce drug tolerance to a specific drug to limit the possibility of a type I reaction.

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: A review [^115Y2pUS]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: β-lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. However, many patients report allergies to these drugs, which limits their use and results in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

- **Observations**: Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon. A low-risk history involves mild exanthems or remote (> 10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.

### Single-step direct drug provocation testing is safe for delabelling selected non-low-risk penicillin allergy labels [^116UjTY6]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy labels are prevalent, and the removal of incorrect labels improves patient outcomes and health economics. Labels may be classified as "low-risk" or "non-low-risk", with the symptoms of the latter chiefly suggesting immunoglobulin E-mediated etiology. Traditionally, "non-low-risk" allergy labels are evaluated by penicillin skin testing followed by graded multistep penicillin drug provocation testing (DPT).

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety of assessing "non-low-risk" labels with single-step direct DPT.

- **Methods**: We consecutively enrolled inpatients and outpatients of a teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, with penicillin allergy labels requiring penicillin for first-line treatment. Patients were classified as "low-risk" or "non-low-risk" based on the allergy labels. All patients proceeded directly to amoxicillin DPT, unless there was a history of anaphylaxis within 10 years of assessment to a beta-lactam (except for cefazolin) or Gell and Coombs type 2, type 3, or severe type 4 reaction. This was followed by a course of amoxicillin.

- **Results**: A total of 149 patients (41 inpatients, 108 outpatients) were enrolled. No patient was excluded from the study. No patient experienced life-threatening reactions to the protocol. There were 85 patients who reported "non-low-risk" allergy labels. One patient developed generalized pruritus and rash that resolved with standard-dose antihistamines; 2 developed delayed benign maculopapular exanthem, and 3 experienced diarrhea during the course of amoxicillin.

- **Conclusion**: In our cohort, direct single-step DPT…

### Safe use of selected cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: A meta-analysis [^1172WSHK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Recent analysis of clinical data and a clearer understanding of the role of chemical structure in the development of cross-reactivity indicate that the increased risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in penicillin-allergic patients is smaller than previously postulated.

- **Method**: Medline and EMBASE databases were searched with the keywords: cephalosporin, penicillin, allergy, and cross-sensitivity for the years 1960 through 2005. Among 219 articles retrieved, 9 served as source material for this evidence-based meta-analysis.

- **Results**: A significant increase in allergic reactions to cephalothin (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 5.5), cephaloridine (OR = 8.7; CI = 5.9 to 12.8), cephalexin (OR = 5.8; CI = 3.6 to 9.2), and all first-generation cephalosporins plus cefamandole (OR = 4.8; CI = 3.7 to 6.2) were observed in penicillin-allergic patients; no increase was observed with second-generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.1; CI = 0.6 to 2.1) or third-generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.2 to 1.1). Clinical challenges, skin testing, and monoclonal antibody studies point to the paramount importance of similarities in side chain structure to predict cross-allergy between cephalosporins and penicillins.

- **Conclusion**: First-generation cephalosporins have cross-allergy with penicillins, but cross-allergy is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of chemical structure in determining the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents.

### Practical management of antibiotic allergy in adults [^116FeznF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

This review examines the main issues surrounding immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. The majority of literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity pertains to β-lactam antibiotics, primarily due to the extensive use of this drug class. Concerns about cross-reactivity frequently trouble clinicians, especially in emergency situations. Reasonable data now exist regarding β-lactam antibiotics and their derivatives, allowing for appropriate risk management. The available literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^112bGYXM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

The potential benefits of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women with a suspected allergy include adherence to guideline-directed antibiotic therapy in the setting of group B streptococcus prophylaxis or cesarean delivery infection prophylaxis, and reduction in exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics. Penicillin allergy testing to document those who truly require alternative treatments supports antibiotic stewardship to mitigate emerging drug resistance. Penicillin allergy testing should ideally occur preconception or at the time of the initial allergy reaction. Obstetricians can also use preconception encounters as well as postpartum visits to counsel women regarding the benefits of penicillin allergy testing.

Recent publications, as well as the latest Committee Opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, advocate for the consideration of penicillin allergy testing in pregnancy. Given the low incidence of anaphylaxis, this study highlights the ability to perform allergy testing in the outpatient setting. In light of the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship and demonstrated acceptability and feasibility of testing, women with a reported penicillin allergy can undergo allergy testing in pregnancy.

### Penicillin G potassium [^1114uRYM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma (see WARNINGS). Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. Penicillin G Potassium, USP, by the intravenous route in high doses (above 10 million units) should be administered slowly because of the potential adverse effects of electrolyte imbalance from the potassium content of the penicillin. Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP, contains 1.68 mEq potassium and 0.3 mEq of sodium per million units. The use of antibiotics may promote overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Indwelling intravenous catheters encourage superinfections. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

Prescribing Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP, in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Laboratory tests**: Periodic assessment of organ system function, including frequent evaluation of electrolyte balance, hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic systems, and cardiac and vascular status, should be performed during prolonged therapy with high doses of intravenous penicillin G (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Diagnostic evaluation of a large group of patients with immediate allergy to penicillins: The role of skin testing [^115HnUwC]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Penicillin is no longer the most commonly prescribed beta-lactam, and the pattern of reactions has changed. We studied the diagnostic value of skin testing in penicillin-allergic subjects from a population where benzylpenicillin is not now the most frequently used beta-lactam.

- **Methods**: Patients with a history of immediate allergic reactions to penicillins were studied with skin tests using major and minor determinants of benzylpenicillin (BPO/MDM), amoxicillin, and ampicillin. In vitro determination of specific IgE and controlled administration for those with a positive history but negative skin and in vitro tests were also conducted. A reaction was considered immediate when symptoms appeared within a maximum of 1 hour after drug intake.

- **Results**: After testing, 290 patients (71% having anaphylaxis and 29% having urticaria) proved to be allergic. Amoxicillin was involved in 64.8%, and benzylpenicillin in 2.8% of the patients. Skin test positivity to at least one determinant appeared in 70% of cases, with amoxicillin being the most frequent. The overall sensitivity decreased markedly when only BPO and MDM were considered. In 13.1% of patients, the diagnosis was established by in vitro tests, and in 16.9% by controlled administration. Of the 290 patients, 42.1% were positive to determinants generated from benzylpenicillin and 57.9% were selective responders.

- **Conclusions**: Sensitivity of skin tests to BPO was lower than reported, being partly replaced by minor determinants, mostly amoxicillin. The incorporation of additional reagents and the development of new tests are required.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^111ZfDBJ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

When conducting diagnostic investigations for drug allergies, particularly for evaluating penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend the following approach. Obtain skin testing using a cephalosporin with a different side chain. If the skin test is negative, perform challenge testing to exclude the possibility of an allergy to the specific cephalosporin. This approach is recommended if a cephalosporin is required for a patient with a clinical history of penicillin allergy and positive skin tests.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations where penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended as first-line agents, the issue of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to the routine use of alternative, but potentially less effective, agents. The use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth.

Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin. The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking, to determine the nature of drug allergies, and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Clinical and genetic risk factors of self-reported penicillin allergy [^112XKbmL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with self-reported penicillin allergy are frequently denied beta-lactam antibiotics. The objective of the study was to identify and correlate clinical and genetic risk factors of self-reported penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a case-control study of adults recruited from allergists' offices. Cases had a history of urticaria, angioedema, wheeze, hypotension, vomiting, or anaphylaxis following a dose of penicillin. DNA from buccal swabs was genotyped for variants associated with candidate genes linked to immediate hypersensitivity (IL4, IL4R, and IL10) and penicillin metabolism (LACTB). Logistic regression was used to calculate the association between penicillin allergy and clinical and genetic factors.

- **Results**: Seventeen allergists identified 76 adults. Complete data were available for 23 cases and 39 controls. Penicillin allergy was associated with a history of penicillin allergy in first-degree relatives (P = 0.002), a history of other adverse drug reactions (P = 0.008), and atopy (P = 0.039). However, in the multivariable analysis, only family history of penicillin allergy remained significant. IL4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs11740584 (P = 0.012), rs10062446 (P = 0.021), and rs2070874 (P = 0.035) were associated with, and LACTB SNP rs2729835 (P = 0.058) was marginally associated with, penicillin allergy. Adding rs11740584 or rs10062446 individually improved the clinical multivariable model (R² increased from 0.23 to 0.33). Haplotype analysis did not provide additional information to the SNP analysis.

- **Conclusion**: Self-reported penicillin allergy may be influenced by both genetic and familial factors.

### A closer look at penicillin allergy history: Systematic review and meta-analysis of tolerance to drug challenge [^1162mEkJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

True allergy to penicillin is rare, despite the high frequency with which it is reported. While most patients reporting penicillin allergy are not prone to anaphylaxis, it is not currently known what percentage of these patients will tolerate dose challenges of penicillin-based antibiotics. This review aims to determine the rate of tolerance in patients reporting penicillin allergy when challenged with penicillin-based antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We searched MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Library for publications with English language translations between the years 2000 and 2017. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, and observational studies of participants reporting penicillin allergy who received at least one systemic dose of a penicillin in the form of a drug challenge. At least two independent reviewers extracted data from included studies and assessed the quality of each included study. To generate primary outcome data, we calculated a summary estimate rate of penicillin tolerance from a pooled proportion of participants receiving penicillin with no adverse effects.

- **Results**: The initial literature search yielded 2945 studies, of which 23 studies were ultimately included in our review; 5056 study participants with reported history of penicillin allergy were challenged with a penicillin. After weighting for study sample size, a pooled average of 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 93.7%-95%) of participants tolerated the dose challenge without any adverse reaction.

- **Conclusion**: Misrepresented penicillin allergy drives unnecessary use of alternative antibiotics, indicating the need for accurate diagnosis and tolerance testing to avoid inappropriate medication use.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^113iuWnT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

Skin testing is an important step in the evaluation of penicillin allergic reactions. It includes testing for amoxicillin, benzyl penicillin, and products generated in vivo after penicillin administration, such as the major determinant hapten penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) and the minor determinant mixture (MDM). Although PPL and MDM are available as a commercial kit, their supply and cost remain problematic.

- **Objective**: We aimed to evaluate the performance and utility of PPL and MDM in penicillin allergy testing.

- **Methods**: A retrospective audit over a 5-year period was undertaken for those with penicillin testing in a tertiary immunology unit.

- **Results**: In all, 214 patients were identified. Of those patients, 151 (70.6%) were female, and the average age was 58 years. Unspecified penicillin was the most common index drug (n = 127 [59.3%]), followed by amoxicillin (n = 53 [24.8%]) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 21 [9.7%]). The result of skin testing was positive in 23 patients (10.7%); skin prick testing was positive in 10 patients (4.7%), and intradermal testing (IDT) was positive in 13 patients (6.1%), the majority of whom had identified amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as the index drug (n = 22 [95.7%]). The result of testing to PPL and/or MDM was positive with IDT only (n = 5 [23.8%]). PPL and MDM positivity coexisted with a positive reaction to amoxicillin IDT in 2 patients, 1 of whom passed an amoxicillin challenge. Additionally, 2 positive tests to PPL were present with a negative result for MDM. Of these 2 positive results, 1 was positive to amoxicillin.

### The use of penicillin skin testing to assess the prevalence of penicillin allergy in an emergency department setting [^1124Fedn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patient-reported penicillin allergies are often unreliable and can result in unnecessary changes in antibiotic therapy. Although penicillin allergy skin testing is commonly performed in allergy clinics, it has not been used in emergency departments (EDs) to verify self-reported allergies. We hypothesize that ED-based testing is possible and that the false-positive rate of patients with self-reported penicillin allergy is greater than 90%.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of ED patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy. Patients were enrolled by one of two emergency physicians who performed skin prick and intracutaneous tests with penicillin major and minor determinants. The total testing time was 30 minutes. The proportion of false-positive self-reported allergies was computed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using the score method.

- **Results**: A total of 150 patients (mean age 42 years; SD 16 years; 46% men; 47% black) were enrolled. The false-positive rate for self-reported penicillin allergy was 137 of 150 (91.3%; 95% CI 85.3% to 95.1%). There were no adverse reactions associated with penicillin skin testing. Compared with patients with a false-positive penicillin allergy result (confirmed by negative penicillin skin testing result), patients reporting a true penicillin allergy confirmed by positive penicillin skin test results tended to be more frequently men (61.5% versus 44.5%; Delta 17.0%; 95% CI -13.5% to 42%), black (69.2% versus 44.5%; Delta 24.7%; 95% CI -6.9% to 46.8%), and have no fam…

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend not to obtain any testing in patients with a history inconsistent with penicillin allergy (such as headache, family history of penicillin allergy, or diarrhea). Consider obtaining a one-step amoxicillin challenge in patients who are anxious or request additional reassurance to accept the removal of a penicillin allergy label.

### Outpatient penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women who report an allergy [^111SzC4K]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Balancing drug allergy with antibiotic stewardship is a difficult and ever-present challenge for the obstetrician. Antibiotics are administered to 30–74% of women during pregnancy for a wide variety of indications. The most commonly used antibiotics include penicillin and other beta lactams, clindamycin and other macrolides, and aminoglycosides.

Pregnant women with a self-reported penicillin allergy typically receive alternative antibiotics that are broader spectrum (e.g. cefazolin, clindamycin, vancomycin), which increases the risk for antibiotic resistance and maternal morbidity. In the general population, self-reported penicillin allergy occurs in 10% of patients; however, when tested, fewer than 2% have a proven (or true) allergic reaction. Penicillin allergy also decreases over time, with up to 80% of patients with a confirmed penicillin allergy losing sensitization 10 years later.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology encourages the consideration of allergy testing in women who self-report a penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergy can be confirmed through skin testing, but there are limited data to inform allergy testing in pregnancy. Two studies using skin testing with 27 and 56 pregnant women reported only 3% and 7% of women, respectively, had a true penicillin allergy, and none had anaphylaxis. Neither of these studies in pregnant women included a graded oral challenge, which is important because oral drug challenge is the gold standard for determining true drug allergy.

Our aim was to estimate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of outpatient penicillin allergy testing.

### Prospective assessment of diagnostic tests for pediatric penicillin allergy: From clinical history to challenge tests [^113AFvLR]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic guidelines for penicillin allergy in children recommend cumbersome protocols based partially on data from adults, which may be suboptimal for pediatric use.

- **Objective**: To assess the accuracy of tools for diagnosis of penicillin allergy in children.

- **Methods**: A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in children with reported adverse events related to penicillin, excluding severe reactions. All patients underwent a uniform diagnostic protocol that consisted of clinical history, skin tests, serum specific IgE (sIgE), and, regardless of these results, drug provocation tests (DPTs).

- **Results**: A total of 732 children (mean age, 5.5 years; 51.2% males) completed the allergy workup, including DPTs. Amoxicillin triggered 96.9% of all reactions. None of the patients with an immediate index reaction (IR) developed a reaction on DPT. Penicillin allergy was confirmed in 35 children (4.8%): 6 immediate reactions (17%) and 29 nonimmediate reactions (83%) on the DPT. No severe reactions were recorded. The allergist diagnosis based on the clinical history was not associated with the DPT final outcome. In 30 of 33 allergic patients (91%), the results of all skin tests and sIgE tests were negative. A logistic regression model identified the following to be associated with penicillin allergy: a family history of drug allergy (odds ratio [OR], 3.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.33–6.89; p = 0.008), an IR lasting more than 3 days vs. 24 hours or less (OR, 8.96; 95% CI, 2.01–39.86; p = 0.004), and an IR treated with corticosteroids (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.30–5.54;…

### The evolution of our understanding of penicillin allergy: 1942–2022 [^113crxza]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

This article reviews our evolving understanding of penicillin hypersensitivity on the 80th anniversary of penicillin's clinical introduction. Penicillin breakdown products covalently bond to serum proteins, leading to classic drug hypersensitivity. Penicillin remains the most frequently reported drug "allergy". Adverse reactions were presumed, in retrospect incorrectly, to implicate a risk for anaphylaxis, and therefore skin testing for IgE became the focus. Skin test positivity may wane over time, leading to the radical conclusion that penicillin hypersensitivity may not be "forever".

Atopic background, other drug allergies, family history, gender, and race are apparently not risk factors for penicillin hypersensitivity. Confirmed penicillin hypersensitivity has declined since the 1960s, potentially due to "cleaner" penicillin products and lower dose oral, instead of parenteral, use. Avoiding penicillins without evaluation caused unanticipated problems that have been appreciated only recently, including longer hospital stays, increased cost of care, suboptimal outcomes from serious infections, and greater toxicities and costs with alternative antibiotics.

There are personal and public health advantages with broadly implemented penicillin allergy delabeling based on a reaction history-based risk assessment. Limited skin testing followed by an oral challenge, if negative, for higher-risk histories and direct oral challenges in lower-risk individuals are currently the reference standard tests to confirm tolerance.

### New avenues for antimicrobial stewardship: The case for penicillin skin testing by pharmacists [^111qstRn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

It is well-appreciated that patients with documented penicillin allergies often receive broader-spectrum antibiotics, which has been associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and cost. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to spread awareness about the implications of self-reported penicillin allergies. The use of penicillin skin testing to evaluate true allergies has been strongly recommended by major organizations for decades; however, testing remains underutilized. Literature has suggested various models of incorporating penicillin allergy screening and testing by different healthcare practitioners (i.e. physicians, allergists, nurses, pharmacists).

We suggest broader adoption of the role of pharmacists in the provision of penicillin skin testing. This would help expand the service and maximize the potential benefits of penicillin skin testing.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often face the task of selecting antibiotics for patients with reported antibiotic allergies. For penicillins, penicillin skin testing sensitivity effectively predicts serious allergic reactions. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing helps exclude sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. In the case of other antibiotics, the patient's history is the most useful tool for determining the likelihood of a serious reaction upon further drug exposure. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably not higher than cross-reactivity between penicillins and other antibiotic classes. When a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy is present, desensitization therapy should be considered if alternative antibiotics' efficacy is doubtful. For treating serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the preferred antibiotic despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### The rational clinical examination. Is this patient allergic to penicillin? An evidence-based analysis of the likelihood of penicillin allergy [^113PW5yR]. JAMA (2001). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently withhold antibiotics that contain penicillin based on patients' self-reported clinical history of an adverse reaction to penicillin and the clinicians' misunderstandings about the characteristics of a true penicillin allergy.

- **Objectives**: To determine the likelihood of true penicillin allergy with consideration of clinical history and to evaluate the diagnostic value added by appropriate skin testing.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE was searched for relevant English-language articles dated 1966 to October 2000. Bibliographies were searched to identify additional articles.

- **Study selection**: We included original studies describing the precision of skin testing in diagnosis of penicillin allergy. We excluded studies that did not use both minor and major determinants, provide an explicit definition of penicillin allergy, or list the specific criteria necessary for a positive skin test result. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Three authors independently reviewed and abstracted data from all articles and reached consensus about any discrepancies.

- **Data synthesis**: Patients' self-reported history has low accuracy for diagnosis of true penicillin allergy. By evaluating studies comparing clinical history to the skin test for penicillin allergy among patients with and without a positive history for penicillin allergy, positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated. History of penicillin allergy had a positive likelihood ratio of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.5–2.5), while absence of history of penicillin allergy…

### The use of direct oral challenge to confirm allergies to penicillin class antibiotics in Danish children [^112FX8NY]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

This study is a retrospective medical record review with no prospective interventional component. According to The Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics, no formal ethics approval was required.

The subjects were children followed in outpatient clinics at three Danish hospitals in the Central Denmark Region, with a history of alleged allergy to a penicillin class antibiotic within the period from December 2007 to October 2011. In total, 141 children (69 boys and 72 girls) with an average age of 4.2 years (range, 0.33–15.3 years) were included.

The local guideline involved a graded two-step direct oral challenge, or drug challenge (DC), with two total hours of observation to confirm antibiotic allergy or tolerance. Additionally, a standardized European Network for Drug Allergy (ENDA) drug allergy questionnaire was completed. There was variable use of skin prick testing (SPT) in a subgroup of 52 children, anti-penicillin and anti-cephalosporin specific IgE testing in 141 children, and measurements of total IgE levels in 104 individuals. The setup with SPT, DC, and in vitro measurements of anti-penicillin and anti-cephalosporin specific IgE was in accordance with ENDA guidelines.

Specific IgE testing was conducted for penicillin G and V, amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefamandole, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and penicillin minor determinant in all patients using the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE 0–100 (Phadia APS, Allerød, Denmark). A value greater than 0.35 kUA/L was considered positive. Total IgE was measured in 104 of the patients at the same time.

### Safety of direct drug provocation testing in adults with penicillin allergy and association with health and economic benefits [^1148HMe1]. Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Nonprescription of penicillin-containing antibiotics in patients diagnosed with penicillin allergy is associated with morbidity and mortality. Adverse reactions to penicillins comprise type A and B reactions.

Objective

To assess the feasibility of penicillin allergy evaluation without penicillin skin testing (PST) for adult patients with type B reactions and the health and economic benefits of this process.

Methods

Inpatients at an Australian tertiary hospital between April 1, 2017, and April 30, 2018, with a diagnosis of type B penicillin allergy, requiring a penicillin-containing antibiotic for treatment, were included. All patients underwent clinical history review, PST, and drug provocation testing (DPT).

Results

Seventy-one patients were enrolled. Sixty-three reported a history of type B or unknown adverse reactions. No patients had a history of anaphylaxis requiring intubation or epinephrine within the last 10 years or a history suggesting Gell and Coombs type 2, 3, or 4 (severe) hypersensitivity reaction. Seven did not complete DPT because the treating team used a β-lactam antibiotic other than amoxicillin. Fifty-four of 56 remaining patients (96%) completed 3-day DPT to amoxicillin with no adverse reaction. Two experienced mild cutaneous reactions. Penicillin allergy evaluation was significantly associated with reduced length of stay, reduced hospital expenditure on bed and second-line antibiotics, and reduced readmission rates.

Conclusion

Penicillin allergy evaluation with DPT without PST may be feasible for all adult patients with a reported hi

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1157buWX]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and pediatric allergy, as well as other clinicians practicing allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence-based, and where evidence is lacking, the panel reached consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a web-based process, and all comments were carefully considered.

Included in the guideline are sections on the epidemiology of allergic reactions to beta-lactams, their molecular structure, formulations available in the UK, and a description of known beta-lactam antigenic determinants.

- **Value and limitations of clinical history**: Skin testing and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins are included.

- **Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins**: Discussed in detail. Recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures are made. Guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children is provided in a separate section. An algorithm to aid clinicians in diagnosing patients with a history of penicillin allergy is also included.

### Treatment of patients with a history of penicillin allergy in a large tertiary-care academic hospital [^112qkMJs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics to patients with a history of penicillin allergy is common in clinical practice. Opting for non-beta-lactam antibiotics has its inconveniences and is often unnecessary because most of these patients are not actually allergic.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine how physicians in a large Canadian tertiary-care academic hospital without allergists on staff treat patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted during a 1-year period among all patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, coronary care unit, and internal medicine wards. Files of patients with a record of penicillin allergy were reviewed to assess the need for antibiotics during their hospitalization and the decision-making process underlying the choice of antibiotic. The additional costs of alternative antibiotics were calculated.

- **Results**: The files of 1,738 patients admitted over a 1-year period were hand reviewed. A history of penicillin allergy was found in 172 patients (9.9%). The allergic reaction was described in only 30% of cases and left unmentioned in 20.7%. Beta-lactam antibiotics were used on 56 occasions despite a history of penicillin allergy. The use of alternative antibiotics in place of the beta-lactam standard of care carried an additional cost of $15,672 Canadian.

- **Conclusion**: Alleged penicillin allergy is common among hospitalized patients and leads to substantial additional costs. Poor documentation of penicillin allergy likely reflects a lack of knowledge on this issue in the medical community, which may contribute to unnecessary healthcare expenses.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing for penicillins and the necessary cephalosporin. This helps determine whether sensitization is to the β-lactam core or the side chain, especially if a cephalosporin is required by a patient with a previous reaction. Subsequent challenge testing should be performed to either exclude allergy or proceed with desensitization if the patient is indeed allergic.

### Documented penicillin allergies on antibiotic selection at pediatric emergency department visits [^115XQx9g]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Penicillin or amoxicillin are the recommended treatments for the most common pediatric bacterial illnesses. Allergies to penicillin are commonly reported among children but are rarely true. We evaluated the impact of reported penicillin allergies on broad-spectrum antibiotic use overall and for the treatment of common respiratory infections among treat-and-release pediatric emergency department (ED) visits.

- **Methods**: Retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients receiving antibiotics during a treat-and-release visit at a large pediatric ED in the northeast from 2014 to 2016. The study exposure was a reported allergy to penicillin in the electronic medical record. Study outcomes were the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics and alternative (second-line) antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) and group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. We used unadjusted and adjusted generalized estimating equation models to analyze the impact of reported penicillin allergies on the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to determine the probability of children with a documented penicillin allergy receiving alternative antibiotic treatments for AOM and GAS.

- **Results**: Among 12,987 pediatric patients, 810 (6.2%) had a documented penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergies increased the odds of children receiving a broad-spectrum versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.34–16.18). In our adjusted logistic regression model, the probability of a child…

### Penicillin skin testing in the evaluation and management of penicillin allergy [^111WoAJA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to review the role of penicillin skin testing in the evaluation and management of penicillin allergy mediated by IgE.

Data sources include a PubMed and OVID search of English-language articles regarding penicillin allergy, penicillin allergy testing, and management of penicillin allergy.

Articles pertinent to the subject matter were selected and reviewed. The results indicate that the major determinant, benzylpenicillin polylysine, detects the greatest number of penicillin allergic patients during skin testing, while the minor determinants of penicillin increase the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing. Penicillin skin testing to the major and minor determinants was found to have a negative predictive value of 97% to 99%. The incidence of systemic adverse reactions to penicillin skin testing is less than 1%.

A detailed history of the prior reaction to penicillin is an integral part of the evaluation, but it is not accurate in predicting a positive penicillin skin test result. A patient with a negative penicillin skin test result to the major and minor determinants is at a low risk of an immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction to penicillin. Patients with a positive skin test result should undergo desensitization to penicillin, or an alternative antibiotic should be considered.

### Outcomes from an inpatient beta-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^116z1TPj]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to direct test-dose challenges

Overall, 570 penicillin allergy patients with IgE or unknown histories were directly challenged with cephalosporins (third, fourth, or fifth generation) or carbapenems. Of the 514 patients directly challenged with third-, fourth-, or fifth-generation cephalosporins, 14 (2.7%) experienced hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (95% CI, 1.5%–4.5%). The highest HSR rate occurred with cefepime (4.4%; 95% CI, 2.1%–8.0%). Of the 56 patients directly challenged with carbapenems, none experienced HSRs.

- **Reactions from direct β-lactam antibiotic challenges**: These figures provide insight into β-lactam hypersensitivity reactions and real-world potential cross-reactivity in acute care patients with well-characterized historical reactions. Patients included those with penicillin allergy histories who received β-lactam test doses following the penicillin hypersensitivity pathway through the type 1 (IgE-mediated) HSR pathway (n = 683). Types of carbapenems administered were meropenem (n = 46), imipenem (n = 6), and ertapenem (n = 4).

	- **Patients with mild HSR pathway**: Patients with penicillin allergy histories who received β-lactam test doses through the mild HSR pathway (n = 179). Antibiotics administered included piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 26), ampicillin/sulbactam (n = 21), ampicillin (n = 13), amoxicillin (n = 6), penicillin G (n = 5), nafcillin (n = 4), and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (n = 1).

*Note: Excluded from the study were patients with both penicillin and cephalosporin allergy histories and those who received penicillin skin testing (PST) prior to their challenge.

### Outcomes from an inpatient beta-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^115KCBCH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). High credibility.

This study provides insight into "real world" β-lactam cross-reactivity in patients with specified IgE penicillin allergy histories, including patients with severe IgE histories. Prior observational studies of cephalosporins administered to penicillin allergy patients largely excluded those with higher-risk penicillin allergy histories because they were selected out. Patients with severe IgE histories have an increased risk of true allergy and β-lactam cross-reactivity. Although third-, fourth-, or fifth-generation cephalosporins overall had a low 2.6% hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) rate in patients with IgE penicillin allergy histories, the cefepime HSR rate was 4.4% with a 95% confidence interval of up to 8.0%.

It remains unclear whether later-generation cephalosporins need to be initiated with a test-dose challenge, as many clinicians initiate these cephalosporins in penicillin allergy histories with a full dose. Of 56 carbapenem test doses administered to patients with IgE penicillin allergy histories, including almost half with severe IgE histories, there were no HSRs. This prompts consideration for modification of the penicillin hypersensitivity pathway to indicate that carbapenems be administered by a full dose. For mild penicillin allergy histories, full-dose challenges for first- or second-generation cephalosporins are a safe modification that would facilitate the use of any cephalosporin for any patient with mild penicillin allergy histories. This change could benefit acute-care obstetric and perioperative patients where cefazolin or cefoxitin are indicated.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^115qWBSe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2023). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy testing has long been a critical facet of clinical immunology. With the prevalence of penicillin allergies, it is essential to accurately identify true hypersensitivities to this commonly used antibiotic. The role of both major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing warrants a reevaluation, given advancements in immunological understanding and diagnostic methodologies. By revisiting these determinants, healthcare providers can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^112CRMFf]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Penicillins are the most common cause of drug-induced allergic reactions. Penicillin allergy can manifest as a variety of symptoms, ranging from reactions non-compatible with allergy and mild allergic symptoms (such as widespread erythema, urticaria, or periorbital edema) to severe anaphylaxis, which includes circulatory failure, cardiac and/or respiratory arrest, and potentially death.

The approach for diagnosing reactions to penicillins is complex, as proposed by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). The first step in this process includes obtaining a detailed clinical history. However, the information provided by patients is often inaccurate, particularly when they are referred following a significant delay and when details about the nature of the symptoms and the suspected antibiotic are incomplete. As a result, in vitro tests and skin tests (STs) are usually required. If these tests are negative, a drug provocation test (DPT) should be considered.

Importantly, many patients with a history compatible with penicillin allergy yield negative STs and even tolerate the suspected antibiotic in DPT. Evidence suggests a loss of specific IgE (sIgE) to penicillins after avoiding exposure to the drug that induced the allergic reaction, leading to ST-negativity. sIgE to penicillin and/or to amoxicillin (AX) in serum was not detected in 50% of patients three years after the reactions and in none of the patients after four years. Concerning the basophil activation test, negativization occurred in 60% of patients after 18 months. Regarding STs, it has been reported that up to 30% of patients with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity have their STs negative over time.

### Why was there ever a warning not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin "allergy" [^112rygzX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

It is now well-established that avoiding β-lactam antibiotics, when they are the drugs of choice, results in significantly worse long-term global outcomes for patients. Much of this avoidable morbidity has been caused by widespread warnings in electronic health care record systems not to use cephalosporins in the setting of penicillin allergy. High rates, up to 1000-fold higher than now seen, of immunologically mediated reactions were associated with early impure penicillin preparations. This instilled a rational fear of β-lactam-associated anaphylaxis in generations of physicians.

In the late 1970s, several editorial comments regarding a potential increased risk to patients given cephalosporins who had a history of a penicillin allergy resulted in the warning that became embedded in the culture of medicine. Over the past 40 years, compelling data have been developed that refute this warning and showed that the risks of avoiding cephalosporins outweighed the benefits. In late 2017, Kaiser Permanente Southern California completely removed all warnings not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin allergy. The results have recently been published in JAMA Network Open. This Rostrum article provides some of the backstory on the establishment and removal of this warning for physicians who trained over the past 30 years.

### A real-time prospective evaluation of clinical pharmaco-economic impact of diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' in a UK teaching hospital [^111JThWU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to perform a pharmaco-economic analysis of prescribing alternative antibiotics in patients with a diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' and assess whether collation of information from a structured history and liaison with the family physician could reduce costs.

- **Methods**: A prospective pro-forma-based interview of randomly selected in-patients and their family physician was used to assess the validity of the diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy'. A cost analysis of the prescription of alternative antibiotics was performed and compared with first-line agents.

- **Results**: 102 patients were assessed and only 40% (n = 41) were found to have a history consistent with penicillin hypersensitivity, 40% (n = 41) were likely 'not allergic', and 20% (n = 20) had 'indeterminate' reactions. The total cost of antibiotics prescribed for patients with penicillin allergy was 1.82- to 2.58-fold higher than for first-line antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Obtaining a structured history from the patient and family physician alone can enable an accurate identification of penicillin allergy status. The total acquisition cost of second-line antibiotics is higher than if these patients were prescribed first-line antibiotics.

### Resensitization in suspected penicillin allergy [^113WjnNd]. Allergy (2023). Low credibility.

The exact rate of resensitization to penicillins is not known, with figures ranging widely among different studies from 0% to 27.9%. The variable resensitization rate reported in different studies can be attributed to differing methodologies, relatively small sample sizes, and failure to perform skin tests (STs) to confirm resensitization in some patients who had a suspected adverse reaction after initial negative STs.

There is no consensus about whether resensitization should be ruled out routinely. While several studies support that the resensitization phenomenon is rare, others advocate for skin retesting after drug provocation tests (DPT) to rule out resensitization. It is necessary to assess the need for skin retesting in patients with suspected penicillin allergy and negative allergy tests, and to agree on its inclusion after completing the routine diagnostic workup.

The aim of our study was to determine the rate of resensitization in a group of patients with a suggestive reported allergic reaction to penicillins by repeating STs after an initial evaluation. We also aimed to analyze the potential factors associated with the resensitization phenomenon.

### The cost of self-reported penicillin allergy: A systematic review [^112MusQz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Patients who report a penicillin (PCN) allergy receive suboptimal antibiotic therapy compared with patients not reporting an allergy. However, a majority of patients who report PCN allergy are not truly allergic on confirmatory testing. Ruling out PCN allergy by testing may improve clinical and economic outcomes for patients with reported allergies requiring antibiotic therapy.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to summarize clinical and economic outcomes associated with PCN allergy and provide recommendations for future cost-effectiveness analyses for PCN allergy testing.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted using SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed, including all articles published up to April 25, 2017 (PROSPERO Registration number 42017064112). A total of 1518 abstracts were found during the initial search with 96 duplicates, resulting in 1422 articles for screening. Thirty articles were included for qualitative synthesis and full data extraction.

- **Results**: The majority of the studies included had an observational design focusing on inpatient admissions. The most frequently measured outcome in the context of PCN allergy was optimizing antibiotic therapy. Patients with PCN allergy were found to have direct drug costs during inpatient admission ranging from no difference to an additional $609 per patient compared with patients without PCN allergy. Outpatient prescription costs were estimated to be from $14 to $193 per patient higher for PCN allergic patients. Total inpatient costs were less for patients without PCN allergy, with average savings starting from $1145.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^1169e4sL]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

Skin testing is an important step in the evaluation of penicillin allergic reactions. It includes testing for amoxicillin, benzyl penicillin, and products generated in vivo after penicillin administration, including the major determinant hapten penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) and the minor determinant mixture (MDM). Although PPL and MDM are available as a commercial kit, their supply and cost remain problematic.

- **Objective**: We aimed to evaluate the performance and utility of PPL and MDM in penicillin allergy testing.

- **Methods**: A retrospective audit over a 5-year period was undertaken for those with penicillin testing in a tertiary immunology unit.

- **Results**: In all, 214 patients were identified. Of those patients, 151 (70.6%) were female and the average age was 58 years. Unspecified penicillin was the most common index drug (n = 127 [59.3%]), followed by amoxicillin (n = 53 [24.8%]) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 21 [9.7%]). The result of skin testing was positive in 23 patients (10.7%); skin prick testing was positive in 10 patients (4.7%), and intradermal testing (IDT) was positive in 13 patients (6.1%), the majority of whom had identified amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as the index drug (n = 22 [95.7%]). The result of testing to PPL and/or MDM was positive with IDT only (n = 5 [23.8%]). PPL and MDM positivity coexisted with a positive reaction to amoxicillin IDT in 2 patients, 1 of whom passed an amoxicillin challenge. Additionally, 2 positive tests to PPL were present with a negative result for MDM; of these 2 positive results, 1 was positive to amoxicillin.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering direct challenges (without prior skin test) to cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains. This is to determine tolerance in patients with a history of non-anaphylactic cephalosporin allergy.
