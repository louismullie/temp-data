## Question

How to treat malignancy induced pe?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat malignancy-associated pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate risk stratification and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should verify the initial anticoagulation strategy and whether to use LMWH versus DOACs. Next, I will consider special populations such as GI, genitourinary, and brain tumors, and how thrombocytopenia alters management. After that, I need to determine duration of therapy, including the role of indefinite anticoagulation and the ONCO PE trial data. I will then examine incidental and subsegmental PE, outpatient eligibility, and advanced therapies for massive PE. Finally, I should review drug–drug interactions, monitoring, and follow-up, and close with a concise decision framework that integrates these elements with guideline support [^114NAjH8] [^112GuR9f].

> Let me first confirm the initial risk stratification because it drives everything downstream; I need to check for hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest, and if present, escalate immediately to reperfusion strategies rather than routine anticoagulation, whereas stable patients can proceed with standard anticoagulation and risk stratification using sPESI or PESI to identify low-risk candidates for outpatient care [^113GmmXp] [^115uSEkd] [^114MfsbN].

> Wait, let me verify the initial anticoagulation choice in active cancer; historically, LMWH has been preferred for the first 3 to 6 months given lower recurrence versus VKAs, but I should confirm whether DOACs are now acceptable alternatives in selected patients; the Hokusai VTE Cancer trial showed edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin for the composite of recurrent VTE or major bleeding, with fewer recurrences but more major bleeding, and ASH 2021 supports DOACs as reasonable options outside high GI bleeding risk settings, so I should tailor to tumor site and bleeding risk rather than default to LMWH for all [^113GyKaV] [^115uJtMW] [^117Y1sxF].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions before choosing a DOAC; patients with GI or gastroesophageal cancers, genitourinary malignancies with potential hematuria, or brain tumors have higher major bleeding risk with DOACs, so LMWH remains preferred there, and I need to screen for drug interactions with chemotherapy agents that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 and P-gp, which can alter DOAC exposure and favor LMWH in complex regimens [^117Y1sxF] [^116mwrRU].

> I need to ensure I address thrombocytopenia because it is common in cancer and complicates anticoagulation; if platelets are below 50,000, I should consider dose-reduced LMWH or even observation with close surveillance, and if below 25,000, I should generally avoid anticoagulation unless the thrombosis is life-threatening, in which case multidisciplinary input is essential to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks [^notfound].

> Next, I should review duration; for active cancer, extended anticoagulation is recommended over stopping at 3 months, with CHEST advising indefinite therapy and periodic reassessment, and ASH supporting indefinite therapy to reduce recurrence while acknowledging increased bleeding over time; I should confirm that this applies to both symptomatic and incidental events in cancer, given similar recurrence risks [^113tE5sk] [^112auZVA] [^112GuR9f].

> But wait, what if the PE is low-risk and incidental; I should double-check whether prolonged DOAC therapy reduces recurrence without excess bleeding; the ONCO PE randomized trial in cancer patients with acute low-risk PE showed that 18 months of rivaroxaban reduced recurrent VTE versus 6 months without a significant increase in major bleeding, supporting extended DOAC therapy in this subgroup when bleeding risk is acceptable [^1154YEWW] [^114FZq1J].

> Let me consider incidental and subsegmental PE specifically; I should confirm that guidelines advise treating incidental PE the same as symptomatic PE in cancer because outcomes are comparable, and for subsegmental PE, ASH suggests short-term anticoagulation rather than observation when recurrence risk is moderate to high and bleeding risk is lower, so I should not dismiss small clots in this population [^112GuR9f] [^114NAjH8] [^114w6Dt4].

> I will now examine outpatient eligibility; hemodynamically stable patients with low-risk features can often be managed as outpatients, but I need to check whether active cancer modifies that risk; post hoc data from HOME-PE suggest higher 30-day complication rates in cancer patients managed at home, so I should apply enhanced monitoring, early follow-up, and careful selection rather than automatic admission or discharge [^111cDZpr] [^114MfsbN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about advanced therapies; in massive or high-risk PE with shock or arrest, systemic thrombolysis is indicated, and if contraindications exist or lysis fails, catheter-directed therapy or surgical embolectomy should be considered, with VA-ECMO as a bridge in refractory cases even in advanced malignancy when goals of care support aggressive intervention [^115uSEkd] [^115F3kXE].

> I should confirm drug–drug interaction screening and monitoring; strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers can markedly change DOAC levels, so I need to review all cancer therapies and supportive medications, and if interactions are unavoidable, LMWH is safer; I should also monitor CBC and renal function regularly, and reassess bleeding and thrombotic risks periodically to adjust therapy and duration [^116mwrRU] [^113tE5sk].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency: risk-stratify and stabilize first, select LMWH or a DOAC based on tumor site and interactions, extend therapy indefinitely in active cancer with periodic reassessment, treat incidental and subsegmental PE similarly to symptomatic events, consider outpatient care with caution in cancer, escalate to reperfusion for massive PE, and individualize in thrombocytopenia and complex drug interactions, aligning with major society guidelines and pivotal trials [^115D4Jdg] [^114NAjH8] [^112GuR9f] [^113GyKaV] [^1154YEWW].

Malignancy-associated PE is best managed with **LMWH for at least 6 months** [^112ryiwy] as first-line therapy, with indefinite anticoagulation if cancer remains active or treatment is ongoing [^113tE5sk]. DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) are reasonable alternatives when gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding risk is low, but **LMWH is preferred for GI, genitourinary, or brain tumors** [^117Y1sxF] [^116mwrRU]. For high-risk PE with hemodynamic instability, use systemic thrombolysis or catheter-directed therapy [^115uSEkd] [^113cAQFs]; for low-risk PE, outpatient management is appropriate with close follow-up [^114MfsbN]. Reassess bleeding risk, renal function, and drug interactions regularly, and adjust therapy as cancer status changes [^112auZVA].

---

## Initial anticoagulation therapy

### Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)

- **First-line therapy**: LMWH (e.g. dalteparin, enoxaparin) is the preferred initial anticoagulant for malignancy-associated PE [^113cAQFs] [^113moVnU].
- **Duration**: Treat for at least 6 months; if cancer remains active or treatment is ongoing, continue indefinitely [^112ryiwy] [^113tE5sk].
- **Advantages**: LMWH reduces recurrence compared to VKAs and avoids the dietary and drug interaction issues of warfarin [^117Y1sxF] [^111ac5d4].

---

### Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

- **Alternatives**: Apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban are reasonable options when gastrointestinal (GI) and intracranial bleeding risks are low [^113GmmXp] [^116mwrRU].
- **Limitations**: Higher major bleeding risk, especially GI bleeding, compared to LMWH; avoid in GI, genitourinary, or brain tumors [^113GyKaV] [^117Y1sxF] [^116mwrRU].
- **Evidence**: Hokusai VTE Cancer showed edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin for recurrent VTE/major bleeding, but with more major bleeding [^113GyKaV].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation therapy

The **duration of anticoagulation** depends on cancer activity and patient-specific factors:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|
| Active cancer or ongoing treatment | Indefinite anticoagulation (no scheduled stop date) [^113tE5sk] [^112auZVA] |
| Cancer in remission or cured | Minimum 6 months; consider indefinite if high recurrence risk [^112ryiwy] [^112auZVA] |
| High bleeding risk | Individualized decision; consider shorter courses or alternative strategies [^114NAjH8] [^112auZVA] |

## Management of high-risk pulmonary embolism

High-risk PE presents with **hemodynamic instability** (shock or cardiac arrest) and requires immediate escalation:

- **Systemic thrombolysis**: First-line for massive PE with shock or cardiac arrest [^115uSEkd].
- **Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)**: For patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis or as adjunctive therapy [^112aVqbB].
- **Surgical embolectomy**: Consider when thrombolysis is contraindicated or fails [^notfound].

---

## Management of low-risk pulmonary embolism

Low-risk PE is hemodynamically stable without right ventricular dysfunction and is often managed as an **outpatient** when appropriate [^114MfsbN]. Outpatient management is feasible with close follow-up and patient education, though active cancer increases complication risk and warrants careful selection and monitoring [^111cDZpr] [^114SXHQg]. Patient selection should confirm stability, low bleeding risk, good renal function, and strong adherence before discharge [^114MfsbN].

---

## Special considerations and adjustments

### Thrombocytopenia

In thrombocytopenia, **platelet count ≥ 50,000/μL** supports full-dose anticoagulation; for **platelet count < 50,000/μL**, use reduced-dose LMWH or consider observation if bleeding risk is high [^notfound].

---

### Renal impairment

In renal impairment, **LMWH** requires dose adjustment if creatinine clearance (CrCl) is < 30 mL/min, whereas **DOACs** should be avoided or adjusted based on renal function and specific agent [^notfound].

---

### Drug interactions

For drug interactions, **chemotherapy agents** may interact with anticoagulants; review and adjust therapy as needed [^116mwrRU].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly reassess **bleeding risk**, renal function, and cancer status to guide **ongoing anticoagulation** [^116Ffbzt]. Imaging may be considered to confirm resolution or **detect recurrence** when clinically indicated [^114FZq1J]. Provide education on adherence, bleeding signs, and when to seek care [^1116cPiy].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line therapy**: LMWH for at least 6 months; continue indefinitely if cancer is active or treatment is ongoing [^112ryiwy] [^113tE5sk].
- **DOACs**: Consider only when GI and intracranial bleeding risks are low [^116mwrRU] [^113GyKaV].
- **High-risk PE**: Systemic thrombolysis or CDT as indicated [^113cAQFs].
- **Low-risk PE**: Outpatient management is appropriate with careful selection [^114MfsbN].
- **Regular reassessment**: Adjust therapy based on bleeding risk, renal function, and cancer status [^116Ffbzt].

---

Malignancy-associated PE requires **individualized anticoagulation**, with LMWH as the preferred initial therapy and DOACs as alternatives in selected patients. Management should be **guided by cancer status, bleeding risk, and patient-specific factors**, with regular reassessment to optimize outcomes [^113moVnU] [^112auZVA].

### How I treat cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^116whUQw]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common complication of cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Several cancer-related risk factors contribute to the development of VTE including cancer type and stage, chemotherapy, surgery, and patient-related factors such as advanced age and immobilization. Patients with cancer frequently undergo diagnostic imaging scans for cancer staging and treatment response evaluation, which is increasing the underlying risk of VTE detection. The management of cancer-associated VTE is challenging. Over the years, important advances have been made and, recently, randomized controlled trials have been published helping clinicians' management of this patient population. In this review, we will discuss common cancer-associated VTE scenarios and critically review available evidence to guide treatment decisions.

Treatment

How long should I anticoagulate for? And with what dose?

Acute VTE/PE events should be treated for a minimum of 3 months. Physicians may consider stopping treatment at 3 months if the risk factor associated with the blood clot is no longer present. However, if the associated risk factor persists beyond 3 months, or if the blood clot occurred with no identifiable risk factors, physicians should consider treatment beyond 3 months, with the possibility of long-term anticoagulation.

Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in anticoagulation management with the majority of patients with acute PE being treated with a DOAC. A step-down dose in certain DOACs (apixaban and rivaroxaban) may be considered from 3 to 6 months after starting anticoagulation. Although patients were treated for a minimum of 6 months in randomised controlled trials of DOACs, in clinical practice, treatment can be reviewed between 3 and 6 months post-VTE.

Specific exceptions to the use of DOACs in acute PE include some patients with cancer such as gastrointestinal tract, renal system or brain malignancies or those receiving systemic cancer therapies with potential drug interactions. It is also recommended against initiating DOACs for the treatment or secondary prophylaxis in patients with venous thrombosis and known APS.

### Risk stratification for acute pulmonary embolism [^115WJRgK]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

This article discusses state-of-the-art techniques for predicting risk of death after acute pulmonary embolism (PE), with special attention to how underlying malignancy adversely affects survival after an episode. Current methods of risk stratification generally categorize patients with PE as low-, moderate-, and high-risk for in-hospital adverse outcomes of respiratory failure, circulatory shock, and death. Published risk stratification studies find that patients with PE and an underlying malignancy have a worse prognosis, but no validated risk stratification criteria have been published specifically for these patients. Standard treatment is full-dose heparin followed by oral anticoagulation. The term escalated treatment refers to the use of systemic or intrapulmonary fibrinolytic agents, catheter-based treatment, or surgical embolectomy. Most patients with low-risk PE (normal vital signs and normal serum troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, and normal echocardiography) are treated successfully with standard anticoagulation, and many can be treated as outpatients. In contrast, patients with high-risk PE (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg and no contraindications) often benefit from escalated treatment. Treatment decisions for patients with moderate-risk PE (normotension with evidence of right ventricular damage or dysfunction) are most controversial. Most patients in this category of risk recover with standard therapy, but some benefit from escalated treatment. Patients with cancer with an incidentally discovered PE should be risk stratified the same as those who have clinically suspected PE.

### Research progress on the association between lung cancer and pulmonary embolism [^11574Svy]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy globally and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. In 2020, lung cancer was responsible for 1.8 million deaths, accounting for 18% of all cancer-related fatalities. Pulmonary embolism (PE), a serious complication in individuals with lung cancer, is the second most common cause of death in this population, following disease progression. The incidence of PE in individuals with lung cancer is approximately six times higher than in the general population, placing lung cancer among the malignancies with the highest rates of thrombosis. This malignancy accounts for the largest absolute number of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events associated with cancer. Factors such as high D-dimer levels, chemotherapy, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), advanced disease stages (III–IV), and adenocarcinoma have been positively correlated with the occurrence of PE. Additionally, PE is consistently associated with a poor prognosis in individuals with lung cancer.

The prognosis for those with coexisting lung cancer and PE is generally unfavorable, with a significant incidence rate in this patient group. Clinically, the development of PE requires close consideration, as variations in the timing of onset — whether before, during, or after the diagnosis of lung cancer — present distinct differences in pathogenesis. These variations can complicate the diagnostic and therapeutic approach. During anti-tumor treatment, lung cancer may exacerbate pre-existing PE, and when combined with infection or tumor progression, it remains uncertain whether anti-tumor therapies can lead to the chronic progression of acute PE or its conversion to chronic pulmonary hypertension.

Furthermore, the management of individuals undergoing anti-tumor therapy for lung cancer is complicated by the need to balance increased risks of both thrombosis and hemorrhage. The complex interaction between physiological responses and pharmacological interventions poses additional challenges in clinical management. This study aims to investigate the relationship between lung cancer and PE, review current research findings, and discuss the implications for clinical practice.

Conclusion

The management of individuals with concurrent lung cancer and PE presents significant clinical challenges, requiring a comprehensive and individualized approach. Existing management strategies are not fully adequate and may lack the necessary rigor to address the complexities of these conditions. Ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial to advancing more effective and targeted treatment solutions for this high-risk patient population.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113svGKB]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to duration of anticoagulation (cancer-associated thrombosis), ACCP 2016 guidelines recommend to consider initiating extended anticoagulant therapy (with no scheduled stop date) in patients with DVT of the leg or PE and active cancer who have a high bleeding risk.

ASH 2021 VTE in cancer — incidental pulmonary embolism or SSPE: For patients with cancer and incidental (unsuspected) PE or SSPE, the panel suggests short-term (first 3–6 months) anticoagulation rather than observation, with a conditional recommendation and very low certainty in the evidence of effects. Clinicians should use clinical judgment and consider diagnostic certainty, chronicity (age of thrombus), extent of thrombosis, associated symptoms, and bleeding risks; the choice of anticoagulant should also depend on a patient's underlying risk for bleeding, and if therapeutic anticoagulation is warranted, the panel recommends the use of the same anticoagulants recommended for cancer-associated thrombosis.

### A systematic review of pulmonary embolism in patients with lung cancer [^116NnSty]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is increasingly recognized as causing significant morbidity and mortality in modern societies; however, little is known about PE in patients with lung cancer. We systematically reviewed Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases and selected 26 studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials, and 4 prospective, 18 retrospective cohort, and 2 case-control studies. Overall incidence of PE was 3.6%. Pulmonary embolism abbreviated survival in 2 studies when the diagnosis was synchronous with lung cancer. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, treatment, and surveillance are inconsistently reported. Clinical outcome data pertaining to this topic are limited and of overall poor methodologic quality.

### How I treat incidental pulmonary embolism [^1114hgCg]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

The identification of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography scans performed for indications other than identification of thromboembolism is a growing clinical problem that has not been adequately addressed by prospective treatment trials. The prevalence of incidentally detected PE ranges from 1% to 4% in unselected populations, with higher rates among hospital inpatients and patients with cancer. Current guidelines recommend using the same approach to type and duration of anticoagulation as is used for patients with suspected PE. Available data regarding the significance of symptomatic subsegmental PE (SSPE) are conflicting, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the appropriate treatment of incidentally detected SSPE, for which the data are sparse. Among cancer patients, the bulk of available data suggest that incidental SSPE is associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism and, when symptomatic, may adversely impact survival. Here, the topic is reviewed utilizing 3 clinical cases, each of which is followed by a discussion of salient features and then by treatment recommendations.

### Characteristics and risk factors for thrombocytopenia in malignancy patients with pulmonary embolism: a case control study [^114e4Vw1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are collectively recognized as venous thromboembolism (VTE), both of which are highly prevalent in patients with active malignancy. Conversely, malignancy increases the risk of VTE by ninefold. Consequently, VTE has become a major global health burden among malignancy patients. Notably, PE can also occur when a thrombus from a DVT dislodges and migrates to the pulmonary artery. Furthermore, VTE is the second leading cause of death in malignancy patients. More critically, diagnosing and treating PE in patients with concurrent malignancy is particularly challenging because PE symptoms are often nonspecific and may be masked by those of the underlying cancer. Despite its clinical significance, malignancy-associated PE has not received sufficient attention.

Thrombocytopenia is a common complication of PE in malignancy and is closely related to delayed PE treatment. Heparin is one of the main treatments for PE but can induce thrombocytopenia, which may contribute to PE recurrence. In fact, thrombocytopenia is highly prevalent in patients with malignant diseases and thrombosis, occurring in 22% of patients with solid tumors and 47% of those with hematologic malignancies. One study reported that 43% of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU also had thrombocytopenia, and these patients exhibited poorer prognosis and higher mortality. Thrombocytopenia lasting over 30 days is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of recurrent PE and DVT. Additionally, thrombocytopenia can be caused by various conventional treatments for malignant tumors, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and interventional therapy. However, hospitalized patients with malignant tumors are less likely to receive VTE prophylaxis than those without malignancy, as thrombocytopenia significantly increases bleeding risk. Among patients with hematologic malignancies who did not receive anticoagulant therapy, the 28-day mortality rate was 15%. Consequently, treating malignancy patients with PE and concurrent thrombocytopenia is challenging, and optimal management remains controversial.

The optimal anticoagulant treatment for malignancy-associated PE with concurrent thrombocytopenia remains uncertain, and additional clinical evidence is urgently needed. This study aimed to characterize thrombocytopenia in malignancy patients with PE and identify its risk factors, thereby providing further clinical insights for the management of this high-risk population.

### Research progress on the association between lung cancer and pulmonary embolism [^115UvGAL]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE), a form of venous thromboembolism, is a frequently observed complication in malignancies, with a notably high incidence in individuals with lung cancer. The presence of PE markedly reduces the quality of life and has a significant impact on the prognosis of those diagnosed with both lung cancer and PE. As a result, timely diagnosis and intervention are of paramount importance.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### Outcome of incidentally diagnosed pulmonary embolism in patients with malignancy [^115eaBz7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

With improvements in the quality of computed tomography (CT) examinations, pulmonary embolism is increasingly being detected incidentally in oncology patients undergoing routine cancer staging CT scans. The purpose of this review is to update current evidence on the prognosis of cancer patients diagnosed with incidental pulmonary embolism.

Recent Findings

Several recent observational studies have shed some light on the prognostic implications of diagnosing incidental pulmonary embolism in cancer patients. In general, anticoagulant treatment is initiated in these patients. Even during treatment, recurrent venous thromboembolic events may occur with a frequency that is comparable to cancer patients who have symptomatic pulmonary embolism. It has been demonstrated that the diagnosis of incidental pulmonary embolism is associated with adverse survival in cancer patients, and the long-term mortality rate in incidental pulmonary embolism patients seems to approach that of symptomatic pulmonary embolism patients.

Summary

Overall, the body of literature on patients with incidental pulmonary embolism is sparse and does not allow firm recommendations on the therapeutic approach to these patients. Yet, in the absence of data on the natural clinical course of these patients, and the presence of cohort studies suggesting that incidental pulmonary embolism may impact recurrent venous thromboembolism and mortality, current consensus is to treat these patients in the same manner as symptomatic patients.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^112aVqbB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

### Pulmonary embolism-related mortality in patients with cancer [^114ewmuZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US. However, over the past 2 decades, the rate of cancer-related deaths has declined, with an overall reduction of 33% since the 1990s. Such a trend is hypothesized to be due to the combination of population-based screening programs, early diagnosis, and major innovations in cancer treatments, including advanced surgical resection techniques and novel targeted therapies. As a growing population of patients with cancer are living longer, complications such as venous thromboembolism (VTE) are becoming more frequent. Epidemiological cohort studies suggest that 1 in every 4 VTE events is attributable to cancer. Furthermore, acute pulmonary embolism (PE) represents the second leading cause of death among patients with malignant neoplasms, after cancer itself. The incidence of acute PE within 1 year of the cancer diagnosis has risen from 1% to greater than 3%. This increase is hypothesized to stem from factors such as the aging of the oncology population, a growing proportion of individuals surviving with cancer, and the utilization of prothrombotic cancer therapies. Updated data on the association of acute PE with cancer may better inform thromboprophylaxis efforts and societal guidelines to protect this vulnerable population.

In the present investigation, we analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) dataset, with the aim of assessing the most recent PE-related mortality rates and trends in US patients with cancer. Additionally, to further characterize the observed trends, we also evaluated cancer incidence and related mortality over the same period, using the publicly available data from US Cancer Statistics (USCS).

### Cancer-associated unsuspected pulmonary embolism [^1153ETo9]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Clinically unsuspected pulmonary embolism (UPE) is frequently diagnosed in cancer patients undergoing routine computed tomography scans for staging purposes or treatment response evaluation. The reported incidence of UPE ranges from 1% to 5% which probably represents an underestimation. A significant proportion of cancer patients with UPE actually do have pulmonary embolism (PE) related symptoms. However, these can erroneously be attributed to the cancer itself or to cancer therapy leading to a delayed or missed diagnosis. The incidence of UPE is likely to increase further with the improvements of imaging techniques. Radiologic features of UPE appear similar to symptomatic PE with nearly half of the UPE located in central pulmonary arteries and one third involving both lungs. UPE in cancer patients is not a benign condition with rates of recurrent venous thromboembolic events, bleeding and a mortality rate comparable to cancer patients with symptomatic PE. Current guidelines suggest that UPE should receive similar initial and long-term anticoagulant treatment as for symptomatic PE. However, direct evidence regarding the treatment of UPE is scarce and treatment indications are largely derived from studies performed in cancer patients with symptomatic venous thromboembolism. Selected subgroups of cancer patients with UPE such as those with sub-segmental UPE may be treated conservatively by withholding anticoagulation and avoiding the associated bleeding risk, although this requires further evaluation.

### Pulmonary tumor embolism: a review of the literature [^112pymJc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Dyspnea in a patient with cancer may have several causes, including infection, thromboembolism, metastases, and therapeutically induced cardiopulmonary disease. Pulmonary tumor embolism is an uncommon cause. Occlusion of the pulmonary microvasculature by tumor cells and associated thrombi can produce a subacute and progressive clinical picture that resembles thromboembolic disease. Unfortunately, microscopic tumor embolism is recognized rarely before death because of difficulty in establishing the diagnosis. We provide a review of the literature about the evaluation and diagnosis of this rare clinical entity.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^114XpiYE]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Short-term (first 3–6 months) treatment for cancer patients with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) is supported by very-low-certainty evidence and a conditional recommendation: No systematic reviews or RCTs were identified and 9 observational studies met partial inclusion, with certainty judged very low for single or multiple SSPEs, so the panel relied on indirect evidence showing a reduction in recurrent VTE and suggesting that patients with single or multiple SSPEs may benefit from anticoagulation therapy (rather than observation) when recurrence risk is moderate/high and bleeding risk is lower. The panel considered major bleeding risk probably moderate, citing cancer patients with VTE on LMWH for up to 6 months with a risk of 7.7% versus 1.8% (1.1–2.6%) in noncancer PE cohorts, and despite high uncertainty concluded the balance of effects probably favors short-term treatment vs observation. Accordingly, the guideline makes a conditional recommendation for short-term treatment over observation for patients with single or multiple SSPEs and identifies this as a research priority in cancer patients with SSPEs.

### Rivaroxaban vs Dalteparin in cancer-associated thromboembolism: a randomized trial [^114LnNDF]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an alternative to low-molecular-weight heparin for treating cancer-associated VTE.

Research Question

Is rivaroxaban as efficient and safe as dalteparin to treat patients with cancer-associated VTE?

Study Design and Methods

In a randomized open-label noninferiority trial, patients with active cancer who had proximal DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), or both were assigned randomly to therapeutic doses of rivaroxaban or dalteparin for 3 months. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of recurrent VTE, a composite of symptomatic or incidental DVT or PE, and worsening of pulmonary vascular or venous obstruction at 3 months.

Results

Of 158 randomized patients, 74 and 84 patients were assigned to receive rivaroxaban and dalteparin, respectively. Mean age was 69.4 years, and 115 patients (76.2%) had metastatic disease. The primary outcome occurred in 4 and 6 patients in the rivaroxaban and dalteparin groups, respectively (both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations: cumulative incidence, 6.4% vs 10.1%; subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.21–2.66). Major bleeding occurred in 1 and 3 patients in the rivaroxaban and dalteparin groups, respectively (cumulative incidence, 1.4% vs 3.7%; SHR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.04–3.43). Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 9 and 8 patients in the rivaroxaban and dalteparin groups, respectively (cumulative incidence, 12.2% vs 9.8%; SHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.49–3.26). Overall, 19 patients (25.7%) and 20 patients (23.8%) died in the rivaroxaban and dalteparin groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.56–1.97).

Interpretation

In this trial comparing rivaroxaban and dalteparin in the treatment of cancer-associated VTE, the number of patients was insufficient to reach the predefined criteria for noninferiority, but efficacy and safety results were consistent with those previously reported with DOACs. An updated meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing DOACs with low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with cancer-associated VTE is provided.

### Research progress on the association between lung cancer and pulmonary embolism [^115poyEf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Incidence and prognostic implications of PE as an early indicator of malignancy

In the absence of identifiable risk factors, a significant proportion of individuals diagnosed with PE are subsequently found to have malignancies within one year. Unexplained PE may thus serve as an early marker of malignant tumors. A study by Li et al. reported that 6 patients experienced PE within 6 months prior to their cancer diagnosis. Similarly, in a study by Cui et al. 30 patients were diagnosed with cancer during hospitalization for PE. Moreover, 47 patients were diagnosed with PE following the identification of a malignancy, while 18 individuals experienced PE prior to their cancer diagnosis. Among these 18 cases, 3 developed PE within 3 months of the cancer diagnosis, 5 between 3 and 6 months, and 10 more than 6 months before tumor detection.

The 2018 Chinese guidelines for PE emphasize the importance of investigating the underlying cause during the diagnostic and therapeutic process. In cases of VTE without an identifiable cause, close follow-up is recommended. If rheumatic immunological diseases and myeloproliferative disorders are excluded, heightened vigilance for potential malignancies is advised. Malignancies, as a prominent acquired risk factor, can induce a hypercoagulable state. In cases where tumor symptoms are not evident, this hypercoagulability may be the initial manifestation, particularly when persistent.

For the management of acute PE, a 3 month course of therapy is generally recommended following successful initial treatment. However, after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy, secondary recurrence may occur. In a follow-up study of individuals with acute PE, those with secondary recurrences were observed to develop lung malignancies within one to three years of continued monitoring.

The occurrence of PE prior to a lung cancer diagnosis presents a significant clinical risk. Maintaining vigilance and ensuring thorough follow-up in cases of refractory PE can facilitate the early detection of lung cancer, allowing for prompt diagnosis and intervention, which may improve patient outcomes.

### Management of dyspnea in advanced cancer: ASCO guideline [^114PvECQ]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — Treatment of underlying causes of dyspnea in advanced cancer states that Patients with potentially reversible, common etiologies of dyspnea such as pleural effusion, pneumonia, airway obstruction, anemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, or treatment-induced pneumonitis should be given goal-concordant treatment(s) consistent with their wishes, prognosis, and overall health status (good practice statement). Patients with dyspnea because of underlying malignancy (eg, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, atelectasis because of large pulmonary mass, malignant pleural effusion) may benefit from cancer-directed treatment if consistent with their wishes, prognosis, and overall health status (good practice statement). Patients with underlying comorbidities such as COPD or heart failure should have the management of these conditions optimized (good practice statement).

### Challenging anticoagulation cases: a case of incidental subsegmental pulmonary embolism in a patient with cancer [^116HUdJi]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Cancer therapy and progress in quality of imaging technologies for cancer surveillance and staging are in cause for the increase incidence of smaller incidental pulmonary embolism (PE). The clinical significance of incidental subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) is hard to define, balancing between possible false positive result, hypercoagulability signal, and truly venous thromboembolism (VTE) event. Evidence for optimal management of such findings are largely extrapolated from symptomatic SSPE in non-cancer patients and from symptomatic, more proximal PE in cancer patients. Current practice guidelines vary but some suggest withholding anticoagulation in selected patients. However, most SSPEs, incidental or not, should be treated as any other cancer-associated PE due to likely similar prognosis. Choice and duration of anticoagulation are extended from existing knowledge on more proximal PE.

### How to choose an appropriate anticoagulant for cancer-associated thrombosis [^117Y1sxF]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolic disease can be a fatal complication of cancer. Despite advances in prevention, thousands of patients require treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) each year. Guidelines have advocated low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as the preferred anticoagulant for CAT for years, based on clinical trial data showing LMWH to be associated with a lower risk of recurrent thrombosis when compared with vitamin K antagonists. However, the potentially painful, subcutaneously administered LMWH injections can be expensive, and clinical practice has not been consistent with guideline recommendations. Recently, studies have compared LMWH to the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the management of CAT. Based on promising trial results outlined in this review, DOACs are now preferred anticoagulants for CAT occurring in patients without gastric or gastroesophageal lesions. For patients with gastrointestinal cancers, who may be at higher risk of hemorrhage with the DOACs, LMWH remains the anticoagulant of choice. Applying the latest data from this rapidly evolving field to care for diverse patient groups can be challenging. This article provides an evidence-based review of outpatient anticoagulant selection for lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in the setting of cancer, and takes into account special populations with cancer.

### Outpatient management of cancer-associated pulmonary embolism: a post-hoc analysis from the HOME-PE trial [^111cDZpr]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cancer-related pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with poor prognosis. Some decision rules identifying patients eligible for home treatment categorize cancer patients at high risk of complications, precluding home treatment. We sought to assess the effectiveness and the safety of outpatient management of patients with low-risk cancer-associated PE.

Methods

In the HOME-PE trial, hemodynamically stable patients with symptomatic PE were randomized to either triaging with Hestia criteria or sPESI score. We analyzed 3 groups of low-risk PE patients: 47 with active cancer treated at home (group 1), 691 without active cancer treated at home (group 2), and 33 with active cancer as the only sPESI criterion qualifying them for hospitalization (group 3). The main outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and all-cause death within 30 days after randomization.

Results

Patients treated at home had composite outcome rates of 4.3% (2/47) for those with cancer vs. 1.0% (7/691) for those without (odds ratio (OR) 4.98, 95%CI 1.15–21.49). Patients with cancer had rates of complications of 4.3% when treated at home vs. 3.0% (1/33) when hospitalized (OR 1.19, 95%CI 0.15–9.47). In multivariable analysis, active cancer was associated with an increased risk of complications for patients treated at home (OR 7.95; 95%CI 1.48–42.82). For patients with active cancer, home treatment was not associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.19, 95%CI 0.15–9.74).

Conclusions

Among patients treated at home, active cancer was a risk factor for complications, but among patients with active cancer, home treatment was not associated with adverse outcomes.

### Targeted anti-cancer agents and risk of venous thromboembolism [^111Ttd5z]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common complication among patients with cancer and is a significant cause of death in this population. Coinciding with improved cancer outcomes, the overall 1-year incidence of VTE after cancer diagnosis has risen from 1% to over 3% in recent decades.

Several factors may influence the VTE risk in cancer patients. Cancer is a well-known risk factor for thromboembolic events, increasing the risk of developing VTE approximately 9-fold in comparison to the general population, with heterogeneous risks according to cancer types and stages. Other established risk factors include patients' characteristics (demographic characteristics, comorbidities) and treatment-related factors such as certain types of chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and central venous catheters.

In the past two decades, various targeted anti-cancer agents have been developed, leading to a paradigm shift in anti-neoplastic treatment towards more personalized cancer treatment. In clinical oncology, these agents have dramatically revolutionized patient care, resulting in significant improvements in treatment responses and overall survival of patients. Increased survival due to the therapies is, over time, likely to be associated with an increase in events as patients will have longer exposure to other cancer-related prothrombotic factors. Targeted therapies are a heterogeneous group of drugs, administrable either orally or intravenously, that comprise, among others, monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), anti-hormonal agents, and immune regulatory molecules. Available literature suggests, often with modest evidence, a potential prothrombotic effect for certain classes of targeted therapy. In addition, recent data have highlighted significant rates of thrombotic complications in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI).

This review comprehensively summarizes the current evidence on risk profiles and potential mechanisms of thrombosis in cancer patients treated with targeted therapies, highlighting the limitations of existing data and exploring possible future perspectives.

### Does clinical method mask significant VTE-related mortality and morbidity in malignant disease? [^116xPaow]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

A retrospective case–control study of 59 patients with incidental PE showed that patients with PE were significantly more likely to be fatigued (odds ratio of 4.82 (P = 0.0002)). Breathlessness, a classic symptom of PE, was seen in a minority of cases (22 vs 8%, P = 0.02). However, as this study included cancer patients at different stages of diagnosis and treatment, it is difficult to discern which symptoms are due to cancer or to its treatment, especially when the symptoms may be atypical of PE and the time of embolism is unknown.

### Acute pulmonary embolism. part 2: treatment [^112ryiwy]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism (PE) varies widely, ranging from only limited symptoms to severe cardiogenic shock. Treatment of PE comprises initial therapy — with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin — and long-term treatment, most commonly with vitamin-K antagonists (VKAs). Methods of risk stratification, to determine whether a patient will benefit from thrombolysis, are currently under investigation. However, at present, insufficient evidence exists that hemodynamically stable patients who demonstrate echocardiographic right ventricular strain (submassive PE) benefit from thrombolysis. By contrast, thrombolysis is a widely accepted treatment strategy for patients with hemodynamic shock (massive PE). The duration of VKA treatment is commonly 3–12 months and depends on the type of PE and on the balance between the risks of recurrent PE, major bleeding, and the patient's preference. In patients with a malignancy, treatment with LMWH during the first 6 months after diagnosis of PE is recommended. Several new oral anticoagulants, such as factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors, are now being investigated. For prevention of recurrent PE in situations where anticoagulation is contraindicated, a temporary inferior vena cava filter might be useful. Some patients with PE can be safely treated at home, but few outcome studies in this setting have been published.

### Cancer in males and risk of venous thromboembolism [^116UGMv5]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication associated with increased mortality in cancer patients. Adequate treatment of thrombotic complications increases survival in these patients although additional complications such as thrombus progression with pulmonary embolism and bleeding events are common. The incidence of types of cancer as well as malignancy-associated VTE varies between genders. This article focuses on cancers more common in male patients and reviews the risk of VTE with special regard to types of cancer and anticancer therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111CRN3P]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg or pulmonary embolism (PE) without cancer — anticoagulant selection: For long-term (first 3 months) therapy, we suggest dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (all Grade 2B), and for patients not treated with these agents, we suggest VKA therapy over LMWH (Grade 2C). Remarks specify that initial parenteral anticoagulation is given before dabigatran and edoxaban, is not given before rivaroxaban and apixaban, and is overlapped with VKA therapy, and in patients with VTE and cancer ("cancer-associated thrombosis"), we still suggest LMWH over VKA.

### Approach to the management of incidental venous thromboembolic events in patients with cancer [^111eoBGx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent clinical complication of cancer and its treatment. Although much of the epidemiologic data regarding this complication have been based on symptomatic events, the use of multidetector row CT scanner technology has led to increased identification of VTE on scans ordered primarily for staging or restaging of malignancy. These incidentally discovered VTEs are variously referred to in the literature as incidental, asymptomatic, unexpected, or unsuspected VTE. A recent guidance paper by the Hemostasis and Malignancy Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis provided recommendations regarding this terminology (now termed incidental) and reporting of incidental VTE for clinical trials. A growing number of retrospective and case-controlled reports have described the prevalence, prognostic implications, and treatment options for these incidentally discovered VTE events, and have reported similar clinical outcomes for patients with incidental and symptomatic VTE. Because most reported patients with incidental VTE have been treated in a manner similar to those with symptomatic events, the present recommendations, except in rare circumstances, support the use of standard anticoagulation in the management of incidental deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

### Pulmonary embolism-related mortality in patients with cancer [^115G4r3f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 60% of cancer deaths in the US are associated with potentially reversible risk factors, including tobacco, alcohol, radiation, occupational exposures, infectious diseases, obesity, and physical inactivity — many of which also predispose individuals to PE. Additionally, cancer therapies that enhance survival, such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies can increase the risk of VTE. Furthermore, complications like infections, cytopenia, cardiomyopathy, and organ dysfunction significantly complicate PE treatment and impact overall survival.

Nonmalignant-related factors may also contribute to rising PE-related mortality among US patients with cancer. Increased diagnoses of acute PE, including in asymptomatic patients undergoing computed tomography scans for other reasons, may lead to more frequent coding for PE. Additionally, as patients with cancer live longer due to advancements in treatment, they accumulate comorbidities associated with VTE — such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, lung disease, and chronic kidney disease — thereby increasing the risk of PE-related death.

As evidenced by the complementary analysis performed using USCS, the observed PE-related mortality trends in patients with cancer coincided with an increase in the absolute numbers of new cancer diagnoses (12% from 2011 to 2019) and related deaths (4.4% from 2011 to 2020). However, in the same period, the age-adjusted mortality rate of cancer decreased. This finding suggests that indeed more patients with advanced and high-risk cancers may live longer, making them more prone to developing and dying from PE. Furthermore, the improved survival rates in individuals with cancer may favor exposure to additional contributing risks that could heighten susceptibility to PE, including acute and chronic complications of oncological therapy and accrual of chronic medical illnesses which may potentially increase susceptibility to PE and impact PE-related mortality.

We observed a relative increase in PE-related mortality in adults aged 15 to 64 years. We have previously demonstrated a similar increase in total US PE-related mortality in young adults. This observation may be attributed to the rising incidence of cancer in early adulthood in the US. Alternatively, increased recognition of PE as a potential complication of cancer and cancer-directed therapy, even in younger patients, may result in greater recognition and attribution of mortality to the diagnosis.

### Effect of testing for cancer on cancer-or venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality and morbidity in people with unprovoked VTE [^113bzrnc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancer or VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 11 July 2018. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for identifying cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

No new studies were identified for this 2018 update. In total, four studies with 1644 participants are included. Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests including computed tomography (CT) scanning versus tests at the physician's discretion, while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, the quality of the evidence, as assessed according to GRADE, was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the quality of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The quality of the evidence was downgraded further as detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events. When comparing extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.26; low-quality evidence). One study (201 participants) showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced at diagnosis in extensively tested participants than in participants in the control group. In total, 9/13 participants diagnosed with cancer in the extensively tested group had a T1 or T2 stage malignancy compared to 2/10 participants diagnosed with cancer in the control group (OR 5.00, 95% CI 1.05 to 23.76; P = 0.04; low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in detection of advanced stages between extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion: one participant in the extensively tested group had stage T3 compared with four participants in the control group (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.28; P = 0.22; low-quality evidence). In addition, extensively tested participants were diagnosed earlier than control group (mean: 1 month with extensive tests versus 11.6 months with tests at physician's discretion to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Extensive testing did not increase the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.93; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.50; low-quality evidence). Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life. When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT screening versus standard testing alone, standard testing plus PET/CT screening was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.04; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.66; moderate-quality evidence), cancer-related mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; moderate-quality evidence) or VTE-related morbidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.17; 854 participants; 1 study; P = 0.96; moderate-quality evidence). Regarding stage of cancer, there was no clear difference for detection of early (OR 1.78, 95% 0.51 to 6.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 0.37; low-quality evidence) or advanced (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 1.00; low-quality evidence) stages of cancer. There was also no clear difference in the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.20; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.09; moderate-quality evidence). Time to cancer diagnosis was 4.2 months in the standard testing group and 4.0 months in the standard testing plus PET/CT group (P = 0.88). Neither study measured VTE-related mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Specific testing for cancer in people with unprovoked VTE may lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer- or VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results could be consistent with either benefit or no benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

### Testing low-risk patients for suspected pulmonary embolism: a decision analysis [^115VV5KW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) identifies low-risk patients who are treated in the emergency department for suspected pulmonary embolism and for whom testing may be deferred. The purpose of this study is to develop a decision model to determine whether certain elements not included in the PERC methodology could better estimate the testing threshold for pulmonary embolism (ie, the pretest probability below which a patient should not be tested for pulmonary embolism). In addition, we determine which risks and benefits of pulmonary embolism evaluation and treatment have the greatest effect on the testing threshold.

Methods

We built decision models of low-risk patients with suspected pulmonary embolism, as determined by the PERC. We obtained model inputs from the literature or by using clinical judgment when data were unavailable. One-way sensitivity analysis derived the testing threshold, and 2-way sensitivity analysis was used to determine the main drivers of the testing threshold.

Results

We found an average testing threshold of 1.4% across all age and sex cohorts. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that risk of major bleeding from anticoagulation, mortality from contrast-induced renal failure, risk of cancer from computed tomography scan, and mortality from both treated and untreated pulmonary embolism had the greatest effects on the testing threshold.

Conclusion

We found a testing threshold for the PERC similar to that calculated by the Pauker and Kassirer method, using somewhat different assumptions. The 5 major drivers for the testing threshold are variables for which there is a paucity of literature to assess accurately for low-risk patients.

### Effect of testing for cancer on cancer-and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality and morbidity in people with unprovoked VTE [^1148PiUL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (16 February 2017). In addition, the CIS searched the Cochrane Register of Studies CENTRAL (2017, Issue 1). We searched trials registries (February 2017) and checked the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion in this review. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

Four studies with 1644 participants met the inclusion criteria (two studies in the original review and two in this update). Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion) while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion, the quality of the evidence was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the quality of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias.

Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life. When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT screening versus standard testing alone, standard testing plus PET/CT screening was consistent with either a benefit or no benefit on all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.04; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.66; moderate quality evidence), cancer-related mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; moderate quality evidence) or VTE-related morbidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.17; 854 participants; 1 study; P = 0.96; moderate quality evidence). With regards to stage of cancer, there was no clear difference for detection of early (OR 1.78, 95% 0.51 to 6.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 0.37; low quality evidence) or advanced (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 1.00; low quality evidence) stages of cancer. There was also no clear difference in the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.20; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.09; moderate quality evidence). Time to cancer diagnosis was 4.2 months in the standard testing group and 4.0 months in the standard testing plus PET/CT group (P = 0.88). Neither study measured VTE-related mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Testing for cancer in people with unprovoked VTE may lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer and VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results could be consistent with either benefit or no benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

### Rivaroxaban for 18 months versus 6 months in patients with cancer and acute low-risk pulmonary embolism: an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (ONCO PE trial) [^114FZq1J]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-Up

The mandatory follow-up visits were planned at 3, 6, and 18 months, with additional assessments for routine clinical care as needed. At the 6-month visit after the diagnosis (between 151 and 209 days), the 6-month rivaroxaban treatment group stopped rivaroxaban, and the 18-month rivaroxaban treatment group continued rivaroxaban. During the follow-up period, the anticoagulation status was obtained, including the discontinuation and initiation of anticoagulants, along with the reasons and types of anticoagulants. Persistent rivaroxaban discontinuation was defined as a discontinuation of rivaroxaban according to the study protocol or lasting for > 14 days for any reason. To evaluate the potential difference in the frequency of conducting contrast CT scans between the 2 groups, we collected all contrast CT scans studies during the follow-up period. To ensure compliance with rivaroxaban, the study protocol had predetermined the detailed follow-up methodology at each institution. A full detailed follow-up methodology is provided in.

Primary and Secondary End Points

The primary end point was recurrent VTE at 18 months. Recurrent VTE included PE with or without deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was defined as the appearance of new or worsening thrombus images in the pulmonary arteries and deep veins on imaging tests (ultrasonography of lower-limb vein system, CT examinations, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy, pulmonary angiography, and venography) regardless of symptoms. Recurrent VTE included incidentally diagnosed PE or DVT when imaging examinations were performed, usually for follow-up of cancer. In the study protocol, follow-up imaging examinations for VTE were not recommended unless recurrent VTE was clinically suspected.

The major secondary end point was a major bleeding event at 18 months. Major bleeding was defined according to the definition of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria, which consisted of fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, and bleeding causing a reduction in the hemoglobin level by ≥ 2 g/dL or leading to a transfusion of ≥ 2 units of whole blood or red cells. Other secondary end points were death resulting from all causes, symptomatic recurrent VTE events, and all clinically relevant bleeding events at 18 months. A list of the prespecified secondary end points and criteria for adjudication of all the outcomes is provided in. The members of an independent clinical events committee who were unaware of the study group assignments adjudicated all the suspected outcome events and causes of death, as well as the severity of the major bleeding events, using a prespecified criteria.

### Rivaroxaban for 18 months versus 6 months in patients with cancer and acute low-risk pulmonary embolism: an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (ONCO PE trial) [^114hyyNC]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Many patients with cancer can live longer as a result of advancements in the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and complications during the course of cancer treatment have become increasingly clinically important from the perspective of cardio-oncology. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the major complications in patients with cancer.PE has been reported to be found in 3.6% of routine computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest for the evaluation of cancer, and patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE, including incidental and minor PE, have become quite common in the current daily clinical practice. PE has a long-term risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), which could be prevented by anticoagulation therapy. However, data are limited on patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE, and the optimal anticoagulation strategies for these patients have been a matter of active debate.

The current international guidelines recommend extended anticoagulation therapy beyond 6 months for patients with PE with active cancer. – However, several guidelines weakly recommend the same management strategies for patients with incidental PE, and minor PEas for patients with an evidence level of uncertainty. A previous observational study showed that patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE such as incidental PE were at a relatively high risk of recurrent VTE, which suggested that these patients might benefit from prolonged anticoagulation therapy. Given that there has been no randomized clinical trial on this issue, we conducted the ONCO PE trial (Optimal Duration of Anticoagulation Therapy for Low-Risk Pulmonary Embolism Patients With Cancer) to investigate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy beyond 6 months by comparing the 2 different treatment durations of the oral factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban for patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE.

### Safety of outpatient management of cancer-associated pulmonary embolism: a retrospective study [^114SXHQg]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Included patients had a visit to an ED and an International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for cancer (diagnosed within 5 years before the ED visit), a diagnosis of PE, and had undergone a computed tomography scan on the same day. Chart review was done to confirm the diagnosis, collect the patients' baseline characteristics, information on outpatient management and outcomes of interest. The primary outcome measure was the rate of return to the ED for a venous thromboembolism (VTE)-or anticoagulation-related complication within 7 days of PE diagnosis (i.e. recurrent/worsening VTE, or bleeding). Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality at 7 and 30 days, and the rate of return to the ED for a VTE-or an anticoagulation-related complication at 30 days. We used previously described definitions for recurrent VTEand the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definitions for major bleeding, and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. Kaplan-Meier cumulative rate estimates were calculated for outcomes of interest along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The study was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board.

Certainty in the evidence of effects was judged as low owing to very serious indirectness. The panel determined that there is low certainty in the evidence for a net health benefit and believed that long-term anticoagulation for secondary prophylaxis can be discontinued when patients are no longer at high risk for recurrent VTEs, with the decision dependent on factors such as cancer type, prognosis, periodic reevaluation of thrombosis and bleeding risks, comorbidities, cancer status, costs, and patient preferences and values.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^1116cPiy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

### Rivaroxaban for 18 months versus 6 months in patients with cancer and acute low-risk pulmonary embolism: an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (ONCO PE trial) [^1154YEWW]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy for patients with cancer and acute low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) is clinically relevant, but evidence is lacking. Prolonged anticoagulation therapy could have a potential benefit for prevention of thrombotic events; however, it could also increase the risk of bleeding.

Methods

In a multicenter, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, randomized clinical trial at 32 institutions in Japan, we randomly assigned patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE of the simplified version of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score of 1, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either an 18-month or a 6-month rivaroxaban treatment. The primary end point was recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 18 months. The major secondary end point was major bleeding at 18 months according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. The primary hypothesis was that an 18-month treatment was superior to a 6-month treatment in terms of the primary end point.

Results

From February 2021 to March 2023, 179 patients were randomized, and after the exclusion of one patient who withdrew consent, 178 were included in the intention-to-treat population: 89 patients in the 18-month rivaroxaban group and 89 in the 6-month rivaroxaban group. The mean age was 65.7 years; 47% of the patients were men, and 12% had symptoms of PE at baseline. The primary end point of recurrent VTE occurred in 5 of the 89 patients (5.6%) in the 18-month rivaroxaban group and in 17 of the 89 (19.1%) in the 6-month rivaroxaban group (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09–0.72]; P = 0.01). Among 22 recurrent VTE, 5 patients presented with a symptomatic recurrent VTE; recurrent PE occurred in 11 patients, including 2 with main and 4 with lobar PEs; and recurrent deep vein thrombosis was seen in 11 patients, including 3 with proximal deep vein thromboses. The major secondary end point of major bleeding occurred in 7 of the 89 patients (7.8%) in the 18-month rivaroxaban group and in 5 of the 89 patients (5.6%) in the 6-month rivaroxaban group (odds ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.44–4.70]; P = 0.55).

Conclusions

In patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE of the simplified version of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score of 1, the 18-month rivaroxaban treatment was superior to the 6-month rivaroxaban treatment with respect to recurrent VTE events.

### Pulmonary embolism-related mortality in patients with cancer [^111BwyCi]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that although mortality rates in patients with cancer declined, PE-related mortality in such patients increased from 2011 to 2020. Concerning trends included rising PE-related mortality in younger patients aged 15 to 64 years, Hispanic or Latinx, non-Hispanic or Latinx Black or African American, and non-Hispanic or Latinx White patients, and the Southern region of US. Recognition and confirmation of such patterns may inform further research into thromboprophylaxis and treatment of PE as a complication of cancer and cancer-directed therapy.

### Cancer-associated thrombosis [^112w8EB6]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolic events are common in patients with malignancy, producing both morbidity and mortality. Although the underlying mechanisms by which cancer might promote a procoagulant state are multifaceted and incompletely understood, recent translational research has significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship between cancer and thrombosis. The occurrence of a thromboembolic event in a patient with an active malignancy should be regarded as a life-threatening complication, and decisions regarding prevention and treatment are usually complex. Outcomes may be improved by an evidence-based approach to management with consideration of practice guidelines.

### Rivaroxaban for 18 months versus 6 months in patients with cancer and acute low-risk pulmonary embolism: an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (ONCO PE trial) [^115xvXHD]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The ONCO PE trial, which enrolled patients with active cancer who were newly diagnosed with acute low-risk PE without other score components of sPESI than cancer, showed that 18 months of rivaroxaban treatment was superior to 6 months of rivaroxaban treatment with respect to recurrent VTE events, whereas the longer duration of rivaroxaban treatment was not associated with a higher incidence of major bleeding.

The incidence of acute low-risk PE, including incidental PE, in patients with cancer was reported to be increasing over time partly as a result of the frequent use of CT for the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer and improvements in the CT scanning technology. – A recent study reported that approximately half of PEs in patients with cancer were diagnosed incidentally through routine CT scanning for cancer staging or the evaluation of the cancer treatment response. The clinical relevance of acute low-risk PE, including incidental and minor PE, could still remain debatable. Historically, acute low-risk PE has been considered a more benign condition of PE than symptomatic or nonminor PE. However, several previous observational studies have reported that incidental PE has a risk of recurrent VTE similar to that of symptomatic PE, suggesting a potentially higher risk of thrombosis events in patients with than in those without incidental PE. Based on those findings, current international guidelines weakly recommend the same anticoagulation strategies for incidental PE and minor PE as for symptomatic PE. However, because of the lack of solid evidence from randomized clinical trials, the optimal anticoagulation strategies for patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE have remained controversial, leading to wide variations in anticoagulation strategies. No randomized clinical trials have evaluated the optimal duration of anticoagulation therapy for these patients, and it remains uncertain whether anticoagulation therapy should be extended beyond 6 months.

### Trends in pulmonary embolism mortality in cancer patients in the United States from 1999–2022 – A CDC wonder database study [^112DFfnX]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

There is an increased risk for PE development in cancer patients, driven by cancer-specific pathophysiological mechanisms, treatment-related side effects, and overlapping risk factors such as immobility and hypercoagulability. Previous studies indicate that across all cancer subtypes, patients presenting with cardiovascular presentations, including PE, have a significantly increased risk of mortality compared to patients without cancer. Of patients presenting to emergency rooms for cardiovascular complications, cancer patients were more likely to present with PE than other CVD complications, making the presentation to the ED due to PE three times more common than in noncancer patients.

It is also important to note the rise in cancer immunotherapy treatment from 2010 to 2021 following its FDA-approval for 19 cancer subtypes. Cancer therapies, particularly immunotherapies, can increase the risk of thromboembolism. It is possible the increase in immunotherapy would lead to the sharp 2016 increase of overall PE-related mortality. Additionally, these advancements in cancer therapies are prolonging survival which heightens the possibility of patients developing comorbidities that increase their risk of PEs and PE-related death. Factors like obesity and cardiovascular disease increased in prevalence during this time period and are tied to PE etiology. It is also important to note that literature suggests patients with PE receive advanced therapy such as systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed interventions, and surgical embolectomy less than patients without PE. This would contribute to the disparity in mortality between cancer and noncancer patients with PE. Our findings demonstrate a clear need for further identification of risk factors to relieve the burden of PEs, particularly in the cancer patient population.

Both genders parallel the overall mortality trend with a steady increase until a notable increase in 2016. However, throughout the entire time period, males had a higher mortality rate than females. This was an unexpected finding, as women are generally more likely to be in a hypercoagulable state, especially when diagnosed with cancer, which can lead to a PE. A previous study indicates women have higher awareness of the clinical signs and symptoms of PEs. This could account for prompt medical attention of female patients, lowering their mortality rate. The same study demonstrates men have decreased awareness for the signs of PEs which could lengthen the time it takes to receive proper care, heightening male mortality. Current literature indicates there is no gender-based difference in severity of PE or management. Our findings suggest, along with previous studies there is a continued need to increase education on the signs and symptoms of PEs for all patients, particularly with a focus on male cancer patients.

### Successful management of hemodynamic instability secondary to saddle pulmonary embolism-induced cardiac arrest using VA-ECMO in advanced malignancy with brain metastases [^115F3kXE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Saddle pulmonary embolism (SPE) represents a rare type of venous thromboembolism that frequently causes circulation collapse and sudden death. While venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has been well established as a salvage treatment for SPE-induced circulatory shock, it is infrequently administered in patients with advanced malignancy, especially those with brain metastases, given the potential bleeding complications and an uncertain prognosis. As far, there are rare case reports regarding the successful management of hemodynamic instability secondary to SPE-induced cardiac arrest using VA-ECMO in advanced malignancy patients with brain metastases.

Case presentation

A 65-year-old woman presenting with cough and waist discomfort who had a history of lung cancer with brain metastases was admitted to the hospital to receive chemoradiotherapy. She suffered sudden cardiac arrest during hospitalization and returned to spontaneous circulation after receiving a 10-min high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Pulmonary embolism was suspected due to the collapsed hemodynamics and a distended right ventricle identified by echocardiography. Subsequent computed tomographic pulmonary angiography revealed a massive saddle thrombus straddling the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk. VA-ECMO with adjusted-dose systemic heparinization was initiated to rescue the unstable hemodynamics despite receiving thrombolytic therapy with alteplase. Immediately afterward, the hemodynamic status of the patient stabilized rapidly. VA-ECMO was successfully discontinued within 72 h of initiation without any clotting or bleeding complications. She was weaned off invasive mechanical ventilation on the 6th day of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and discharged from the ICU 3 days later with good neurological function.

Conclusion

VA-ECMO may be a 'bridging' therapy to circulation recovery during reperfusion therapy for SPE-induced hemodynamic collapse in malignancy patients with brain metastases.

Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (combination pharmacological plus mechanical vs pharmacological alone) — evidence scope and outcomes assessed are summarized. The guideline states, "We identified 7 systematic reviews addressing this question", and "we identified 19 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria and measured outcomes relevant to this context", with "Seven included observational data on early postoperative population of patients with cancer (range, 4–50% across trials)". Outcomes included mortality and thromboembolism: "Eight studies reported the effect of the combination of pharmacological and mechanical thromboprophylaxis compared with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis alone on risk of mortality", "Eleven studies reported the effect on the development of symptomatic PEs", "9 studies reported the effect on the development of any PE", and "Eight studies reported data on any proximal DVT". Safety and procedural outcomes were also captured: "Seven studies reported the effect of the combination pharmacological and mechanical thromboprophylaxis compared with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis alone on the risk of major bleeding", and "2 studies reported the effect on the risk of reoperation". An additional trial was identified in updating, but "the panel decided not to include the trial".

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113cAQFs]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We update recommendations on 12 topics that were in the 9th edition of these guidelines, and address 3 new topics.

Methods

We generate strong (Grade 1) and weak (Grade 2) recommendations based on high- (Grade A), moderate- (Grade B), and low- (Grade C) quality evidence.

Results

For VTE and no cancer, as long-term anticoagulant therapy, we suggest dabigatran (Grade 2B), rivaroxaban (Grade 2B), apixaban (Grade 2B), or edoxaban (Grade 2B) over vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy, and suggest VKA therapy over low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; Grade 2C). For VTE and cancer, we suggest LMWH over VKA (Grade 2B), dabigatran (Grade 2C), rivaroxaban (Grade 2C), apixaban (Grade 2C), or edoxaban (Grade 2C). We have not changed recommendations for who should stop anticoagulation at 3 months or receive extended therapy. For VTE treated with anticoagulants, we recommend against an inferior vena cava filter (Grade 1B). For DVT, we suggest not using compression stockings routinely to prevent PTS (Grade 2B). For subsegmental pulmonary embolism and no proximal DVT, we suggest clinical surveillance over anticoagulation with a low risk of recurrent VTE (Grade 2C), and anticoagulation over clinical surveillance with a high risk (Grade 2C). We suggest thrombolytic therapy for pulmonary embolism with hypotension (Grade 2B), and systemic therapy over catheter-directed thrombolysis (Grade 2C). For recurrent VTE on a non-LMWH anticoagulant, we suggest LMWH (Grade 2C); for recurrent VTE on LMWH, we suggest increasing the LMWH dose (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Of 54 recommendations included in the 30 statements, 20 were strong and none was based on high-quality evidence, highlighting the need for further research.

Combined mechanical plus pharmacological thromboprophylaxis — among hospitalized medical patients with cancer compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone, benefits were judged small with very low certainty for mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81–1.22; ARR, 1 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 24 fewer to 27 more per 1000) and pulmonary embolism (PE; RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.30–1.58; ARR, 3 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 8 fewer to 6 more per 1000), while major bleeding may increase but was judged trivial (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 0.30–26.70; ARI, 19 more per 1000; 95% CI, 7 fewer to 265 more per 1000) and "the risk of bleeding is unlikely to be increased by adding mechanical prophylaxis to anticoagulation". The panel determined that, based on very low certainty, "the balance of effects probably does not favor the intervention or the comparison" and that "cost-effectiveness probably favors pharmacological prophylaxis alone", though "a combination of pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis may be considered for selected hospitalized medical patients with cancer who are considered at very high risk for VTE (eg, patients with cancer with sustained and prolonged immobilization)".

### International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer [^1117NJHA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines addressing the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients are heterogeneous and their implementation has been suboptimal worldwide.

Objectives

To establish a common international consensus addressing practical, clinically relevant questions in this setting.

Methods

An international consensus working group of experts was set up to develop guidelines according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system.

Results

For the initial treatment of established VTE: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended [1B]; fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be also used [2D]; thrombolysis may only be considered on a case-by-case basis [Best clinical practice (Guidance)]; vena cava filters (VCF) may be considered if contraindication to anticoagulation or pulmonary embolism recurrence under optimal anticoagulation; periodic reassessment of contraindications to anticoagulation is recommended and anticoagulation should be resumed when safe; VCF are not recommended for primary VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients [Guidance]. For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A]; idraparinux is not recommended [2C]; after 3–6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA; (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended; pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12–2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7–10 days; there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A]; there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C]; use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A]; extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B]; the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance]; mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B]; for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance]; in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B]; primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding; in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended; in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects; however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl < 30 mL min(-1)), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts.

Conclusions

Dissemination and implementation of good clinical practice for the management of VTE, the second cause of death in cancer patients, is a major public health priority.

### Effect of testing for cancer on cancer-and venous thromboembolism (VTE)-related mortality and morbidity in patients with unprovoked VTE [^111vWqmU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of patients with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether patients with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that patients received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier, potentially curative stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and thus lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) is effective in reducing cancer and VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to establish which tests for cancer are most useful.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS) (2014, Issue 12). Clinical trials databases were searched. The reference lists of relevant articles were also checked.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which patients with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion in this review. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Selection of the studies, quality assessment and data extraction were completed independently by two review authors. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Main Results

Two studies with a combined total of 396 patients met the inclusion criteria for this review. Both studies assessed the effect of testing for cancer versus clinically indicated tests only in patients with an unprovoked VTE. The quality of the evidence was moderate because although the studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, there was concern that the studies were small as reflected in the wide confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled analysis showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either a benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.67, P = 0.26). One study showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced in patients belonging to the extensive screening group than in patients of the control group (64% versus 20%, P = 0.047) and that tested patients were diagnosed earlier than untested patients (mean 1 month versus 11.6 months to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Standard deviations were not provided for time to diagnosis, so it was not possible to perform an independent statistical analysis on this association. Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, side effects of anticoagulation, side effects of cancer tests or patient satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Testing for cancer in patients with idiopathic VTE leads to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer and VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results are imprecise and could be consistent with either harm or benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

### British thoracic society guideline for the initial outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^114MfsbN]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Finally, the advent of the DOACs facilitates early discharge from hospital since patients no longer need to be kept in hospital until they have reached a therapeutic INR. This raises the question of how to identify moderate-risk patients appropriate for early discharge.

In conclusion, there is a need for a standardised approach to identify low-risk patients for outpatient management and also to aid clinicians in deciding when moderate-risk patients can be discharged early. The aim of this guideline is to standardise the approach to the initial outpatient management of PE (up to 3 weeks post diagnosis) and to reduce the risk to patients and hospital trusts, while ensuring best value to the National Health Service.

Target audience for the guideline

This guideline is aimed at clinicians, in particular physicians, clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners, at all levels of seniority delivering emergency, acute, ambulatory and inpatient care who are involved in the management of acute PE. The main specialties referring to the guidance are likely to be acute, emergency, general (internal) and respiratory medicine. It is also designed to inform general practitioners involved in the delivery of ambulatory care or thrombosis pathways. This document may also be used by healthcare commissioners and hospital management to ensure appropriate staffing and resourcing of ambulatory care facilities to integrate PE management into ambulatory care pathways.

Scope of the guideline

The guideline covers
adults (≥ 16 years) with suspected and confirmed acute PE;
haemodynamically stable PE;
use of DOACs in relation to suspected PE and outpatient management;
risk stratification for identifying patients suitable for outpatient management or early discharge;
special subgroups of patients (pregnant patients, those with cancer and intravenous drug abusers).

The guideline does not cover
the diagnostic algorithm for PE;
evidence for cancer screening;
detailed comparisons of anticoagulant drugs;
who should be treated and not treated, specifically how to manage subsegmental PE;
duration of anticoagulation and thrombophilia investigations.

Methodology

This guideline is based on the best available evidence. The methodology used to write the guideline adheres strictly to the criteria as set by the AGREE II collaboration, which is available online at. The BTS Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) guideline production manual is available at.

### Deep vein thrombosis in cancer: the scale of the problem and approaches to management [^111ac5d4]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with cancer have long been recognised to be at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), although the condition remains under diagnosed and under treated in these patients. As a consequence, the morbidity and mortality due to deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism remains unacceptably high in this group. Furthermore, the management of VTE in the presence of malignancy is complex, due both to the effects of the cancer itself and its treatments. Conventional long-term management of VTE involves the use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, this approach is associated with a range of practical difficulties including the need for regular laboratory monitoring, the potential for drug interactions, in addition to the risk of treatment resistance and bleeding in patients with cancer. Recent research indicates that the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) therapy instead of VKAs may be beneficial in these patients. In particular, evidence from a large clinical trial of the LMWH dalteparin indicates that this agent offers an effective alternative to VKAs in the long-term management of VTE, that is free from the practical problems associated with the use of VKAs and without increasing the risk of bleeding.

### Chemotherapy-induced thrombosis [^111EJ7vc]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication associated with hematological and solid tumor malignancies. In patients with cancer, VTE portends a poor prognosis; in fact, only 12% of those who suffer an event will survive beyond one year. There are several different risk factors for the development of VTE in cancer patients that are well-described in the literature. One that has become increasingly recognized over the past two decades is the independent risk factor of chemotherapy. The annual incidence of VTE in patients receiving chemotherapy is estimated at 11%. This risk can climb to 20% or higher depending on the type of drug(s) being administered. In addition to chemotherapy, there are many other anti-neoplastic and supportive therapies that are also associated with an increased risk for the development of VTE. At present, several original basic science studies and clinical trials are underway in an effort to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which different chemotherapeutic agents can generate a prothrombotic state. The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent literature related to VTE in malignancy, and more specifically, chemotherapy and other cancer-related treatments associated with VTE.

### Fedratinib hydrochloride (Inrebic) [^111n9Wtp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Thrombosis

Another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which INREBIC is not indicated. In patients with MF treated with INREBIC in clinical trials, the rates of thromboembolic events were similar in INREBIC and placebo treated patients.

Promptly evaluate and treat patients with symptoms of thrombosis.

5.9 Secondary Malignancies

Another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which INREBIC is not indicated. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with INREBIC, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.

### Rivaroxaban for 18 months versus 6 months in patients with cancer and acute low-risk pulmonary embolism: an open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial (ONCO PE trial) [^1176DU1H]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study Design

The ONCO PE trial (NCT04724460) was an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, adjudicator-blinded, superiority, randomized clinical trial at 32 institutions in Japan designed to compare an 18-month rivaroxaban treatment with a 6-month rivaroxaban treatment in patients with cancer and acute low-risk PE. We evaluated clinical end points at 18 months according to a previous extension trial in which the outcomes were evaluated at 12 months after the implementation of different treatments strategies. Funding was provided by Bayer Yakuhin Co, Ltd, which had no role in the study design; data collection, analysis, or interpretation; or writing of the report. The design of the trial has previously been reported in detail. The data were reviewed by an independent data and safety monitoring committee. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Kyoto University institutional review board, along with the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Study Population

Because there has been no established definition of acute low-risk PE, in the current trial, we used the simplified version of the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) score as a standard risk stratification model for PE, and PE with an sPESI score of 1 (no score component of the sPESI score other than cancer) was defined as acute low-risk PE. Adult patients with active cancer who were newly diagnosed with acute low-risk PE confirmed by a contrast CT examination were eligible for inclusion. Active cancer was defined as cancer meeting one of the following criteria: newly diagnosed cancer within 6 months of randomization; cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc) performed within 6 months of randomization; current cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc); recurrence, local invasion, or distant metastases; or a hematopoietic malignancy that has not achieved complete remission. The key exclusion criteria were patients on anticoagulation therapy at the time of the diagnosis, patients with a contraindication to rivaroxaban, and patients who were expected to have a life prognosis of ≤ 6 months by the treating physicians. All patients provided written informed consent. The full detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

The Hokusai VTE Cancer (Cancer Venous Thromboembolism) study was a landmark randomized, noninferiority trial that compared the efficacy of the DOAC edoxaban against the subcutaneous LMWH dalteparin in preventing recurrent VTE or major bleeding (composite primary outcome) within 12 months in patients with cancer and an acute VTE. Of the 1,046 participants, 12.8% in the edoxaban group experienced the composite outcome compared with 13.5% in the dalteparin group, suggesting that edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin for the composite outcome (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.36; P = 0.006). Fewer participants (7.9%) in the edoxaban group experienced a recurrent VTE compared with 11.3% of participants receiving dalteparin (difference in risk −3.4%; 95% CI: −7.0% to 0.2%). However, major bleeding occurred in 6.9% of participants receiving edoxaban compared with 4.0% of participants in the dalteparin group (difference in risk 2.9%; 95% CI: 0.1% to 5.6%). Importantly, the median treatment duration was longer with edoxaban (median 211 vs 184 days; P = 0.01).

### Optimal follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function, in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology working group on atherosclerosis and vascular biology, endorsed by the European Respiratory Society [^116Ffbzt]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), developed with the European Respiratory Society, provide recommendations on the optimal management of acute PE, including diagnostic algorithms, risk stratification, initial and extended treatment, and follow-up strategy. Some important aspects of the treatment and overall care of patients after acute PE were mentioned, but their detailed discussion was beyond the scope of the guideline document. These issues relate to: management of bleeding risk, screening for cancer, screening for thrombophilia, treatment of PE in women, dealing with sports and travel, detection and management of the post-PE syndrome (PPES), and screening for and management of risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease. This position paper highlights these key aspects of patient counselling, summarizes best available evidence and provides guidance for clinical practice. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE that is intended to be complementary to the formal guideline. The rationale for the conclusions presented is provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix. This review will not deal with PE and COVID-19, for which the reader is referred to the dedicated European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus document.

### Influence of preceding length of anticoagulant treatment and initial presentation of venous thromboembolism on risk of recurrence after stopping treatment: analysis of individual participants' data from seven trials [^117WScN2]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

By increasing the number of patients studied and the spectrum of lengths of treatment evaluated, and by enabling time to event analyses and adjustment for confounding variables (such as patients' age and sex), meta-analysis of individual patients' data from several trials has the potential to answer questions that individual trials, and meta-analyses of aggregate data from such trials, cannot answer. For this reason, the authors of seven studies that compared various length of vitamin K antagonist treatment for venous thromboembolism pooled individual patients' data from their studies. Our primary goal was to identify the shortest length of treatment that reduced the risk of recurrence to its lowest value after stopping treatment, including in subgroups defined according to the location of the initial venous thromboembolism (for example, isolated distal deep vein thrombosis, proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)and whether thrombosis was provoked by a temporary risk factor or was unprovoked (that is, no temporary risk factor or association with cancer was present).

### Performance status and long-term outcomes in cancer-associated pulmonary embolism: insights from the hokusai-VTE cancer study [^112hrAJJ]. JACC: CardioOncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of the Hokusai-VTE Cancer phase III study. Briefly, Hokusai-VTE Cancer was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial that compared edoxaban (60 mg once daily or 30 mg once daily) with dalteparin (200 IU/kg once daily for 30 days and 150 IU/kg thereafter) in patients with cancer with acute VTE (ie, presenting with acute PE or deep vein thrombosis [DVT]). The treatment duration was at least 6 months and up to 12 months, at the treating physician's discretion. Patients were followed for 12 months or until the global end of the study. Predefined follow-up visits were performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after enrollment. All participants provided written informed consent prior to randomization. The ethics committees of the participating centers approved the study.

Patient population

This analysis included adult patients presenting with symptomatic or incidental PE of a segmental or a more proximal pulmonary artery confirmed by diagnostic imaging (as defined in the Hokusai-VTE Cancer protocol) and associated with cancer. Incidental PE was defined as PE detected by imaging tests performed for reasons other than the clinical suspicion of PE. At diagnosis, cancer (excluding basal-cell or squamous-cell skin cancer) had to be active (diagnosed or on therapy within 6 months prior to randomization; recurrent, regionally advanced or metastatic; hematologic malignancy with no complete remission), or diagnosed and objectively confirmed within the previous 2 years. Patients had to be intended for long-term therapy (at least 6 months) with low–molecular weight heparin. The exclusion criteria are described in the Supplemental Appendix. Patients with missing baseline ECOG values were excluded from the present analysis.

### Short-and long-term mortality for patients with and without a cancer diagnosis following pulmonary embolism in Denmark, 2000 to 2020: a nationwide study [^117B5AUF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with a high risk of mortality, with death occurring in 12% to 28% of patients within a month after the index event, and in up to 30% after 1 year. New treatment regimens and updated guidelines have been introduced during the past 20 years and may have influenced the incidence and prognosis of PE. Previous research has shown that new diagnostics, such as computed tomography angiography and D‐dimer, have a significant impact in increased diagnosed PE. PE poses a substantial burden for patients and health care systems in the Western part of the world, and it has been estimated that there are 300 000 cases of PEs and > 370 000 deaths each year related to venous thromboembolism in Europe. The incidence of PE ranges from 75 to 269 events per 100 000 people and is increasing because of an aging population, as the incidence after the age of 40 years has been shown to double with each subsequent decade. Previous studies have investigated the incidence of PE in the Danish population over time and found that the incidence increased while the 30‐ and 90‐day mortality decreased.

Cancer‐associated venous thrombosis is a common condition for patients diagnosed with cancer, and treatment of this group of patients can be challenging and is associated with increased mortality. New treatment regimens, diagnostics, and more focus on PE in the past 20 years might have changed the trend in this mortality. However, newer studies investigating the trend in mortality of both short‐ and long‐term risk and for patients with and without a cancer diagnosis following PE are lacking. Hence, we conducted a nationwide, registry‐based cohort study investigating short‐ and long‐term mortality for patients with and without a cancer diagnosis in Denmark from 2000 through 2020 and, secondarily, we described the temporal trends in PE incidence and anticoagulant treatment.

### Successful management of hemodynamic instability secondary to saddle pulmonary embolism-induced cardiac arrest using VA-ECMO in advanced malignancy with brain metastases [^111USiwJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

In this case report, we described our experience in the successful management of hemodynamic deterioration secondary to SPE-induced cardiac arrest using VA-ECMO with adjusted-dose systemic anticoagulation in a lung cancer patient with brain metastases. The patient had no clotting or bleeding complications during VA-ECMO treatment and was discharged from the hospital with good neurological function. This case suggests the effectiveness of VA-ECMO as a salvage therapy for SPE-induced hemodynamic collapse in malignancy patients with brain metastases.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of case reports on the application of VA-ECMO to successfully rescue SPE-induced hemodynamic collapse in advanced malignancy patients with brain metastases. Indeed, ECMO is infrequently applied in the cohort of patients with advanced malignancy, especially those with brain metastases. According to the latest report from the extracorporeal life support organization registry, the percentage of ECMO runs for neoplasms is around 3% of all ECMO runs, and ECMO runs for the central nervous system neoplasms account for only 1.3% of all ECMO runs for neoplasms. The extremely reduced utilization of ECMO in the population of advanced malignancy with brain metastases might attribute to the following potential reasons: first, the long-term prognosis of a patient with advanced malignancy receiving ECMO may be undesirable; second, the potential ECMO-related bleeding complications were frequent and, sometimes, lethal. Hence, when a malignancy patient with brain metastases developed respiratory failure or circulatory shock, his/her relatives or physicians in charge might abandon the option of ECMO treatment in consideration of the high cost and uncertain prognosis. Cost-effectiveness has always been an important factor that relatives or physicians have to consider before establishing an ECMO circuit. Several studies reported that VA-ECMO was a cost-effective treatment for cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, or cardiotoxicity poisonings. However, there was no study investigating the cost-effectiveness of VA-ECMO in the special subgroup population (i.e. malignancy) so far. Despite this, we believe that VA-ECMO remains a cost-effective treatment for PE-induced refractory shock in patients with malignancy, provided that strict indications and contraindications are applied while respecting the relatives' willingness to rescue. Based on the experience of our ECMO center, we are still willing to discuss with the relatives the possibility of applying ECMO to treat acute hemodynamic instability in malignancy patients, as long as their basic nutritional status is good and has not progressed to cachexia.

### Successful management of hemodynamic instability secondary to saddle pulmonary embolism-induced cardiac arrest using VA-ECMO in advanced malignancy with brain metastases [^112J1ykE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Saddle pulmonary embolism (SPE) represents a rare type of venous thromboembolism that occurs in approximately 2.6–5.4% of all acute pulmonary embolism (PE) cases and frequently leads to hemodynamic collapse and sudden death. As conventional reperfusion therapy including thrombolysis and thrombectomy is less efficacious in mitigating hemodynamic instability, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has increasingly emerged as a salvage therapy for PE-induced hemodynamic instability, which is typically defined as persistent hypotension, obstructive shock, or cardiac arrest. Despite this, the appropriate selection of patients eligible for VA-ECMO remains an ongoing challenge in clinical practice. This is especially true for advanced malignancy patients with brain metastases given the potential bleeding complications and uncertain prognosis. Immunosuppression and irreversible central nervous system pathology have historically been considered to be relatively contraindicated to the application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Consequently, despite a largely increased number of ECMO runs over the past decade, the ECMO runs for neoplasms remain quite infrequent. Herein, we reported a rare case describing the successful management of hemodynamic deterioration secondary to SPE-induced cardiac arrest using VA-ECMO in a lung cancer patient with brain metastases.

### Pacritinib (Vonjo) [^113wqJA8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Thrombosis

Another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial thrombosis (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which VONJO is not indicated.

Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately.

5.7 Secondary Malignancies

Another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (compared to those treated with TNF blockers) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which VONJO is not indicated. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.

Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with VONJO, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.

5.8 Risk of Infection

Another JAK-inhibitor increased the risk of serious infections (compared to best available therapy) in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections may occur in patients treated with VONJO. Delay starting therapy with VONJO until active serious infections have resolved. Observe patients receiving VONJO for signs and symptoms of infection and manage promptly. Use active surveillance and prophylactic antibiotics according to clinical guidelines.

5.9 Interactions With CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers

Co-administration of VONJO with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is contraindicated. Monitor for increased adverse reactions of VONJO when administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Adherence to treatment guidelines for cancer-associated thrombosis: a French hospital-based cohort study [^112FBUyt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

French 2008 treatment guidelines recommend low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) with treatment duration of at least 3 months and up to 6 months and beyond if cancer remains active. Our aim was to assess adherence to guidelines in hospital clinical practice.

Methods

The French hospital database (PMSI) was used to identify patients with CAT admitted to three hospitals of the Paris region to be included in a retrospective cohort study. Adherence to guidelines was assessed in patients included from different treatment periods following the venous thromboembolism (VTE) episode i.e. first 10 days (T1), day 10 to 3 months (T2), months 3 to 6 (T3) and beyond 6 months (T4) when applicable.

Results

A total of 240 patients with CAT were included from January 2012 to December 2012 of whom 204 were analyzable. Treatment was adherent to guidelines in 55, 31 and 34% of patients in T1, T2 and T3 treatment periods, respectively, while overall treatment adherence was found in 52% of patients. Adherence rates were the highest among patients with pulmonary embolism (PE, 60.5%), catheter-related thrombosis (62.5%), class III/IV extended cancer (58.0%) and metastatic malignancy (60.3%) while only 40% with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) received a treatment consistent with guidelines.

Conclusion

Adherence to guidelines appears insufficient since only half of patients received an appropriate treatment. Adherence dropped significantly across treatment periods T2 and T3. VTE diagnosis and cancer characteristics influenced the anticoagulant prescription. Management of patients with CAT requires further education and information of health care professionals.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^111AmRF5]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2021 cancer-associated VTE — evidence base informing the indefinite-duration question: No direct comparative trials were found; two prospective single-arm cohort studies of long-term low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use ≤ 12 months were identified. To inform comparisons, the guideline cited general-population evidence comprising nineteen systematic reviews and 13 RCTs (N = 8593), including adults with objectively confirmed DVTs or PEs treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), LMWH, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), or aspirin (ASA) for ≥ 3 months without recurrence; ASA was not included as an intervention of interest and 1 RCT was excluded. In these studies, short-term recipients were randomized to placebo or to continue long-term treatment of ≥ 6 months, with mean follow-up ranging from 24 to 28 months.

### American Society of Hematology 2021 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention and treatment in patients with cancer [^115aJK3h]. Blood Advances (2021). High credibility.

Mechanical versus pharmacological thromboprophylaxis — direct trials in cancer were not found; because of this, the guideline panel "decided to include evidence from 8 trials conducted in the general population". Benefits were judged trivial with very low certainty for mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.42–2.16; ARR, 1 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 11 fewer to 21 more per 1000) and major bleeding (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.25–3.00; ARR, 1 fewer per 1000; 95% CI, 6 fewer to 16 more per 1000), while harms favored pharmacological prophylaxis because mechanical prophylaxis may increase pulmonary embolism (PE; RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.48–4.93; ARI, 5 more per 1000; 95% CI, 5 fewer to 39 more per 1000) and symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT; RR, 2.20; 95% CI, 0.22–22.09; ARI, 36 more per 1000; 95% CI, 23 fewer to 633 more per 1000). The panel concluded that "the balance probably favors pharmacological prophylaxis", but "patients at high risk for major bleeding may be considered for mechanical, rather than pharmacological, thromboprophylaxis".

### Treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in cancer [^1125h65y]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

It has been clearly established that patients with cancer have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with patients without cancer. Venous thromboembolism, comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients and its treatment is particularly difficult because standard therapy is less effective in preventing recurrences and causes more bleeding than is the case in non-cancer patients with VTE. The need to perform surgery or invasive procedures in patients with cancer receiving anticoagulants, as well as the frequent presence of thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy or haematological malignancy, widespread use of in-dwelling central lines, administration of multiple interacting drugs, and varying dietary intake during the course of cancer therapy, all add to the particular challenges faced in VTE treatment.

Randomised clinical trials over the past decade have substantially altered the management of VTE in patients with cancer, leading to improved outcomes and quality of life. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) have been the mainstay of management of VTE since the mid-twentieth century, followed by the widespread replacement of UFH by low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) since the 1990s. The appearance of new classes of oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit specific clotting factor targets, such as thrombin and factor Xa, may further transform the management of VTE in patients with cancer in the years to come.

### Edoxaban for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^113GyKaV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study Hokusai VTE Cancer was published by Raskob GE and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary embolism, Deep vein thrombosis and Cancer-associated thrombosis. In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the trial question was: is edoxaban noninferior to dalteparin for the management of VTE in patients with cancer? In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the population was: 1046 patients (506 female, 540 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with cancer who had acute symptomatic or incidental VTE. The key exclusion criteria were basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, a history of VTE, previous treatment dose of anticoagulant or > 75 mg aspirin per day, clinically significant liver disease, active bleeding or high risk of bleeding, or uncontrolled hypertension. In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the interventions were: n = 522 edoxaban (LMWH for at least 5 days followed by oral edoxaban at a dose of 60 mg once daily) n = 524 dalteparin (subcutaneous dose of 200 IU/kg of body weight once daily for 1 month followed by a dose of 150 IU/kg once daily). In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in recurrent VTE or major bleeding (12.8% vs. 13.5%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.36). In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in recurrent VTE (7.9% vs. 11.3%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.06) Significant increase in major bleeding (6.9% vs. 4%; HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.04) No significant difference in death from any cause (39.5% vs. 36.6%; HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.37). In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, including progression of neoplasm and pneumonia. In the Hokusai VTE Cancer study, the conclusion was: in patients with cancer who had acute symptomatic or incidental VTE, edoxaban was noninferior to dalteparin with respect to recurrent VTE or major bleeding.

### Reducing the hospital burden associated with the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^115xebya]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a major health care burden worldwide (estimated annual incidence of 0.75 to 2.69 cases per 1000 population), and is associated with considerable morbidity and health care resource utilization 1. In patients with PE, almost half report reduced aerobic functional capacity 1 year after their PE diagnosis, which negatively impacts on patient quality of life 2, 3.

The hospital burden of PE is particularly high for several reasons. First, approximately two‐thirds of non‐fatal PE and fatal VTE cases are associated with recent (≤ 90 days) hospitalization for surgical procedures associated with a moderate to high risk of VTE or admission to a medical ward after acute medical illness, making them leading preventable causes of hospital‐acquired morbidity and mortality 4, 5, 6. Second, patients diagnosed with PE have traditionally been treated in hospital 7. Last, data from the European PREFER in VTE registry indicated that 10% to 25% of patients with PE were rehospitalized within 1 year of diagnosis, and 20% of these readmissions were due to VTE‐related events 8, 9.

Current guidelines suggest that the approximately 30% to 55% of patients with PE who are at low mortality risk may be suitable for early discharge and outpatient treatment 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Nonetheless, clinical trial and real‐world data suggest that 80% to 98% of patients diagnosed with PE are admitted to hospital 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. The necessity of this strategy is unclear, because some centers have established outpatient treatment pathways that result in ~50% to 70% of patients with PE receiving outpatient therapy 22, 23. As well as clinical indicators of cardiopulmonary stability (e.g. blood pressure and oxygen saturation) and PE risk (e.g. high/intermediate vs. low risk), factors favoring hospitalization over outpatient treatment include first VTE (vs. recurrent VTE), provoked VTE (vs. unprovoked VTE), advancing age, and presence of comorbidities (e.g. renal impairment or cancer) 20, 22, 24, 25, 26. Type of health care system, geographical location, level of medicolegal risk, physician attitudes, and patient preferences also influence the proportion of patients with PE treated in the outpatient setting 22, 27, 28, 29.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^111MCoCS]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

VTE bleed scores

While there are bleeding scores available, they have poor predictive performance in acute PE. The NICE guidelines of VTE management state that physicians can consider using the HAS-BLED score (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, and Drugs or alcohol use) for estimating the risk of major bleeding events in patients with VTE and no identifiable risk factors, as there is some evidence that it can identify those who are at particularly high risk of major bleeding. However, the NICE guidelines also recommend research to focus on developing a new prediction tool for recurrence and major bleeding combined, as the current tools cannot be solely relied on. There is also an unmet need for VTE bleed scores designed for patients with cancer.

In general terms, the risk of having a recurrent VTE following an acute PE is approximately 1 in 10 in the first year, rising to 1 in 3 over 5–19 years once anticoagulation is stopped. For patients presenting with a symptomatic PE rather than a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the risk of the recurrent VTE event being another PE rather than a DVT is threefold higher than if the patient presented with a DVT. This needs then to be balanced against an overall risk of major bleeding of 1–2 cases in 100 per year.

Thrombosis

Advise patients that events of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been reported in clinical studies with another JAK-inhibitor used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which VONJO is not indicated. Advise patients to tell their healthcare provider if they develop any signs or symptoms of a DVT or PE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Secondary Malignancies

Advise patients, especially current or past smokers and patients with a known secondary malignancy (other than a successfully treated NMSC), that lymphoma and other malignancies (excluding NMSC) have been reported in clinical studies with another JAK-inhibitor used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which VONJO is not indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

Infections

Advise patients that treatment with another JAK-inhibitor has increased the risk of serious infections in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and that serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections may occur in patients treated with VONJO. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of infection and to report any such signs and symptoms promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

Nausea and Vomiting

Advise patients that nausea and vomiting may occur during treatment with VONJO. Instruct them on how to manage nausea and vomiting and to immediately inform their healthcare provider if nausea/vomiting become severe.

Drug–Drug Interactions

Advise patients to inform their healthcare providers of all medications they are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins, herbal products, and dietary supplements [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Inform women of the possible reduced effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives when under treatment with VONJO and for 30 days after last dose. Advise women of childbearing potential receiving VONJO and hormonal contraception, to use additional nonhormonal contraception or use an alternative contraceptive that is not affected by CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### British thoracic society guideline for the initial outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^113GmmXp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Management of patients with suspected PE, where a diagnosis has yet to be confirmed

Recommendation

Patients with suspected PE should, where reasonably practical, undergo investigation on the same day of presentation to exclude a diagnosis of PE. An alternative strategy of anticoagulation followed by outpatient imaging within 24 hours may be considered in patients with suspected PE, who have been deemed low risk and eligible for outpatient care as per confirmed PE. Robust systems should be in place to facilitate next day investigation and review. Grade D

Treatment of suspected/confirmed PE in the outpatient setting

(See tables 7 and 8).

Table 7
Key randomised trials of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)

Table 8
Relative risk of major and non-major bleeding using direct oral anticoagulants compared with Vitamin K antagonist

Recommendations

Patients with confirmed PE being treated in the outpatient setting should be offered treatment with either LMWH and dabigatran, LMWH and edoxaban or a single-drug regimen (apixaban or rivaroxaban). Grade A
Patients with suspected PE being treated in the outpatient setting may be treated with apixaban or rivaroxaban pending diagnosis as an alternative to LMWH. Grade D

Good practice point

Using a single DOAC in a pathway is preferred to minimise potential confusion over dosing and administration.

Assessing patients transitioning from inpatient care to early discharge/outpatient care?

Recommendation

Patients who have been admitted with an intermediate risk PE (PESI Class III) can be considered for early discharge when they meet the criteria for low risk (PESI class I/II or sPESI score 0). Grade C

Good practice points

Those with PESI-48 class III or sPESI-48 score of > 0 are considered to be at higher risk of adverse outcome and senior review is necessary prior to discharge; PESI and sPESI may remain elevated due to non-reversible factors (eg, cancer, age) which should be taken into consideration when using clinical judgement.
Consideration should be given to repeating assessment of right ventricular function with echocardiography or biomarkers in those admitted with right ventricular dysfunction or biomarker elevation at baseline.

### Treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: perspectives on the use of novel oral anticoagulants [^116kUg7z]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for the management of venous thromboembolism have expanded with the introduction of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). These agents offer significant advantages in convenience and simplicity, and large, well-designed clinical trials have shown that NOACs are comparable in efficacy and safety to traditional therapy using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by a vitamin K antagonist in most patients with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to the general oncology population because randomized clinical trials have included very few and highly selected patients with cancer. Furthermore, how well these agents perform in comparison to LMWH, the drug of choice for both initial and long-term treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis, has not been evaluated. Other limitations of particular importance to patients with cancer, such as chemotherapy interaction, renal impairment, or hepatic involvement with metastases also need to be carefully considered because these patients have higher risks of recurrent thrombosis and bleeding. The use of NOACs is currently not recommended by international consensus guidelines but is now being explored in ongoing clinical trials. The results are eagerly awaited.
