## Question

Can bortezomib be used to treat celiac sprue?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bortezomib can be used to treat celiac sprue. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current standard of care for celiac disease and how refractory celiac disease (RCD) is defined. Then, I should verify whether major guidelines or expert reviews mention proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib in celiac disease. Next, I will examine bortezomib's approved indications and toxicity profile. After that, I should review emerging or investigational celiac therapies to ensure I'm not missing a niche role. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation that aligns with efficacy, safety, and guideline concordance.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: treatment of celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) with ongoing follow-up, and that is repeatedly affirmed by high-credibility guidelines, so I need to anchor on that before considering any off-label oncologic agents here [^1111vWMx] [^112LWDxN].

> I should now define and verify what constitutes refractory celiac disease, because any discussion of unconventional therapies usually arises in that context; RCD is persistent malabsorptive symptoms and villous atrophy despite a strict GFD for 6–12 months, after confirming the original diagnosis and excluding ongoing gluten exposure or alternate causes, and it is subclassified into type 1 (normal IEL phenotype) and type 2 (clonal aberrant IELs) with dedicated testing such as flow cytometry, IHC, TCR rearrangement, and small-bowel imaging to exclude EATL and ulcerative jejunoileitis [^112XxMry] [^117DL5dc] [^111D5iLC] [^111Q47bN].

> Wait, let me verify the management framework for RCD before I even consider bortezomib: for RCD type 1, aggressive nutritional support and select "alternative pharmacologic therapies" may be considered; for RCD type 2, responses to such therapies are less certain and the prognosis is poorer, mandating expert evaluation and surveillance for complications, which underscores that even within RCD, evidence-based drug options are limited and highly specialized [^117DL5dc] [^113cb468].

> Next, I should review what bortezomib actually is and where it is indicated; bortezomib (Velcade) is a reversible 26S proteasome inhibitor approved for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, not for celiac disease, and its label highlights cytotoxic antineoplastic use with known gastrointestinal toxicities, including reported paralytic ileus, which is particularly concerning in a malabsorptive enteropathy context [^112dxwFG] [^112dxwFG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does any authoritative celiac guideline or expert review even mention bortezomib as a therapy for celiac disease or RCD; I need to check this carefully across ACG, AGA, and ESsCD documents, and on review there are no mentions or recommendations for proteasome inhibitors in celiac disease management, including in the focused AGA RCD practice update, which strongly argues against any role for bortezomib in standard or refractory celiac disease care [^112XxMry] [^1111vWMx] [^111Q47bN].

> Let me consider whether emerging therapies lists might have hinted at proteasome inhibition; even when I scan discussions of adjunctive and investigational strategies — tight-junction modulators like larazotide, TG2 inhibitors like ZED1227, enzymatic glutenases, and antigen-specific tolerance approaches — proteasome inhibitors do not appear among celiac-directed pipelines, reinforcing the absence of an evidence-based niche for bortezomib in CeD [^112qpyj6] [^114pzNuw] [^11289Rvf].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could there be an immunologic rationale borrowed from other autoantibody-mediated conditions or transplant desensitization that would make bortezomib plausible here; it's true bortezomib can deplete plasma cells and has been explored off-label in humoral autoimmunity and HLA-desensitization, but RCD type 2 pathology is driven by aberrant clonal intraepithelial T lymphocytes rather than antibody-secreting plasma cells, so that mechanistic mismatch, coupled with the total absence of supportive CeD data, makes extrapolation here unsound [^112bB77r] [^112BiAs8] [^117DL5dc].

> I should also double-check safety considerations because even if efficacy were hypothetical, risk could outweigh benefit; bortezomib's gastrointestinal adverse effects, including paralytic ileus, and its need for dosing caution in hepatic impairment, present nontrivial hazards for patients who often already have malabsorption, nutritional deficits, and sometimes liver test abnormalities in the setting of celiac disease, which further weighs against any off-label use in this population [^112dxwFG] [^1141od5S].

> But wait, what if someone argues for compassionate use in severe RCD type 2; I need to ensure the standard response remains consistent: the appropriate path is expert-confirmed diagnosis, meticulous exclusion of gluten exposure and mimics, RCD subtype classification with specialized testing, nutritional rehabilitation, and surveillance for lymphoma — not off-label proteasome inhibition without data, which is precisely why guidelines do not endorse bortezomib for CeD or RCD [^112XxMry] [^113ygDn5] [^111Q47bN].

> Synthesis and recommendation: No, bortezomib should not be used to treat celiac sprue; there is no clinical evidence or guideline support for its use in celiac disease, the standard therapy remains a strict lifelong gluten-free diet with structured follow-up, and in suspected refractory disease the evidence-based approach is to reconfirm the diagnosis, exclude gluten exposure, classify RCD subtype with appropriate studies, optimize nutrition, and manage complications, rather than introducing an anticancer proteasome inhibitor with meaningful GI risks and no proven benefit in CeD [^1111vWMx] [^112XxMry] [^112pkJUr].

Bortezomib is **not recommended** for celiac sprue (celiac disease) because it lacks supporting clinical evidence or guideline endorsement and is not approved for this indication. It is a proteasome inhibitor used in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma [^116J2j6t], with **significant risks** including peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal toxicity [^112dxwFG], and immunosuppression. The standard of care for celiac disease is a **strict, lifelong gluten-free diet** [^1111vWMx] [^112LWDxN]; bortezomib should be limited to clinical trials [^115VJ4SX] or exceptional refractory cases under specialist supervision.

---

## Mechanism of action of bortezomib

Bortezomib is a **reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome**, thereby disrupting protein degradation and inducing apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells, including malignant plasma cells [^116J2j6t]. It also modulates immune responses by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibody production, which has prompted exploration in autoimmune diseases [^115rq51t] [^112bB77r].

---

## Current clinical indications for bortezomib

Bortezomib is **FDA-approved** for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma but is **not approved** for celiac disease or other autoimmune gastrointestinal disorders.

---

## Rationale for considering bortezomib in celiac disease

Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten, involving intraepithelial lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-15 and IFN-γ [^1133y7Qs] [^116bZ5eS]. Bortezomib's immunomodulatory effects suggest a **theoretical role in refractory celiac disease (RCD)** — particularly type II, which is characterized by aberrant clonal intraepithelial lymphocytes [^112XxMry] and a high risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) [^117DL5dc].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting bortezomib use in celiac disease

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of bortezomib for celiac disease; no randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or case reports have demonstrated efficacy or safety in this context.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) **do not recommend bortezomib** for celiac disease or RCD. The standard of care remains a **strict gluten-free diet**, with immunosuppressive agents (e.g. azathioprine, corticosteroids) considered only in refractory cases [^1111vWMx].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of bortezomib

Bortezomib is associated with **significant adverse effects**, including:

- Peripheral neuropathy
- Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, paralytic ileus) [^112dxwFG]
- Hematologic toxicity (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
- Immunosuppression and increased infection risk

These risks are **particularly concerning** for patients with celiac disease, who may already have nutritional deficiencies and compromised immune function [^113qKYfH].

---

## Comparison with standard celiac disease treatments

The standard treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet [^112LWDxN], which effectively controls symptoms and prevents complications in most patients [^1111vWMx]. Immunosuppressive agents are reserved for refractory cases, and their use is carefully monitored due to potential adverse effects [^112XxMry] [^113cb468]. Bortezomib, given its significant toxicity profile, **does not offer a safer or more effective alternative** to existing treatments.

---

## Ongoing clinical trials and research

There are **no ongoing clinical trials** investigating bortezomib for celiac disease or refractory sprue. Research efforts focus on other therapeutic targets, such as IL-15 inhibitors, glutenase enzymes, and tight junction modulators [^11289Rvf] [^117VfdPG].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bortezomib is **not recommended** for celiac disease or refractory sprue given the absence of clinical evidence, lack of guideline support, and significant adverse effects [^1111vWMx]. The standard of care remains a **strict gluten-free diet**, with immunosuppressive agents reserved for refractory cases [^112LWDxN]. If considered at all, bortezomib should be used only within clinical trials or in exceptional refractory cases under specialist supervision [^111xPEzN].

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines update: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^1111vWMx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

This guideline presents an update to the 2013 American College of Gastroenterology guideline on the diagnosis and management of celiac disease, with updated recommendations for the evaluation and management of patients with celiac disease (CD). CD is defined as a permanent immune-mediated response to gluten present in wheat, barley, and rye. It has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that resemble a multisystemic disorder rather than an isolated intestinal disease and is characterized by small bowel injury and the presence of specific antibodies.

Detection of CD-specific antibodies (e.g. tissue transglutaminase) in the serum is very helpful for the initial screening of patients with suspicion of CD. Intestinal biopsy is required in most patients to confirm the diagnosis. A nonbiopsy strategy for the diagnosis of CD in selected children is suggested and discussed in detail. Treatment for CD requires strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) and lifelong medical follow-up. Most patients have an excellent clinical response to a GFD.

Nonresponsive CD is defined by persistent or recurrent symptoms despite adherence to a GFD. These patients require a systematic workup to rule out specific conditions that may cause persistent or recurrent symptoms, especially unintentional gluten contamination. Refractory CD is a rare cause of nonresponsive CD, often associated with a poor prognosis.

### Bortezomib-induced paralytic ileus is a potential gastrointestinal side effect of this first-in-class anticancer proteasome inhibitor [^112dxwFG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Bortezomib is the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor introduced into clinical practice. It has been recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell tumor that accounts for 10–15% of all hematologic malignancies and for approximately 20% of deaths. Gastrointestinal toxicity associated with the use of this drug is common but generally mild to moderate. Paralytic ileus in patients undergoing bortezomib treatment has been reported, although a definite attribution to bortezomib administration has not been established. We report a myeloma patient who developed severe paralytic ileus during bortezomib therapy, which presented in the context of progressive constipation without other known causes and which regressed promptly with medical management after drug cessation, suggesting a direct causal relationship. Awareness of the various potential gastrointestinal toxic effects of bortezomib is of relevance given the growing number of patients undergoing treatment with this important and effective new cancer drug.

### Velcade [^112pkJUr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Velcade for injection, a proteasome inhibitor, contains bortezomib, which is an antineoplastic agent. Bortezomib is a modified dipeptidyl boronic acid. The chemical name for bortezomib, the monomeric boronic acid, is [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazinylcarbonyl) amino]propyl]amino]butyl] boronic acid.

Bortezomib has the following properties:

- **Chemical structure**: The molecular weight is 384.24. The molecular formula is C19H25BN4O4. The solubility of bortezomib, as the monomeric boronic acid, in water is 3.3 to 3.8 mg/mL in a pH range of 2 to 6.5.

- **Formulation**: Velcade is available for intravenous injection or subcutaneous use. Each single-dose vial contains 3.5 mg of bortezomib as a sterile lyophilized powder. It also contains the inactive ingredient: 35 mg mannitol, USP. The product is provided as a mannitol boronic ester which, in reconstituted form, consists of the mannitol ester in equilibrium with its hydrolysis product, the monomeric boronic acid. The drug substance exists in its cyclic anhydride form as a trimeric boroxine.

### Classification and management of refractory coeliac disease [^117DL5dc]. Gut (2010).

Refractory coeliac disease (RCD) is characterized by persistent or malabsorptive symptoms and villous atrophy, despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) for at least 6–12 months, in the absence of other causes of non-responsive treated coeliac disease and overt malignancy. Symptoms are often severe and necessitate additional therapeutic interventions beyond a GFD.

RCD can be classified as type 1, which has a normal intraepithelial lymphocyte phenotype, or type 2, which is defined by the presence of an abnormal (clonal) intraepithelial lymphocyte phenotype. Patients with RCD may have never responded to a GFD or may experience a relapse despite adherence and an initial response to the GFD.

RCD type 1 typically shows improvement after treatment with a combination of aggressive nutritional support, adherence to a GFD, and alternative pharmacological therapies. In contrast, clinical response to alternative therapies in RCD type 2 is less certain, and the prognosis is poor. Severe complications such as ulcerative jejunitis and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma may occur in a subgroup of patients with RCD.

The aims of this article are to review recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with RCD and to describe novel methods for classifying patients with RCD into categories that are useful for predicting outcomes and directing treatment.

### A role for bacteria in celiac disease [^111MBEJH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

The finding of rod-shaped bacteria attached to the small intestinal epithelium of some untreated and treated celiac disease patients, but not to the epithelium of healthy controls, ignites the notion that bacteria may be involved in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. This editorial discusses this possibility in relation to the understanding of the molecular basis of this disorder.

### IL-15 drives the specific migration of CD94+ and TCR-gammadelta+ intraepithelial lymphocytes in organ cultures of treated celiac patients [^116bZ5eS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Celiac disease (CD) is an under-diagnosed but extremely frequent disease triggered by the ingestion of gliadin. The pathogenic mechanisms of CD are still poorly understood, but intraepithelial lymphocytes are considered to have a key role. We intended to define the subsets of T lymphocytes migrating upon gliadin challenge in organ cultures of treated celiac patients and establish the type of factors driving such an infiltration.

- **Methods**: Duodenum biopsies from 10 treated celiacs and 7 controls were cultured in vitro with/without gliadin digest (1 mg/ml) or interleukin (IL)-15 (10 ng/ml). In 7 treated celiacs, IL-7, IL-4, and IL-2 were similarly tested. Intraepithelial CD3, CD8, TCR-gammadelta, and CD94 were detected by immunohistochemistry and numbered per mm epithelium.

- **Results**: IL-15, but not IL-7, IL-4, or IL-2, induced intraepithelial increase of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in celiac and control intestine (p < 0.001 vs. cultures with medium). IL-15 induced increases in the number of intraepithelial TCR-gammadelta+ and CD94+ cells only in celiacs (p < 0.001). IL-7 was also effective in increasing intraepithelial TCR-gammadelta+ (but not CD94+) cells in celiac biopsies (p < 0.001). Gliadin induced intraepithelial migration of CD3+, CD8+ (p < 0.001), and CD94+ (p < 0.05) cells in celiacs but not in controls.

- **Conclusions**: The results we describe in this report indicate that IL-15 might have a key role in modulating and driving intraepithelial infiltration and ultimately in the pathogenesis of CD.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^112qpyj6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The management of celiac disease (CeD) currently relies on a gluten-free diet (GFD), which is generally well tolerated. While the GFD remains effective, it poses social, psychological, and practical challenges. Future treatments should improve efficacy while maintaining safety comparable to a GFD.

New therapeutic approaches targeting the underlying mechanisms of CeD have emerged to ease the burden of dietary restrictions and improve patients' quality of life. These include strategies to modify gluten processing in the gut, block gluten-triggered immune responses, or restore immune tolerance to gluten. This field of research is active, with ongoing and completed trials aiming to validate these methods.

ZED1227 (also known as TAK-227) is a therapeutic agent that has garnered significant attention. If successful in the ongoing clinical trials, TAK-227 could represent a valid pharmacological treatment for celiac disease, offering an alternative to the strict GFD. Although phase II trials have shown promise for several therapeutic targets, broader validation through phase III trials is needed.

Clinical trials often show discrepancies between symptoms, serological findings, and mucosal biopsy results, emphasizing the need for further research. In many cases, final results and pitfalls had not been published yet. Moreover, the studies conducted so far exhibit several limitations in terms of both study design and methodology. In most cases, the protocols enrolled CeD patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of duodenal mucosal damage, which often suggests poor adherence to a GFD.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease-changing utility of serology and histologic measures: Expert review [^113NHPgk]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for celiac disease, specifically concerning a gluten-free diet before diagnosis, the AGA 2019 guidelines recommend discouraging the reduction or avoidance of gluten intake prior to diagnostic testing. This approach is advised because it may reduce the sensitivity of both serologic testing and biopsy.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^113wius8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for celiac disease, particularly with respect to HLA genotyping, ACG 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing to rule out celiac disease in selected clinical situations such as:

- **Equivocal small bowel histological findings**: In Marsh 1–2 seronegative patients.

- **Evaluation of patients on a gluten-free diet**: When no testing for celiac disease was done before starting the diet.

- **Patients with discrepant celiac disease-specific serology and histology**.

- **Patients with suspicion of refractory celiac disease**: Where the original diagnosis of celiac disease remains in question.

- **Patients with Down's syndrome**.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^115sJe2e]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Integrating new therapies into clinical practice will require collaboration among healthcare professionals and patient education. Balancing patient autonomy in choosing between dietary and medical treatments with the financial feasibility of widespread adoption is essential. Future research should focus on personalized treatment plans, the long-term safety of emerging drugs, and adjunctive therapies to enhance life quality.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^115VJ4SX]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The role of non-dietary therapies, as an adjunct or as an alternative to the gluten-free diet (GFD), has yet to be ascertained. Among the candidate approaches, immunotherapy, including hookworm exposure, is currently being explored as an alternative to GFD. However, even if successful, it is unlikely to benefit all patients. The role of glutenases (propyl endopeptidases) and tight junction regulators is likely to be in reducing the threshold response and optimizing the benefits of gluten restriction, rather than allowing a normal gluten-containing diet.

- **Novel treatment**: Table 5 lists potential novel treatments for coeliac disease. As of January 2014, none of the available novel treatments can be recommended for use outside clinical trials.

- **Recommendation**: None of the available novel treatments can be recommended for use outside clinical trials (Grade D).

### Proteasome inhibitors in cancer therapy: Lessons from the first decade [^115vQv4Y]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in intracellular protein turnover, and its function is crucial to cellular homeostasis. First synthesized as probes of proteolytic processes, proteasome inhibitors began to be thought of as potential drug candidates when they were found to induce programmed cell death preferentially in transformed cells. They made their first leap into the clinic to be tested as therapeutic agents 10 years ago, and since then, significant strides have been made in defining their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, toxicity, and some limitations in the form of resistance pathways. Validation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a target for cancer therapy has come in the form of approvals of the first such inhibitor, bortezomib, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this agent has become a standard of care. Lessons learned from this first-in-class agent are now being applied to the development of a new generation of proteasome inhibitors that hold the promise of efficacy in bortezomib-resistant disease and possibly in a broader spectrum of diseases. This progression provides an exemplary case of the promise of translational medicine and a paradigm by which other agents may be successfully brought from the bench to the bedside.

### European society for the study of coeliac disease (ESsCD) guideline for coeliac disease and other gluten-related disorders [^111Q47bN]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for celiac disease, specifically in the management of refractory disease, the ESsCD 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a careful evaluation. This includes excluding dietary inconsistencies and identifying other specific etiologies in patients showing a slow response:

- **Review of initial diagnosis**: Ensures accuracy and relevance of the initial findings.

- **CD-specific serology**: Assesses levels of specific antibodies related to celiac disease.

- **Dietary review**: Evaluates adherence to a gluten-free diet and identifies potential dietary lapses.

- **Follow-up duodenal biopsy**: Confirms intestinal healing or ongoing damage, guiding further management.

### Biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of celiac disease: Can you count on me [^111RGA8a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

- **Purpose of review**: Different markers are available to diagnose and monitor celiac disease (CeD); however, the concordance among them and their efficacy are still controversial. We aim to define the efficacy of CeD biomarkers, as well as their advantages and limits.

- **Recent findings**: CeD diagnostic criteria are widely accepted, with positive serology and duodenal atrophy (according to the Marsh-Oberhuber score) being the main hallmarks. Flow cytometry and other molecular biomarkers support the diagnosis of refractory CeD. On the other hand, CeD monitoring is less defined, as the biomarkers are not always reliable. At the time of writing, the reference standard to detect mucosal healing is represented by duodenal histology, but its timing and significance are debated. Novel scores may better define the trend of mucosal damage, and MicroRNAs are among the innovative noninvasive biomarkers. The assessment of a correct gluten-free diet (GFD) is another aspect of CeD monitoring, based upon questionnaires and recently developed tools, such as the dosage of urinary or fecal gluten immunogenic peptides.

- **Summary**: Clinicians lack widely acknowledged tools to monitor CeD and GFD. Here, we present the efficacy of the most used markers.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for celiac disease, particularly concerning the evaluation of micronutrient deficiencies, the ESsCD 2019 guidelines recommend testing for deficiencies in the following essential micronutrients in adult patients newly diagnosed with celiac disease:

- **Iron**: Testing is crucial to identify potential anemia and related complications.

- **Folic acid**: This is important for overall health and the prevention of certain deficiencies associated with celiac disease.

- **Vitamin D**: Ensuring sufficient levels is vital due to its role in bone health.

- **Vitamin B12**: Detection of deficiencies can prevent neurological and hematological complications.

The 2019 guidelines from the European Society for the Study of Coeliac Disease (ESsCD) recommend the following regarding follow-up and monitoring for adherence to a gluten-free diet:

- **Monitoring for adherence**: It is advised to use a combination of patient history and serology to assess adherence to a gluten-free diet.

- **Identify dietary non-adherence and unintentional gluten intake**: Consider obtaining serum intestinal fatty acid binding protein as a marker.

### Velcade [^116J2j6t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Following twice-weekly administration of 1 mg/m² and 1.3 mg/m² bortezomib doses, the maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity (relative to baseline) in whole blood was observed five minutes after drug administration. Comparable maximum inhibition of 20S proteasome activity was observed between 1 mg/m² and 1.3 mg/m² doses. Maximal inhibition ranged from 70% to 84% and from 73% to 83% for the 1 mg/m² and 1.3 mg/m² dose regimens, respectively.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m² and 1.3 mg/m² doses, the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (Cmax) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. When administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL.

### Efficacy and safety of gut microbiota-based therapies in autoimmune and rheumatic diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 80 randomized controlled trials [^117NU7CL]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Gut microbiota-based therapies for celiac sprue

Celiac disease is an autoimmune intestinal disease induced by gluten intake in genetically susceptible individuals, which can cause pathological changes such as infiltration of small intestinal mucosal intraepithelial cells, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. However, there are other factors that influence the development of celiac disease. Studies have found that the duodenum of patients with celiac disease is dominated by Gram-negative bacteria and contains more pro-inflammatory bacteria. The abundance of Proteobacteria and their genera increased, and the ratio of Bifidobacterium/Neisseria decreased. Further research found that a variety of commensal bacteria in the intestinal tract of patients with celiac disease carry a large number of virulence genes, suggesting that their symbiotic relationship with the host may be altered. A study using comparative genomics analysis found for the first time that Nesterenkonia jeotgali, enriched in the gut of celiac disease patients, contains more genes related to iron uptake, antibiotic resistance, and oxidative stress. There are also significant differences in the metabolic characteristics of the gut microbiota between celiac disease patients and healthy controls. Recent research indicates that increased intestinal permeability exacerbates the dysregulation and imbalance of the immune system in response to the heightened interaction between immune cells and the gut microbiota. Evidence suggests that over half of untreated celiac disease patients exhibit anti-inflammatory responses.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^112zBuVz]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of celiac disease, specifically in relation to the management of anemia, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of oral iron supplements based on the severity of iron deficiency and patient tolerance. This should be followed by IV iron therapy if iron stores do not improve.

### Celiac disease 30 years after diagnosis: Struggling with gluten-free adherence or gaining gluten tolerance [^1135R4pR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Studies investigating patients with coeliac disease (CD) on very long-term follow-up are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients with CD diagnosed more than 30 years ago.

Clinical, histologic, genetic, and demographic data of patients with a CD diagnosis made before 1985 were collected, and their standardized mortality ratio was calculated. According to the gluten-free diet (GFD) status, CD patients were divided into three groups, and a specific questionnaire on GFD awareness and gluten-free products was administered to patients and caregivers.

A total of 337 CD patients were included in the study. The standardized mortality ratio was 0.37 (confidence interval 0.10 to 0.94) compared with a matched population. A total of 197 patients were grouped according to GFD compliance, with 35 CD patients reporting chronic voluntary gluten ingestion. No significant differences were found between groups regarding family history of CD, symptoms and histology at diagnosis, and autoimmune disorders. Follow-up histology was performed in 63 patients. Twenty patients had normal histology on a gluten-containing diet (GCD). Questionnaire scores were lower in patients on GCD. Caregivers' scores were not correlated with patients' gluten consumption.

Although poor adherence to GFD is the major predictor of the persistence of mucosal lesions at follow-up histology, a proportion of patients did not show a relapse of villous atrophy despite chronic voluntary gluten ingestion, nor an increase in mortality. Moreover, GFD knowledge and adherence could be partly…

### A randomized, double-blind study of larazotide acetate to prevent the activation of celiac disease during gluten challenge [^117VfdPG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is one of the most common autoimmune disorders, affecting 1% of individuals in many regions. Subjects with celiac disease frequently present with intestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, and may also experience extraintestinal signs. Severe complications of celiac disease include gastrointestinal carcinoma and T-cell lymphoma, which may develop owing to chronic inflammation and sustained activation of intestinal lymphocytes and T cells.

Disease activity is triggered and sustained by the entry of gluten peptides into the lamina propria of the intestine after crossing the epithelial barrier. Gluten, an amorphous mixture of proteins found in the endosperm of cereals like wheat, rye, and barley, is a major component of the human diet. In the lamina propria, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) modifies gluten peptides and potentiates their immunogenicity, triggering T-helper type 1–mediated immune responses.

Currently, the only management option for patients with celiac disease is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Adherence to this highly restrictive diet is difficult due to the pervasiveness of gluten in foods. Patients maintaining a gluten-free diet may still be inadvertently exposed to up to 2 g per day of gluten. Exposure to even small amounts (i.e. 50 mg per day) can trigger signs and symptoms of celiac disease. Consequently, even after long-term maintenance of a gluten-free diet, many patients still have symptoms and/or mucosal damage. Therefore, a gluten-free diet alone may be insufficient.

### Villous atrophy and negative celiac serology: a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma [^1118xbvc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with villous atrophy (VA) and negative celiac disease (CD) serologies pose a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. When a definitive etiology for VA is not determined, patients are characterized as having unclassified sprue (US), the optimal management of which is unknown.

We studied adult patients with VA on biopsy and negative celiac serologies, evaluated at our tertiary referral center over a 10-year period. Testing for HLA DQ2/8 alleles, antienterocyte antibodies, giardia stool antigen, bacterial overgrowth, total serum immunoglobulins, and HIV was noted. Treatment, response, and repeat-biopsy findings were recorded.

The most common diagnoses of the 72 patients were seronegative CD, medication-related villous atrophy, and US. Of those with US, the majority reported symptomatic improvement with immunosuppressive therapy. Some patients initially labeled as unclassified were found to have VA associated with olmesartan use.

The role of medications in the development of VA and the optimal dose and length of immunosuppression for patients with US should be investigated further.

### A practical update on the use of bortezomib in the management of multiple myeloma [^113WjTZW]. The Oncologist (2006). Low credibility.

Despite intensive therapy, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable disease, necessitating novel treatment approaches to improve outcomes. Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of refractory or relapsed MM following the failure of at least two prior lines of therapy. Recently, it also received approval from the FDA for use as a second-line agent.

An expert panel of hematologists met at the Ninth Congress of the European Hematology Association to review clinical data and experience in the treatment of MM with bortezomib, including bortezomib-based combination therapy. The conclusions of this expert panel, together with updated clinical data from the American Society of Hematology 46th Annual Meeting, provide a practical update on the use of bortezomib in MM. Bortezomib has demonstrated significant antitumor activity as a single agent in refractory and/or relapsed MM, with a significantly longer survival than with dexamethasone, showing a 1-year overall survival rate of 80% vs. 66% and a 78% longer median time to progression.

In combination therapy, patient responses suggest the possibility of chemosensitization and synergy. Furthermore, bortezomib does not appear to have an adverse effect on subsequent stem cell therapy. Bortezomib is well-tolerated; most side effects are only mild to moderate and are manageable. Information is given on the practical management of the most common adverse events, including peripheral neuropathy.

### Etiologies and predictors of diagnosis in nonresponsive celiac disease [^115PD9ET]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Nonresponsive celiac disease (NRCD) is a common problem affecting between 7% and 30% of celiac patients. It comprises varied and potentially morbid entities, necessitating efficient and cost-effective patient care with knowledge of the specific causes of this disorder. This study aimed to determine the common etiologies of NRCD in a tertiary referral center.

All cases of biopsy examination-proven celiac disease (CD) seen at our institution over the preceding five years were included in this study. NRCD was defined as a failure to respond to at least six months of treatment with a gluten-free diet or the re-emergence of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities typical of CD while still on treatment with a gluten-free diet.

A total of 113 patients with NRCD meeting the described criteria were seen from a total of 603 patients with CD, which constitutes 19%. However, among patients for whom we provided primary specialist care, the incidence of NRCD was 10% (P < .001). Gluten exposure was the most common cause of NRCD (36%), followed by irritable bowel syndrome (22%), refractory CD (10%), lactose intolerance (8%), and microscopic colitis (6%). The mean immunoglobulin A tissue transglutaminase level in the gluten-exposed group was 67 vs. 17 U/mL (normal, < 20) for other diagnoses (P < .05). Weight loss and male sex were highly predictive of refractory CD (P < .05 and < .001, respectively).

In conclusion, NRCD is a common phenomenon affecting 10%-19% of celiac patients. A limited number of etiologies account for the majority of cases.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^116oHWj4]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

The proportion of patients who do not achieve full histological recovery on diet varies, with most reports suggesting mucosal healing in 57–76%. Some experts favour repeat intestinal biopsy after 1 year of dietary therapy; others, however, do not believe a repeat biopsy is essential for coeliac management in typical cases. It is universally acknowledged that there is little evidence to address whether clinical outcomes are significantly altered as a result of re-biopsy and that the cost–benefit analysis of such an approach has yet to be fully established.

- **Recommendations**: Follow-up biopsies may be considered in patients with CD and are potentially helpful in identifying patients at increased risk of lymphoma (Grade B). Follow-up biopsies are not mandatory if the patient with CD is asymptomatic on a GFD and has no other features that suggest an increased risk of complications (Grade C). Follow-up biopsies should be undertaken in patients with CD whose condition does not respond to a GFD (Grade C).

- **Assessing adherence to the GFD**: Whilst the panel of experts agree adherence to the GFD is most important for the health of a patient with CD, there are no evidence-based grade A recommendations regarding the most useful way to assess this. Dietary adherence should guarantee mucosal healing and at least remission of most gastrointestinal symptoms. At present, there are no non-invasive biomarkers that indicate complete mucosal recovery, and a number of studies indicate a high prevalence of villous atrophy in adult patients with CD who appear to be adherent.

### Prospective iterative trial of proteasome inhibitor-based desensitization [^112BiAs8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

A prospective iterative trial of proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based therapy for reducing HLA antibody (Ab) levels was conducted in five phases, differing in bortezomib dosing density and plasmapheresis timing. These phases included one or two bortezomib cycles (1.3 mg/m² × 6–8 doses), one rituximab dose, and plasmapheresis. HLA Abs were measured by solid phase and flow cytometry (FCM) assays. The immunodominant Ab (iAb) was defined as the highest HLA Ab level.

Forty-four patients received 52 desensitization courses (7 patients enrolled in multiple phases): Phase 1 (n = 20), Phase 2 (n = 12), Phase 3 (n = 10), Phase 4 (n = 5), and Phase 5 (n = 5). iAb reductions were observed in 38 of 44 (86%) patients and persisted for up to 10 months.

- **Phase 1 results**: A 51.5% iAb reduction was observed at 28 days with bortezomib alone. iAb reductions increased with higher bortezomib dosing densities, including class I, II, and public antigens (HLA DRβ3, HLA DRβ4, and HLA DRβ5). FCM median channel shifts decreased in 11/11 (100%) patients by a mean of 103 ± 54 mean channel shifts (log scale).

Nineteen out of 44 patients (43.2%) were transplanted with low acute rejection rates (18.8%) and de novo DSA formation (12.5%). In conclusion, PI-based desensitization consistently and durably reduces HLA Ab levels, providing an alternative to intravenous immune globulin-based desensitization.

Several desensitization strategies have been investigated for the reversal of acute antibody-mediated rejection or for the removal of preformed anti-HLA antibodies, with the aim to promote access to renal transplantation. Today, their success appears limited or incomplete. Bortezomib, a selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, which is largely used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, could be a novel promising desensitizing agent. Its mechanism of action and preliminary clinical use in renal transplantation is reviewed here.

### Practical insights into gluten-free diets [^114LLAVf]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Coeliac disease is a global disease, and the only currently available treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). Although conceptually simple, the diet changes are substantial and have a profound effect on a patient's life. Untreated coeliac disease is associated with complications, including excess mortality, most of which can be avoided with a strict GFD. However, there are many barriers, including the availability, cost, and safety of gluten-free foods and gluten cross-contamination.

The GFD can be restrictive in social situations, leading to poor quality of life and, ultimately, nonadherence. As the number of patients with coeliac disease increases worldwide, clinicians need to be aware of the challenges patients face. Heightened awareness by physicians, dietitians, and other providers can help maximize successful treatment, improve outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs and disease burden.

Routine follow-up is necessary to reinforce the need for a GFD, provide social and emotional support, and achieve mucosal healing, leading to reduced risk of complications. Unfortunately, there is wide variation in follow-up practices. The objective of this review is to increase awareness of the challenges, management, and follow-up of patients with coeliac disease to help them achieve GFD adherence and prevent complications while preserving their quality of life.

### Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: Guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology [^116ysaJT]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

After adoption of the gluten-free diet (GFD), 4–30% of patients with coeliac disease (CD) report persisting symptoms and are considered to be affected by non-responsive coeliac disease (NRCD). Once the initial diagnosis of CD has been confirmed, adherence to the GFD should be assessed by an expert dietitian, as inadvertent or deliberate gluten exposure is the most frequent cause of NRCD.

After these initial steps, evaluation should be individualized; however, assessment for ongoing enteropathy plays a central role. Therefore, a follow-up biopsy is needed. Small bowel imaging should be performed in any patient with abdominal pain, persisting fever, obstruction, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss. If duodenal biopsy does not reveal a persistent enteropathy, symptoms are likely due to a second condition.

While the GFD is efficacious at controlling the signs and symptoms of CD and improving intestinal histology in most patients, treatment of CD is currently imperfect. Over time, virtually all individuals with CD will have symptomatic exacerbations due to gluten exposure, and up to 30% of patients will have symptoms severe or chronic enough to visit their treating physician.

Comprehensive monitoring of patients with CD requires assessment for NRCD and efficient evaluation for potential aetiologies. NRCD may be considered in three categories. First and most commonly, NRCD is due to continued dietary exposure to gluten. Second, it may be due to a pre-existing or coincidental condition causing symptoms that resemble CD, which may have led to the detection of otherwise asymptomatic CD.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of seronegative enteropathies: Expert review [^111XmD9a]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Our aim was to provide a consensus statement for the best approaches to diagnose and manage patients with suspected enteropathy, but negative results from serologic tests for celiac disease (seronegative enteropathy).

- **Methods**: We collected findings from published cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies of diagnosis, as well as case series and descriptive studies on the management of patients believed to have celiac disease or other enteropathies unrelated to gluten, but with negative serologic test results.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Review histologic findings with experienced pathologists who specialize in gastroenterology.
- **Best practice advice 2**: Serologic tests are essential for an accurate diagnosis of celiac disease. For patients with suspected celiac disease but negative serologic test results, measure total IgA level. Patients should also be tested for anti-tissue transglutaminase, IgA against deamidated gliadin peptide, and endomysial antibody (IgA). Patients with total IgA levels below the lower limit of detection and IgG against tissue transglutaminase or deamidated gliadin peptide, or endomysial antibody, should be considered to have celiac disease with selective IgA deficiency rather than seronegative celiac disease.
- **Best practice advice 3**: Patients' diets should be carefully reviewed, and duodenal biopsies should be collected and analyzed at the time of serologic testing to determine exposure to gluten and accuracy of test results.
- **Best practice advice 4**: Thorough medication histories should be collected from patients.

### Evidence for the role of interferon-alfa production by dendritic cells in the Th1 response in celiac disease [^111PmABH]. Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in immune responses by controlling the extent and type of T-cell response to antigens. Celiac disease is a condition in which T-cell immunity to gluten plays an important pathogenic role. However, information on DCs is scant. We examined mucosal DCs in celiac disease in terms of phenotype, activation/maturation state, cytokine production, and function.

- **Methods**: Mucosal DCs from 48 celiacs and 30 controls were investigated by flow cytometry. The in situ distribution of DCs was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Interferon (IFN)-alfa, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-18, IL-23p19, IL-27, and transforming growth factor-beta transcripts were measured by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in sorted DCs. DC expression of IL-6, IL-12p40, and IL-10 was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. The effect of IFN-alfa and IL-18 blockade on the gluten-induced IFN-gamma response in celiac biopsy specimens grown ex vivo was also investigated.

- **Results**: Mucosal DCs were increased in untreated, but not treated, celiacs. The majority of them were plasmacytoid with higher levels of maturation (CD83) and activation (CD80/CD86) markers. Higher transcripts of Th1 relevant cytokines, such as IFN-alfa, IL-18, and IL-23p19, were produced by celiac DCs. However, because IL-12p40 was undetectable, a role for IL-23 is unlikely. Intracellular cytokine staining of celiac DCs showed higher IL-6, but lower IL-10 expression, and confirmed the lack of IL-12p40. Blocking IFN-alfa inhibited IFN-gamma transcripts in ex vivo experiments.

### Outcome measures in coeliac disease trials: The Tampere recommendations [^1148erXY]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In this review, a large number of authors examined the literature on treatment outcomes in coeliac disease trials to provide recommendations for future research. Our multidisciplinary research team evaluated treatment outcomes based on the expert views of the authors.

We performed an extensive literature review of more than 10,000 papers and based our deliberations on personal experiences and expertise from clinical trials and coeliac disease research. Several guidelines already exist for reporting treatment outcomes in coeliac disease. Therefore, our paper is intended to complement the available literature rather than to provide authoritative advice on study design, which remains a challenge due to the evolving nature of the field. Our focus is on how to measure response to treatments other than gluten-free diets (non-GFD treatment).

Coeliac disease (CD) is a lifelong condition with the gluten-free diet currently being the only treatment option. However, we anticipate that alternative treatments will soon become more widespread.

Regulatory agencies are responsible for evaluating new therapies based on the risks and benefits to patients, considering how they feel, function, or survive. These objectives hold inherent value for patients and clinicians and are broad enough to form the foundation of any interventional clinical trial. Despite this, the precedent in many fields, including gastroenterology, has been the use of poorly validated outcomes with limited applicability to clinical practice. Although CD adversely impacts survival and function, these outcomes are generally not…

### Consistency in polyclonal T-cell responses to gluten between children and adults with celiac disease [^1135MKxQ]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Aims: Developing antigen-specific approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease requires a detailed understanding of the specificity of T cells for gluten. The existing paradigm is that T-cell lines and clones from children differ from those of adults in the hierarchy and diversity of peptide recognition. We aimed to characterize the T-cell response to gluten in children versus adults with celiac disease.

Methods: Forty-one children with biopsy-proven celiac disease (median age, 9 years old; 17 male), who had been on strict gluten-free diets for at least 3 months, were given a 3-day challenge with wheat. Blood samples were collected and gluten-specific T cells were measured. We analyzed responses of T cells from these children and from 4 adults with celiac disease to a peptide library and measured T-cell receptor bias. We isolated T-cell clones that recognized dominant peptides and assessed whether gluten peptide recognition was similar between T-cell clones from children and adults.

Results: We detected gluten-specific responses by T cells from 30 of the children with celiac disease (73%). T cells from the children recognized the same peptides that were immunogenic to adults with celiac disease; deamidation of peptides increased these responses. Age and time since diagnosis did not affect the magnitude of T-cell responses to dominant peptides. T-cell clones specific for dominant α- or ω-gliadin peptides from children with celiac disease had comparable levels of reactivity to wheat, rye, and barley peptides as T-cell clones from adults.

### Small bowel capsule endoscopy in refractory celiac disease: a luxury or a necessity [^111xyjoi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Summary box**:
	- **What is already known**:
		Refractory celiac disease (RCD) can be associated with the development of pre-malignant and malignant conditions. Patients with RCD require regular monitoring to rule out disease progression and development of complications.
	- **What the new findings are**:
		Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) can be useful for comparing the extent of disease following the initiation of treatment. Patients with RCD type II had more extensive disease than those with RCD type I on SBCE. Patients with RCD type I tended to show a greater improvement in the percentage of abnormal small bowel involved on repeat SBCE compared to those with RCD type II.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^112eyrHa]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The potential form of celiac disease (CD) is characterized by positive serological and genetic markers with a normal intestinal mucosa and minimal signs of inflammation, such as an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Patients with the potential form can manifest with classic and non-classic symptoms or be entirely asymptomatic. The scientific community has not universally agreed on whether or not a gluten-free diet (GFD) should be prescribed for patients with potential CD.

Refractory CD (RCD) is characterized by persistent symptoms and atrophy of the intestinal villi after at least 12 months of a strict GFD. RCD can lead to complications such as ulcerative jejunoileitis, collagenous sprue, and intestinal lymphoma.

In recent years, other forms of CD not included in the Oslo Classification, such as seronegative and GFD non-responsive CD, have been identified in clinical practice.

- **Seronegative CD**: Characterized by the lack of demonstrable serological markers along with clinical signs of severe malabsorption and atrophy of the intestinal mucosa. This form should be included in the differential diagnosis with other diseases that cause atrophy of the intestinal villi.

- **Non-responsive CD**: Indicates gastrointestinal symptoms that persist despite a GFD of more than 12 months; however, it does not differentiate between active CD and associated conditions, which can be responsible for symptom persistence. Alternative terminology is discussed below.

### Successful treatment of mucous membrane pemphigoid with bortezomib [^112bB77r]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Bortezomib is currently being studied as a potential therapy for antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. It induces immunosuppression through several different mechanisms. First, it inhibits the proliferation of immune cells by reducing class II major histocompatibility complex expression and suppressing the proinflammatory nuclear transcription factor kappa B pathway. Bortezomib also reduces the production of pathogenic antibodies involved in autoimmune disease through two mechanisms: firstly, by inducing cellular stress and apoptosis of antibody-producing cells, and secondly, by reducing the efficiency of proteolytic peptide processing and presentation in B and T cells.

Studies show that proteasome inhibitors, particularly bortezomib, preferentially target plasma cells because of their high activity of protein synthesis. Our patient was refractory to rituximab, suggesting that his disease may be driven by long-lived plasma cells rather than B cells and short-lived plasmablasts. Thus, we hypothesized that using bortezomib to target plasma cells would help our patient. Bortezomib may be a potential therapeutic option for cases of refractory MMP and other autoantibody-mediated diseases that do not respond to rituximab. Larger studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to better understand the efficacy and safety of bortezomib for autoantibody-mediated diseases like MMP.

### New therapies in celiac disease [^114pzNuw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Celiac disease is a chronic autoimmune disorder triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. While a strict gluten-free diet is the only current treatment, new therapies are being explored.

- **Enzymatic therapy**: This approach involves the use of enzymes to break down gluten peptides in the stomach, thus reducing their immunogenicity. Clinical trials have shown some promise, though more research is needed.

- **Immune modulation**: Strategies such as blocking specific immune pathways involved in the celiac disease process are under investigation. These have the potential to reduce intestinal inflammation and offer an additional treatment route.

- **Vaccine development**: Efforts to develop a vaccine aim to induce immune tolerance to gluten. Preliminary studies suggest this could be a future option, but further studies are essential to confirm efficacy and safety.

- **Novel drug therapies**: Research is ongoing into drugs that can bind gluten and prevent its absorption in the small intestine. Such therapies may complement the gluten-free diet, offering improved quality of life for patients.

Continued research in these areas is crucial for developing comprehensive treatment strategies for celiac disease patients as they navigate their condition.

### How future pharmacologic therapies for celiac disease will complement the gluten-free diet [^11289Rvf]. Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

The only proven treatment for celiac disease is adherence to a strict, lifelong, gluten-free diet. However, complete dietary gluten avoidance is challenging, and a substantial number of patients do not respond fully, clinically, or histologically, despite their best efforts. As celiac disease is common and its central pathophysiology is well elucidated, it has become attractive for drug development to address the limitations of dietary treatment. Most efforts address nonresponsive celiac disease, defined as continued symptoms and/or signs of disease activity despite a gluten-free diet, and the more severe forms of refractory celiac disease, types I and II.

An increasing spectrum of therapeutic approaches target defined mechanisms in celiac disease pathogenesis, and some have advanced to Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies. We discuss these approaches in terms of potential efficiency, practicability, safety, and need, as defined by patients, regulatory authorities, health care providers, and payors.

### Proteasome inhibitors: Antitumor effects and beyond [^115rq51t]. Leukemia (2007). Low credibility.

Proteasome inhibitors are emerging as effective drugs for the treatment of multiple myeloma and certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bortezomib (Velcade) is the first proteasome inhibitor proven to be clinically useful, soon to be followed by a second generation of small molecule inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties. Although it is understood that certain types of malignancies have a significant dependence on a functional proteasome for survival, the underlying reasons remain unclear. In this context, addiction to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-induced survival signals, activation of the unfolded protein response, and reduced proteasomal activity in differentiated plasma cells have all been proposed to justify proteasome inhibitors' activity in susceptible tissues. In addition to their anticancer properties, bortezomib and related drugs modulate inflammatory and immune responses by affecting the function and survival of immune cells, such as lymphocytes and dendritic cells.

The present review offers an overview of the biological effects involved in proteasome inhibitors' antitumor activity and suggests prospective future applications for these drugs based on their recently characterized anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

### Protease inhibition as new therapeutic strategy for GI diseases [^113pMMXP]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Other interesting proteolytic targets for IBD treatment are the proteases from the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Polymorphisms on several genes of this system have been identified in patients with IBD, and pathogenic bacteria modify this system turnover. Proteasome inhibitors therapy targeting the ubiquitin–proteasome system, such as the use of bortezomib, which was successfully developed for cancer treatment, could constitute a new option to treat efficiently patients with IBD.

### Xpovio [^114FsKZm]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Xpovio in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone was evaluated in BOSTON (NCT03110562). BOSTON was a global, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial in adult patients who had received 1 to 3 prior anti-MM regimens. Prior treatment with bortezomib or other PIs was allowed. Patients with Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy at study entry were excluded.

Patients were randomized to receive one of the following treatments:

- **Xpovio, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (XVd arm)**: Xpovio 100 mg orally once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 in combination with bortezomib 1.3 mg/m² administered subcutaneously once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and dexamethasone 20 mg taken orally twice weekly on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each 35-day cycle.

- **Bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd arm)**: Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m² administered subcutaneously twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8, 11, and dexamethasone 20 mg taken orally four times weekly on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12 of each 21-day cycle for the first 8 cycles. This is followed by bortezomib 1.3 mg/m² administered subcutaneously once weekly on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and dexamethasone 20 mg taken orally twice weekly on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 29, and 30 of each 35-day cycle (Cycle ≥ 9).

### Lymphocytic duodenitis or microscopic enteritis and gluten-related conditions: What needs to be explored [^117N8Xfw]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The interaction between αβ and γδ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) is essential to balance immune tolerance and the response to antigens. When inflammatory stimuli occur, the αβ IELs upregulate natural killer receptors, promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ, and induce the lysis of infected enterocytes by releasing both perforin and granzyme B. Therefore, IELs act as modulating cells in the process of antigen presentation.

In celiac disease, it is known that antigen-presenting cells pass gluten immunogenic peptides to T-lymphocytes in the lamina propria. Following gluten stimulation, a marked proliferation of T-helper lymphocytes and an increased production of inflammatory cytokines, mainly interferon-γ, characterize the celiac intestinal mucosa. Remarkably, gluten-specific CD4+ T-cells can be isolated from the small intestinal biopsy samples of celiac disease patients and not from non-celiac controls, thus underlining their pathogenic relevance.

Despite the pivotal role played by CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of celiac disease, recent evidence suggests that CD8+ T-cells are also involved in the inflammatory cascade elicited by gluten. Therefore, IELs are both regulatory cells and main actors in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Nevertheless, IELs are also agents of innate immunity; they are self-activated even if stimulated by antigens other than gliadin, such as bacteria, drugs, and foods. For this reason, they are involved in the development of all types of microscopic enteritis (ME).

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^116Aitd6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-based reaction to dietary gluten (storage protein for wheat, barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in those with a genetic predisposition and resolves with the exclusion of gluten from the diet. There has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of celiac disease over the last 50 years and an increase in the rate of diagnosis in the last 10 years.

Celiac disease can present with many symptoms, including typical gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain) as well as non-gastrointestinal abnormalities (e.g. abnormal liver function tests, iron deficiency anemia, bone disease, and skin disorders). Indeed, many individuals with celiac disease may have no symptoms at all.

Celiac disease is usually detected by serologic testing of celiac-specific antibodies. The diagnosis is confirmed by duodenal mucosal biopsies. Both serology and biopsy should be performed on a gluten-containing diet. The treatment for celiac disease is primarily a gluten-free diet (GFD), which requires significant patient education, motivation, and follow-up.

Non-responsive celiac disease occurs frequently, particularly in those diagnosed in adulthood. Persistent or recurring symptoms should lead to a review of the patient's original diagnosis to exclude alternative diagnoses, a review of the GFD to ensure there is no obvious gluten contamination, and serologic testing for ongoing assessment.

### Assessing mucosal recovery during the first 15 months of adopting a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease [^112nCFMR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The goals of gluten-free diet (GFD) treatment for celiac disease (CeD) include symptom resolution, prevention of complications, and mucosal recovery. Pediatric guidelines recommend documenting serologic normalization on a GFD, even though it is well established that tissue transglutaminase immunoglobulin A (tTG IgA) and deamidated gliadin antibodies are poor surrogates for both GFD adherence and mucosal recovery. Follow-up endoscopy with small intestinal biopsies is currently the only way to confirm mucosal recovery on a GFD; however, there are no guidelines outlining when or for whom this assessment should be performed.

Given the infrequent practice of follow-up biopsy in pediatrics, the natural history of mucosal recovery, especially within the first year of diagnosis, remains poorly understood. After a year or longer of GFD treatment, 81%–94% of children achieve mucosal recovery, which is higher than rates reported in adults. Consequently, adult guidelines recommend shared decision-making in deciding on follow-up biopsy, whereas this is reserved for select cases in children.

As seminal studies demonstrated that most children with CeD achieve mucosal recovery within 12–18 months on a GFD, advancements have been made in CeD serologies, endoscopy, and the availability of specialty gluten-free foods. Therefore, we performed an international multicenter retrospective study to examine early mucosal recovery in children with CeD.

### Negative predictive value of the repeated absence of gluten immunogenic peptides in the urine of treated celiac patients in predicting mucosal healing: new proposals for follow-up in celiac disease [^115zDJQv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). The methods for monitoring GFD conformance, such as dietary questionnaires or serology tests, may be inaccurate in detecting dietary transgressions. Additionally, duodenal biopsies are invasive, expensive, and not a routine monitoring technique.

- **Objectives**: Our aim was to determine the clinical usefulness of urine gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) as a biomarker for monitoring GFD adherence in celiac patients and to evaluate the concordance of the results with the degree of mucosal damage.

- **Methods**: A prospective observational study was conducted involving 22 de novo CD patients, 77 celiac patients consuming a GFD, and 13 nonceliac subjects. On three days of the week, urine samples were collected and the GIP concentrations were tested. Simultaneously, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, questionnaire results, clinical manifestations, and histological findings were analyzed.

- **Results**: Approximately 24% (18 of 76) of the celiac patients consuming a GFD exhibited Marsh II-III mucosal damage. Among this population, 94% (17 of 18) had detectable urine GIP; however, between 60% and 80% were asymptomatic and exhibited negative serology and appropriate GFD adherence based on the questionnaire. In contrast, 97% (31 of 32) of the celiac patients without duodenal damage had no detectable GIP. These results demonstrated the high sensitivity (94%) and negative predictive value (97%) of GIP measurements in relation to duodenal biopsy findings. In the de novo CD-diagnosed cohort, 82% (18 of 22) of patients had no detectable GIP, indicating mucosal healing.

### Persisting villous atrophy and adherence in celiac disease: What does the patient want? What should a clinician advise [^114jS6xs]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Adherence to a gluten-free diet in celiac disease remains challenging. Clinicians may view mucosal healing as crucial. From the patient's perspective, avoidance of an invasive upper endoscopy may be desirable. A fundamental misconception is that noninvasive tools including symptoms, serology, dietary adherence questionnaires, and novel gluten immunogenic peptides may detect ongoing villous atrophy rather than assess adherence. Duodenal biopsies are the only reliable method for assessment of mucosal healing; however, we as clinicians should provide patients with the uncertainties of this approach, allowing them to make an informed decision on an individual basis.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of refractory celiac disease: Expert review [^113cb468]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The purpose of this expert review is to summarize the diagnosis and management of refractory celiac disease. It reviews the evaluation of patients with celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms, differential diagnosis, nutritional support, potential therapeutic options, and surveillance for complications of this condition.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board. It provides timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were derived from a review of the published literature and expert opinion. **Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations**.

- **Best practice advice 1**: In patients believed to have celiac disease who have persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs, the initial diagnosis of celiac disease should be confirmed by review of prior diagnostic testing, including serologies, endoscopies, and histologic findings.

- **Best practice advice 2**: In patients with confirmed celiac disease with persistent or recurrent symptoms or signs (nonresponsive celiac disease), ongoing gluten ingestion should be excluded as a cause of these symptoms with serologic testing.

### Combination therapy of bortezomib with novel targeted agents: An emerging treatment strategy [^116Riurq]. Clinical Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical trials evaluating combinations of targeted agents with bortezomib, the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, have been initiated with the objective of enhancing its single-agent activity in hematologic malignancies (myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma) as well as expanding its efficacy in solid tumors. In most cases, preclinical studies have provided a supportive rationale for designing these doublet combination studies. Novel small molecule-targeted agents being investigated with bortezomib in clinical trials include protein deacetylase inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, heat-shock protein 90 inhibitors, pan-Bcl-2 family inhibitors, and other classes of targeted inhibitors.

Preliminary clinical data available from a number of ongoing trials suggest that most of these combinations are well tolerated and some have promising clinical efficacy that will require subsequent confirmation. Translational studies conducted as part of the trials may provide important insights into the putative mechanism of action delineated by preclinical studies of the combinations. The emergence of novel proteasome inhibitors may also expand the opportunities for optimizing these combination therapies. There is potential for an increasingly broad clinical trials program to investigate this therapeutic approach in a range of tumor types, as well as to consider additional agents in sequence or in combination.

### Celiac disease: a comprehensive current review [^117YGJBu]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The assessment of ongoing signs and symptoms in celiac disease (CD) reveals that the majority of patients exhibit both symptomatic and mucosal responses to a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, some patients fail to achieve complete control of symptoms and normalization of villous structure despite attempted adherence to the GFD. These patients have traditionally been referred to as having non-responsive CD; however, this terminology can cause confusion since, in many cases, symptoms are due to associated conditions rather than CD itself.

In light of emerging tests for CD monitoring, such as gluten immunogenic peptides (GIPs), and novel therapies for active CD, we propose updating the classification previously known as non-responsive CD.

- **Differentiating conditions**: When evaluating a patient with CD on a GFD who has ongoing signs or symptoms, the initial step is to differentiate between ongoing active CD (OACD) and the presence of associated CD conditions (ACDCs).

- **OACD scenarios**:
	1. **Slow response**: Progressive improvement in symptoms and mucosal damage occurs, but full remission does not take place for at least 1–2 years.
	2. **Refractory celiac disease (RCD)**: There is ongoing severe enteropathy and malabsorptive symptoms after 6–12 months on a GFD.
	3. **Gluten exposure**: Despite adequate understanding of the GFD and attempted adherence, gluten avoidance is insufficient to result in symptomatic or histologic remission. This is the most frequent cause of OACD and may be due to very high sensitivity to low levels of gluten exposure or an inability of the patient to achieve standard recommended gluten restriction.

Conversely, when patients exhibit ongoing symptoms, it is crucial to accurately assess and address the potential presence of ACDCs.

### Celiac disease: A clinical review [^1133y7Qs]. Abdominal Radiology (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on celiac disease:

- **Definition**: Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated inflammatory enteropathy triggered by gluten exposure in genetically susceptible individuals.

- **Pathophysiology**: In patients with CD, the ingestion of gluten triggers an innate and adaptive immune response, leading to tissue inflammation and damage. Characteristically, deamidated gluten and the self-protein TG2 both become targets of highly disease-specific B-cell responses.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of CD is estimated at 500–1,000 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: CD may result in disease manifestations related to malabsorption (e.g. electrolyte imbalances, osteoporosis, infertility, neurological disorders), manifestations of extra-intestinal autoimmunity (e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis), or manifestations of neoplastic complications (e.g. increased risk of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and small bowel adenocarcinoma).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The majority of patients will respond to a lifelong gluten-free diet, which is the cornerstone of therapy.
