## Question

How to start treatment for hyponatremia of 125?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to start treatment for hyponatremia with a serum sodium of 125 mEq/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should assess symptom severity and classify the hyponatremia by severity. Next, I will determine acuity and volume status because these drive urgency and therapy. After that, I will outline treatment for severe symptoms, moderate symptoms, and asymptomatic or mild cases. Finally, I will specify monitoring, correction limits, and special scenarios like liver disease, SIADH, and exercise-associated hyponatremia, and I will double-check where guidelines differ and why.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude pseudohyponatremia. I need to check serum osmolality to verify hypotonicity, and I should review for hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, or paraproteinemia that can artifactually lower measured sodium, because management hinges on true hypotonic hyponatremia rather than translocational or pseudohyponatremia [^19dbc176] [^c9242bcd].

> Next, I should review symptom severity and classify the hyponatremia. Sodium 125 mEq/L is moderate by European criteria and severe by some US panels, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — classification should align with symptoms and chronicity rather than sodium alone. Mild symptoms include nausea, headache, confusion, while severe symptoms include seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest, and these distinctions will shape urgency and therapy [^9f3f9f1f] [^1438df03] [^19dbc176].

> I will now examine acuity and chronicity, because this determines how fast I can safely correct. Acute hyponatremia is less than 48 hours, chronic is more than 48 hours, and if duration is unknown I should treat as chronic to avoid osmotic demyelination. I should double-check whether there are risk factors for ODS such as alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or liver disease, which would lower my correction targets [^d4b25184] [^cf662663].

> Hold on, I should verify volume status next, since this directs therapy. Hypovolemic hyponatremia responds to isotonic saline, euvolemic etiologies like SIADH require fluid restriction and possibly urea or vaptans, and hypervolemic states such as heart failure or cirrhosis need fluid restriction and disease-directed therapy rather than saline, which can worsen sodium retention [^19dbc176] [^90dd948b] [^86adf319].

> For severe symptoms at sodium 125 mEq/L, I need to act immediately. Wait, let me verify the bolus approach: 3% hypertonic saline 100–150 mL IV boluses, repeated up to three times at 10-minute intervals, targeting a 4–6 mEq/L rise to reverse encephalopathy, with the aim of staying under 10 mEq/L in 24 hours. I should monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially and be ready to relower with desmopressin and D5W if I overshoot, because overcorrection risks ODS even when the absolute sodium is not extremely low [^d4610886] [^b072557f] [^3e6d9ba7] [^7cdd2350].

> For moderate symptoms or sodium 125 mEq/L with concerning features, I should confirm whether to use hypertonic saline. Some guidelines advise considering 3% saline in this scenario, but I need to ensure careful monitoring and respect correction limits. If I choose hypertonic therapy, I will use boluses rather than continuous infusion to reduce overcorrection risk, and I will reassess frequently [^9b935b38] [^3e6d9ba7].

> For asymptomatic or mild symptoms, I should avoid hypertonic saline and prioritize cause-specific therapy. Let me think about first-line options: fluid restriction to about 500–1000 mL/day for SIADH, isotonic saline for hypovolemia, and strict fluid restriction with disease-directed therapy for hypervolemic states. I should double-check that fluid restriction is less effective when urine osmolality is very high, in which case urea or a vaptan may be needed as second-line therapy [^5d817d8e] [^34cb0cd6] [^09dfc4bb].

> I need to ensure I set safe correction limits and monitoring cadence. For chronic hyponatremia, I should target no more than 8 mEq/L in 24 hours in high-risk patients and no more than 10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours in standard-risk patients, with hard stops at 10 mEq/L total in 24 hours in many guidelines. I should check sodium every 6 hours during active correction and daily once stable, and I should calculate projected changes using Adrogué–Madias or similar tools to anticipate trajectory and avoid overshooting [^939d0f17] [^7cdd2350] [^18482b1c].

> But wait, what if the patient has cirrhosis or advanced liver disease? I should confirm a lower correction target of 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours and not exceed 8 mEq/L, given the high risk of ODS. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day is reasonable in severe hyponatremia, and I should avoid therapies that solely raise sodium without addressing volume status, such as saline in hypervolemic patients [^c6181535] [^8017b6b4] [^de7550dd].

> Let me reconsider SIADH-specific management. Fluid restriction is first-line, but if urine osmolality exceeds about 500 mOsm/kg or sodium fails to rise, I should add urea 30–60 g/day in divided doses or consider a vasopressin antagonist like tolvaptan, while watching closely for overly rapid aquaresis and relowering with desmopressin if needed. I should confirm that tolvaptan is not first-line in profound hyponatremia due to overcorrection risk, and I must avoid it in liver disease where indicated [^34cb0cd6] [^09dfc4bb] [^d4b25184].

> For exercise-associated hyponatremia, I should double-check that fluid restriction is critical and that oral hypertonic sodium can be effective in mild cases. If altered mental status is present, 100 mL 3% saline boluses repeated up to three times are recommended, with the same caution to avoid overcorrection and to monitor frequently when feasible [^102f8b73] [^fd6fc5f5].

> I should confirm medication contributors and stop offending agents when possible. Thiazides, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and eslicarbazepine can cause clinically significant hyponatremia, and dose reduction or discontinuation often normalizes sodium within days, which can simplify management and reduce the need for aggressive correction [^10636a38] [^c7c99a85] [^b2b05706].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal planning. Once sodium stabilizes, I should continue cause-directed therapy, reassess volume status, and taper monitoring as appropriate. If I used hypertonic saline, I should transition to fluid restriction or oral therapies to consolidate gains, and I should educate the patient to avoid excessive free water intake and to recognize recurrent symptoms early [^19dbc176] [^90dd948b].

For hyponatremia at 125 mEq/L, **start with isotonic saline if hypovolemic** [^1438df03] and **fluid restriction if euvolemic or hypervolemic** [^5d817d8e] [^86adf319]. Use **3% hypertonic saline only for severe symptoms** (seizures, coma) [^d4610886] to raise sodium by 4–6 mEq/L rapidly, then stop and switch to slower correction [^3e6d9ba7]. Limit total correction to **≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours** in high-risk patients (chronic, liver disease, malnutrition) [^939d0f17] and ≤ 10–12 mEq/L in others [^cf662663] to avoid osmotic demyelination [^19dbc176]. Monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially, then daily once stable [^f94a3f7a] [^18482b1c]. Treat the underlying cause and adjust therapy based on volume status and response [^834f4760].

---

## Initial assessment and classification

- **Confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia**: Measure serum osmolality to exclude pseudohyponatremia (hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia) [^19dbc176].

- **Classify severity**: Moderate hyponatremia is 125–129 mEq/L; severe is < 125 mEq/L or with severe symptoms (seizures, coma) [^9f3f9f1f] [^1438df03].

- **Determine acuity**: Acute (< 48 hours) vs chronic (> 48 hours or unknown duration) [^d4b25184].

- **Assess volume status**: Hypovolemic, euvolemic (e.g. SIADH), or hypervolemic (e.g. heart failure, cirrhosis) [^19dbc176].

---

## General principles of management

- **Treat the underlying cause**: Address the cause (e.g. stop thiazides, treat adrenal insufficiency, manage heart failure/cirrhosis) [^4589f127].

- **Correct slowly**: Avoid rapid correction to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) [^19dbc176].

- **Monitor closely**: Frequent sodium checks during correction [^18482b1c].

---

## Specific treatment strategies based on volume status

| **Volume status** | **Recommended treatment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) | Restores volume, suppresses ADH, and corrects sodium [^17100407] |
| Euvolemic (SIADH) | Fluid restriction (≤ 1,000 mL/day) | Reduces free water intake and increases sodium [^5d817d8e] |
| Hypervolemic (heart failure, cirrhosis) | Fluid restriction and disease-specific therapy | Reduces free water and treats the cause [^86adf319] |

---

## Role of hypertonic saline (3% NaCl)

Hypertonic saline is **reserved for severe symptoms** (seizures, coma) [^d4610886] to rapidly raise sodium by 4–6 mEq/L [^3e6d9ba7]. Give 100–150 mL boluses over 10–20 minutes, repeated up to three times if needed, then stop and switch to slower correction. It is not routine at 125 mEq/L without severe symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Correction limits and monitoring

Limit total correction to **≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours** in high-risk patients (chronic, liver disease, malnutrition, alcoholism) [^939d0f17] and ≤ 10–12 mEq/L in others [^cf662663]. Monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially, then daily once stable [^f94a3f7a] [^18482b1c].

---

## Special considerations

- **Chronic hyponatremia**: Correct even more slowly (≤ 4–6 mEq/L/day) in cirrhosis or high risk of ODS [^c6181535].

- **Medication-induced hyponatremia**: Stop offending drugs (e.g. thiazides, SSRIs, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) [^10636a38] [^c7c99a85].

- **Exercise-associated hyponatremia**: Fluid restriction and oral hypertonic solutions for mild cases; hypertonic saline for severe symptoms [^102f8b73] [^fd6fc5f5].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia and classify severity/acuity** [^19dbc176].

- **Treat based on volume status**: isotonic saline for hypovolemia; fluid restriction for euvolemic/hypervolemic [^17100407] [^5d817d8e].

- **Reserve hypertonic saline for severe symptoms**, correct 4–6 mEq/L rapidly, then stop [^d4610886].

- **Limit total correction** to ≤ 8 mEq/L/day in high-risk patients, ≤ 10–12 mEq/L/day in others [^939d0f17] [^cf662663].

- **Monitor sodium closely** and treat the underlying cause [^18482b1c] [^4589f127].

---

At 125 mEq/L, **most patients do not need hypertonic saline**; use isotonic saline or fluid restriction based on volume status, correct slowly, and monitor closely to avoid ODS [^1438df03].

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^c932362c]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of < 135 mEq/L, is a water balance disorder, with a relative excess of body water in relation to sodium. Some reports have classified SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L as "profound" hyponatremia. Since profound hyponatremia is also associated with fatal complications such as brain herniation, appropriate treatments for hyponatremia have been discussed intensively worldwide. For example, urgent therapy using hypertonic saline is justified in life-threatening conditions caused by hyponatremia complicated with seizures and coma. In contrast, the problem of overcorrection makes the treatment of hyponatremia difficult because it can provoke osmotic demyelination (ODS), which is a dreaded neurologic complication associated with high mortality. Therefore, the international guidelines recommend limiting the increase of SNa to within 10 mEq/L and 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively, from the initiation of treatment for hyponatremia. To achieve the ideal correction rate of hyponatremia, several strategies including administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), 3% hypertonic saline in combination with DDAVP, and re-lowering the SNa with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) have been introduced. However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk factors for overcorrection, especially in "Chronic" profound hyponatremia, which carries a greater risk of neurologic complications from overcorrection, even though several risk factors for ODS have been identified, including SNa ≤ 105 mEq/L at presentation, overcorrection itself, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and liver disease. We hypothesized that the identification of risk factors for overcorrection can improve the safety and efficacy of the treatment of chronic hyponatremia.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^29b08b61]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Aims

The aim of this study was to determine the risks for overcorrection during the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia to provide physicians with additional information on the safe and ideal treatment of hyponatremia.

Setting

This was a single-center retrospective cohort study, conducted by reviewing the medical records of a 520-bed teaching hospital (St. Luke's International Hospital).

Study patients

Consecutive patients with chronic profound hyponatremia, who were attended to by nephrologists, and treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) between February 2012 and April 2014, were included. Chronic hyponatremia was defined as hyponatremia that was documented to exist > 48 h. If the duration could not be identified, we considered it as chronic. Among the 64 patients who were admitted to the ICU with Sna ≤ 125 mEq/L, we excluded 8 who were not treated for hyponatremia by nephrologists. This exclusion ensured that treatment and data gathering were uniform throughout the study. Finally, 56 consecutive patients with SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L were included in the present study. The number of patients was confirmed using the treatment list of our department, as well as the electrical patient records of the hospital.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^81ecfb0a]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains.

The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^5ab69a88]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Even with abundant evidence for osmotic demyelination in patients with hyponatremia, the risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. Therefore the purpose of this study is to clarify the risks for overcorrection during the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia.

Methods

This is a single-center retrospective observational study. We enrolled 56 adult patients with a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of ≤ 125 mEq/L who were treated in an intensive care unit by nephrologists using a locally developed, fixed treatment algorithm between February 2012 and April 2014. The impact of patient parameters on the incidence of overcorrection was estimated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Overcorrection was defined as an increase of SNa by > 10 mEq/L and > 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively.

Results

The median age was 78 years, 48.2% were male, and 94.6% of the patients presented with symptoms associated with hyponatremia. The initial median SNa was 115 mEq/L (quartile, 111–119 mEq/L). A total of 11 (19.6%) patients met the criteria for overcorrection with 9 (16.0%) occurring at 24 h, 6 (10.7%) at 48 h, and 4 (7.1%) at both 24 and 48 h. However, none of these patients developed osmotic demyelination. Primary polydipsia, initial SNa, and early urine output were the significant risk factors for overcorrection on univariable analysis. Multivariable analysis revealed that the initial SNa had a statistically significant impact on the incidence of overcorrection with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.98; p = 0.037) for every 1 mEq/L increase. Additionaly, the increase in SNa during the first 4 h and early urine output were significantly higher in patients with overcorrection than in those without (p = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively).

Conclusions

An initial low level of SNa was associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with profound hyponatremia. In this regard, the rapid increase in SNa during the first 4 h may play an important role.

### Oxcarbazepine [^10636a38]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hyponatremia

Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) can develop during oxcarbazepine use. In the 14 controlled epilepsy studies 2.5% of oxcarbazepine-treated patients (38/1,524) had a sodium of less than 125 mmol/L at some point during treatment, compared to no such patients assigned placebo or active control (carbamazepine and phenobarbital for adjunctive and monotherapy substitution studies, and phenytoin and valproate for the monotherapy initiation studies). Clinically significant hyponatremia generally occurred during the first 3 months of treatment with oxcarbazepine, although there were patients who first developed a serum sodium < 125 mmol/L more than 1 year after initiation of therapy. Most patients who developed hyponatremia were asymptomatic but patients in the clinical trials were frequently monitored and some had their oxcarbazepine dose reduced, discontinued, or had their fluid intake restricted for hyponatremia. Whether or not these maneuvers prevented the occurrence of more severe events is unknown. Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been reported during postmarketing use. In clinical trials, patients whose treatment with oxcarbazepine was discontinued due to hyponatremia generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.

Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered for patients during maintenance treatment with oxcarbazepine, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels (e.g., drugs associated with inappropriate ADH secretion) or if symptoms possibly indicating hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity).

5.2 Anaphylactic Reactions and Angioedema

Rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema involving the larynx, glottis, lips and eyelids have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of oxcarbazepine. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If a patient develops any of these reactions after treatment with oxcarbazepine, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. These patients should not be rechallenged with the drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^8c9ce4c2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^5180895f]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7a0afd8d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^1b780606]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

Table 2.
Prevalence of hyponatremia — summary of key studies in adults

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands of nearly 3000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250 000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium of less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%. An outlying US study of nearly 200 000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring 2 sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L. There are specific patient subgroups with a higher risk of moderate-profound hyponatremia — for example, following pituitary surgery, where a meta-analysis showed 5.6% cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies do seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia such as increased serum lipids or proteins, or erroneous results from hemolyzed or contaminated blood samples, are not specifically excluded.

Patients and methods

Study plan

The study design has been described previously in detail. In brief, patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia were enrolled from 146 US sites and 79 EU sites. For the present publication, only patients initially assessed as clinically euvolemic were analyzed. The study was exclusively observational; no standardized diagnostic or treatment protocols were imposed.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Only patients with clinically meaningful hyponatremia ([Na +] ≤ 130 mEq/L) and physician-diagnosed euvolemia were enrolled. In a pre-specified adjudication process, individuals whose medical file reports were inconsistent with the diagnosis of euvolemia were excluded.

Statistical methods

Mild hyponatremia was defined as 130mEq/ L ≥ [Na +] > 125 mEq/L, moderate hyponatremia as 125 mEq/L ≥ [Na +] ≥ 120 mEq/L, and severe hyponatremia as [Na +] < 120 mEq/L. Overly rapid correction of [Na +] was defined as an increase > 12 mEq/L in any 24-h interval or > 18 mEq/L in any 48-h interval. Rate of change of [Na +] was calculated as the total increment in [Na +] during the treatment divided by the number of treatment days.

Categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test. In the case of more than two comparison groups, an overall chi-square test was done before performing individual pairwise chi-square tests

Nonparametric analysis was performed for continuous variables. In case of more than two comparison groups, a Kruskal-Wallis test was done to generate an overall test for equality of medians followed by pairwise group comparisons. For comparisons of only two groups, medians were compared using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. P values were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^19dbc176]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^957d6d78]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Study limitations

This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size of 56 patients. Some patients with chronic profound hyponatremia may have been admitted to the general ward and treated by general physicians, without the involvement of nephrologists. Second, the definition of overcorrection varies among studies. Finally, we ourselves designed the algorithm used in hyponatremia treatment. The protocol basically complied with international guideline recommendations for the treatment of chronic profound hyponatremia, although we did employ an exceptionally aggressive strategy involving continuous administration of 3% hypertonic saline in some situations to avoid under-treatment. In addition, the purpose of this standardized algorithm was not to recommend our treatment protocol to other institutions, but to make our results comparable to other studies. The appropriateness of applying diagnostic algorithms to treat hyponatremia remains to be studied, and physiology-based treatment must always be kept in mind. Our data should be interpreted in the light of these limitations.

5.1

	 Hyponatremia

Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) can develop during TRILEPTAL use. In the 14 controlled epilepsy studies, 2.5% of TRILEPTAL-treated patients (38/1524) had a sodium of less than 125 mmol/L at some point during treatment, compared to no such patients assigned placebo or active control (carbamazepine and phenobarbital for adjunctive and monotherapy substitution studies, and phenytoin and valproate for the monotherapy initiation studies). Clinically significant hyponatremia generally occurred during the first 3 months of treatment with TRILEPTAL, although there were patients who first developed a serum sodium < 125 mmol/L more than 1 year after initiation of therapy. Most patients who developed hyponatremia were asymptomatic, but patients in the clinical trials were frequently monitored and some had their TRILEPTAL dose reduced, discontinued, or had their fluid intake restricted for hyponatremia. Whether or not these maneuvers prevented the occurrence of more severe events is unknown. Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been reported during postmarketing use. In clinical trials, patients whose treatment with TRILEPTAL was discontinued due to hyponatremia generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.

Measurement of serum sodium levels should be considered for patients during maintenance treatment with TRILEPTAL, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels (e.g., drugs associated with inappropriate ADH secretion), or if symptoms possibly indicating hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity).

Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If a patient develops any of these reactions after treatment with TRILEPTAL, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. These patients should not be rechallenged with the drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^69c2c422]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. Hyponatraemia is present in 15–20% of emergency admissions to hospital and occurs in up to 20% of critically ill patients. Symptomatology may vary from subtle to severe or even life threatening. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. Against this background, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology and the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association, represented by European Renal Best Practice have developed a Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^be330dd8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of overcorrection

Risk factors for ODS included an initial SNa of < 105 mEq/L and overcorrection. International guidelines recommend avoidance of overcorrection in the management of patients with hyponatremia; however, risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. In contrast, avoidance of overcorrection or ODS may lead to prolonged or inadequate management of patients with hyponatremia, leading to undercorrection in clinical practice. We need to develop an optimal treatment strategy to assure a safe correction rate of SNa to achieve an appropriate correction while avoiding overcorrection. With this point of view, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the risk factors for overcorrection and believe that our results will guide physicians in the management of these patients. Our study revealed that a low level of SNa at presentation was associated with overcorrection, with an adjusted OR of 1.19 for every 1 mEq/L decrease (0.84 for every 1 mEq/L increase). This meant that a 4 mEq/L lower SNa level doubled the risk of overcorrection. Although several previous retrospective studies have indicated that the SNa at presentation was lower in patients with overcorrection compared to those without, a direct association between the SNa levels and risk of overcorrection has not been evaluated previously. Our results alert clinicians to be cautious of the incremental risk of overcorrection when patients present with low SNa levels.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^71e6b1d1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^e1611723]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Therapy periods are defined as the time interval during which a patient received only the single therapy (monotherapy) or combination specified. Patients could have had multiple episodes and multiple therapies during the hospital stay. Initial therapy refers to the first treatment given specifically for HN. Conivaptan was used initially in only 6 patients and urea was used in only 10 but never as initial therapy. Thus, we were unable to quantitate response to these agents. For purposes of categorizing initial [Na +], mild HN was defined as 130 mEq/l ⩾[Na +] > 125 mEq/l, moderate HN as 125 mEq/l ⩾[Na +] ⩾120 mEq/l, and severe HN as 120 mEq/l > [Na +]. Overly rapid correction of [Na +] was defined as an increase > 12 mEq/l in any 24-h interval or > 18 mEq/l in any 48-h interval. Rate of change of [Na +] was calculated as the total increment in [Na +] during the period the treatment was utilized divided by the number of treatment days. For patients who received no treatment, the interval during which the patient was hyponatremic was used. The incremental [Na +] change during the first day of treatment was calculated as the difference in [Na +] values at the end and the beginning of the first 24 ± 12 h window. The actual interval for any individual patient ranged from 12 to 36 h, depending on the timing of the reported laboratory values. Patients who lacked paired values during this interval were excluded from this analysis. Duration of the initial course of HN therapy was determined by subtracting the treatment day number of the first day the initial HN therapy was used from the treatment day number of the day the treatment ended and adding one.

### Oxcarbazepine (Oxtellar xr) [^6a0ab0b3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hyponatremia

Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) may develop during Oxtellar XR use. Serum sodium levels less than 125 mmol/L have occurred in immediate-release oxcarbazepine-treated patients generally in the first three months of treatment. However, clinically significant hyponatremia may develop more than a year after initiating therapy.

Most immediate-release oxcarbazepine-treated patients who developed hyponatremia were asymptomatic in clinical trials. However, some of these patients had their dosage reduced, discontinued, or had their fluid intake restricted for hyponatremia. Serum sodium levels returned toward normal when the dosage was reduced or discontinued, or when the patient was treated conservatively (e.g., fluid restriction). Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been reported during post-marketing use of immediate-release oxcarbazepine.

Among treated patients in a controlled trial of adjunctive therapy with Oxtellar XR in 366 adults with complex partial seizures, 1 patient receiving 2400 mg experienced a severe reduction in serum sodium (117 mEq/L) requiring discontinuation from treatment, while 2 other patients receiving 1200 mg experienced serum sodium concentrations low enough (125 and 126 mEq/L) to require discontinuation from treatment. The overall incidence of clinically significant hyponatremia in patients treated with Oxtellar XR was 1.2%, although slight shifts in serum sodium concentrations from Normal to Low (< 135 mEq/L) were observed for the 2400 mg (6.5%) and 1200 mg (9.8%) groups compared to placebo (1.7%).

Measure serum sodium concentrations if patients develop symptoms of hyponatremia (e.g., nausea, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, obtunded consciousness, or increase in seizure frequency or severity). Consider measurement of serum sodium concentrations during treatment with Oxtellar XR, particularly if the patient receives concomitant medications known to decrease serum sodium levels (for example, drugs associated with inappropriate ADH secretion).

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^6b476f5f]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this single-center retrospective observational study, we investigated the risk factors for overcorrection by enrolling 56 patients with chronic profound hyponatremia who underwent standardized therapeutic strategies including DDAVP administration at our institution. We found two clinically important observations. First, an initial low level of SNa was a statistically significant risk factor for overcorrection. Second, the rapid increase in the first 4 h of the treatment might be responsible for the overcorrection, as suggested by Fig. 2.

### Disorders of salt and water balance after pituitary surgery [^410a7813]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

We propose an algorithm for the management of delayed hyponatremia after pituitary surgery (Fig. 2). Asymptomatic mild to moderate hyponatremia (sodium ≥ 125 mmol/L) can often be managed as an outpatient, with strict fluid restriction of 500 to 1000 mL/24 hours and close monitoring of plasma sodium until improvement is seen. In patients who have symptomatic or profound hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L), hospitalization is recommended.

Figure 2.
Proposed algorithm for the management of delayed hyponatremia secondary to SIAD following pituitary surgery. a Secondary to postoperative SIAD, exclude other causes first, including adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, infection, exogenous desmopressin administration, or other medications. b If chronic hyponatremia (> 48 hours duration, or unknown duration), avoid overcorrection and aim increase in plasma sodium by < 10 mmol/L over the initial 24 hours, and < 18 mmol/L over the initial 48 hours. c When used in combination with frusemide, fluid restriction < 1000 mL/day has been associated with acute kidney injury. d Urea 30 to 60 g daily in divided doses. e Monitor kidney function (using creatinine, not urea) in patients taking urea. f Tolvaptan 7.5 mg as single dose (can be repeated if required) if low risk of complications from overcorrection of plasma sodium (including acute hyponatremia of known < 48 hours duration, plasma sodium > 120 mmol/L). g Hypertonic saline recommended as per guidelines.

Patients with moderate asymptomatic hyponatremia (sodium 125–129 mmol/L) can be managed with aggressive fluid restriction (500 mL/24 hours) initially, with or without the addition of oral urea therapy, if available. In those with inadequate improvement on fluid restriction alone, or with profound hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mmol/L) who remain asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, combined treatment with fluid restriction and urea remains appropriate. Fluid restriction and urea can be relaxed once the plasma sodium exceeds 132 mmol/L, or if there are signs of DI developing. Patients with plasma sodium < 120 mmol/L or neurological symptoms should be managed with hypertonic saline with the aim to raise the plasma sodium promptly and improve symptoms. Thereafter, fluid restriction and urea may be sufficient as continuing therapy. Tolvaptan may also be considered for moderate hyponatremia depending on availability. If tolvaptan is administered, the patient should be encouraged to drink to thirst to limit overcorrection from induced aquaresis.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Eslicarbazepine acetate [^b2b05706]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Hyponatremia

Clinically significant hyponatremia (sodium < 125 mEq/L) can develop in patients taking eslicarbazepine acetate. Measurement of serum sodium and chloride levels should be considered during maintenance treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate, particularly if the patient is receiving other medications known to decrease serum sodium levels, and should be performed if symptoms of hyponatremia develop (e.g., nausea/vomiting, malaise, headache, lethargy, confusion, irritability, muscle weakness/spasms, obtundation, or increase in seizure frequency or severity). Cases of symptomatic hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) have been reported during postmarketing use. In clinical trials, patients whose treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate was discontinued because of hyponatremia generally experienced normalization of serum sodium within a few days without additional treatment.

In the controlled adult adjunctive epilepsy trials, 4/415 patients (1.0%) treated with 800 mg and 6/410 (1.5%) patients treated with 1,200 mg of eslicarbazepine acetate had at least one serum sodium value less than 125 mEq/L, compared to none of the patients assigned to placebo. A higher percentage of eslicarbazepine acetate-treated patients (5.1%) than placebo-treated patients (0.7%) experienced decreases in sodium values of more than 10 mEq/L. These effects were dose-related and generally appeared within the first 8 weeks of treatment (as early as after 3 days). Serious, life-threatening complications were reported with eslicarbazepine acetate-associated hyponatremia (as low as 112 mEq/L) including seizures, severe nausea/vomiting leading to dehydration, severe gait instability, and injury. Some patients required hospitalization and discontinuation of eslicarbazepine acetate. Concurrent hypochloremia was also present in patients with hyponatremia. Hyponatremia was also observed in adult monotherapy trials and in pediatric trials. Depending on the severity of hyponatremia, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate may need to be reduced or discontinued.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review… [^c9242bcd]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality. Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency.

US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^bcbfb0d7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. – Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

Table 1
Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated, regardless of outcome. Data on 56 patients obtained from 40 medical centers confirmed that outcomes depend on the chronicity of hyponatremia, as previously defined: While none of the 18 patients with acute hyponatremia suffered complications, regardless of correction rate, 14 of 28 patients with chronic hyponatremia corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours developed post-therapeutic neurologic complications; in most, the clinical course was consistent with CPM (a delayed onset of neurologic symptoms beginning 2–6 days after initial improvement), but only three had CPM documented by imaging. The amount of correction over 48 hours was also associated with post-therapeutic complications: 14 of 27 chronic patients (52%) corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours were affected. All patients corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours had also been corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, and all but one corrected by < 12 mmol/L in 24 hours were corrected by < 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.

Heat and cold illness in travelers — exercise-associated hyponatremia recognition and initial treatment: Symptoms of heat exhaustion and early exercise-associated hyponatremia are similar, including anorexia, nausea, emesis, headache, muscle weakness, and lethargy, but hyponatremia symptoms can progress to confusion, seizures, and coma, and hyponatremia can be distinguished by persistent alteration of mental status without elevated body temperature, delayed onset of major neurologic symptoms, or deterioration hours after cessation of exercise and removal from heat; where resources are available, clinicians can measure the patient's serum sodium to diagnose hyponatremia and guide treatment. Treating clinicians should restrict fluid if hyponatremia is suspected; if the patient is conscious and can tolerate oral intake, clinicians should give salty snacks with sips of water or a solution of concentrated broth (2–4 bouillon cubes in 125 mL or 1/2 cup of water), whereas obtunded hyponatremic patients require intravenous hypertonic saline.

Data collected on hospital admission included date of hospitalization, admitting diagnosis, demographics (age, sex, and race), details on HF condition (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] and New York Heart Association classification), and history of HN (including number of hospitalizations in the past year and acuity of onset of HN, when available). Additional data points collected are described in the methods paper. 20 Creatinine clearance was used as a measure of renal function in order to standardize data collection across international sites. "No specific treatment" was used to describe patients who received no specific therapy for HN.

Patients were excluded from analysis if [Na +] was ≤ 130 mEq/L for a duration < 24 hours to avoid individuals with spurious laboratory values, and if the diagnosis of HF was accompanied by a diagnosis of euvolemia. The prespecified definitions of correction (ie, "clinically meaningful") included: achievement of [Na +] ≥ 130 or ≥ 135 mEq/L, or an increase ≥ 5 mEq/L. Therapy periods were defined as the time interval during which a patient received only the single therapy (monotherapy) or specified combination. Initial therapy refers to the first treatment given specifically for HN.

For purposes of categorizing initial [Na +] within the context of the HN Registry, HN was analyzed according to 3 ranges of [Na +]: > 125–130, between 120 and 125, and < 120 mEq/L. Overly rapid correction of [Na +] was defined as an increase > 12 mEq/L in any 24‐hour interval or > 18 mEq/L in any 48‐hour interval consistent with current guidelines. 22 For each HN treatment received by patients, LOS was calculated from the day HN was first treated to better understand the impact of treatment for HN, and was not calculated for patients receiving no specific therapy for HN. Data analyses included comparisons for age, race, HF with preserved LVEF (HFpEF) versus reduced LVEF (HFrEF; defined as LVEF ≤ 45%), rate of [Na +] change, and HN on admission versus HN developed in the hospital. Creatinine clearance comparisons were made at the start and end of an episode, and at both admission and discharge as long as values were available for weights and creatinine values at both time points. The database recorded an age of 90 years for all patients > 89. No data were collected postdischarge.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^46c6af11]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia

Recent guidelines define hyponatraemia as a serum sodium < 135 mmol/L, with 130–135 mmol/L, 125–129 mmol/L and < 125 mmol/L, constituting mild, moderate and severe hyponatraemia, respectively. A prospective population survey among patients with cirrhosis found serum sodium < 130 mmol/L in 21.6%. Hyponatraemia has been associated with higher prevalence of refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, HRS and mortality. Acknowledging this, the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score now incorporates serum sodium (MELD-Na). Those with cirrhosis and chronic hyponatraemia are often asymptomatic and seldom need treatment.

Both hypovolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia is observed in cirrhosis. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia results from overzealous diuretic therapy, being characterised by a prolonged negative sodium balance with marked loss of extracellular fluid. Its management requires expansion of plasma volume with normal saline and cessation of diuretics. Most hepatologists would discontinue diuretics if serum sodium is < 125 mmol/L.

Given the better efficacy of tolvaptan and HS in individual treatment episodes, data were pooled and examined to determine if initial therapy containing one of these two highly effective compounds, either as monotherapy or in conjunction with slower acting therapies, was effective in increasing [Na +]. With a tolvaptan-containing therapy, 59 and 53% of patients with a starting [Na +] of ≤ 125 mEq/L or < 120 mEq/L, respectively, achieved a [Na +] > 130 mEq/L, while HS-containing therapies, and the slow-acting treatments, succeeded in only 18%/5% and 17%/14%, respectively (P < 0.01, Fig. 2). The time needed to increase [Na +] to > 130 mEq/L in the patients who met this goal was 2 days for tolvaptan- and HS-containing treatments, but 4 days for other treatments (P < 0.01).

### Urea for the treatment of hyponatremia [^4d66dcbc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Current therapies for hyponatremia have variable effectiveness and tolerability, and in certain instances, they are very expensive. We examined the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of urea for the treatment of inpatient hyponatremia.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

We identified all patients hospitalized at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between July 2016 and August 2017 with hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 135 mEq/L) who received urea, including a subgroup of patients who received urea as the sole drug therapy for hyponatremia (urea-only treated). We matched urea only-treated patients to a group of patients with hyponatremia who did not receive urea (urea untreated) and compared changes in plasma sodium at 24 hours and the end of therapy as well as the proportion of patients who achieved plasma sodium ≥ 135 mEq/L. We abstracted data on adverse events and reported side effects of urea.

Results

Fifty-eight patients received urea (7.5–90 g/d) over a median of 4.5 (interquartile range, 3–8) days and showed an increase in plasma sodium from 124 mEq/L (interquartile range, 122–126) to 131 mEq/L (interquartile range, 127–134; P < 0.001). Among 12 urea only-treated patients, plasma sodium increased from 125 mEq/L (interquartile range, 122–127) to 131 mEq/L (interquartile range, 129–136; P = 0.001) by the end of urea therapy. There was a larger increase in plasma sodium at 24 hours in urea only-treated patients compared with urea-untreated patients (2.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, 0–4.5 versus -0.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, -2.5 to 1.5; P = 0.04), with no difference in change in plasma sodium by the end of therapy (6 mEq/L; interquartile range, 3.5–10 versus 5.5 mEq/L; interquartile range, 3–7.5; P = 0.51). A greater proportion of urea only-treated patients achieved normonatremia, but this difference was not statistically significant (33% versus 8%; P = 0.08). No patients experienced overly rapid correction of plasma sodium, and no serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Urea seems effective and safe for the treatment of inpatient hyponatremia, and it is well tolerated.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### A randomized trial of empagliflozin to increase plasma sodium levels in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^ea02c860]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment options to address the hyponatremia induced by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) are inadequate. The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin promotes osmotic diuresis via urinary glucose excretion and therefore, might offer a novel treatment option for SIAD.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized trial, we recruited 88 hospitalized patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia < 130 mmol/L at the University Hospital Basel from September 2016 until January 2019 and assigned patients to receive, in addition to standard fluid restriction of < 1000 ml/24 h, a once-daily dose of oral empagliflozin or placebo for 4 days. The primary end point was the absolute change in plasma sodium concentration after 4 days of treatment. Secondary end points included predisposing factors for treatment response and safety of the intervention.

Results

Of the 87 patients who completed the trial, 43 (49%) received treatment with empagliflozin, and 44 (51%) received placebo. Baseline plasma sodium concentrations were similar for the two groups (median 125.5 mmol/L for the empaflozin group and median 126 mmol/L for the placebo group). Patients treated with empagliflozin had a significantly higher increase of median plasma sodium concentration compared with those receiving placebo (10 versus 7 mmol/L, respectively; P = 0.04). Profound hyponatremia (< 125 mmol/L) and lower baseline osmolality levels increased the likelihood of response to treatment with empagliflozin. Treatment was well tolerated, and no events of hypoglycemia or hypotension occurred among those receiving empagliflozin.

Conclusions

Among hospitalized patients with SIAD treated with fluid restriction, those who received empagliflozin had a larger increase in plasma sodium levels compared with those who received placebo. This finding indicates that empagliflozin warrants further study as a treatment for the disorder.

### Euvolemic hyponatremia in cancer patients. report of the hyponatremia registry: an observational multicenter international study [^f523fd09]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

All employed therapies except tolvaptan appeared to be less efficacious in the cancer group as compared to the non-cancer group. Two major reasons may account for this. Firstly, SIADH may be transient and a spontaneous improvement in hyponatremia would be credited in our analysis to any simultaneously administered hyponatremia treatment. Hyponatremia secondary to cancer is less likely to be transient in the short-term. Secondly, it is well known that the effectiveness of the most frequently used therapy, FR, is reduced with higher urine osmolality; the median urine osmolality was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the cancer group (440 mOsm/kg H 2 O) than in the non-cancer group (390 mOsm/kg H 2 O). Furthermore, NS is also known to be ineffective or counterproductive in SIADH and worsening of hyponatremia is expected with higher urine osmolality. In contrast, the predicted effect of a pharmacological approach that blocks the vasopressin effect is largely independent of baseline urine osmolality.

Consistent with what has been previously published, our data indicate that treatment response is more pronounced with lower baseline [Na +] values, irrespective of the employed therapy. This should be taken into consideration when choosing a treatment in patients with moderate/severe hyponatremia.

Since hyponatremia hampers anti-tumor therapy, affects quality of life, interferes with treatment, and often leads to unwanted hospital admissions or prolonged hospital stays, rapid control of [Na +] is desirable. The rate of reaching a safe [Na +] level in patients with clinically relevant hyponatremia ([Na +] ≤ 125 mEq/L) was 3 times as high if the initial therapy contained tolvaptan than with treatments containing only slower-acting therapies or HS-containing therapies. The time needed to reach a [Na +] > 130 mEq/L was significantly shorter (2 days) with a tolvaptan-containing therapy than with less effective therapies (4 days) (P < 0.01).

In addition, among the 56 patients, 6 (11%) from the "no-overcorrection" group died during hospitalization due to infectious disease (n = 4) or cancer (n = 2). Both of these conditions may have caused hyponatremia in these patients. Among the 50 patients who were discharged alive, 12 were lost to follow-up partly because they were referred to their family doctors or because they cancelled their outpatient visits unexpectedly. Among the 38 patients who were ultimately followed-up at our institution, there were no re-hospitalizations due to hyponatremia within a median follow-up of 822 (quartile, 199–1411) days.

### Clinical and organizational factors in the initial evaluation of patients with lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^68a56514]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer — SIADH: Approximately 10% to 45% of SCLC and 1% of other lung cancer cases produce arginine vasopressin, but only 1% to 5% of patients with lung cancer have symptomatic SIADH; at serum sodium concentrations of 125 to 130 mEq/L patients usually experience symptoms, and when serum sodium levels drop to < 120 mEq/L life-threatening manifestations may ensue. Diagnostic features include hyponatremia (serum sodium < 134 mEq/L), hyposmolality (plasma osmolality, < 275 mosm/kg), inappropriately high urine osmolality (> 500 mosm/kg), inappropriately high urinary sodium concentration (> 20 mEq/L), and absence of hypothyroidism or adrenal insufficiency or volume depletion; further evaluation notes that by assessing effective arterial blood volume with the fractional excretion of urate the accuracy of a diagnostic algorithm for SIADH can approach 95%, and laboratory findings include urine osmolality of > 300 mosm/kg, urinary sodium level of > 40 mEq/L, serum osmolality of < 275 mosm/kg, and serum uric acid concentration of < 4 mg/dL. There are no evidence-based guidelines and recommended management is based on expert opinion; fluid water restriction (< 1 L/d) is a first-line treatment of asymptomatic mild SIADH and a recommended adjunct to other therapy for severe cases, hypertonic 3% saline IV is given in life-threatening or acute symptomatic and severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, and demeclocycline, lithium, and vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists (conivaptan, lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and satavaptan) may also be used to correct hyponatremia.

### Risk of overcorrection in rapid intermittent bolus vs slow continuous infusion therapies of hypertonic saline for patients with symptomatic hyponatremia: the SALSA randomized clinical trial [^3e6d9ba7]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Few high-quality studies have clarified whether hypertonic saline is best administered as slow continuous infusion (SCI) therapy or rapid intermittent bolus (RIB) therapy for symptomatic severe hyponatremia.

Objective

To compare the risk of overcorrection in RIB and SCI with hypertonic saline in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 178 patients older than 18 years with moderately severe to severe hyponatremia and glucose-corrected serum sodium (sNa) levels of 125 mmol/L or less. Recruitment took place from August 24, 2016, until August 21, 2019, across emergency departments and wards of 3 general hospitals in the Republic of Korea.

Interventions

Either RIB or SCI of hypertonic saline, 3%, for 24 to 48 hours stratified by the severity of clinical symptoms.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was overcorrection at any given period, defined as increase in the sNa level by greater than 12 or 18 mmol/L within 24 or 48 hours, respectively. Secondary and post hoc outcomes included efficacy and safety of the treatment approaches. The sNa concentrations were measured every 6 hours for 2 days.

Results

The 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [12.2] years; 80 (44.9%) male; mean [SD] sNa concentrations, 118.2 [5.0] mmol/L) were randomly assigned to the RIB group (n = 87) or the SCI group (n = 91). Overcorrection occurred in 15 of 87 (17.2%) and 22 of 91 (24.2%) patients in the RIB and SCI groups, respectively (absolute risk difference, -6.9% [95% CI, -18.8% to 4.9%]; P = 0.26). The RIB group showed lower incidence of relowering treatment than the SCI group (36 of 87 [41.4%] vs 52 of 91 [57.1%] patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, -15.8% [95% CI, -30.3% to -1.3%]; P = 0.04; number needed to treat, 6.3). Groups did not differ in terms of efficacy in increasing sNa concentrations nor improving symptoms, but RIB, when compared with SCI, showed better efficacy in achieving target correction rate within 1 hour (intention-to-treat analysis: 28 of 87 (32.2%) vs 16 of 91 (17.6%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 14.6% [95% CI, 2%-27.2%]; P = 0.02; number needed to treat, 6.8; per-protocol analysis: 21 of 72 (29.2%) vs 12 of 73 (16.4%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 12.7% [95% CI, -0.8% to 26.2%]; P = 0.07). The statistical significance of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were similar for all outcomes except for achieving the target correction rate within 1 hour.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that both RIB and SIC therapies of hypertonic saline for treating hyponatremia were effective and safe, with no difference in the overcorrection risk. However, RIB had a lower incidence of therapeutic relowering treatment and tended to have a better efficacy in achieving sNa within 1 hour than SCI. RIB could be suggested as the preferred treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, which is consistent with the current consensus guidelines.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — oral sodium options for mild/asymptomatic cases: Oral hypertonic solutions may increase serum sodium levels similar to an intravenous (IV) bolus of the same solution (100 mL of 3% sodium chloride) in runners with asymptomatic or mild EAH, and another study suggests that oral HTS reduces symptomatology from EAH faster than an IV bolus; symptomatic individuals with suspected EAH who are neurologically intact and have minimal nausea may respond favorably to an oral bolus of a hypertonic solution, such as concentrated broth (3–4 bouillon cubes [880 mg sodium per cube] in 125 mL [0.5 cup] of water) or 100 mL of HTS with flavoring; another option is 3 Top Ramen seasoning packets (contain 900 mg of sodium) ingested with 0.5 cup (125 mL) of water, and high sodium foods such as Rold Gold pretzels (450 mg per 23 g for a 17-pretzel serving size); oral sodium in hypertonic solutions or foods with high sodium content may increase serum sodium levels and enhance symptom relief (over fluid restriction) for mild EAH, if tolerated (Recommendation grade: 2B).

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^d18691e4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Hyponatremia and vasopressin antagonism in congestive heart failure [^bead57b1]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In a national heart failure registry, hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) was initially reported in 5% of patients and considered a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. In a chronic heart failure study, serum sodium level on admission predicted an increased length of stay for cardiovascular causes and increased mortality within 60 days of discharge. Hyponatremia in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with a higher mortality rate. Also, by monitoring and increasing serum sodium levels during hospitalization for CHF, patient outcomes may improve. This review describes the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in relation to CHF, including the mechanism of action of vasopressin receptors in the kidney, and assesses the preclinical and clinical trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists — agents recently developed to treat hyponatremia. In hospitalized patients with CHF, hyponatremia plays a major role in poor outcomes. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials in patients with hyponatremia.

### Hyponatraemia-treatment standard 2024 [^09dfc4bb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte disorder in hospital patients associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay and financial burden. The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Tolvaptan (Samsca) [^332cb295]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The dose of tolvaptan could be increased at 24-hour intervals to 30 mg once daily, then to 60 mg once daily, until either the maximum dose of 60 mg or normonatremia (serum sodium > 135 mEq/L) was reached. Serum sodium concentrations were determined at 8 hours after study drug initiation and daily up to 72 hours, within which time titration was typically completed. Treatment was maintained for 30 days with additional serum sodium assessments on Days 11, 18, 25 and 30. On the day of study discontinuation, all patients resumed previous therapies for hyponatremia and were reevaluated 7 days later. The primary endpoint for these studies was the average daily AUC for change in serum sodium from baseline to Day 4 and baseline to Day 30 in patients with a serum sodium less than 135 mEq/L. Compared to placebo, tolvaptan caused a statistically greater increase in serum sodium (p < 0.0001) during both periods in both studies (see Table 2). For patients with a serum sodium of < 130 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L, the effects at Day 4 and Day 30 remained significant (see Table 2). This effect was also seen across all disease etiology subsets (e.g. CHF, cirrhosis, SIADH/other).

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^6f2bee8d]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The present study identified that an initial low level of SNa was associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with profound hyponatremia. The rapid increase in SNa during the first 4 h may play an important role in overcorrection. It is also important to note that no ODS occurred in the present study, and that minimizing SNa increases is important to prevent ODS, even when overcorrection does occur.

### Osmotic demyelination syndrome in patients hospitalized with hyponatremia [^0cc0423c]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) is a rare but potentially devastating neurologic complication of hyponatremia. The primary objective of this study was to identify the proportion of patients who developed ODS in a large, contemporary, multicenter cohort of patients admitted to the hospital with hyponatremia. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of patients admitted with hyponatremia at five academic hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. All adult patients presenting with hyponatremia (serum sodium level 8 mmol/l in any 24-hour period). RESULTS: Our cohort included 22,858 hospitalizations with hyponatremia. Approximately 50% were women, the average age was 68 years, and mean initial serum sodium was 125 mmol/l (standard deviation, 4.6), including 11.9% with serum sodium from 110 to 119 mmol/l and 1.2% with serum sodium less than 110 mmol/l. Overall, rapid correction of serum sodium occurred in 3632 (17.7%) admissions. Twelve patients developed ODS (0.05%). Seven (58%) patients who developed ODS did not have rapid correction of serum sodium. CONCLUSIONS: In this large multicenter study of patients with hyponatremia, rapid correction of serum sodium was common (n = 3632 [17.7%]), but ODS was rare (n = 12 [0.05%]). Future studies with a higher number of patients with ODS are needed to better understand potential causal factors for ODS.

### Lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia [^343bcde4]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in the elderly. Lixivaptan, a new selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist, safely corrected serum sodium concentrations in phase II studies of patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. Here our multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study assessed the effect of lixivaptan on serum sodium concentrations in 106 initially hospitalized patients with euvolemic hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 mmol/l). Of them, 52 were randomized to receive placebo and 54 received 50 mg lixivaptan once daily and were then titrated to receive 25–100 mg once daily depending on serum sodium concentration. Fluid restriction was at the investigator's discretion. Initial titration occurred in a monitored inpatient setting; patients were then treated as outpatients for a total of 30 days. The primary end point was the change in serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7. Lixivaptan significantly increased the serum sodium concentration from baseline to day 7 (the primary end point) by 6.7 mmol/l compared with placebo (4.5 mmol/l; P = 0.034). Importantly, the serum sodium concentration was normalized safely and more rapidly in patients receiving lixivaptan than placebo (P = 0.004) and was well tolerated. After drug discontinuation, serum sodium concentrations decreased to near-baseline levels within 7 days. Thus, lixivaptan safely and effectively corrects serum sodium concentrations in patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

It is also possible to have dual pathology, hence an exception to the aforementioned classifications can occur in hypotonic hyponatremia with concurrent raised ineffective osmoles (eg, acute alcohol intoxication), which can lead to a measured osmolality that is normal or even elevated despite the hypotonic hyponatremia.

In this review, the term hyponatremia will refer to hypotonic hyponatremia unless otherwise stated.

Categorization of hypotonic hyponatremia varies, and usually considers both clinical symptoms and the absolute pNa concentration. Biochemically, European guidelines classify hyponatremia as mild (pNa 130–135 mmol/L), moderate (125–129 mmol/L), or profound (< 125 mmol/L). "Severe" hyponatremia is defined by the presence of symptoms or signs of cerebral edema including vomiting, seizures, cardiorespiratory manifestations of raised ICP, decreased conscious state or coma (eg, Glasgow Coma Scale score [GCS] < 8), and warrants emergency treatment (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia" and "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). US expert panel guidelines use the term severe more broadly to indicate serum sodium levels less than 125 mmol/L. To maintain the distinction of symptomatic severity, we use the European definitions in this review.

Another important categorization is acute vs chronic hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia is often defined as duration less than 48 hours, whereas chronic hyponatremia is defined as duration greater than 48 hours, and for practical reasons also includes cases where duration cannot be determined. The biochemical basis for this classification is in the time taken for cerebral adaptation to hyponatremia, via the export or deactivation of intracellular effective osmoles (Fig. 3). Those with chronic hyponatremia are vulnerable to rapid correction of pNa if it outpaces the speed that intracellular osmolality can be restored. A critical consideration in the management of moderate or profound hyponatremia that is chronic, or of unknown duration, is the need to avoid excessively rapid correction of serum sodium — which can lead to ODS and permanent neurological disability or death (see "Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome").

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^3c391830]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically synthesize and appraise clinical guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia In accordance with the Prisma statement, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and searched an additional 337 websites of specialist societies and guideline organizations (Additional file 6). We used AGREE II, a validated and reliable instrument, and an adequate number of reviewers to individually appraise the guidance documents. On top of the individual appraisals, we included an attempt to resolve major discrepancies and increase consistency by introducing an audiotaped group consensus meeting. During this meeting, reviewers could explain and motivate their scores and adapt them if they wanted to. This mostly resulted only in modest downgrading of domain scores by 1% to 10%. Most of the changes happened because reviewers felt they had scored inconsistently for a same rationale, or because they missed information during the initial appraisal that was in fact available in the document. Although the scores did not change substantially, the group felt the discussion further highlighted the qualitative differences between the guidance documents. In addition, even the reviewers with large deviations from the mean in their initial scores felt they agreed with the conclusion. It means that final average scores were truly a product of consensus rather than a mathematical calculation, as proposed in the original AGREE protocol. We believe that a consensus meeting is valuable in any guideline appraisal process, and particularly useful if reviewer groups have the intention to select a guideline for local use.

This study has its limitations. We based our assessment on what guideline organizations actually reported. Reporting by guideline developers may not wholly reflect what occurred in practice with respect to the AGREE criteria, and we did not seek additional clarification. However, contacting guideline developers is not standard practice when using AGREE as the instrument specifically aims to provide a framework for assessing the quality of reporting of recommendations. We aimed to summarize the existing recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia as formulated by other guideline development groups and to evaluate the quality of the guideline development process. We did not aim to summarize or critically appraise the evidence base itself. Consequently, it is difficult to assess to what extent differences between guidance documents stem from differences in development procedures rather than important limitations in the evidence base that underpin individual recommendations. Secondly, the purpose of using the AGREE instrument was not to accuse guideline development groups of being biased, but rather to highlight both strengths and weaknesses of existing guidance to suggest on how we could make improvements in the future.

### A rapid and efficient way to manage hyponatremia in patients with SIADH and small cell lung cancer: treatment with tolvaptan [^bc92a77d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death for cancer-related mortality worldwide. In 2007 1.3 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is found in up to 15–20% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer cases. The highly malignant SCLC tumor consists of primitive cells derived from the neuroendocrine lung and is associated with paracrine and paraneoplastic syndromes. Smoking, sex, initial tumor burden and LDH levels have been found to play a role in the outcome and prognosis of the patients. As recently demonstrated, persistent hyponatremia also appears to be a negative prognostic marker for overall survival in SCLC patients.

Hyponatremia is common in patients with lung cancer. Clinical symptoms such as dizziness, tremor, agitation and other neuropsychiatric symptoms have to be taken into consideration for the diagnosis of clinically relevant hyponatremia. Mild symptoms such as fatigue occur in mild (plasma sodium = 130–134 mmol/l) and in moderate hyponatremia (plasma sodium = 125–129 mmol/l). Clinical symptoms can aggravate in hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 125 mmol/l). The SIADH is a common finding in SCLC patients with euvolemic hyponatremia.

SIADH as a hallmark of SCLC can be found in 10–15% of all SCLC patients, but only in 2–4% of all non-small cell lung (NSLC) cancer patients, as recent retrospective series demonstrated. In SCLC patients SIADH is diagnosed predominantly in advanced stages and may induce a significant reduction in plasma sodium levels. Retrospective data point out that hyponatremia and the lack of correction of sodium can lead to a poor outcome in SCLC patients. Furthermore, these data suggest that the correction of hyponatremia may affect the prognosis of the patients. Correction and stabilisation of the sodium levels are required to initiate chemotherapy treatment and finally for the successful treatment of the underlying disease.

At the time of diagnosis SCLC patients in advanced stages of disease are often in a very limited performance status. In addition, comorbidities such as hyponatraemia or cardiovascular disease may delay the initiation of systemic chemotherapy and increase early mortality. Historical cohorts have shown that up to 40% of patients will not receive an effective primary chemotherapy due to a low Karnofsky-Index. New, supportive therapeutic options such as the rapid stabilization of the sodium metabolism could be helpful in this context.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^c58c5577]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Incidence of overcorrection and ODS

The incidence of overcorrection varies depending on its definition and mode of correction. A retrospective study that involved 412 patients with SNa < 120 mEq/L, in which overcorrection was defined as an increase in the SNa by > 10 mEq/L during the first 24 h, reported that 114 (27.9%) patients were overcorrected. The study, however, did not discuss the treatment strategies for hyponatremia in detail. Another retrospective study that included 62 patients concluded that 7 (11.3%) patients exceeded the increase of SNa by > 12 mEq/L and 6 (9.7%) patients by 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively. The treatment included administration of 3% hypertonic saline, D5W, and DDAVP, which were used in patients in whom overcorrection was likely or had occurred. The incidence of overcorrection in our study was consistent with that observed in these previous studies. We identified that 9 (16.0%) patients had an increase in the SNa by > 10 mEq/L and 6 (10.7%) by > 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively.

The international guidelines define overcorrection with a safety margin. We speculated that no ODS occurred mainly because the increase in SNa was relatively limited in the present study; even in patients with overcorrection, SNa increased by 12 mEq/L (quartile, 11–15 mEq/L) and 19 mEq/L (quartile, 17–23 mEq/L) during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively (Table 3). Similarly, in a previous retrospective study in which four of 37 patients (11%) with overcorrection developed ODS, the increases in SNa were 21 ± 5 mEq/L and 28 ± 8 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively. Therefore, we believe that minimizing SNa increases is essential to prevent ODS, even when overcorrection does occur.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^026d1318]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L -1 that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity. It is reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in environments in which medical care is limited and often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. To mitigate the risk of EAH mismanagement, care providers in the prehospital and in hospital settings must differentiate from other causes that present with similar signs and symptoms. EAH most commonly has overlapping signs and symptoms with heat exhaustion and exertional heat stroke. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of worsened morbidity and mortality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH management, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel in May 2018. The panel was charged with updating the WMS Practice Guidelines for Treatment of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia published in 2014 using evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, recognition, and treatment of EAH. Recommendations are made based on presenting with symptomatic EAH, particularly when point-of-care blood sodium testing is unavailable in the field. These recommendations are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balanced between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians.

Discussion

SCLC belongs to a class of the most malignant solid tumours. At the time of diagnosis most of the patients (90%) have to be classified as patients with limited, palliative treatment options. Due to the advanced age of this cohort (median 70 years) comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases or respiratory insufficiency influence the therapeutic strategies. Paraneoplastic syndromes, hyponatremia in particular, is common in SCLC (up to 15% of all patients). In 1957, Schwartz and Bartter described this clinical phenomenon of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion in patients with lung cancer and introduced the term SIADH.

In general, SIADH can be diagnosed on the basis of plasma and urine sodium levels and osmolality. Treatment of SIADH should always be set in correlation with the clinical picture of hyponatremia before the treatment option is chosen. Chronic hyponatremia (plasma Na < 125 mmol/l) in lung cancer can often be oligosymptomatic. Acute loss of sodium in hyponatremia is, in contrast, associated with agitation, lack of concentration or compliance and requires urgent control of the symptoms. Therefore, before treatment options are chosen in individual cases, and especially in clinical presentations such as fatigue or wasting syndrome, the concerted action of specialists in the field such as endocrinologists and pulmonologists is sought.

As Hansen et al. pointed out, hyponatremia in lung cancer patients is not only confined to the diagnosis of paraneoplastic SIADH. Other causes such as co-medications should be checked and considered to optimize the therapeutic goal. Hyponatremia treatment is based on clinical and biochemical parameters. The diagnostic and treatment algorithm given in Figure 1 proved to be helpful for a standardization of the hyponatremia management.

SIADH in SCLC is up to now a therapeutic challenge. Treatments with conventional therapeutic options such as fluid restriction or sodium chloride substitution, as well as with oral or intravenous medications, are often insufficient. Therapeutic oral drug preparations, such as demeclocycline, show only a slow and delayed increase in sodium levels in SIADH-associated hyponatremia. Fluid restriction or 3% hypertonic saline infusions is left as an option to reduce clinical symptoms which are required to start treatment. As most patients were in stage IV, an early commencement of chemotherapy was sought. A poor control of hyponatremia in this cohort may induce delays in the initiation of chemotherapy and consequently raise the disease-related morbidity and possibly mortality.
