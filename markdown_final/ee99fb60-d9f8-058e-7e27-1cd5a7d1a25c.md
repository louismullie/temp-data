## Question

penis turtling

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "penis turtling", what it means, how to think about it clinically, and how to manage it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and whether it maps to recognized medical entities. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and prioritize emergencies. Next, I will review evidence-based evaluation and immediate management, including when to image or operate. After that, I should consider condition-specific treatments and follow-up. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight red flags and counseling points, making sure I anchor each step to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "turtling" is not a standard medical term. Wait, let me verify the closest analogs: the phrase mirrors the Malay concept of koro, which literally refers to a turtle retracting its head into its shell and is used to describe a fear-based perception of genital retraction, and it also evokes the clinical picture of a concealed or buried penis, where the shaft appears shortened or hidden due to surrounding tissue or scarring, so I should keep both psychogenic and anatomic explanations in mind as I proceed [^117VJQQh] [^1125YvuJ] [^117YUsTK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check the differential and separate emergencies from non-emergencies. Emergencies include penile strangulation from constricting devices, ischemic priapism, and paraphimosis, all of which can threaten tissue viability and require urgent intervention, whereas non-emergencies include buried/concealed penis, true micropenis, and psychogenic genital retraction fears; I should also remember that hair tourniquet injury in children can mimic strangulation and needs prompt removal to prevent ischemia [^112woXB2] [^117XiMzV] [^113syEkP] [^115KWVti].

> I will now examine the emergency triage steps, starting with penile strangulation. Let me think about the immediate risks: vascular compromise, edema, and necrosis escalate with time, so I should confirm the object, duration, and degree of ischemia on exam and proceed to decompression without delay; techniques vary by object and thickness, including string-wrap methods, bolt cutters with protection, Gigli saw, and improvised approaches, and I should double-check that I'm choosing the lowest-risk, most feasible method in the ED setting [^117XiMzV] [^117C4uvt] [^111C5MAw] [^117LFqdL].

> Next, I should review ischemic priapism. Wait, I should verify the time threshold and first-line therapy: ischemic priapism is typically defined as a persistent erection beyond 4 hours, and initial management is corporal aspiration with saline irrigation and intracavernosal sympathomimetic injection; if this fails, a distal shunt is indicated, and I need to ensure I do not delay escalation because fibrosis risk rises with time [^114mQ6AM] [^112dSCKH] [^113tZndd].

> For paraphimosis, I need to ensure I reduce the foreskin promptly. Let me consider edema control first with ice, manual compression, or osmotic agents, and if these fail, I should proceed with a dorsal slit or circumcision; I should confirm that I also counsel on preventing recurrence by returning the foreskin after manipulation [^116j623m].

> Now, for non-emergency "turtling" phenotypes, I should confirm whether this fits buried versus trapped penis. Let me verify the distinction: buried penis is concealed by suprapubic adiposity without fibrous tethering, whereas trapped penis involves scar or fibrosis fixing the shaft; management is individualized, with weight loss, panniculectomy, monsplasty, and anchoring sutures for buried penis, and lysis of adhesions, scar excision, and skin reconstruction for trapped penis, and I should set expectations about staged procedures and wound risks [^1125YvuJ] [^117YUsTK] [^115dNnbQ].

> But wait, what if the "turtling" reflects a psychogenic syndrome rather than anatomic concealment. I should confirm the presence of anxiety, cultural context, and absence of objective retraction; koro-like presentations, while rare outside specific cultural settings, are documented worldwide and require reassurance, education, and consideration of psychiatric co-morbidity, and I need to ensure I screen for depression, anxiety, or psychosis when the story fits [^117VJQQh].

> I should double-check the evaluation framework so I don't miss subtle emergencies. History should document onset, duration, pain, trauma, devices, prior surgery, and psychiatric symptoms; exam should assess for edema, color change, necrosis, plaques, curvature, and whether the shaft is truly shortened or just concealed; imaging is selective, with ultrasound or MRI reserved for equivocal trauma such as suspected penile fracture or complex foreign body, and I must not let imaging delay urgent decompression or exploration when indicated [^1128baRL] [^114eCJDA].

> Let me reconsider management algorithms to ensure they are actionable. If there is a constricting device, I should attempt removal immediately using lubrication, string-wrap, cutting with protection, or specialty tools, escalating to urology if failed; if ischemic priapism, I should aspirate and irrigate within 4–6 hours and proceed to shunt if refractory; if paraphimosis, I should reduce using compression and consider dorsal slit; if buried/trapped penis, I should arrange elective reconstruction after optimizing comorbidities; if psychogenic retraction, I should provide reassurance and psychiatric referral as needed, documenting objective findings to counter somatic preoccupation [^117XiMzV] [^114mQ6AM] [^116j623m] [^1125YvuJ] [^117VJQQh].

> I need to ensure I address prognosis and counseling. Early removal of strangulation devices generally preserves function, though delays beyond 72 hours increase the risk of tissue loss; ischemic priapism beyond 24 hours carries a high likelihood of permanent erectile dysfunction despite treatment; buried/trapped penis surgery improves hygiene, voiding, and sexual function but may require revision; and for psychogenic cases, education and culturally sensitive reassurance are key to reducing recurrence and distress [^117XiMzV] [^114mQ6AM] [^1125YvuJ] [^117VJQQh].

> Finally, I should confirm red flags that mandate immediate action: dusky or black discoloration of the glans or shaft, severe pain with rigid erection beyond 4 hours, a tight band of constricting tissue behind the glans, or a foreign body encircling the penis; any of these should trigger emergency protocols without delay, and I should document time stamps and interventions meticulously to support outcomes and medicolegal clarity [^112woXB2] [^114mQ6AM] [^116j623m] [^117XiMzV].

Penis turtling refers to the **retraction of the penis into the suprapubic fat or scrotum**, making it appear shorter or hidden. This is most often due to **obesity, aging, or scarring** from surgery or inflammation, and is termed a buried or concealed penis [^1125YvuJ] [^117YUsTK]. It is not dangerous but can cause hygiene problems, urinary issues, and psychological distress [^117YUsTK]. Management includes weight loss, hygiene measures, and **surgical options** such as lipectomy, skin grafting, or anchoring procedures if conservative measures fail [^115dNnbQ] [^1125YvuJ]. Rarely, turtling can signal **priapism or paraphimosis**, which require urgent care [^112woXB2] [^116j623m].

---

## Anatomical and physiological basis

The penis is anchored by the suspensory ligament, fascial layers, and skin; **retraction occurs when these are disrupted** or when surrounding tissues (suprapubic fat, scrotal skin) engulf the shaft [^1125YvuJ]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Obesity**: Suprapubic fat buries the penis, especially when standing or sitting [^1125YvuJ].
- **Aging**: Loss of elasticity and increased laxity of skin and fascia allow retraction [^notfound].
- **Scarring**: Post-circumcision or inflammatory scars tether the skin, trapping the penis [^116TPep7].
- **Congenital factors**: Short suspensory ligament or webbed penis can predispose to retraction [^116TPep7].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

While not inherently dangerous, turtling can cause:

- **Hygiene difficulties**: Retracted skin traps moisture and debris, increasing infection risk [^117YUsTK].
- **Urinary problems**: Difficulty voiding, spraying, or damp clothing [^1125YvuJ].
- **Psychological distress**: Embarrassment, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction [^117YUsTK].
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Difficulty with intercourse or erectile concerns [^117YUsTK].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, with history and examination distinguishing buried/trapped penis from micropenis or other anomalies [^116TPep7]. Imaging (ultrasound/MRI) is reserved for surgical planning or when malignancy is suspected [^1128baRL].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

- **Weight loss**: Reduces suprapubic fat and improves exposure [^notfound].
- **Hygiene**: Regular cleansing and skin care to prevent infection [^notfound].
- **Manual traction**: Gentle stretching to maintain length and prevent adhesions [^notfound].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **severe cases** or when conservative measures fail [^115dNnbQ]. Options include:

| **Procedure** | **Indication** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Lipectomy/monsplasty | Buried penis from obesity | Removal of suprapubic fat and skin lift [^117YUsTK] |
| Skin grafting | Trapped penis from scarring | Release of scar and skin reconstruction [^117YUsTK] |
| Anchoring procedures | Persistent retraction | Fixation of penile shaft to prevent retraction [^1125YvuJ] |

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Conservative measures improve symptoms in many patients, though recurrence is common without sustained weight loss. Surgery yields **high satisfaction** with improved hygiene, voiding, and sexual function, but complications such as infection, recurrence, or sensory changes can occur [^117YUsTK].

---

## Psychological and quality of life considerations

Turtling can cause **significant anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction**. Counseling and support are essential, and surgical correction often improves self-esteem and sexual confidence [^117YUsTK].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Patients should seek care if turtling is **new, severe, or associated with**:

- Pain, swelling, or discoloration (possible priapism or paraphimosis) [^112woXB2] [^116j623m].
- Urinary retention or infection.
- Significant psychological distress or sexual dysfunction [^116L2LsG].

---

Penis turtling is a **retraction of the penis into surrounding tissues**, most often from obesity, aging, or scarring. It is not dangerous but can cause hygiene, urinary, and psychological issues; management ranges from weight loss and hygiene to surgery, with generally good outcomes.

### Koro-like symptoms in an adolescent female with schizophrenia [^117VJQQh]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Koro is a disorder characterized by the fear of genitals shrinking and retracting into the body. 1 While it is not included in the cultural concepts of distress in DSM-5, DSM-IV-TR described koro as "an episode of sudden and intense anxiety that the penis (or, in female patients, the vulva and nipples) will recede into the body and possibly cause death". The term koro originates from the Malay language, referring to the retracting motion of the head of turtles or tortoises into their shells. In the United States and Europe, the term genital retraction syndrome is commonly used instead of koro. In classical koro, cultural belief plays a role in its origin and spread, often in epidemics in Asian countries. 2 On the other hand, Koro-like syndrome (KLS) has been reported worldwide secondary to medical and psychiatric disorders. 2 Similar to koro, KLS is more prevalent in males, with only 3 documented cases in female patients worldwide (Table 1). We present the first case to our knowledge of KLS in an adolescent female patient with schizophrenia. The patient's parents gave consent for the publication of this case report.

### Penile emergencies [^1143JmPD]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The penis is an organ of enormous importance and is vital for both excretory and reproductive function. The anatomy of the penis itself can lead to many of its emergent conditions and a thorough understanding of the anatomy and physiology is central to recognition of these conditions. Physicians should have a high clinical suspicion for penile emergencies and perform a thorough physical examination to make a proper diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and proper management are essential for minimizing dysfunction of this vital organ.

### Treatment of penile strangulation caused by constricting devices [^111b8XnZ]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Constricting devices placed on the penis present a challenge to urologists. Various nonmetallic and metallic objects are placed on the penis to increase sexual performance or because of autoerotic intentions. We describe five different cases of strangulating objects (wedding ring, metal plumbing cuff, bull ring, hammer- head, and plastic bottle neck) and demonstrate that each case needs individual handling in removing the object. The treatment of penile strangulation is decompression of the constricted penis to facilitate free blood flow and micturition. It requires no particular skill but does require resourcefulness to perform the removal simply and effectively, and with as little discomfort for the patient as possible.

### Penile constriction devices: case report, review of the literature, and recommendations for extrication [^117XiMzV]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile constriction devices often present significant challenges to urologic surgeons. Failure to remove such devices can lead to significant ischemia and loss of tissue. Patients often present after several days of ischemia and swelling have developed.

Aim

This article reviews previously published data on penile constriction devices and strategies for their removal. Additionally, we present new methodologies for extrication.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the English language literature was performed using MEDLINE. "Penile incarceration" and "penile strangulation" were used as search terms, and a manual bibliographic review of cross-referenced items was performed. Publications prior to 1970 were excluded from our search.

Main Outcome Measures

Review of published literature on penile constriction devices and their removal.

Results

Penile incarceration is frequently described in the literature as an isolated case report or small series describing the approach of a single physician or group of physicians for dealing with these problems. Penile incarceration has been reported in a wide spectrum of age groups, with the incarcerating object most frequently placed for erotic or autoerotic purposes. While the most commonly reported devices causing incarceration are metal rings, higher-grade penile injuries are more frequently sustained by nonmetallic objects. Patients who present with incarceration after 72 hours are more likely to sustain higher-grade injuries than those who seek more timely treatment. Strategies for extrication depend on the type of device used, the length of time of incarceration, the patient's ability to remain calm, and the tools available to the presenting physicians.

Conclusion

Penile incarceration is a urologic emergency with potentially severe clinical consequences. With rapid intervention and removal of the foreign body, most patients do extremely well and need no further intervention. Removal of such devices can be challenging and often requires resourcefulness and a multidisciplinary approach.

### Classification and treatment of the adult buried penis [^1125YvuJ]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

In contrast to the concealed penis found in children, the adult buried penis (BP) is associated with obesity or found in patients after massive weight loss. Bariatric patients present with enormous prepubic fat masses into which the penile shaft retracts. As a consequence, urinating problems occur with wetting of the adjacent tissue. Many BP patients are circumcised with recurrence and worsening of the symptoms. In postbariatric patients, the penis is not engulfed into the prepubic tissue. In contrast to highly obese patients, the BP is covered underneath the cutaneous apron. Although all conditions are called BP, it is conceivable that plastic-surgical treatment differs. Hence, a novel classification for the adult BP was needed to adjust the procedures accordingly. We propose 3 types of the adult BP. The first type is termed "pseudo-BP". The penis is covered underneath the lax skin without signs of retraction. Here, an apronectomy and prepubic lift with tissue fixation are sufficient. The second type is the "intermediate-type BP" with partial penile invagination. After prepubic apronectomy, anchoring sutures secure the penile shaft from retraction. The third type is the "classical BP" seen in obese patients. The penile shaft is completely retracted into the prepubic fat. Often a stenotic scar tissue is found after previous circumcisions. The plastic-surgical reconstruction comprises scar excision, reduction of the prepubic fat masses with extraction of the penile shaft, anchoring sutures, and reconstruction of the penile envelope. In short, the etiology of the adult BP, a novel classification, and a treatment algorithm according to each type are presented in this comprehensive overview.

### The treatment of priapism – when and how? [^112SEgUk]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Priapism is a condition first described by Tripe in 1845. It has been defined as a pathological condition of penile erection that persists beyond or is unrelated to sexual stimulation. Two variants of priapism have been well described. The ischemic priapism (also known as low-flow priapism) and nonischemic priapism (or high flow priapism) have unique and distinct causes. It is important to distinguish these two conditions as the treatment for each is different. This review will focus on the two types of priapism and the appropriate diagnostic work-up for each. As well, the medical and surgical treatment options for these two conditions will be described in detail. A third entity known as stuttering priapism will also be discussed as will its unique treatment alternatives.

### Paraphimosis: current treatment options [^116j623m]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency, occurring in uncircumcised males, in which the foreskin becomes trapped behind the corona and forms a tight band of constricting tissue. Often iatrogenically induced, paraphimosis can be prevented by returning the prepuce to cover the glans following penile manipulation. Treatment often begins with reduction of edema, followed by a variety of options, including mechanical compression, pharmacologic therapy, puncture technique and dorsal slit. Prevention and early intervention are key elements in the management of paraphimosis.

### Noninfectious penile lesions | AAFP… [^113L2PbE]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

LICHEN SCLEROSUS Penile lichen sclerosus, also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans, occurs in males of all ages. Bullae, erosions, or atrophy may be prominent. Patients typically present with phimosis, painful erections, obstructive voiding, itching, pain, and bleeding. 16, 19 Because the progression of the lesions may lead to obstruction, urinary retention may be the initial complaint. 16, 18, 20 Almost all parts of the body can be affected, although they may be asymptomatic. 12, 16, 20 Lichen sclerosus should be differentiated from carcinoma in situ, leukoplakia, and scleroderma. 16, 20. 31,
32. These lesions should be distinguished from pearly papules, which have a ring-like distribution on the coronal sulcus. Lichen nitidus papules may occur on the penis, as well as the upper limbs and abdomen. 31, 33 Patients are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Pruritus and pain occur in approximately 50 percent of patients with penile carcinoma in situ. 41 Lesions usually appear as raised, beefy red, velvety, irregularly shaped plaques that may ulcerate. The lesions are generally 2 to 35 mm in size and occur on the glans penis, urethral meatus, frenulum, coronal sulcus, and prepuce. In uncircumcised men, the lesions may be encrusted without a velvety appearance. Lesions on the shaft may appear erythematous; display fissuring; and have soft, white scales. Biopsy is needed for the diagnosis of penile carcinoma in situ; shave biopsy is generally adequate. 6, 43, 44 Zoon balanitis lesions generally appear as bright red or brown, shiny patches with red specks or as pinpoint red spots. 6, 40, 44 Characteristic patches are sharply demarcated, glistening red, and occur on the glans penis, inner prepuce, or coronal sulcus 44, 45. Lesions tend to bleed and may erode.

Although Zoon balanitis is benign, the lesions may mimic carcinoma in situ; therefore, biopsy is needed. 6, 19, 36.

### The jew's penis: circumcision and sexual pathology in eighteenth-century england [^112CqMib]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Here, as in depictions of elderly Jews with young prostitutes, the vigorous sexual health of the prostitute is effectually used to denigrate the shameful sexual dysfunction of the Jew: despite Parrimore's enthusiastic ministrations, S----r remains flaccid, his penis 'a stupid, senseless Mass'. And while the hot-blooded prostitute departs from this encounter 'enraged' with sexual frustration, the humiliated S----r can only 'curse his Stars and the Cause of his fatal Impotence'. It is no coincidence that the episode concludes with S---r forced to consume 'Lobsters, Crabs, Prawns, Oysters, and other Shell-fish' to restore his potency: it is only by breaking with kosher food laws — 'their Law prohibiting the Use of Shell-fish', the narrator explains — that the Jewish lover can attain something akin to Christian virility (, 34).

### The concealed penis: management and outcomes [^115dNnbQ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Management of the concealed penis continues to evolve, with several manuscripts having been published over the last several years. Each describes a novel surgical approach, as well as outcome data. Recently a non-surgical, conservative, approach has also been published. Our goal with this review is to examine the most recent work, highlight the commonalities and differences in technique and compare their results.

Recent Findings

The surgical techniques all adhere to several common principles, and all accompany excellent results. The different manuscripts highlight the importance of classification based upon the underlying cause, as this directs surgical technique. The recent report by Radhakrishnan et al. is the first to describe the successful use of conservative management in select cases, a very appealing approach.

Summary

Appropriate management requires a solid understanding of the variable causes of the concealed penis. This allows a more tailored surgical approach and improved outcomes. Accordingly, the management of concealed penis can include a successful non-surgical approach.

### Penile emergencies [^112woXB2]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The penis is a very sensitive organ and even minor injury or discomfort may cause a patient to seek emergency evaluation. Emergency practitioners must be most concerned with the entities that, if left untreated, can result in ischemia and necrosis of the penis, namely ischemic priapism, paraphimosis, and entrapment injury. Any penile trauma should be considered an emergency until proven otherwise. This article discusses emergent penile complaints in adults, with emphasis on the most serious and common conditions.

### Circumferential dissection of deep fascia as ancillary technique in circumcision: is it possible to correct phimosis increasing penis size? [^111iMfAw]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Phimosis is a clinical condition in which the prepuce cannot be retracted over the glans. In pediatric population it is common and can be considered physiologic, whereas in adult population is always considered pathologic and is related to many conditions such as diabetes, or recurrent balanitis or trauma. Phimosis had been classified by Kayaba et al. in four grades according to the retractability of the prepuce.

The most performed surgical treatment of this clinical condition is circumcision but alternative surgical techniques with preputial preservation have been described.

The chronic inflammatory conditions that lead to phimosis in adults are often associated with a certain grade of fibrosis, from simple glanular adhesions to constricting bands affecting a larger portion of penile skin.

These fibrotic reactions could consequently lead to a reduction in penis size due to chronic and progressive constriction.

During the last 30 years augmentative surgery of penis has gradually increased its appeal to the point of being considered equivalent to the need of some women to ask for breast augmentation.

In this paper we described an ancillary procedure in circumcision that can lead to an augmentation both in terms of penile length and circumference.

### Xialla ®: a novel medical device for addressing erectile dysfunction associated with veno-occlusive dysfunction [^116HsJqV]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Penile strangulation due to the placement of constricting devices whether metallic or non-metallic is a rare but serious situation that requires urgent attention to avoid vascular compromise and ischemic injury to penile tissues. If the patient forgets to remove the ring before sleeping or leaves it on for extended periods, it can lead to penile ischemia and potentially severe clinical consequences. Management of penile constriction injuries involves the immediate removal of the constricting device to restore blood flow and prevent further tissue damage.

Further research and multicenter trials will be necessary to confirm the potential of this tool and its impact on men affected by ED. The development of the Xialla® device, however, highlights the progressive shift in ED therapeutics, aiming not merely to manage ED symptoms but to address the underlying cause and potentially restore erections to their pre-pathological state. Such advancements signal a promising era in ED therapeutics, with the potential to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

### Diseases of the foreskin, penis, and urethra [^114Gx9B6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Diseases of the foreskin, penis, and urethra are uncommon conditions that constitute a small percentage of emergency department visits. However, it is important that the emergency physician recognize and treat these conditions and understand which conditions require urologic consultation. Rapid and proper treatment in the emergency department can alleviate patient discomfort, increase patient satisfaction, and prevent future morbidity.

### Surgical management of the constricted or obliterated vagina [^116rKDNU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Management of the constricted or obliterated vagina demands an understanding and recognition of the potential etiologies leading to this presentation. A thorough and comprehensive medical and surgical review is required to arrive at an accurate diagnosis, which then will guide medical or surgical intervention. It is paramount to recognize when underlying medical conditions are contributing to these conditions and to begin medical therapy; failure to do so will often yield suboptimal results. When these conditions arise after surgical interventions, compensatory surgical techniques that correct upper and lower vaginal strictures or obliteration include incision through the stricture, vaginal advancement, Z-plasty, skin grafts, perineal flaps, and abdominal flaps and grafts. Postoperative surveillance and dilation are critical to optimize long-term success.

### Penile strangulation due to plastic bottle neck: a surgical emergency [^113syEkP]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Use of various metallic and non-metallic constricting objects on the external male genitalia for increasing sexual performance or because of autoerotic intentions is an unusual practice that can potentially lead to penile strangulation with severe consequences. Depending on the type of constricting material, emergency removal of such an object is a challenge. We report a case of a 45-year-old man who presented to our hospital with a hard plastic bottle neck at the base of his penis that led to penile strangulation. The constricting agent was successfully removed. The patient had an uneventful recovery.

### The jew's penis: circumcision and sexual pathology in eighteenth-century england [^111mNieE]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Within eighteenth-century venereological discourse, circumcision was further identified as a potential treatment for two conditions strongly associated with infection: phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin is drawn over the glans too tightly to be pulled back, and paraphimosis, a parallel condition in which the foreskin is drawn back and cannot be pulled forward over the glans (, 206 and, 68;, 234–29;, 421;, 25–27). Practitioners recognised that both conditions could occur naturally, but most venereological case studies attributed phimosis and paraphimosis to syphilitic chancres that 'fused' the foreskin to the penis. 8 Circumcision could be required in such cases as a therapeutic measure, allowing the surgeon to 'come at some latent Chancre ' that might be trapped beneath the patient's foreskin (, 68).

### Penis evolution across species: divergence and diversity [^1135GvFu]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2019). High credibility.

The penis is an incredibly diverse and rapidly evolving structure, such that even in closely related species that otherwise differ very little in their morphology, penis form can be highly differentiated. Penises are also much more complex than their fundamental function - sperm transfer - would seem to require. The rapid divergent evolution of male structures is typically the signature of traits under sexual selection and the current evidence suggests the penis is no different in this regard. Despite the general agreement that sexual selection is the main driver of penis evolution, many questions about penis evolution remain unresolved. Furthermore, the penis might be an ideal characteristic on which to focus in the drive to link phenotype with genotype.

### Novel extraction technique to remove a penile constriction device [^111D2AJ5]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile strangulation can be a challenging clinical situation and usually requires prompt treatment. The clinician should be aware of the various techniques to remove such devices.

Aim

The aim of this article was to describe a new noninvasive technique, the "pseudo-pulley" method, to remove a penile constriction device.

Methods

During an episode of medication-induced hypersexuality, a 63-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a cast iron locking nut of a vehicle towbar lodged at the base of the patient's penis.

Results

The utilization of the "pseudo-pulley" method to remove the constriction device negated the need for more invasive measures. We outline a step-by-step description on this new technique. The patient's recovery was complete and uneventful.

Conclusion

The current case report describes a noninvasive technique for removing a penile constriction device that does not rely on specialized equipment and industrial drills that can cause iatrogenic injury.

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^111EZVVL]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — limitations of the evidence base highlight interpretive challenges, including that "Some symptoms, such as pain, are highly susceptible to placebo effects", that "The changing nature of PD symptoms and the possibility that improvement in some patients may be a consequence of the passage of time makes the study of treatment effects challenging", that many studies rely on "patient perceptions of changes in deformity and penile dimensions as primary outcomes", and that there are "highly variable inclusion criteria across studies in terms of symptom severity and symptom duration".

### An anatomical pathogenesis of lower urinary tract definitions from the 2002 ICS report symptoms, conditions, syndromes, urodynamics [^113bzqLD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Incontinence during sexual intercourse

In a live anatomical study, the lateral part of PUL was noted to insert into the lateral part of PCM and directly into the vagina. With reference to Figure 3, a penis thrusting backward from the introitus may stretch the vagina sufficiently to pull open the urethra if PUL cannot sustain the backward stretching from the penis, which elongates PUL to "L"; this allows the posterior forces (large arrows, Figure 3) to stretch open the urethra from "C" to "O". Such cases respond to midurethral sling surgery.

2.5 Symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse

"Backache", "dragging" is consequential on the uterus being pushed into the vagina by intraabdominal pressure and gravity pulling on USLs which contain myelinated and unmyelinated nerves. Digitally supporting the perineum prevents diversion of feces into the rectocele during defecation.

2.6 Genital and lower urinary tract pain

Pain was not defined in the ICS definitions. Neuroscience onlinedefines pain as " an unpleasant sensation and emotional experience that links to tissue damage. It allows the body to react and prevent further tissue damage*. People feel pain when a signal travels through nerve fibers to the brain for interpretation".

*This definition explains the inflammatory reaction, mast cells, leukocytes, even neuroproliferation, seen at visceral nerve receptor sites such as, the urothelium (Hunner's lesion) and vaginal pain syndrome (see also Figure 5).

### Removal of a steel ring causing penile strangulation without the use of powered tools or sharp blades [^117C4uvt]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Penile strangulation is an uncommon urologic emergency that requires prompt evaluation and treatment to avoid disastrous consequences. Strangulation has been reported with objects ranging from hair tourniquets, to plastic rings, to iron rings. Strangulation with these devices can result in vascular congestion of the penis, swelling and eventual gangrene of the penis distal to the constricting device. We present a case report of a 43-year-old male who had a 2-day history of penile pain and swelling secondary to a metal ring constricting the proximal phallus. Ring removal was achieved with an orthopedic bolt cutter to cut the ring in two places, using a malleable retractor to act as a "backboard" to prevent iatrogenic injury to the penis.

### Novel use of the gigli saw for management of penile entrapment [^111C5MAw]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile entrapment is a rare clinical entity requiring urgent and efficient management. If left untreated, it may result in vascular compromise to penile soft tissue structures. Management poses unique challenges to the treating physician through variable presentation as well as the lack of specifically designed treatment options.

Aim

This article describes the use of the Gigli saw for management of penile entrapment.

Main Outcome Measures and Methods

We employed the Gigli saw to remove an entrapped metallic peno-scrotal constriction ring.

Results

We successfully removed the entrapped ring with no noted immediate complications.

Conclusions

The Gigli saw can be safely used, and represents an easily available and potentially effective option in the management of penile entrapment.

### Emergency evaluation and treatment of priapism [^1141H4LE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Priapism is a fairly uncommon presentation to the Emergency Department, but when it does present, it represents a true urologic emergency. Prompt treatment will decrease the risk of permanent sequelae including impotence. Treatment should be based on etiology and follow an organized approach. Various cases will arise when conservative management will not remedy the priapism and more aggressive measures will be needed, particularly if emergent urological consultation is not available. This article reviews the causes of priapism and systematically reviews techniques and procedures used to manage and treat priapism.

### The jew's penis: circumcision and sexual pathology in eighteenth-century england [^112Bq9yx]. Medical Humanities (2023). Medium credibility.

Like Pope's Strange Relation (on which it is explicitly based), The Warning-Piece tells the story of a circumcision gone awry. In this case, it is Edward Turner, a Whig candidate in the notoriously corrupt Oxford Parliamentary elections for 1754, who agrees to undergo the procedure in exchange for the support of Samson Gideon, a prominent and wealthy Jewish businessman. 28 When Turner's newly severed foreskin goes missing after the operation, Gideon insists that being 'in full Possession' of the flesh is an 'indespensable [sic] Condition' of their agreement, and so refuses to honour his half of the bargain. Although we subsequently learn that Turner's foreskin has been stolen by a Christian clergyman attending the event — a 'Reverend Timothy Boots' identified by Gonda as the Reverend Thomas Bray of Exeter College — the text's description of how this thief uses the 'invigorating Contrivance' of the foreskin to enhance his liaisons with 'the Mountain-Nymphs of Shotover and the Dryads of Maudlin-Wood ' signals why Gideon would covet this tool: it serves as a means of increasing his sexual and reproductive power (, 13). (Bray was not only rumoured to have been sexually promiscuous, but also, Gonda observes, to have impregnated a local prostitute (, 266)). The prospect of Christian conversion to Judaism is thus presented here, although allusively, as a prospect of anatomical levelling: Gideon insists on possessing the foreskin not because he wishes, like the sinister gang in Pope's Strange Relation, to display it as a battle trophy, but because he wants to use it to Jewish sexual and reproductive advantage. Fears about increased Jewish birth rates clearly also underpin other antinaturalisation satires, such as the 14 July 1753 issue of the Tory periodical The Craftsman (, unpag). 29 Here the writer imagines a dystopian future in which The Craftsman has become The Hebrew Journal, and naturalised Jewish immigrants have masterminded a cultural and biological takeover of the nation. The Hebrew Journal for 1853 records the imagined circumcision of 'twenty-five Children… at the Lying-In Hospital in Brownlow street' and the imagined execution of 17 Christian men who choose 'to lay down their Lives rather than be curtail'd of the Honour of their Ancestors by the Act of Circumcision' (, unpag). Taken together, these disconnected news items invoke a future in which Jewish birth rates are skyrocketing while Christian Englishmen are dwindling into extinction. In this context, the foreskin is not only a badge of sexual 'Honour', but also a means of identifying a dying ancestry.

Priapism, a pathologic condition of persistent penile erection in the absence of sexual excitation, is a true erectile disorder. Although it may seem to affect only a small population of male individuals, it carries major significance. Possible complications of the disorder include penile fibrosis and permanent erectile dysfunction. All health care professionals should appreciate the importance of the disorder and be prepared to follow current principles of diagnosis and treatment to reduce or avert its complications.

### Penoscrotal entrapment: a safe, innovative technique for removing metal constricting devices [^117LFqdL]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Penoscrotal entrapment is a rare urological emergency that requires urgent treatment to avoid penile ischaemia and subsequent erectile dysfunction. Non-metallic and thin metallic objects are easily removed via cutting, while thick metallic constricting devices require specialist saws or motorised cutters, all of which may be difficult to locate in the emergency setting. We report a case of a 45-year-old patient who presented with a 48-h history of gross penoscrotal oedema secondary to entrapment by a thick metal ring (internal diameter 55 mm, external diameter 74 mm and thickness 19 mm). The positioning, thickness of the ring, delayed presentation and extensive oedema meant its removal was especially challenging. We improvised a simple, three-step technique (aspiration, strapping and sling) which enabled the metal ring to be removed without the need for specialist equipment. We would encourage others to employ this safe technique in an emergency setting.

### How I treat priapism [^111sgP6M]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Priapism is a disorder of persistent penile erection unrelated to sexual interest or desire. This pathologic condition, specifically the ischemic variant, is often associated with devastating complications, notably erectile dysfunction. Because priapism demonstrates high prevalence in patients with hematologic disorders, most commonly sickle cell disease (SCD), there is significant concern for its sequelae in this affected population. Thus, timely diagnosis and management are critical for the prevention or at least reduction of cavernosal tissue ischemia and potential damage consequent to each episode. Current guidelines and management strategies focus primarily on reactive treatments. However, an increasing understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of SCD-associated priapism has led to the identification of new potential therapeutic targets. Future agents are being developed and explored for use in the prevention of priapism.

### Rare disorders of penile erection [^112Q71UE]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

This literature review presents two unusual and mystifying disorders of penile erection: painful nocturnal erections, alternatively termed sleep-related painful erections, and idiopathic stuttering priapism, a variant of recurrent ischemic priapism in which no cause is discernible. The disorders are closely related although they are distinct clinically and pathologically. The main subject areas of discussion are recognition, clinical evaluation and management although current concepts surrounding their causes and mechanisms are also addressed. It is acknowledged that despite the perceived rarities of these disorders they are impactful in terms of their disease profiles and consequences. Future advances in their management will require continued development of evidence-based treatments.

### Vascular lesions… [^114Y1Xzj]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus appears as a hypopigmented lesion with a skin texture similar to crinkled paper or cellophane. It primarily affects the glans penis and prepuce. Bullae, erosions, or atrophy may be prominent. Patients typically present with phimosis, painful erections, obstructed voiding, pruritus, pain, and bleeding. 27, 31 Because lesions may cause obstruction of the urethra, urinary retention may be the initial presenting concern. LICHEN NITIDUS Lichen nitidus is uncommon. Patients typically present with discrete, slightly elevated, hypopigmented 1-mm papules on the penis, upper extremities, and abdomen. 43 One-fourth of patients with lichen planus have genital lesions, and most patients have extragenital involvement. 44, 45 Lichen planus lesions are raised, violaceous, flat-topped, leukokeratosis-like, polygonal papules 46. Fine white streaks may appear on the surface of the lesions.

50–54 Diagnosis is usually made by characteristic appearance, although it may be misdiagnosed as penile cancer or pearly papules. Angiokeratomas may affect only the glans penis, scrotum, groin, thighs, or abdominal wall 55. Pruritus and pain occur in approximately 50% of patients with penile carcinoma in situ. 65 Lesions usually appear as raised, beefy red, velvety, irregularly shaped plaques that may ulcerate. The lesions are generally 2 to 35 mm and occur on the glans penis, urethral meatus, frenulum, coronal sulcus, or prepuce. In uncircumcised patients, the lesions may be crusted without a velvety red appearance. Lesions on the shaft may appear erythematous, display fissuring, and have soft, white scales. Penile carcinoma in situ requires biopsy to distinguish it from psoriasis and Zoon balanitis. 8, 67–69.

Given that, on average, patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis delay seeking medical care by six months or longer, presentations can vary.

### Circumcision devices versus standard surgical techniques in adolescent and adult male circumcisions [^115pmyVL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical circumcisions are among the most common surgical procedures performed in males. The usual indications are phimosis (inability to completely retract the foreskin and expose the glans due to a congenital or acquired constriction of the prepuce), paraphimosis (when the foreskin is not pulled back over the glans after retraction resulting in a tight constricting band which causes swelling of the distal penis and acute discomfort), balanoposthitis (erythema and edema of the prepuce and glans) and balanitis (inflammation is confined to the glans; the foreskin is usually non-retractile). Circumcision devices have been developed to shorten the operative time, simplify techniques, and improve safety and cosmetic outcomes. The devices generally aim to crush the foreskin while simultaneously creating hemostasis, the foreskin is then excised or allowed to slough off. Their use is supposedly safer and easier to replicate than the standard dissection techniques. There are at least 20 devices for male circumcision on the market, yet their effectiveness has not been reviewed to date.

Objectives

To assess the effects of device-based circumcisions compared with standard surgical techniques in adolescent and adult males (10 years old and above).

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions to the language of publication or publication status. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, trials registries, grey literature sources and conference proceedings up to 16 April 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of device-based circumcisions (crush or ligature circumcision devices) compared to standard surgical dissection-based circumcision conducted by health professionals in a medical setting.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data from the included studies. We classified adverse events into serious, moderate or mild. We reported study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) using 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials were conducted in China, South Africa, Kenya and Zambia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Primary outcomes Serious adverse events: there were no serious adverse events in either treatment arm (11 trials, 3472 participants). Moderate adverse events: there may be a slight increase in moderate adverse events when devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.10; I² = 68%; 10 trials, 3370 participants; low-certainty evidence); this corresponds to 8 more (ranging from 15 fewer to 84 more) moderate adverse events per 1000 participants. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes Mild adverse events: we are uncertain about the difference in mild adverse events between groups when devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.72; I² = 91%; 10 trials, 3370 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations, imprecision and unexplained inconsistency. Operative time: operative time is probably about 17 minutes shorter when using a device rather than standard surgical techniques, which constitutes a clinically meaningful decrease in a procedure (MD -17.26 minutes, 95% CI -19.96 to -14.57; I² = 99%; 14 trials, 4812 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious study limitations. The standard surgical technique generally takes about 24 minutes. There may be less postoperative pain during the first 24 hours when circumcision devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques (measured using a visual analog scale [VAS]; MD 1.30 cm lower, 95% CI 2.37 lower to 0.22 lower; I² = 99%; 9 trials, 3022 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained heterogeneity. There may be little or no difference in postoperative pain experienced during the first seven days when compared with standard surgical techniques (measured using a VAS; MD 0.11 cm higher, 95% CI 0.89 lower to 1.11 higher; I² = 94%; 4 trials, 1430 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained inconsistency. A higher score on the VAS indicates greater pain. Participants may slightly prefer circumcision devices compared to standard surgical techniques (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37; I² = 97%; 15 trials, 4501 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained inconsistency. We recorded satisfaction as a dichotomous outcome. Higher rates reflected greater satisfaction.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that there were no serious adverse events reported when using a circumcision device compared to standard surgical techniques, but they may slightly increase moderate adverse effects, and it is unclear whether there is a difference in mild adverse effects. Use of circumcision devices probably reduces the time of the procedure by about 17 minutes, a clinically meaningful time saving. For patients, use of the circumcision device may result in lower pain scores during the first 24 hours and patients may be slightly more satisfied with it compared with standard surgical techniques. Clinicians, patients and policymakers can use these results in conjunction with their own contextual factors to inform the approach that best suits their healthcare settings. High-quality trials evaluating this intervention are needed to provide further certainty regarding the rates of adverse effects and postoperative pain of using devices compared to standard approaches.

### Preputioplasty as a surgical alternative in treatment of phimosis [^116SpYFV]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical treatment of phimosis is a very common procedure worldwide. Radical or partial foreskin removal is one of the oldest surgical procedures in the history of mankind. The foreskin was called "prepuce" in Roman time and means as it protrudes before (pre) the tip of penis (putos). The inventor and first person to perform a circumcision is unknown. The actual indication for circumcision was not a medical condition but was based mostly on religious and cultural beliefs.

Testify to the known historical sources, circumcision was first performed in old Egypt probably inspired by the mythology of Osiris. From those old times till now circumcision is an important part of the Jewish and Muslim cultures. Based on the historical documents of the 19th century, circumcision was known to be performed as "ultima ratio" for masturbation, seizures, epilepsy, and paraplegia. Only in the modern time, beginning form the middle of the 20th century, circumcision has become a medical indication as a surgical option in the treatment of phimosis. Circumcision is the most-performed surgical procedure in modern medicine. The main indications are: non-retractable foreskin due to phimosis or paraphimosis, still as a part of cultural and religious beliefs, and finally as a prevention of penile cancer, sexually transmitted diseases.

There are a number of non-surgical alternatives to circumcision that have been described in the literature, such as a retraction therapy, variations of the steroid applications, and finally systemic antibiotics are recommended in case of balanoposthitis.

All the latter treatments have the goal to retract the foreskin and do not aim at the removal of the entire foreskin. Alternative surgical treatments include different types of preputioplasty. The term preputioplasty denotes various surgical techniques directed at resolving phimosis without radical or partial circumcision. This narrative review summarizes the best-known surgical techniques of preputioplasty, such as triple incision plasty, preputial plasty, ventral "V"-plasty ("VVP"), "Y"-"V" plasty, trident plasty, and "Z"-plasty, exploring the success rates and complications of the known procedures.

While Moll and the merchant sit at their tea, a maidservant is hastily ushering another man out the door behind them. This second man's state of undress — his belt hangs at his waist and his sword is unsheathed — parallels Moll's partially exposed breast, and confirms his identity as Moll's lover. Sneaking out behind the merchant's back, he is unable to resist a final gesture of ridicule at his rival's expense: with his free hand, he holds up his thumb and forefinger, as though indicating a length of two or three inches. For many, perhaps most, of Hogarth's viewers, this gesture would have been instantly recognisable as a sexual slur: Moll's lover is ridiculing the diminutive size of the merchant's penis. (The same gesture also appears in other eighteenth-century satires on penis size, including, for example, a 1742 caricature of Colley Cibber ridiculing Alexander Pope's 'little tiny-Manhood' (figure 2)). 2

### Peyronie's disease: AUA guideline [^116L2LsG]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

Peyronie's disease — minimum diagnostic evaluation: The clinician should engage in a diagnostic process to document the signs and symptoms that characterize Peyronie's disease, with the minimum requirements being a careful history to assess penile deformity, interference with intercourse, penile pain, and/or distress, and a physical exam of the genitalia to assess for palpable abnormalities of the penis. Assessment of sexual function is of particular importance and penile sensation, ejaculatory function, erectile function, difficulty/pain with penile penetration, and concerns regarding penile length and girth should be assessed; the goal of the examination is to provide baseline values that document the presence of deformity, the point of maximum curvature, presence/location/size of penile plaque(s), penile length, and areas of tenderness. For patients and/or partners with significant distress, consideration should be given for referral to a mental health professional with expertise in sexuality.

### Priapism: pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management [^11551NVW]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Priapism describes a persistent erection arising from dysfunction of mechanisms regulating penile tumescence, rigidity, and flaccidity. A correct diagnosis of priapism is a matter of urgency requiring identification of underlying hemodynamics.

Aims

To define the types of priapism, address its pathogenesis and epidemiology, and develop an evidence-based guideline for effective management.

Methods

Six experts from four countries developed a consensus document on priapism; this document was presented for peer review and debate in a public forum and revisions were made based on recommendations of chairpersons to the International Consultation on Sexual Medicine. This report focuses on guidelines written over the past decade and reviews the priapism literature from 2003 to 2009. Although the literature is predominantly case series, recent reports have more detailed methodology including duration of priapism, etiology of priapism, and erectile function outcomes.

Main Outcome Measures

Consensus recommendations were based on evidence-based literature, best medical practices, and bench research.

Results

Basic science supporting current concepts in the pathophysiology of priapism, and clinical research supporting the most effective treatment strategies are summarized in this review.

Conclusions

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of priapism are necessary to spare patients ineffective interventions and maximize erectile function outcomes. Future research is needed to understand corporal smooth muscle pathology associated with genetic and acquired conditions resulting in ischemic priapism. Better understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of stuttering ischemic priapism will offer new avenues for medical intervention. Documenting erectile function outcomes based on duration of ischemic priapism, time to interventions, and types of interventions is needed to establish evidence-based guidance. In contrast, pathogenesis of nonischemic priapism is understood, and largely attributable to trauma. Better documentation of onset of high-flow priapism in relation to time of injury, and response to conservative management vs. angiogroaphic or surgical interventions is needed to establish evidence-based guidance.

### Evaluation and management of priapism: 2009 update [^114mQ6AM]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

Priapism is defined as a persistent penile erection (typically 4 h or longer) that is unrelated to sexual stimulation. Priapism can be classified as either ischemic or nonischemic. Ischemic priapism, the most common subtype, is typically accompanied by pain and is associated with a substantial risk of subsequent erectile dysfunction. Prompt medical attention is indicated in cases of ischemic priapism. The initial management of choice is corporal aspiration with injection of sympathomimetic agents. If medical management fails, a cavernosal shunt procedure is indicated. Stuttering (recurrent) ischemic priapism is a challenging and poorly understood condition; new management strategies currently under investigation may improve our ability to care for men with this condition. Nonischemic priapism occurs more rarely than ischemic priapism, and is most often the result of trauma. This subtype of priapism, which is generally not painful, is usually initially managed with conservative treatment.

### Uncovering the hidden penis: a nomenclature and classification system [^117YUsTK]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A hidden penis can interfere with normal hygiene, prevent effective voiding, restrict sexual activity, and cause great embarrassment to the patient. The terms "hidden", "buried", and "trapped" penis are used interchangeably. To date, there is no classification system that adequately characterizes the spectrum of this condition. In this study, we propose a simplified nomenclature and classification system for adult-acquired hidden penis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all adult patients treated surgically for hidden penis by the senior author from 2009 to 2019. Patients were classified into either "buried" or "trapped" categories. A "buried" penis was defined as a hidden penis concealed by suprapubic fat without fibrous tethering. These patients were managed with panniculectomy, monsplasty, or both. In contrast, those with a "trapped" penis presented with scarred or fibrous tissue, which required surgical lysis, phalloplasty, and penile skin resurfacing.

Results

Thirteen patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort was aged 53 ± 15.7 years with a mean body mass index of 37.4 ± 4.3 kg/m2. Two patients required repeat operations, yielding a total of 15 operative encounters. Six were defined as buried, and 9 as trapped. Inability to achieve erection was the most common preoperative complaint in those with buried penis (67%), whereas difficulties in voiding were most common with trapped penis (78%). Patients with trapped penises had a significantly larger body habitus than those with a buried penis (39.8 vs 34.2 kg/m2, P = 0.0088). Operative duration and length of hospital stay were comparable between the trapped and buried penis groups (206 vs 161 minutes, P = 0.3664) (5 vs 1 day, P = 0.0836). One third experienced wound complications, but this was not significantly different between buried and trapped penises (17% vs 44%, P = 0.5804). Postoperatively, 5 patients experienced spontaneous erections, and 7 were able to void while standing.

Conclusions

Patients with a trapped penis present with a different preoperative symptom profile and body type than those with a buried penis. Our nomenclature and classification system offer a simple and clear algorithm for the management of hidden penis. Large cohort studies are warranted to assess differences in clinical outcomes between trapped and buried penises.

### Strangulation of penis by a ball bearing device [^1153TPEP]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile strangulation is rare and usually results following placement of constricting objects to enhance sexual stimulation. It requires urgent treatment as delay may lead to irreversible penile ischemia and gangrene. Various objects causing penile strangulation have been reported. Nonmetallic and thin metallic objects can be removed easily as compared to heavy metallic objects. Cutting is the commonest method described, although procuring special cutting tools may be difficult and the process of cutting may be tedious with the possibility of iatrogenic penile injury.

Aim

To present a simple, safe, minimally invasive, effective, and feasible technique for removing heavy metallic objects constricting the penis.

Methods

The published English literature (PubMed™) was searched for cases of "penile strangulation" using the keywords penile strangulation, penile injury, penile trauma, penile constriction, penile entrapment, and penile incarceration. The described treatment modalities were carefully reviewed and studied.

Main Outcome Measures

Reviewed published English literature on the various causes of penile incarceration and the various techniques used for their extrication.

Results

Search results yielded several cases of penile strangulation caused by a variety of metallic and nonmetallic objects. Various modalities have been described in the English literature for their safe removal, each with its own merits and demerits.

Conclusions

Penile strangulation should be viewed and managed as an emergency in order to prevent penile necrosis and urethral injury and to preserve erectile function. The modified method described herein for managing penile strangulation due to heavy metallic rings is minimally invasive, safe, effective, does not require any special cutting instrument(s) or skill, and is free of causing iatrogenic collateral thermal or mechanical damage to the penile organ. A stepwise algorithm depicting a rational and comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and management of penile incarceration is also suggested for the clinicians.

### Penile strangulation: two case reports and review of the literature [^1118yRfx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Entrapment or strangulation of the penis is a rare emergency situation that can lead to a wide range of vascular and mechanical injuries.

Aim

The aim of this article is to present our experience dealing with penile strangulation. A review of the literature is also summarized in this report. Current treatment options and outcomes are also evaluated.

Methods

We performed a computerized MEDLINE search followed by a manual bibliographic review of cross-references. These reports were analyzed and the important findings summarized.

Results

Penile strangulation has been first time reported in 1755. Since that time, sporadic reports have appeared in the literature describing a variety of foreign bodies on the penis that have in common only the property of circularity. We noted motives, types of objects, types of strangulation, symptomatology, trauma grades, diagnoses, including psychological involvement, as well as possible treatment options. Furthermore, two cases of penile strangulation from our clinical practice are presented involving different degrees of vascular insult leading to different pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and surgical approach.

Conclusion

Penile strangulation is an unusual clinical condition and the consequences can be severe. Penile strangulation could lead to different degrees of vascular obstruction. Consequently, several clinical syndromes can occur: from mild nonsignificant vascular obstruction that resolves after decompression to severe gangrene of the penis accompanied with impaired renal function. The most common motive associated with foreign bodies on the penis is sexual or erotic in nature. The choice of method for removal depends upon type, size, incarceration time, trauma grade, and availability of the equipment. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment are essential to avoid the potential complications of ischemic necrosis and autoamputation.

### Fractured penis: diagnosis and management [^116qTGLF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile fracture is a well-recognized clinical entity. It is relatively uncommon and is considered a urological emergency. Its management has been a subject of controversy.

Aim

In this article, we will review contemporary knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and evolving management strategies of penile fracture.

Methods

A case report was discussed followed by an English-language Medline review.

Main Outcome Measure

Review of the available literature to establish best-practice management.

Results

The injury is defined as the traumatic rupture of the corpus cavernosum secondary to a blunt trauma of the erect penis. The condition is underreported. The commonest causes were coital injuries and penile manipulation. The diagnosis was usually fairly straightforward because of the stereotypical clinical presentation. Associated injuries included urethral rupture. Imaging was helpful in selected cases. Conservative measures were associated with increased complications. Most authors advocated early surgical repair. False explorations have been reported.

Conclusions

Penile fracture is a clinical diagnosis. The ideal management has evolved and remains largely surgical. Preoperative imaging should not delay surgical repair.

### The inconspicuous penis in children [^116TPep7]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2015). Medium credibility.

The term 'inconspicuous penis' refers to a group of anatomical abnormalities in which the penis looks smaller than is expected. Micropenis can be defined as 'true micropenis' — which results from a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis — and 'micropenis secondary to congenital anatomical anomalies of the surrounding and overlying structures' — also known as 'concealed penis'. The different forms of concealed penis include webbed penis, congenital megaprepuce and partially hidden penis caused by prepubic adiposity. This disorder can also have iatrogenic causes resulting from adhesions that are secondary to circumcision — this type of concealed penis is known as 'trapped penis'. However, in both groups, micropenis is defined as a stretched penile length that is at least 2.5 SD below the mean for the patient's age, but without any other penile defects. Patients with true micropenis can be managed with testosterone, which has demonstrated good penile elongation results in the long term. Surgery also has a pivotal role in reconstruction for elongating the penis and for correction of anatomical abnormalities in concealed penis.

### Wedding ring in the wrong place: an unusual presentation of penile incarceration in a child with a wedding ring [^114QTeQw]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

An unusual case of penile incarceration in a 13-year-old boy is presented, with lessons to be learned for Accident and Emergency Department junior doctors in particular and for all in general. The presentation was misleading and the condition would have gone undiagnosed with fatal consequences without a team effort. The object used was a wedding ring in this case. Penile incarceration is not common in routine practice. The need for development of necessary paediatric history taking and examination techniques among Emergency Department doctors and staff is highlighted. Recalling the basics, this case report emphasises the importance of thorough physical examination. With early diagnosis and treatment, lifelong disabilities can be prevented.

### Removal of a detached head of the brooks dilator from the corpora cavernosa during penile prosthesis implantation [^112UHu2U]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Several complications during and after penile implantation have been reported. The most difficult part of the procedure seems to be the dilatation of the corpora, especially in fibrotic cases.

Aim

To report a rare intraoperative complication during dilatation of the corpora and its management.

Methods

During dilation of the corpora cavernosa with Brooks dilators for the implantation of penile prosthesis, its head was detached and stuck at the tip of the corpus cavernosum. Several trials to remove the head of the dilator using different kinds of clamps were unsuccessful. Finally, an incision was performed to the distal lateral part of the corpora cavernosa and the head of the dilator was removed. Implantation was completed uneventfully.

Results

The patient instructed to inflate the prosthesis and use it for sexual intercourse after 6 weeks. Follow-up was 14 months and the patient is using properly the prosthesis.

Conclusions

Although this is a very rare complication not previously described, we recommend examination of the dilators before use.

### Surgical management of hair-coil penile injury: anatomical insights and grading system [^115KWVti]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To report our experience in the surgical management of a group of patients with varying degrees of hair-coil penile injury, while applying a more detailed grading scale for the severity of injury.

Patients and Methods

The study included 16 boys with hair-coil penile injury who were managed during the period 2010 through 2016. In the acute state, the constricting hair coil was removed under general anesthesia. The repair was planned 6 months later after the acute injury. In 1 case presenting with severe form (near total glanular amputation), the glans was resutured to the penile shaft immediately after removal of the hair coil; the urethroplasty was performed six months later.

Results

The patients' age ranged from 2 to 17 years (mean 4.8 years). The urethroplasty was always covered by a protective layer, which was derived from the ventral dartos fascia in all but 1 case. In the latter, we used a tunica vaginalis flap for covering the urethroplasty. A successful outcome (regarding both urethral reconstruction and cosmesis) was achieved in all cases.

Conclusion

Hair-coil penile injury is an uncommon condition with insidious course. Unawareness of such condition can lead to progression to serious complications. Delayed and staged surgical repair is associated with successful outcome.

### Xialla ®: a novel medical device for addressing erectile dysfunction associated with veno-occlusive dysfunction [^115BCywJ]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Venous leak or veno-occlusive dysfunction (VOD), a common etiological factor contributing to approximately 75% of erectile dysfunction (ED) cases, has traditionally been a complex condition to manage effectively. Recent advancements have seen the development of the Xialla® (Nigel Shaw, Greater Ottawa Metropolitan Area) constriction ring, a unique, scientifically validated FDA class II wearable device specifically designed to address ED issues related to venous leak.

A clinical trial led by Dr Anthony J. Bella and presented in World Meeting on Sexual Medicine 2016 demonstrated significant enhancement to erectile function in 14 of 21 patients (66%) utilizing the Xialla® device. These findings are further supported by a subsequent trial, which reported satisfactory ED treatment salvage in 6 of 11 men (54%) with VOD. These studies indicate the potential efficacy of the Xialla® device in treating this subset of ED patients with VOD.

Xialla®'s unique design enables application whether the penis is erect or flaccid. In addition, a patented mechanism secures the ring to prevent movement and associated blood leakage during intercourse, potentially improving its therapeutic efficacy compared to traditional rings. Comfort is enhanced with a design that negates the need for a tight fit, typically required by conventional rings.

The Xialla® device is composed of a soft, stretchy silicone material with a smooth finish, offering abalance of functionality and discretion (Fig. 1). The process of application involves the placement of an adhesive pad on the lower back, followed by the positioning of the ring around the base of the penis. The loop is then extended up and around the scrotum and secured with a tab-lock to the adhesive pad (Figs. 2 and 3).

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^115DPjBX]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Acute ischemic priapism — perioperative considerations for penile prosthesis — Clinicians should consider all items of relevance before proceeding with a penile prosthesis in a patient with priapism, including that repetitive bedside irrigation procedures may increase the chances for bacterial entry with infection and distal shunts may compromise the tunica albuginea predisposing to erosion; patients may not be in optimal condition due to comorbid conditions or problematic medications, and the urologist may lack the experience, comfort level, or materials to render device placement practical. Conversely, allowing fibrosis to mature within the corporal bodies may render them difficult or impossible to dilate, possibly necessitating use of shorter and/or narrower devices and increasing the likelihood for inadvertent corporal and/or urethral perforation.
