## Question

HDS off inotropes meaning

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "HDS off inotropes" means in a clinical context and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "HDS" is a standard abbreviation or a typographical error. Then, I should verify the correct terminology and its accepted definition. Next, I will review the clinical implications of being "off inotropes", including prognosis and guideline context. Finally, I will synthesize a precise, clinically grounded interpretation and note any caveats or exceptions that might apply.

> Let me first confirm the acronym. Wait, let me verify whether "HDS" appears in authoritative heart failure or critical care sources. I don't see "HDS" as a standard abbreviation in ESC or AHA/ACC/HFSA guidelines or ISHLT documents, which makes me suspect a typographical error for "HF" (heart failure) or "HFpEF/HFrEF" subtypes, or perhaps "HD" for hemodialysis in a different context, but the surrounding phrasing "off inotropes" strongly suggests this pertains to heart failure management rather than dialysis, so I should proceed by interpreting this as "heart failure off inotropes" while acknowledging the abbreviation uncertainty [^notfound].

> I will now examine the phrase "off inotropes". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the clinical meaning. "Off inotropes" means the patient no longer requires continuous intravenous positive inotropic support such as dobutamine or milrinone, indicating hemodynamic stabilization sufficient to discontinue these agents, often after a period of dependence in advanced heart failure or cardiogenic shock settings [^113PypNQ] [^111UX84M].

> Next, I should review the clinical implications of being "off inotropes". Let me consider prognosis first: patients who can be weaned from inotropes generally have better outcomes than those who remain dependent, with observational data showing substantially higher 180‑day survival and discharge home after successful weaning, and worse outcomes persisting in those who cannot be weaned, reflecting more advanced disease and right-sided failure features in non‑weaners [^112fFE7K] [^111ZoN61]. I should double-check device and transplant contexts too; inotrope dependence correlates with higher risk and is captured in INTERMACS profiles as "stable but inotrope dependent", which flags patients for advanced therapies, whereas weaning off inotropes moves patients toward lower-risk categories and better transplant/VAD candidacy [^116FSMAH] [^111Q1qyT].

> But wait, what if the patient required inotropes for a bridge strategy? I need to ensure I frame this correctly. Guidelines endorse inotropes as a bridge to transplant or durable mechanical circulatory support in selected stage D patients, and being able to wean off inotropes signals clinical improvement and may obviate the immediate need for escalation, though candidacy for advanced therapies should still be reassessed serially using risk models and functional testing [^114ddutk] [^113KXF8g] [^111Q1qyT].

> I should confirm the weaning process and safety considerations. Hold on, I should verify that weaning is typically gradual with close monitoring for recurrent hypotension, congestion, or renal dysfunction, and that concomitant optimization of guideline‑directed medical therapy, especially beta‑blockers, is often feasible during or after inotrope weaning with improved outcomes in selected patients, though this requires careful titration and sometimes bridging strategies [^111ZoN61] [^114s1vTo] [^113PypNQ].

> Let me synthesize the interpretation. Given the absence of "HDS" as a standard acronym and the centrality of "off inotropes", the most clinically coherent reading is that the patient has advanced heart failure and is now off intravenous inotropic support, indicating hemodynamic stabilization and generally a more favorable prognosis than those who remain inotrope dependent, with the caveat that ongoing risk stratification for transplant, durable MCS, or palliative care remains essential depending on underlying ventricular function and trajectory [^112fFE7K] [^116FSMAH] [^111Q1qyT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge exceptions. Being "off inotropes" does not guarantee long‑term stability. Some patients relapse and require reinitiation, and others transition to oral inotropes or palliative strategies, so documentation should specify whether the cessation is permanent, whether it reflects recovery versus substitution with oral agents, and what the plan is for GDMT optimization and advanced therapy evaluation [^111UX84M] [^113V9CYw].

The phrase "HDS off inotropes" is not a standard medical term; it most likely refers to a patient who is **hemodynamically stable (HDS)** and no longer requires **inotropic support** [^113PypNQ]. This means the patient has adequate blood pressure, cardiac output, and organ perfusion without intravenous inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone [^113d28kC]. This status is a positive clinical indicator, as inotropes are typically reserved for acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock and are associated with increased risks if used long term [^117KByBa] [^111UX84M].

---

## Clinical significance of being "off inotropes"

Being "off inotropes" signifies that the patient has **recovered sufficient intrinsic cardiac function** to maintain hemodynamic stability without pharmacological support. This is a critical milestone in the management of heart failure or cardiogenic shock, indicating:

- **Improved cardiac output**: The heart can adequately perfuse organs without pharmacological augmentation [^notfound].

- **Stabilized blood pressure**: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is maintained above 65 mmHg without vasopressor or inotropic support [^notfound].

- **Enhanced organ perfusion**: Clinical signs of adequate perfusion, such as warm extremities, normal mental status, and adequate urine output, are present [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where patients are "off inotropes"

Patients are typically weaned off inotropes in the following clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) | Patients who have recovered from acute decompensation and no longer require inotropic support to maintain hemodynamic stability [^113PypNQ] [^112vwBEB] |
| Cardiogenic shock | Patients who have recovered from cardiogenic shock and no longer require inotropes to maintain adequate perfusion and blood pressure [^116hN6au] |
| Post-cardiac surgery | Patients recovering from cardiac surgery who no longer require inotropic support to maintain adequate cardiac output and hemodynamic stability [^112ZW3Q8] [^1147Aqzy] |
| Bridge to recovery or transplant | Patients who were previously dependent on inotropes but have recovered enough intrinsic cardiac function to discontinue inotropic support [^112bMU5G] [^111UX84M] |

---

## Clinical criteria for weaning off inotropes

The decision to wean a patient off inotropes is based on **objective hemodynamic parameters** and clinical judgment. Common criteria include:

- **Hemodynamic stability**: Stable blood pressure (MAP > 65 mmHg), adequate cardiac output (cardiac index > 2.2 L/min/m²), and normal lactate levels [^114ATchb].

- **Absence of organ hypoperfusion**: No signs of renal, hepatic, or neurological dysfunction.

- **Clinical improvement**: Improved symptoms, reduced dyspnea, better exercise tolerance, and absence of chest pain or arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Echocardiographic evidence**: Improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), reduced ventricular dilation, and absence of significant valvular regurgitation or wall motion abnormalities [^1162xTg2].

---

## Risks and benefits of discontinuing inotropes

Discontinuing inotropes has several **clinical benefits**, including reduced risk of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and infection associated with intravenous catheters. It also marks improved cardiac function and overall prognosis. However, there are potential risks, such as rebound hemodynamic instability or recurrence of heart failure symptoms, which require close monitoring during the weaning process [^115TDCMA] [^113nwHdf].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up care

After discontinuing inotropes, patients require **careful monitoring and follow-up** to ensure sustained hemodynamic stability and detect early signs of relapse:

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Regular assessment of blood pressure, heart rate, and signs of organ perfusion [^114ATchb].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serial measurements of renal function, electrolytes, and cardiac biomarkers (e.g. BNP, troponin) [^notfound].

- **Echocardiography**: Periodic echocardiograms to assess cardiac function and detect any recurrence of ventricular dysfunction [^1162xTg2].

- **Clinical follow-up**: Regular outpatient visits to assess symptoms, functional status, and adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic implications

Being "off inotropes" generally carries **favorable prognostic implications**, indicating improved cardiac function and reduced risk of adverse outcomes. However, prognosis depends on the underlying cardiac condition, the presence of comorbidities, and adherence to medical therapy. Patients who successfully wean off inotropes have better long-term survival and quality of life compared to those who remain dependent on inotropic support [^111E9JZA] [^112LE7NL].

---

## Conclusion

"HDS off inotropes" likely denotes a patient who is **hemodynamically stable and no longer requires inotropic support**. This status reflects improved cardiac function and is associated with better clinical outcomes. The decision to discontinue inotropes is based on objective hemodynamic parameters, clinical judgment, and careful monitoring to ensure sustained stability and detect early signs of relapse.

### Optimal inotropic support strategy in low cardiac output syndrome [^111c6CMy]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), a form of cardiogenic shock that occurs after cardiac surgery, is associated with an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. Generally, LCOS is managed medically with inotropes and vasopressors to optimize hemodynamics. However, randomized data comparing the efficacy of individual inotropes in treating LCOS are limited. Consequently, there is little consensus regarding the optimal inotrope strategy, and practice patterns vary widely. This review synthesizes current evidence on pharmacologic, non-mechanical circulatory support strategies for managing LCOS, advocating for a personalized approach tailored to the individual patient's hemodynamic profile and inotropic requirements. Currently available vasoactive agents are discussed, and guidance is provided on their use across specific clinical contexts to support individualized treatment.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^113ir6x3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Current pharmacological therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are largely either repurposed anti‐hypertensives that blunt overactivation of the neurohormonal system or diuretics that decrease congestion. However, they do not address the symptoms of heart failure that result from reductions in cardiac output and reserve. Over the last few decades, numerous attempts have been made to develop and test positive cardiac inotropes that improve cardiac haemodynamics. However, definitive clinical trials have failed to show a survival benefit. As a result, no positive inotrope is currently approved for long‐term use in heart failure. The focus of this state‐of‐the‐art review is to revisit prior clinical trials and to understand the causes for their findings. Using the learnings from those experiences, we propose a framework for future trials of such agents that maximizes their potential for success. This includes enriching the trials with patients who are most likely to derive benefit, using biomarkers and imaging in trial design and execution, evaluating efficacy based on a wider range of intermediate phenotypes, and collecting detailed data on functional status and quality of life. With a rapidly growing population of patients with advanced heart failure, the epidemiologic insignificance of heart transplantation as a therapeutic intervention, and both the cost and morbidity associated with ventricular assist devices, there is an enormous potential for positive inotropic therapies to impact the outcomes that matter most to patients.

### Do heart and respiratory rate variability improve prediction of extubation outcomes in critically ill patients? [^112N3N8A]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

The weaning and variability evaluation (WAVE) research study was a prospective, blinded observational multicenter cohort study conducted in 12 centers. Research ethics boards at each site waived consent for enrolment in this strictly observational study (Ottawa - Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board (OHSN-REB)). The study was powered based on preliminary data from a single-center pilot (n = 60), to estimate the fold increase of extubation failure (respect to average failure rate - that is 12% in this population) within a margin of error of 10% or less with two-sided α = 0.05.

Patients were considered for enrolment when an SBT was planned in anticipation of extubation. Inclusion criteria were: invasive mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours, at least partial reversal of the condition precipitating mechanical ventilation, stabilization of other organ systems, toleration of pressure support ventilation ≤ 14 cm H₂O (oxygen saturation (SpO₂) ≥ 90% with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO₂) ≤ 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ≤ 10 cm H₂O), hemodynamic stability (low - phenylephrine < 50 ug/min; norepinephrine < 5 ug/min; dobutamine < 5 ug/kg/min; milrinone < 0.4 ug/kg/min - or no vasopressors), stable neurological status (no deterioration in Glasgow coma score during prior 24 hours and, if measured, intracranial pressure (ICP) < 20 mmHg), and intact airway reflexes (cough and gag). Exclusion criteria were: order not to reintubate should the patient fail extubation, anticipated withdrawal of life support, known or suspected severe weakness (myopathy, neuropathy or quadriplegia), tracheostomy, atrial fibrillation, and prior extubation during ICU stay.

### Carvedilol titration in patients with congestive heart failure receiving inotropic therapy [^114s1vTo]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Carvedilol has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). There are limited data of carvedilol use in patients on inotrope therapy. We present our experience with carvedilol titration in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IIIb/IV patients stabilized on milrinone therapy, as a nonrandomized study with a parallel control group of patients never on inotropes. These patients achieved volume control and stabilization of their symptoms during the course of milrinone therapy.

Methods and Results

Seventeen patients in class IIIb/IV CHF (group 1) on intermittent intravenous milrinone therapy and 15 patients in class II/IIIa compensated CHF (group 2) on standard triple heart failure therapy were titrated on carvedilol. Success and adverse events during titration were compared between the 2 groups. Fifteen (88%) patients in group 1 and 14 (93%) patients in group 2 were successfully titrated on carvedilol over 8.1 ± 1.8 weeks and 6.7 ± 2.8 weeks, respectively. The target dose of carvedilol (25 or 50 mg twice daily) was achieved in 13 (87%) patients (group 1) and 14 (93%) patients (group 2). Seven (47%) patients in group 1 and 4 (28%) patients in group 2 had adverse events during carvedilol titration. Eight (53%) patients in group 1 were weaned off milrinone over a period of 8.4 weeks after carvedilol titration, whereas the rest of the patients had reduction in the frequency of infusion. Ten (63%) patients in group 1 improved by one or more functional classes.

Conclusions

Patients in NYHA class IIIb/IV who are treated with inotropic therapy can be titrated on carvedilol after reaching a stable state while on milrinone and standard oral drugs. Most of these patients can be successfully weaned off of milrinone or have decreased frequency of infusions and demonstrate improved functional status. Prospective randomized trials are required to evaluate these observations made in a limited number of patients in class IIIb and IV CHF because the combination of milrinone and beta-blockers has never been adequately evaluated.

Diagnosis of persistent/irreversible biventricular failure — in ambulatory chronic heart failure, dobutamine stress testing can demonstrate right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve, with dosing increased at increments of 5 μg/kg/min at 3-minute intervals up to a maximum of 20 μg/kg/min or until limited by side effects. In ongoing acute left heart failure, coexistent RV failure should be suspected when CI < 2.2 L/min/m² or cardiac power < 0.6 W and any of the following: ongoing hemodynamic evidence of CVP > 15 mm Hg, CVP/PCWP ratio > 0.63, or pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi) < 1.85, and echo/imaging evidence of RV dysfunction such as TAPSE < 14 mm or increased RVEDV. Failure of weaning of temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) or high dose inotropes after 72 hours of hemodynamic optimization and complete revascularization may require escalation to total artificial heart (TAH), biventricular assist device (BiVAD) or transplant in suitable candidates. Recommendation — The right ventricular contractile reserve must be evaluated by echo and hemodynamic testing in a patient undergoing left ventricular support to determine the need for biventricular support (Class I, Level of evidence: C.).

### Postoperative heart failure after stage 1 palliative surgery for single ventricle cardiac disease [^1176USLR]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes for patients with single ventricle congenital heart disease (SV-CHD) continue to improve over time. However, the prognosis for patients who develop heart failure immediately after surgery is poorly understood. We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients with SV-CHD, who suffered postoperative heart failure. Of 1038 cardiac surgeries performed on 621 SV-CHD patients between 2004 and 2010, 125 patients met inclusion criteria, including non-septatable anatomy, stage 1 surgery, and verified low cardiac output or heart failure state per STS definition. Overall survival was 73.2% at 2 months, 64.9% at 1 year, 60.5% at 2 years, and 54.6% at 4 years. Inotrope dependence beyond 7 days post-op yielded 45% 2-year survival versus 68% for those who weaned from inotropes within 7 days (p = 0.02). Atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR) influenced survival, and patients who developed renal failure or required ECMO fared poorly, even when they survived their hospitalization. Patients with postoperative heart failure and low cardiac output syndrome constitute a high-risk population beyond the term of the initial hospitalization and have an overall mid-term survival of 55% at 4 years. Wean from inotropic therapy is not completely reassuring in this population, as they have ongoing elevated risk of cardiac failure and death in the medium term. Ventricular dysfunction, AVVR, renal failure, and need for ECMO are all important prognostic factors for mid-term mortality. Inotrope dependence for > 7 days has important implications reaching beyond the hospitalization.

### Vasopressors and inotropes in sepsis [^113QyUMF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressor and inotropes are beneficial in shock states. Norepinephrine is considered the first-line vasopressor for patients with sepsis-associated hypotension. Dobutamine is considered the first-line inotrope in sepsis, and should be considered for patients with evidence of myocardial dysfunction or ongoing signs of hypoperfusion. Vasopressor and inotrope therapy has complex effects that are often difficult to predict; emergency providers should consider the physiology and clinical trial data. It is essential to continually reevaluate the patient to determine if the selected treatment is having the intended result.

### A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock [^113x8UVN]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Personalized use of inotropic agents

There are no data to support the systematic use of inotropic agents. The indiscriminate use of levosimendan in such patients was unsuccessful. Even attempting to identify patients with myocardial injury based on biomarkers was not helpful. This is not surprising since the consequences of sepsis-associated myocardial depression are highly variable. Some patients present with a high CO or even dynamic obstruction of the outflow tract despite significant impairment in cardiac function or high levels of biomarkers. They should not be treated with inotropic agents. On the other hand, some patients present with a low CO related to left or right ventricular dysfunction and may benefit from inotropic agents. Accordingly, as stated above, inotropes may be indicated only in patients with signs of tissue hypoperfusion related to a low CO induced by impaired cardiac function. Adverse effects (tachycardia, arrhythmias) and specific risks in some patient categories (hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, myocardial ischemia) should be cautiously scrutinized, and risks/benefits of the intervention evaluated.

Discussion on the type of agent is more complex. No agent has proven to be superior to another in patients in shock. Of note, most trials comparing inotropic agents were performed in patients with heart failure and excluded patients in cardiogenic shock. Accordingly, meta-analyses of these trials should be considered cautiously.

Based on pharmacologic properties, we suggest the following stepwise approach: First, test a limited dose of dobutamine (2.5 to 5 mcg/kg/min) and evaluate efficacy and tolerance. In cases of severe contractility impairment, higher doses (up to 20 mcg/kg/min) may be considered. Second, substitute or add enoximone or milrinone and evaluate efficacy and tolerance (beware of the risk of hypotension). Third, substitute or add levosimendan in cases of severe impairment. At each step, efficacy (improvement in cardiac function and CO, resolution of tissue hypoperfusion) and tolerance (e.g. lack of tachycardia, arrhythmias, etc.) should be evaluated. For each of the agents, the lowest dose associated with the desired effect should be administered. As soon as the situation improves, weaning of inotropes should be attempted.

### IVIg for small fiber neuropathy with autoantibodies TS-HDS and FGFR3… [^112RuYcn]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Study Overview The objective of this study is to develop a rationale for the selective treatment of small fiber neuropathy with immune globulin in the appropriate patients. The investigators hypothesize that individuals with auto-antibodies targeting neuronal antigens and confirmed evidence of small fiber neuropathy will have an improvement in both nerve fiber density and pain after treatment with immune globulin. However, despite this broad differential at least 30% of cases of small fiber neuropathies remain idiopathic. There is therefore a growing interest in the potential for using IVIG in small fiber neuropathy without direct proof that the disorder is caused by immune reactions. We have recently uncovered two novel autoantibodies, TS-HDS and FGFR-3, that are targeted again peripheral neural structure. TS-HDS is a disaccharide component of glycosylation of heparin and heparin sulfate.

Patients with elevated levels of IgM against TS-HDS display clear small fiber loss with IgM deposits around the outside of medium- & larger-sized capillaries with C5b-9 complement deposits. FGFR-3 is a secreted cell surface receptor; genetic defects of FGFR-3 are linked to achrondroplasia and other bony abnormalities. The antibodies to TS-HDS and FGFR-3 are detected in up to 20% of patients with otherwise idiopathic small fiber neuropathy, but are rare in patients without small fiber neuropathy. Dr. Levine recently presented 3 cases of small fiber associated with elevated levels of auto-antibodies to TS-HDS or FGFR-3 who were treated with IVIG at 2 gm/kg/month for 6 months. He examined skin biopsies for intra-epidermal nerve fiber density and patient self-reported pain scores at baseline and after six months of therapy.

The investigators believe these anecdotal cases suggest that TS-HDS and FGFR-3 antibodies may be a marker for a group of SFN patients that are immune mediated and may respond to IVIG. Drug: Intravenous immunoglobulin Drug:

### Association between statin use and survival among patients with breast cancer… [^113NACWy]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

eTable 7. Crude and Adjusted Hazard Ratio of High-Dose Statin Users, Non-HDS Users, and Statin Nonusers Among Patients With Breast Cancer eTable

With the improvement of anticancer therapies, the cancer-free ratio of patients with breast cancer has increased, but survivors face threats of cancer therapy–associated cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and thrombosis. 1, 2 Through suppressing HMG-CoA reductase, statins have been shown to reduce blood cholesterol. The risk of cancer-related death was persistently low in both HDS and non-HDS users compared with statin nonusers. Compared with statin nonusers, the risk of cancer-related death was reduced in non-HDS users and was even lower in HDS users, while there were no significant differences in terms of the risks of cardiovascular death and other cardiovascular outcomes. Taken together, despite statins being drugs for lowering lipids and protecting the cardiovascular system, we found a significant risk reduction of death, especially cancer-associated death, among patients with breast cancer who received statins, especially HDS. Surprisingly, no significant differences were observed in the cardiovascular outcomes between statin users and nonusers.

### Post hoc analysis of the glutamics-trial: intravenous glutamate infusion and use of inotropic drugs after cabg [^1174Wqmn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Promoting metabolic and functional recovery with metabolic support represents a novel concept in the treatment of heart failure after acute ischaemia. Intravenous glutamate improved metabolic and haemodynamic recovery early after CABG. Early clinical experience with intravenous metabolic support showed that the need for inotropes could almost be abolished while clinical outcomes with regard to postoperative mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction and long-term survival compared favourably with literature. This encouraging experience contributed to the initiation of the GLUTAMICS-trial.

The GLUTAMICS-trial was negative with regard to the primary endpoint. However, the study included a high proportion of low risk patients and furthermore the design of the primary endpoint suffered from liberal preemptive use of inotropes in patients anticipated to have weaning problems. It became evident at clinical endpoint committee meetings that preemptive use of inotropes prevented detection of weaning problems in patients who later developed severe circulatory failure. The secondary endpoint severe circulatory failure discriminated mild short-lasting heart failure at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass from clinically significant heart failure requiring substantial circulatory support and leading to prolonged ICU stay or death. In the glutamate treated patients the relative risk of developing severe circulatory failure was reduced by more than 50% in most risk groups undergoing isolated CABG. For those who believe that inotropes are beneficial after cardiac surgery the present post-hoc analysis clearly shows that these results were not explained by more liberal use of inotropes in the glutamate group. On the contrary, glutamate infusion was associated with a reduced need for inotropes in patients fulfilling criteria for heart failure on weaning from CPB, which is compatible with the suggested mechanism of glutamate, i.e. to promote post-ischaemic recovery of the heart. These results also agree with previous clinical experience, which has showed that metabolic support can achieve excellent clinical outcomes with reduced need for inotropes. The fact that glutamate had a minor impact on inotrope use overall is not unexpected given that only about one fourth of the patients treated fulfilled criteria for heart failure.

### Effects of levosimendan on respiratory muscle function in patients weaning from mechanical ventilation [^114Pg2E6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Levosimendan is known as a cardiac inotrope, with vasodilating properties. On one hand, it acts by increasing the sensitivity of troponin C to calcium in myocardial fibers, hence leading to inotropy. In addition, levosimendan increases open probability of the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels in smooth muscle cells, thus resulting in vasodilation (for review, see). Levosimendan is currently approved as an inotrope for acutely decompensated heart failure. In recent years, we have provided convincing evidence that levosimendan improves contractility of the diaphragm. For instance, in human diaphragm muscle fibers, levosimendan increases calcium sensitivity of contraction by 20–30%, which is expected to improve contractile efficiency. We have also demonstrated that the effects of levosimendan are more pronounced in slow-type fibers compared to fast-type fibers. It should be noted that levosimendan does not increase maximum force-generating capacity of the muscle fibers, as maximum force is independent from calcium sensitivity at saturating calcium concentration. In vivo, levosimendan improved neuromechanical efficiency of the diaphragm by ~ 21% during both unloaded and loaded breathing. Moreover, levosimendan reversed the development of diaphragm fatigue after strenuous loaded breathing. Based on these encouraging results in vitro (increased calcium sensitivity of contraction) and in vivo (improved neuromechanical efficiency of the diaphragm), we designed the current study. In the current study, measurements were performed during a CPAP trial, because at the time the study was designed, a CPAP trial was a common type of weaning trial. We found that levosimendan did not improve contractile efficiency of the diaphragm in ventilated critically ill patients compared to placebo. However, we did observe a significant increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation in the levosimendan group compared to placebo, resulting in a decrease in PaCO₂. Despite not being the primary endpoint, this outcome is clinically relevant as minute ventilation is the final common pathway of the respiratory system and sufficient minute ventilation is the key to successful weaning. The physiological mechanism for the increased minute ventilation remains speculative. First, these findings may be explained by an increase in central respiratory drive. As respiratory drive of the diaphragm (assessed by EA di) was not different after levosimendan, it can only be explained by altered drive to other muscles of the respiratory muscle pump, such as accessory inspiratory muscles or expiratory muscles. Second, improved cardiac function may decrease pulmonary congestion and thus improve respiratory mechanics. However, dynamic lung compliance was not affected by levosimendan, making this explanation less likely.

### Post hoc analysis of the glutamics-trial: intravenous glutamate infusion and use of inotropic drugs after cabg [^111v4MBt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Definitions

Use of inotropes was defined as any use of inotropic drugs (except noradrenaline) regardless of indication, duration or dosage. Participating centres and individual clinicians were free to institute inotropic drugs according to their choice and usual practice.

Preemptive use of inotropic drugs to facilitate weaning from CPB was defined as use of inotropic drugs before weaning from CPB in patients that according to prespecified criteria were deemed, by the blinded clinical endpoints committee, not to have had heart failure at weaning. If, however, the patient fulfilled prespecified criteria for heart failure at weaning use of inotropes was considered "treatment" regardless if the drugs had been instituted before weaning or instituted because of weaning problems.

Prespecified criteria were used by a blinded endpoints committee to determine if heart failure was present. Briefly clinical and echocardiographic signs of heart failure as a cause of low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO₂) were used to diagnose postoperative heart failure. A surgical pulmonary artery catheter was introduced in all patients for sampling of SvO₂. SvO₂ was measured in every patient at weaning from CPB, 5 min after protamine administration and on admission to ICU and whenever clinical condition of the patients required evaluation of the haemodynamic status. If the rare cases when a patient required more meticulous monitoring to guide haemodynamic treatment a Swan-Ganz catheter was employed. Detailed criteria are given in the Additional file 1.

Postoperative heart failure was categorised into heart failure evident at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass or late circulatory failure presenting after apparently uncomplicated weaning. Circulatory failure was classified as late if it became evident after weaning from CPB and it was categorised as cardiac or non-cardiac in origin.

Severe circulatory failure was defined as heart failure leading to death or requiring ICU stay ≥ 48 h with intra-aortic balloon pump for ≥ 24 h or inotropic agents in dosages according to Additional file 1 for ≥ 24 h.

Postoperative mortality was defined as death within 30 days of surgery. Hospital mortality was defined as death during the first hospitalisation period including stay at the referral hospital after discharge postoperatively. Cardiac cause of death was assessed by the endpoints committee.

Statistics

Two-sided Fisher's exact test was used was used for comparison of dichotomous variables. Two-sided Students t -test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate were used for comparison of continuous variables. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. The data are given as percentages or means ± standard deviation.

### The 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines for mechanical circulatory support: executive summary [^116PWa6p]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2013). Medium credibility.

Right heart dysfunction — non-ICU post-operative period: Class I recommendations state that inotropic support may need to be continued into the remote post-operative period (> 2 weeks) when there is evidence for right heart dysfunction, and once euvolemic, inotrope wean should be done cautiously with ongoing examination for recurrent signs and symptoms of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (Level of evidence: C). Diuretics and renal replacement therapy, such as continuous venovenous hemofiltration, should be used early and continued as needed to maintain optimal volume status (Level of evidence: C). Class IIb recommendations state that cardiac glycosides may be used to support RV function (Level of evidence: C); for patients with persistent pulmonary hypertension who exhibit signs of RV dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension-specific therapies, such as phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, should be considered (Level of evidence: C); and pacemaker therapy can be used if the heart rate is not optimal to support hemodynamics (Level of evidence: C).

Temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) indications: Temporary MCS can help stabilize patients and allow time for decisions about the appropriateness of transitions to definitive management such as durable MCS as a bridge or destination therapy, stabilization until cardiac transplantation, or device removal if improvement and recovery occur; these patients often present in cardiogenic shock that cannot be managed solely with IV inotropes and in whom other organ function is at risk.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116hN6au]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Cardiogenic shock — intravenous inotropes, mechanical circulatory support (MCS), invasive hemodynamics, and team-based care are characterized as follows: Intravenous inotropic support can increase cardiac output and improve hemodynamics in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, but there is a lack of robust evidence to suggest the clear benefit of one inotropic agent over another in cardiogenic shock, and in general the choice is guided by blood pressure, concurrent arrhythmias, and availability of drug. Vascular, bleeding, and neurologic complications are common to MCS devices and should be weighed, and if time allows, escalation to MCS should be guided by invasively obtained hemodynamic data (eg, PA catheterization), with observational experiences associating its use with improved outcomes, particularly in conjunction with short-term MCS. Team-based cardiogenic shock management has reported improved outcomes; in 1 such experience, the use of a shock team was associated with improved 30-day all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41–0.93) and reduced in-hospital mortality (61.0% vs. 47.9%; P = 0.041). Early transfer to centers capable of providing such support should be considered, and treatment of shock should be recognized as a temporizing strategy until the cause has been treated or a definitive solution (eg, durable LVAD or transplant) can be accomplished, with pharmacological or MCS providing time to address bridge-to-decision therapies with the patient, family, and the multidisciplinary shock team.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^113d28kC]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Why is there a disconnect between trial results and clinical use of inotropes?

Any practicing heart failure clinician would strongly argue that the two clinically available inotropes for stage D heart failure — milrinone and dobutamine — are essential tools in their therapeutic armamentarium. Their clinical use reflects this fact whereas exact numbers on a national level are unknown. Studies have approximated that more than 6% of patients admitted with heart failure are placed on intravenous inotropes and in 2014 Medicare spent $243 million for home milrinone and $3.8 million for home dobutamine infusions. 98 Likely because of the rapidly increasing prevalence of end‐stage heart failure, with a large percentage of patients either medically ineligible for or opting not to undergo heart transplantation or implantation of left ventricular assist devices, the usage of inotropes is increasing rapidly. Of note, this is occurring despite the clear lack of data supporting the benefit of chronic inotropic usage in heart failure and robust evidence suggesting the potential for harm. Furthermore, it also goes against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory label for both milrinone and dobutamine that has approved their use for 'inotropic support in the short‐term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility resulting either from organic heart disease or from cardiac surgical procedures'. In keeping with the data, the label specifically mentions that there are no data for treatment with these agents for more than 48 h — the primary way they are currently used in the clinical setting:

Evidence cited includes that "No RCTs compared dobutamine to placebo", network meta-analysis found dobutamine with norepinephrine had "no clear impact on mortality" versus no inotrope (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.47), and an observational study linked inotrope use with increased 90‑day mortality (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.94). "No evidence supports the superiority of dobutamine over epinephrine", and an indirect comparison showed "no clear effect on mortality" (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.47–3.97). The panel "issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations", and "Both should be discontinued in the absence of improvement in hypoperfusion or in the presence of adverse events".

Optimizing VAC during weaning

Vasodilators and inotropes are always used in severe post-cardiac surgery patients to assist in weaning from MV, which also optimizes VAC. Vasodilators, which decrease Ea by reducing the afterload, and inotropes, which augment Ees by strengthening contractility, are two important therapies that can improve VAC, which is crucial for ensuring a short duration of MV. Several studies have shown that vasodilators and inotropes can facilitate the weaning process. Routsi et al. used a nitroglycerin infusion to control systolic blood pressure, and it greatly improved the weaning process of difficult-to-wean patients. Despite concerns about inotrope use, the researchers verified that levosimendan and dobutamine can facilitate weaning in difficult-to-wean COPD patients. Moreover, fluid management also be favorable for VAC. Teboul et al. suggested fluid removal as a reasonable option to help difficult-to-wean patients. Removing excessive fluid can reduce left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which can increase coronary perfusion pressure and ameliorate myocardial perfusion.

### Inotropic therapy in patients with advanced heart failure. A clinical consensus statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^111UX84M]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

This clinical consensus statement reviews the use of inotropic support in patients with advanced heart failure. The current guidelines only support use of inotropes in the setting of acute decompensated heart failure with evidence of organ malperfusion or shock. However, inotropic support may be reasonable in other patients with advanced heart failure without acute severe decompensation. The clinical evidence supporting use of inotropes in these situations is reviewed. Particularly, patients with persistent congestion, systemic hypoperfusion, or advanced heart failure with need for palliation, and specific situations relevant to implantation of left ventricular assist devices or heart transplantation are discussed. Traditional and novel drugs with inotropic effects are discussed and use of guideline-directed therapy during inotropic support is reviewed. Finally, home inotropic therapy is described, and palliative care and end-of-life aspects are reviewed in relation to management of ongoing inotropic support (including guidance for maintenance and weaning of chronic inotropic therapy support).

### Intravenous home inotropic use is safe in pediatric patients awaiting transplantation [^115TDCMA]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous inotropic therapy can be used to support children awaiting heart transplantation. Although use of this therapy is discouraged in adults because of poor outcomes, its use in children, particularly outpatient, has had limited evaluation. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this practice.

Methods and Results

A retrospective analysis of an intent to treat protocol was completed on United Network for Organ Sharing status 1A patients discharged on inotropic therapy from 1999 until 2012. Intravenous inotropic therapy was initiated for cardiac symptoms not amenable to oral therapy. Patients who were not status 1A or required > 1 inotrope were excluded. Efficacy was analyzed by time to first event: transplantation; readmission until transplantation; improvement leading to inotrope withdrawal; or death. Safety included analysis of infection rates, line malfunctions, temporary hospitalization, neurological events, and arrhythmias. One hundred six patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 10.1 ± 6.4 years, 47% of patients had congenital heart disease, and 80% of these patients had single ventricle physiology. In patients without congenital heart disease, 53% had dilated cardiomyopathy, 91% of patients received milrinone, 85% of patients underwent transplantation, 8% of patients successfully weaned from support as outpatients, whereas 6% died. Fifty percent of patients were readmitted before transplantation or weaning from support, of which 64% required only 1 readmission. The majority of readmissions were for heart failure.

Conclusions

Outpatient intravenous inotropic therapy can be safely used as a bridge to transplantation in pediatric patients. A minority of patients can discontinue inotropic therapy because of clinical improvement.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^116qgRPr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

' Experience with intravenous dobutamine in controlled trials does not extend beyond 48 h of repeated boluses and/or continuous infusions. Whether given orally, continuously intravenously, or intermittently intravenously, neither dobutamine nor any other cAMP‐dependent inotrope has been shown in controlled trials to be safe or effective in the long‐term treatment of congestive heart failure. In controlled trials of chronic oral therapy with various such agents, symptoms were not consistently alleviated, and the cAMP‐dependent inotropes were consistently associated with increased risks of hospitalization and death. Patients with NYHA class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk'.
Why is use of these agents so common? Clearly, there is a large and rapidly growing population of patients who might benefit from these medications and were not represented in prior clinical trials. At the current time, however, several questions about inotrope usage in stage D heart failure remain unanswered. We do not know: (i) how to identify the patient populations who will benefit from these therapies, (ii) whether the benefits are purely symptomatic or can extend to hard clinical outcomes, (iii) how to dose either inotropes or concomitant neurohormonal therapies, and (iv) how inotrope use can fit into the patient‐centred decision‐ making regarding complex therapies for end‐stage heart failure. The epidemiologic insignificance of heart transplantation as a therapeutic intervention and the cost and morbidity associated with ventricular assist devices create an enormous potential for positive inotropic therapies for advanced heart failure. Currently there is a large chasm between clinical practice and academic understanding of these agents. Addressing these questions are likely to bring us closer to using and developing cardiac inotropes that meet patient‐specific needs without causing disproportionate harm.

### Prognosis and risk stratification in patients with decompensated heart failure receiving inotropic therapy [^113LEVZv]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Finally, it should be noted that most of the evidence about the impact of inotropes on HF comes from observational studies or post hoc analysis of trials not designed for the purpose. In fact, the severity of the disease and the dependence on inotropes for survival represent clinical and ethical restrictions to the development of randomised placebo controlled trials in this setting. Furthermore, most of these trials were performed before ICDs were used for primary prevention (which could now protect from inotropic-associated mortality) and used inotropic drugs that are no longer in use. Therefore, we have insufficient evidence to support conclusions about inotrope safety nowadays.

Limitations of this study are mostly related to its design: because data were obtained from medical records, it sometimes resulted in incomplete clinical and haemodynamic data, and information about cause of death was not always available. Timing and dose of the inotrope used were not available and could have allowed a better analysis of the association of these drugs with the outcome. The single-centre nature of our study may also reflect local practice patterns, and comparison with other populations should be done with caution.

In conclusion, inotropic drugs are still widely used for support of patients with advanced decompensated HF and are associated with worse in-hospital prognosis. However, transient use of inotropes during hospitalisation did not determine a worse prognosis at 180-day follow-up, and thus, was not a good marker for selection of candidates of advanced HF therapies, such as MCSs, especially in centres where these therapies are not broadly available.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^113nwHdf]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The mechanism and dosage of inotropic agents can cause adverse effects

There is a possibility that the adverse effects of inotropic agents on myocardial energetics and intracellular calcium could explain the results of prior trials: by increasing energy consumption and leading to exhaustion of the energy stores, these agents could promote pump failure as well as ventricular arrhythmias via dysfunctional calcium cycling. In fact, the negative long‐term impact of catecholamines on the heart, and the beneficial impact of β‐blockade, has been demonstrated in several landmark studies. 90 Additionally, data suggest that drugs acting via cAMP modulation lead to adverse effects in the long term by causing desensitization of the contractile apparatus to calcium, disturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis, causing ventricular arrhythmias, and disrupting lusitropy. Studies have shown that left ventricular function deteriorates to below pre‐treatment levels after withdrawal of inotropes, demonstrating that the therapy accelerates ventricular dysfunction. 91 It is conceivable that β‐adrenergic blocking agents might have prevented this deterioration of ventricular function, but their usage was infrequent during most clinical trials.

An intriguing corollary to the notion that the inotropic effects of drugs might explain their negative impact on clinical outcomes is that many clinical trials studying these agents aimed to maximize their positive haemodynamic effects and used very high doses for this purpose. Similar to the deleterious effects of very high doses of digoxin, it is quite possible that by chasing the wrong intermediate measures of heart failure, prior studies drove up the risk of myocardial toxicity and shifted the risk–benefit equation in the wrong direction. 80 This was articulated by Dr. Milton Packer in a perspective article published in a 1993 issue of JACC — in the aftermath of a large number of negative inotrope trials — where he concluded: 'The belief that positive inotropic agents for heart failure should be developed at inotropic doses may have been the primary factor for the controversy that has surrounded these drugs for the last 200 years'. 80

### Low-dose oral enoximone enhances the ability to wean patients with ultra-advanced heart failure from intravenous inotropic support: results of the oral enoximone in intravenous inotrope-dependent subjects trial [^111apWob]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

We determined whether low-dose oral enoximone could wean patients with ultra-advanced heart failure (UA-HF) from intravenous (i.v.) inotropic support. Chronic parenteral inotropic therapy in UA-HF is costly and requires an indwelling catheter. An effective and safe oral inotrope would have value.

Methods

In this placebo-controlled study, 201 subjects with UA-HF requiring i.v. inotropic therapy were randomized to enoximone or placebo. Subjects receiving intermittent i.v. inotropes were administered study medication of 25 or 50 mg 3 times a day (tid). Subjects receiving continuous i.v. inotropes were administered 50 or 75 mg tid for 1 week, which was reduced to 25 or 50 mg tid. The ability of subjects to remain alive and free of inotropic therapy was assessed for up to 182 days.

Results

Thirty days after weaning, 51 (51%) subjects on placebo and 62 (61.4%) subjects in the enoximone group were alive and free of i.v. inotropic therapy (unadjusted primary end point P = 0.14, adjusted for etiology P = 0.17). At 60 days, the wean rate was 30% in the placebo group and 46.5% in the enoximone group (unadjusted P = 0.016) Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated a trend toward a decrease in the time to death or reinitiation of i.v. inotropic therapy over the 182-day study period (hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.55–1.04]) and a reduction at 60 days (0.62 [95% CI 0.43–0.89], P = 0.009) and 90 days (0.69 [95% CI 0.49–0.97], P = 0.031) after weaning in the enoximone group.

Conclusions

Although there was no benefit over placebo in weaning patients from i.v. inotropes from 0 to 30 days, the EMOTE data suggest that low-dose oral enoximone can be used to wean a modest percentage of subjects from i.v. inotropic support for up to 90 days after initiation of therapy.

### Timing and strategy for weaning from venoarterial ECMO are complex issues [^113YUUNj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) usually is performed without clear guidelines; yet, patients still die after removal of extracorporeal circulation because of inadequate heart or end-organ recovery. The aim of the study was to address the weaning procedure, analyzing the hemodynamic and echocardiographic picture of patients weaned and to identify predictors of poor outcome among this population.

Design

Observational study.

Setting

University hospital.

Participants

One hundred twenty-nine VA ECMO cases.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Forty-nine patients (38%) were weaned, 7 (5.4%) were bridged to a ventricular assist device, and 6 (5.2%) were listed for heart transplantation. Weaned patients showed a significant increase of pulse pressure (35 [0–50] mmHg before ECMO, 59 [53–67] mmHg at weaning, 61 [51–76] mmHg after ECMO (p < 0.001]) and reduction of dose of inotropes (inotropic score [as defined in the text] 20 [14–40] before ECMO, 10 [3–15] at weaning, and 10 [5–15] after ECMO, p < 0.001). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased from 19 (0–22.5)% before ECMO to 35 (22–55)% after ECMO (p < 0.001). A significant improvement of right ventricular (RV) function was observed in weaned patients (RV dysfunction from 52% to 21%, p < 0.001). Among weaned patients, 15 (31%) died. Patients who died after weaning had longer ECMO duration compared to discharged patients (8 [5–11] v 4 [2–6] days, p = 0.01) and more transfusions (22 [10–37] v 7 [0.5–15] units, p = 0.02); survival was lower in patients with central ECMO (postcardiotomy) compared to peripheral ECMO (p = 0.045). Mortality was higher in those with persistence of RV failure, continuous venovenous hemofiltration, higher inotropic score, lower systolic pressure, or higher leucocyte count at weaning.

Conclusions

Successful weaning from ECMO is a multifaceted process, which encompasses consistent recovery of myocardial and end-organ function; LVEF, though improved, is still low at weaning. Hospital survival is correlated significantly to the duration of ECMO support and to bleeding complications.

### The effect of inotropes and vasopressors on mortality: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113ArJnQ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Inotropes and vasopressors are frequently administered to critically ill patients in order to improve haemodynamic function and restore adequate organ perfusion. However, some studies have suggested a possible association between inotrope administration and increased mortality. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials published in the last 20 yr to investigate the effect of these drugs on mortality.

Methods

BioMedCentral, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register were searched (all updated April 8th, 2015). Inclusion criteria were: random allocation to treatment, at least one group receiving an inotropic or vasopressor drug compared with at least one group receiving a non-inotropic/vasopressor treatment, study published after 1st January 1994, and systemic drug administration. Exclusion criteria were overlapping populations, studies published as abstract only, crossover studies, paediatric studies and lack of data on mortality.

Results

A total of 28 280 patients from 177 trials were included. Overall, pooled estimates showed no difference in mortality between the group receiving inotropes/vasopressors and the control group [4255/14 036 (31.7%) vs. 4277/14 244 (31.8%), risk ratio = 0.98 (0.96–1.01), P for effect = 0.23, P for heterogeneity = 0.30, I2 = 6%]. A reduction in mortality was associated with inotrope/vasopressor therapy use in settings of vasoplegic syndromes, sepsis and cardiac surgery. Levosimendan was the only drug associated with improvement in survival. Subgroup analysis did not identify any groups with increased mortality associated with inotrope/vasopressor therapy.

Conclusions

Our systematic review found that inotrope/vasopressor therapy is not associated with differences in mortality in the overall population and in the majority of subsettings.

Withdrawal of life-support measures in end-stage heart failure — "At the end stage of HF, patients and/or their surrogates may ask the specialist to withhold or withdraw life-prolonging therapy and provide supportive or comfort-oriented care", and "The decision to do so represents a specialized form of palliative care". HF specialists "should possess the skills needed to meet the goals of care enumerated in the Liverpool care pathway for the dying patient, as appropriate for the patient with end-stage heart disease (Table 11) (136)". Practical considerations "include weaning inotropic support, intraaortic balloon pump support, and LVADs, and deactivation of defibrillators when the decision is made to withdraw support", while ventilator withdrawal skills are "beyond the scope of this guideline and discussed elsewhere (137)".

### Comparison of outcomes for patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy taking intravenous inotropes versus those weaned from or never taking inotropes at cardiac resynchronization therapy [^111E9JZA]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Mixed cohorts of patients with ischemic and nonischemic end-stage heart failure (HF) with a QRS duration of ≥ 120 ms and requiring intravenous inotropes do not appear to benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, CRT does provide greater benefit to patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and might, therefore, be able to reverse the HF syndrome in such patients who are inotrope dependent. To address this question, 226 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy who received a CRT-defibrillator and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 35% and QRS of ≥ 120 ms were followed up for the outcomes of death, transplantation, and ventricular assist device placement. Follow-up echocardiograms were performed in patients with ≥ 6 months of transplant- and ventricular assist device-free survival after CRT. The patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) never took inotropes (n = 180), (2) weaned from inotropes before CRT (n = 30), and (3) dependent on inotropes at CRT implantation (n = 16). At 47 ± 30 months of follow-up, the patients who had never taken inotropes had had the longest transplant- and ventricular assist device-free survival. The inotrope-dependent patients had the worst outcomes, and the patients weaned from inotropes experienced intermediate outcomes (p < 0.0001). Reverse remodeling and left ventricular ejection fraction improvement followed a similar pattern. Among the patients weaned from and dependent on inotropes, a central venous pressure < 10 mm Hg on right heart catheterization before CRT was predictive of greater left ventricular functional improvement, more profound reverse remodeling, and longer survival free of transplantation or ventricular assist device placement. In conclusion, inotrope therapy before CRT is an important marker of adverse outcomes after implantation in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, with inotrope dependence denoting irreversible end-stage HF unresponsive to CRT.

### Weaning from inotropic support and concomitant β-blocker therapy in severely ill heart failure patients: take the time in order to improve prognosis [^111ZoN61]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Beta-blockers improve the prognosis in heart failure (HF), but their introduction may seem impossible in patients dependent on inotropic support. However, many of these patients can be titrated on beta-blockers, but there is little evidence of successful clinical strategies.

Methods and Results

We analysed the records of inotropy-dependent patients referred for assessment for heart transplantation. Thirty-six patients (45%) could not be weaned (NW) and underwent left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation or transplantation, or died. However, 44 (55%) were successfully weaned (SW). Neither the aetiology (ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic) nor cardiac indexes were different in the SW as compared with the NW group (2.27 ± 0.5 vs. 2.15 ± 0.6L/min/m²). The NW patients had lower LVEF (15 ± 5% vs. 19 ± 5%, P = 0.001), higher right atrial pressure (12 ± 6 vs. 8 ± 6 mmHg, P = 0.02), and more severe mitral regurgitation (P < 0.001) than the SW patients. At discharge, 35 of 44 SW patients were receiving beta-blockers. In 29 of them, a beta-blocker could only be initiated or continued during concomitant support with i.v. enoximone for a duration of 14.1 ± 7.2 days. Patients discharged on a beta-blocker had an LVAD/transplantation-free cumulative survival of 71% during a follow-up of 2074 ± 201 days (confidence interval 1679–2470).

Conclusion

It takes time to put severely ill HF patients on beta-blockers and it may require bridging with inotropes which are independent of beta-adrenergic receptors. Whether such a strategy may result in a better clinical outcome warrants further research.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^1133TkSn]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Weaning protocol from mAFP outlines a stepwise assessment beginning with whether "Further cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG, valve surgery, drainage of pericardial effusion) indicated"; if not, hemodynamic stability is defined as "MAP > 65 mmHg with only low-dose inotropes and/or vasopressors" before proceeding. Patients then require echocardiographic parameters "LVEF > 25–30%a" and "VTI > 12 cm" with "No severe mitral or tricuspid regurgitation" to attempt weaning, followed by "mAFP flow reduction to lowest level (e.g. P2) over 2 days". Subsequent criteria include "LVEF > 25–30%a", "VTI > 12 cm", "No inotropes support, only low-dose vasopressors", "No worsening of mitral regurgitation", "Stable cardiac rhythm", "Normal lactate", "AVO2 difference < 5", and "No signs of secondary organ failure". Patients failing these checks are triaged via "Candidate for durable LVAD or HTX"; if appropriate, the pathway directs to "Durable LVAD implantation or high urgency HTX listing".

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117Lczwz]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Maintain perfusion in hypotension — In cases of hypotension, a drug with combined inotropic and vasopressor properties may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion, and dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are useful adjuncts to augment contractility in the setting of significant hypotension (systolic BP < 80–90 mm Hg), with norepinephrine being a potent α1-receptor agonist that leads to vasoconstriction with less prominent inotropic and chronotropic effects. For refractory hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation not responding to initial interventions, more pure vasopressors such as arginine vasopressin or phenylephrine may be required, arginine vasopressin causes peripheral vasoconstriction with less impact on PVR and supports glomerular filtration via selective efferent arteriole constriction, and attempts should be made to wean off these treatments as rapidly as possible. Although short-term inotropic agents improve hemodynamics, long-term administration is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and possibly increased mortality, clinical guidelines recommend against the routine use of these agents in hospitalized patients with acute HF, and in rare cases, dobutamine can cause eosinophilic myocarditis with further deterioration of cardiac function.

Removal of invasive lines and drains in non-complicated post-operative mechanical circulatory support patients — timing and conditions are outlined: Pulmonary artery (PA) catheter removal is listed at 24–48 hours with the note that it must remain in place for severe right heart failure requiring high doses of inotropes. Arterial line removal is at 48–72 hours and must remain until all vasoactive medications are weaned. Central venous line removal is when no longer needed and must remain until all vasoactive medications are weaned. Chest tubes are removed at 48 hours or when drainage is < 100 mL in the previous 6 hours, preferably after the patient has sat up to assure that drainage is not positional. Pocket drains are removed at 72 hours or when drainage is < 100 mL for the previous 8 hours, with the note that earlier removal may occur if the pocket communicates with the left pleural space and the left sided chest tube remains in place.

Prespecified exposure variables included vasopressor infusions, 17 inotrope infusions, 16 RBC transfusions, 18, 26 and fluid volume administration. 19 Based on previous work, 27 clinically significant inotrope and vasopressor exposures were defined as infusion durations longer than or equal to 60 minutes intraoperatively. of patients for whom the score was computable; the inotrope exposure modified to include inopressors only; and the inotrope and vasopressor exposures handled as continuous variables, with clinician- and hospital-level means computed.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^112jSpfr]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Parameters to select device and timing — hemodynamic triggers and referral. When hypoperfusion persists despite preload and afterload optimization, the need for more CO should be considered. A higher inotropic dose and multiple inotropes have been demonstrated as significant risk factors and should drive referral to centers or an ICU, where acute MCS is feasible. The etiology of cardiogenic shock has a paramount role in deciding the need for support and its timing, and a reversible cause of CS (ie, successful reperfusion of ischemic lesions, myocarditis, postcardiotomy failure and post-transplant graft failure) should be a factor favoring timely implantation of a short-term device.

Weaning of cardiopulmonary bypass and actuating DMCS — vasopressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin) are started to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 75 to 90 mm Hg, while before separation and thereafter optimal oxygenation is maintained and acidosis and hypercarbia are avoided. In general, a central venous pressure of ≤ 14 mm Hg is desirable, and rapid administration of large amounts of intravenous fluids or blood products should be avoided; if necessary, blood products should be administered in combination with diuretics. Afterload management can be achieved using nonselective (milrinone) and selective (inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled prostaglandin) pulmonary vasodilators. Atrioventricular pacing may be attempted for bradyarrhythmia to enhance right ventricular function, and in the event of persistent and refractory right ventricular failure, mechanical right ventricular support should be instituted without delay. Continuous TEE guidance should be used to assess right ventricular function and degree of LV unloading during initiation of LVAD pump (Class I, Level of evidence C), pump speed should be increased and adjusted to maintain adequate aortic perfusion pressure, systemic perfusion and avoid excess unloading of the left ventricle (Class I, Level of evidence C), and selective inotropic therapy, pulmonary vasodilator therapy, systemic oxygenation, and heart rate with atrioventricular pacing, if necessary, should be optimized to prevent or manage right heart failure (Class I, Level of evidence C).

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^114rFgxA]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Benefit from inotropes might only be restricted to sub‐phenotypes of heart failure

Heart failure is not a singular disease. Rather, it is a syndrome that likely comprises several diseases with unique underlying mechanisms and trajectories. 84, 85, 86 Moreover, classification systems based on a century old assessment of functional status (NYHA class), or LVEF cut‐points are fundamentally dissociated from both mechanistic and clinical actuality. 87 Whereas trials of neurohormonal blockade have succeeded despite these constraints, we might now need to identify specific subgroups of the syndrome that respond favoorably to inotropes, in a manner analogous to cardiac resynchronization therapy. Thus far, all clinical trials of positive inotropes in heart failure have been anchored in broad measures of disease, leading to overly simplified and often inaccurate assumptions about how these therapies might help patients. 88 The significant drawbacks of this approach were demonstrated in a post‐hoc analysis of the OPTIME‐CHF trial that showed a substantial impact of heart failure aetiology (ischaemic vs. non‐ischaemic) on clinical outcomes with milrinone, with harm seen in patients with ischaemic disease. 89 In a manner analogous to how a therapy would not be tested generically for lung cancer or anaemia, we would be well served by testing future inotropes in a sub‐population of the syndrome (e.g. non‐ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy) that might benefit from the therapy. While there is a dearth of relevant data to approve therapies based on subtypes of heart failure, one population that may benefit are those with advanced, chronic heart failure and low output. Alternatively, inotropes with potentially anti‐remodelling properties, such as omecamtiv mecarbil, 56 could potentially be used at an earlier stage.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113PypNQ]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Inotropic support — synopsis: Despite improving hemodynamic compromise, positive inotropic agents have not shown improved survival in patients with HF in either the hospital or the outpatient setting. For hospitalized patients with documented severe systolic dysfunction who present with low blood pressure and significantly low cardiac index, short-term, continuous intravenous inotropic support may be reasonable to maintain systemic perfusion and preserve end-organ performance. There continues to be lack of robust evidence to suggest the clear benefit of 1 inotrope over another. To minimize adverse effects, lower doses of parenteral inotropic drugs are preferred, although the development of tachyphylaxis should be acknowledged, and the choice of agent may need to be changed during longer periods of support. Similarly, the ongoing need for inotropic support and the possibility of discontinuation should be regularly assessed.

### The impact of midodrine tapering versus nontapering regimens on the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study [^113cnEdp]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Midodrine has been used in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting to reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation. The limited data supporting midodrine use have led to variability in the pattern of initiation and discontinuation of midodrine.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 midodrine discontinuation regimens during weaning vasopressors in critically ill patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City. Included patients were adults admitted to ICU who received midodrine after being unable to be weaned from intravenous vasopressors for more than 24 hours. Patients were categorized into two subgroups depending on the pattern of midodrine discontinuation (tapered dosing regimen vs. nontapered regimen). The primary endpoint was the incidence of inotropes and vasopressors re-initiation after midodrine discontinuation.

Results

The incidence of inotropes or vasopressors' re-initiation after discontinuation of midodrine was lower in the tapering group (15.4%) compared with the non-tapering group (40.7%) in the crude analysis as well as regression analysis (odd ratio [OR] = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.73, P = 0.02). The time required for the antihypertensive medication(s) initiation after midodrine discontinuation was longer in patients who had dose tapering (beta coefficient (95% CI): 3.11 (0.95, 5.28), P = 0.005). Moreover, inotrope or vasopressor requirement was lower 24 hours post midodrine initiation. In contrast, the two groups had no statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, or ICU length of stay.

Conclusion and Relevance

These real-life data showed that tapering midodrine dosage before discontinuation in critically ill patients during weaning from vasopressor aids in reducing the frequency of inotrope or vasopressor re-initiation. Application of such a strategy might be a reasonable approach among ICU patients unless contraindicated.

Weaning protocol of combination of VA-ECLS and mAFP — algorithm directs stepwise decisions: Assess whether further cardiac surgery (e.g., revascularization, valve surgery, drainage of pericardial effusion) is indicated; if not, evaluate acceptable lung function (compliance, X-Ray, oxygenation). If lung function is not acceptable, perform optimization of pulmonary function and consider VA-V ECLS; if acceptable, reduce VA-ECLS flow to 1.5–2 L/min over 2–3 days, then verify ECHO shows acceptable RV function, MAP > 65 mmHg with only low-dose inotropes and/or vasopressors, normal lactate and SvO2, and AVO2 difference < 5. If these criteria are met, proceed to VA-ECLS explantation with next steps in mAFP weaning; if not, determine whether transition to temporary BVAD is possible, proceed to temporary BVAD and evaluate for candidacy for dMCS with implantation if appropriate; if transition is not possible or candidacy is not met, the pathway is support withdrawal for palliative care.

### Post hoc analysis of the glutamics-trial: intravenous glutamate infusion and use of inotropic drugs after cabg [^111SpeeG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous glutamate reduced the risk of developing severe circulatory failure after isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a double-blind randomised clinical trial (GLUTAMICS-ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:). Here our aim was to study if glutamate was associated with reduced the use of inotropes.

Methods

Post-hoc analysis of 824 patients undergoing isolated CABG for ACS in the GLUTAMICS-trial. ICU-records were retrospectively scrutinised including hourly registration of inotropic drug infusion, dosage and total duration during the operation and postoperatively.

Results

ICU-records were found for 171 out of 177 patients who received inotropes perioperatively. Only one fourth of the patients treated with inotropes fulfilled study criteria for postoperative heart failure at weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or later in the ICU. Inotropes were mainly given preemptively to facilitate weaning from CPB or to treat postoperative circulatory instability (bleeding, hypovolaemia). Except for a significantly lower use of epinephrine there were only trends towards lower need of other inotropes overall in the glutamate group. In patients treated with inotropes (glutamate n = 17; placebo n = 13) who fulfilled study criteria for left ventricular failure at weaning from CPB the average duration of inotropic treatment (34 ± 20 v 80 ± 77 h; p = 0.014) and the number of inotropes used (1.35 ± 0.6 v 1.85 ± 0.7; p = 0.047) were lower in the glutamate group.

Conclusions

Intravenous glutamate was associated with a minor influence on inotrope use overall in patients undergoing CABG for ACS whereas a considerable and significant reduction was observed in patients with heart failure at weaning from CPB.

### Determinants of weaning success in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation [^113GMYY9]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Using invasive and direct measurements of 'active' respiratory mechanics and diaphragmatic function, we have shown that stable ventilator-dependent patients who have initially failed more than one weaning attempt are characterized by a high load/capacity balance, especially due to a reduced Pdi max rather than to an excessive workload, so that once they are breathing spontaneously, they are placed above the threshold of diaphragm fatigue. The re-institution of a higher Pdi max was associated with definitive weaning from the ventilator and with a downward shift in the fatigue threshold. Conversely, the inotropic characteristic of the diaphragm did not improve in patients who could not be weaned.

### Inotropic therapy for heart failure: an evidence-based approach [^116Zu47X]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Agents that increase cardiac contractility (positive inotropes) have beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with acute and chronic heart failure but have frequently led to increased mortality when given on a long-term basis. Despite this fact, inotropes remain commonly used in the management of heart failure.

Methods

We reviewed the available data on short- and long-term inotrope use in heart failure, emphasizing high-quality evidence on the basis of randomized trials that were powered to address clinical end points.

Results

Available data suggest that long-term inotropic therapy has a negative impact on survival in patients with heart failure, regardless of the agent used. The data that inotropic therapy improves quality of life are mixed. High-quality randomized evidence is lacking for the use of inotropes for other heart failure indications, such as for acute decompensations or as a "bridge to transplant".

Conclusions

On the basis of the available evidence, the routine use of inotropes as heart failure therapy is not indicated in either the acute or chronic setting. Potentially appropriate uses of inotropes include as temporary treatment of diuretic-refractory acute heart failure decompensations or as a bridge to definitive treatment such as revascularization or cardiac transplantation. Inotropes also may be appropriate as a palliative measure in patients with truly end-stage heart failure. A model of heart failure pathophysiologic features that combines an understanding of both hemodynamic and neurohormonal factors will be required to best develop and evaluate novel treatments for advanced heart failure.

The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Long-term continuous inotropic treatment — use and risks: For some patients, weaning of inotropic support is not possible because of recurrence of symptomatic hypotension, congestive symptoms or worsening renal function after discontinuation; in these acutely inotrope-dependent patients, institution of a continuous infusion may be considered, but most studies have consistently shown an increase in mortality with long-term inotropes, so this option is used as a pharmacologic bridge to heart transplantation or mechanical support, and in end-stage (Class D) heart failure where no alternatives are feasible, long-term inotropic support may be considered for symptomatic relief at the end of life while balancing potential benefits and risks.

### Levosimendan in the light of the results of the recent randomized controlled trials: an expert opinion paper [^112S9mCi]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite interesting and unique pharmacological properties, levosimendan has not proven a clear superiority to placebo in the patient populations that have been enrolled in the various recent multicenter randomized controlled trials. However, the pharmacodynamic effects of levosimendan are still considered potentially very useful in a number of specific situations. Patients with decompensated heart failure requiring inotropic support and receiving beta-blockers represent the most widely accepted indication. Repeated infusions of levosimendan are increasingly used to facilitate weaning from dobutamine and avoid prolonged hospitalizations in patients with end-stage heart failure, awaiting heart transplantation or left ventricular assist device implantation. New trials are under way to confirm or refute the potential usefulness of levosimendan to facilitate weaning from veno-arterial ECMO, to treat cardiogenic shock due to left or right ventricular failure because the current evidence is mostly retrospective and requires confirmation with better-designed studies. Takotsubo syndrome may represent an ideal target for this non-adrenergic inotrope, but this statement also relies on expert opinion. There is no benefit from levosimendan in patients with septic shock. The two large trials evaluating the prophylactic administration of levosimendan (pharmacological preconditioning) in cardiac surgical patients with poor left ventricular ejection fraction could not show a significant reduction in their composite endpoints reflecting low cardiac output syndrome with respect to placebo. However, the subgroup of those who underwent isolated CABG appeared to have a reduction in mortality. A new study will be required to confirm this exploratory finding. Levosimendan remains a potentially useful inodilator agent in a number of specific situations due to its unique pharmacological properties. More studies are needed to provide a higher level of proof regarding these indications.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113DDcH7]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Augment contractility — inotropes should be considered when CO or BP are inadequate, as in broad terms they augment myocardial contractility and augment failing RV SV while reducing RV end-diastolic volume and pressure; milrinone and dobutamine have combined inotropic and vasodilator properties and can precipitate or worsen hypotension, although this is less likely if LV preload is adequate and their use results in improved CO; direct comparisons show similar clinical outcomes, including similar hemodynamic efficacy and arrhythmogenic potential; compared with dobutamine, milrinone leads to greater reductions in RV and LV end-diastolic pressure, less commonly causes tachycardia, may be considered a more rational choice with concomitant β-blocker therapy, and is less prone to drug tolerance during prolonged infusions; however, milrinone is more likely than dobutamine to provoke hypotension, bolus-related and less easily reversed by discontinuation, and given the long half-life vasopressor support may be necessary, with renal clearance necessitating consideration of estimated glomerular filtration rate for dosing.

Recommendations for management of new or progressive RV dysfunction — Class I: The academic research consortium definition of right heart failure should be used to characterize right ventricular failure after LVAD implant as early acute, early postimplant, or late right heart failure (Level of Evidence: C). Inotropic support may need to be continued into the remote postoperative period (> 2 weeks) when there is evidence for right heart dysfunction such as elevated jugular venous pressure, signs of venous congestion, decreased LVAD flows (or low pulsatility in continuous-flow MCSD), or end-organ dysfunction; once euvolemic, inotrope wean should be done cautiously, with ongoing examination for recurrent signs and symptoms of RV dysfunction (Level of Evidence: C). In patients with elevated right sided filling pressures, decongestion is critical to reduce RV wall stress; intravenous diuretics should be used in nonanuric patients and renal replacement therapy and/or ultrafiltration should be employed as needed to maintain optimal volume status (Level of Evidence: C). Class IIa: Inotropes and vasopressors such as dobutamine and epinephrine may assist with RV inotropy, and inotropes with pulmonary vasodilatory properties like milrinone and levosimendan may be useful for reducing RV wall stress and increasing RV contractility (Level of Evidence: B). Temporary or Durable RV mechanical support can be useful in carefully selected LVAD patients with evidence of severe RV dysfunction (Level of Evidence: B).

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^114PiwZm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Why have prior inotrope trials in chronic heart failure been negative?

The development of positive inotropic agents for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction has followed a recurring theme despite testing of a variety of agents that targeted diverse molecular pathways: improvements in surrogate measures of cardiac improvement do not necessarily translate into reduction in clinical events. Some reasons for this are likely to be compound specific, but several themes have emerged from the experience. Of note, these do not apply to the use of inotropic therapies for acute cardiogenic shock, where there are compelling data in support of bridging patients to stability.

Improvements in short‐term haemodynamics may not translate into longer‐term mortality and morbidity benefits

The haemodynamic model of heart failure suggest that reversing left ventricular systolic function will make patients feel better and live longer. 79 In line with this concept, haemodynamic assessments have been the entryway whereby dozens of inotropic agents have progressed to phase 3 clinical trials. Invariably, drugs that improved haemodynamics via a variety of mechanisms with documented increases of cardiac performance and improvements in blood flow to the peripheral organs failed to show clinical benefit in large clinical trials. Indeed, most were even associated with a heightened risk of death. 80

The lack of a direct relationship between interventions that led to short‐term haemodynamic improvements and clinical efficacy is not restricted to inotropes. Nesiritide, a recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide, was approved for clinical use based on small studies showing reductions in filling pressures, but subsequent trials showed no evidence of therapeutic efficacy. 81 Furthermore, the landmark Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) trial demonstrated that haemodynamic‐guided therapies in heart failure did not improve clinical outcomes, among patients in whom there was equipoise about use of these data. 82 Finally, the negative impact of β‐blockade on these indices prevented their clinical use for decades. 83

Therefore, the aggregate data suggest that short‐range haemodynamic endpoints might be misleading as surrogate measures for long‐term morbidity and mortality benefits from inotropes, with the caveat that it is unknown as to what combination of haemodynamic parameters constitute adequate improvement, and prior studies might have erred on the side of higher doses of inotropes to achieve larger than needed changes in haemodynamics. Additionally, it is entirely plausible that temporary treatment with an effective therapy will not translate into improvement in long‐term clinical outcomes.

### Prognosis and risk stratification in patients with decompensated heart failure receiving inotropic therapy [^112fFE7K]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In our study, a significant proportion of patients (44%) were weaned off inotropes and discharged home. Of these, 190 patients (82.6%) were alive at 180 days with no heart transplant or need for MCSs. Other authors reported similar results in a population of 80 patients dependent on inotropic support, where about 55% of patients were weaned-off inotropes, most of them being discharged home and showing an LVAD/transplant-free cumulative survival of 71%, during a mean follow-up of 2074 days. In our population, no difference existed in all-cause mortality, need for heart transplantation or rehospitalisation after discharge. Patients who were weaned off inotropes showed a similar outcome, compared with those who did not need inotropic support, and the only variable we found to be related to composite outcome was a lower LVEF. Studies on out-of-hospital prognosis after treatment with inotropic drugs in the acute setting are rare, and most of them support the harmful impact of these drugs. Another study found that both in-hospital mortality and mortality at 1-year follow-up were higher in the patients treated with inotropes during hospitalisation (21.4% vs 2.7% and 50.6% vs 17.7%, respectively), and inotropic use was independently associated with all-cause mortality using a propensity score adjustment logistic regression. A post hoc analysis of the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) trial also showed a shorter survival after discharge among patients who received in-hospital inotropes, compared with those who did not (144 vs 165 median days, respectively).

### Can levosimendan reduce ECMO weaning failure in cardiogenic shock? a cohort study with propensity score analysis [^112Ggx4Z]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients' management

During the study period, all patients were managed according to international guidelines for cardiogenic shock. Timings of administration of levosimendan (Zimino®, Orion Pharma, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France) and catecholamines were at the entire discretion of the physicians. The administration of levosimendan was started at a dose of 0.1 μg/kg/min for 1 h, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 to 0.2 μg/kg/min for 24 h. VA-ECMO flow rate was initially set at the theoretical cardiac output owing to the body surface area of the patient (2.2 L/min/m²). Inotropic support was usually provided in order to maintain both a left ventricular ejection and an aortic valve opening. Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin was used to maintain anti-Xa factor activity between 0.30 and 0.35 IU/ml during mechanical support. Serial transesophageal echocardiography was performed after a progressive reduction of VA-ECMO flow to a minimum of 1.0–1.5 L/min to assess myocardial recovery. When the weaning trial was hemodynamically well tolerated without the need for increasing inotropic or vasoactive support and echocardiographic criteria were fulfilled (LVEF > 20–25%, time-velocity integral > 10 cm, lateral mitral annulus peak systolic velocity > 6 cm/s, satisfactory right ventricular systolic function without dilatation), the weaning procedure was performed.

Study endpoints

The primary endpoint was VA-ECMO weaning failure defined as death occurring during VA-ECMO support or within 24 h after VA-ECMO removal. Secondary endpoints were mortality at day 28 and at 6 months after VA-ECMO implantation. Based on the available literature and on the analysis of patient outcomes in our institutional database, we classified indications for VA-ECMO into three categories (high, intermediate, or low) according to the potential for myocardial recovery.

### How I approach weaning from venoarterial ECMO [^115YaCb3]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior to weaning VA-ECMO flow, we wean vasoactive medications to low levels, given the deleterious effects associated with these medications, including arrythmia, renal injury, and limb ischemia. The following criteria should be met prior to weaning VA-ECMO: first, the patient phenotype is compatible with recovery; second, end-organ function is recovering; third, PaO₂/FiO₂ > 100; and fourth, vasopressors and inotropes are at reasonably low levels (for instance norepinephrine ≤ 4 μg/min or dobutamine < 5 mcg/kg/min). When these criteria are met, we initiate a 3-part approach to weaning that includes the following: (1) daily weaning study, (2) bedside assessment for decannulation, and (3) final assessment (Fig. 1).

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy in Inotrope-dependent heart Failure Patients: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LE7NL]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in inotrope-dependent patients with heart failure (HF) to ascertain the viability of CRT in these patients.

Background

During the last decade, significant numbers of trials have demonstrated the beneficial effect of CRT in the treatment of patients with HF and systolic dysfunction, prolonged QRS complex duration, and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. However, it is currently undetermined whether CRT may benefit patients who require inotropic support.

Methods

The authors systematically searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through March 2017 for studies evaluating outcomes after CRT in inotrope-dependent patients with HF. The study analyzed 8 studies including 151 patients. Most of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class IV (80.1%), and all had severe systolic HF, with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 30% and a significant intraventricular conduction delay in their surface electrocardiogram (QRS complex duration > 130 ms).

Results

The pooled analysis demonstrated that 93% of the reported patients (95% confidence interval: 86% to 100%) were weaned from inotropic support after CRT, and the overall 12-month survival rate was 69% (95% confidence interval: 56% to 83%).

Conclusions

This study suggests that rescue CRT may be considered a viable therapeutic option in inotrope-dependent patients with HF. In these patients, rescue CRT may allow them to be weaned from inotropic therapy, improve their quality of life, and decrease the rate of mortality; furthermore, rescue CRT may serve as a possible bridge to cardiac transplantation or left ventricular assist device therapy.

### Midodrine in end-stage heart failure [^1158KLS4]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that 5% of patients with heart failure (HF) will progress to end-stage disease refractory to medical therapy and might require prolonged hospitalisation with inotropic support. We present the case of a patient with end-stage HF who was admitted with cardiogenic shock. During his hospitalisation, he required prolonged intravenous vasopressor therapy due to refractory hypotension. He did not qualify for heart transplantation or left ventricular-assist device strategies. Midodrine was started as a last resort attempt to wean off vasopressors. After 5 days of therapy, the patient was weaned entirely off vasopressors and was discharged home for hospice care. By the time of discharge, he was tolerating low-dose carvedilol along with midodrine. We propose midodrine as a reasonable alternative for patients with end-stage HF with reduced ejection fraction and refractory hypotension, who are dependent on intravenous vasoactive drugs and are not candidates for advanced HF therapies.

According to our study patients with MS and small left ventricle needed more inotropic support and IABP during weaning off CBP after MVR to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure > 90 mmHg (P value = 0.01 and 0.03 respectively) and showed higher incidence of heart failure before discharge from ICU (p -value = 0.008). This is why in such patients we tend to use a reasonable dose of inotropes (e.g. Epinephrine at a rate of 50 ng/kg per minute as a continuous infusion) almost routinely during weaning off CBP and withdraw this inotropic support very gradually on the first postoperative day. In addition intravenous volume intake should be carefully administered both during weaning off CBP and during the ICU stay.

Finally our study has some limitations in the form of the retrospective nature and single-center experience. In addition, no significantly higher mortality could be elicited both during the primary hospital stay or the follow up period in patients with mitral stenosis and small left ventricle undergoing MVR. Therefore more future studies with larger cohort may be needed.

The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2006). Medium credibility.

Mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) use during inotropic therapy — key guidance includes that MCSD should be considered as a useful strategy to bridge patients to heart transplantation in those patients who are otherwise not considered transplant candidates as a result of the degree and persistence of pulmonary hypertension despite inotropic therapy (Level of Evidence: C). For patients responsive to inotropic therapy, a period of slow weaning from inotropes is mandatory to reduce the potential need for long-term inotropic therapy, and failure to wean may be defined as recurrence of symptoms and/or declining urinary output and a progressive rise in the BUN and creatinine. In challenging clinical cases, it is reasonable to perform right-heart hemodynamic assessment to verify a patient's volume status and cardiac output to tailor inotropic drug dose if prolonged administration is being considered (Level of Evidence: C), and it is reasonable to consider right-heart hemodynamic assessment to establish an association of clinical and biochemical markers with measured hemodynamic deterioration after withdrawal of inotropic therapy (Level of Evidence: C).

Current Use of Vasoactive Medications in Clinical Practice

The use of vasoactive medications in CS is common. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ≈25% of admitted patients receive at least 1 vasoactive medication, increasing to > 90% in patients with CS. Although comparative studies assessing these agents are limited, norepinephrine is increasingly administered for patients requiring hemodynamic support with CS. The requirement for vasoactive medications is independently associated with short‐term mortality and a stepwise increase in risk of in‐hospital mortality has been observed with increasing number of vasoactive agents administered. Furthermore, a dose‐dependent relationship with higher required peak doses to achieve hemodynamic stability is also associated with an increased risk of death. Although the observed excess mortality risk associated with the use of this drug class is of concern, these findings are likely to be confounded by increased illness severity necessitating the use of multiple agents at high doses. Nonetheless, these data underscore the need for further evaluation of the utility of these commonly used medications, compared with alternate vasoactive sparing strategies such as MCS.

### Cardiac resynchronization therapy: an option for inotrope-supported patients with end-stage heart failure? [^116FoZUL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with refractory heart failure requiring inotropic support have a very poor prognosis. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) offers symptomatic and possibly a survival benefit for patients with stable chronic heart failure (CHF) and a prolonged QRS, but its role in the management of end-stage heart failure requiring inotropic support has not been evaluated.

Methods

We performed a retrospective observational study of patients undergoing CRT at our institution.

Results

We identified 10 patients who required inotropic support for refractory CHF and who underwent CRT while on intravenous inotropic agents. Patients had been in hospital for 30 ± 29 days and had received inotropic support for 11 ± 6 days prior to CRT. All patients were weaned from inotropic support (2 ± 2 days post-CRT) and all patients survived to hospital discharge (12 ± 13 days post-CRT). Furosemide dose fell from 160 ± 38 mg on admission to 108 ± 53 mg on discharge (p < 0.01). Serum creatinine fell from 192 ± 34 micromol/l prior to CRT to 160 ± 37 micromol/l on discharge (p < 0.05). Serum sodium was 131 ± 4 mmol/l prior to CRT and remained low at 132 ± 5 mmol/l on discharge. At short-term follow up (mean 47 days), all patients were alive; mean furosemide dose was 130 ± 53 mg (p = 0.056 versus pre-CRT). Serum creatinine was 157 ± 36 micromol/l and serum sodium had increased to 138 ± 6 mmol/l (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively, versus pre-CRT).

Conclusion

CRT may offer a new therapeutic option for inotrope-supported CHF patients with a prolonged QRS.

### Management patterns and outcomes of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with cardiogenic shock [^113m6iFj]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

After initiation of IMV, patients were initially placed on relatively high ventilator support, but by 24 hours, almost half of patients had been weaned to "minimal vent settings", conservatively defined as FiO₂ ≤ 40% and PEEP ≤ 5 mm Hg. The low ventilator requirements suggest pulmonary edema and respiratory insufficiency were generally not the reason for continued IMV support. Additionally, median tidal volume was 7 cc/kg, slightly above the traditional 6 cc/kg used for low tidal volume ventilation. While this cohort was managed with lower tidal volumes and PEEP, there are no data suggesting improvement in clinical outcomes with this strategy in CS patients. The literature surrounding low tidal volume ventilation is primarily taken from ARDS patients, and it is unclear if strict tidal volume control or a target driving pressure is associated with similar mortality improvements in CS patients as it is in ARDS. This cohort was also predominantly left ventricular or mixed biventricular failure, so the potential harm of higher PEEP strategy associated with right ventricular dysfunction would be less likely. Further work is needed to assess if low tidal volume or lower PEEP strategies impact clinical outcomes in this patient population.

Both the SCCM and AHA recommend routine protocolized use of SATs and SBTs to facilitate extubation based on data that these interventions improve all-cause mortality in intubated patients. Patients must pass a "safety screen" before being eligible for these tests. Criteria for SBT safety are not standardized, but typically include factors such as being on low ventilator settings and relative hemodynamic stability. In some medical ICU literature, milrinone (at any dose) is classified as a screen failure. Failing SBT screens for inotrope use is likely not appropriate in patients with CS. Even in the absence of SBT criteria, patients should receive SATs unless contraindicated due to factors such as the patient receiving paralytic agents or in severe shock (3–5 pressors in medical intensive care unit literature). It is important to note that tMCS is not included in these recommendations. There are few data on weaning IMV in the setting of inotropic or mechanical circulatory support, but data from the medical ICU increasingly suggest that extubation on low-dose vasopressors is reasonable. The definition of how much support qualifies as "hemodynamically unstable" needs further investigation in the modern era of CS.

### Keeping your patient with heart failure safe… [^112ZdegJ]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do not exert their detrimental effects in patients with HF through morphologic changes in heart muscle or direct myocardial damage. The therapeutic and adverse effects of NSAIDs are secondary to their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. This inhibition causes a decrease in renal blood flow and compensatory sodium and water retention. By expanding the intravascular volume, NSAIDs blunt the response to diuretics, an important adjunct therapy in patients with HF. Prostaglandin depletion increases systemic vascular resistance, which may also augment symptoms of HF. 10, 11. Class III Antiarrhythmics. Sotalol is a racemic mixture of D- and L-isomers, which have differing effects on potassium channels and β-receptors. The D-isomer is a pure potassium channel blocker lacking β-adrenergic effects, while L-sotalol possesses competitive nonselective β-receptor blocking activity.

22 Sotalol has produced mixed results in clinical trials and retrospective analyses in patients with HF. Most of the studies include small numbers of patients, which makes interpretation of the outcomes difficult. Calcium Channel Blockers. Major considerations for the use of CCBs are as follows: Mechanisms of adverse effect: negative inotropic activity; neurohormonal activation Time to onset: average of 2 to 3 months on initiation Recommendation: avoid use of CCBs in patients with HF. Recommended heart failure therapy with an ACEI and a β-blocker provides morbidity and mortality benefit by attenuating these neurohormonal systems. In addition, negative inotropic effects of specific CCBs can acutely decrease cardiac output, potentially causing further decompensation in these patients.

32 The CCBs are a heterogeneous class with varying effects on heart muscle, sinus node function, atrioventricular conduction, coronary circulation, and peripheral blood vessels. 33 Hence, it is imperative to examine these agents on the basis of their pharmacologic actions separately. Distinctive from the other CCBs, verapamil and diltiazem possess negative chronotropic activity. Nifedipine, nisoldipine, and nicardipine are essentially devoid of negative chronotropic properties. Nifedipine retains significant negative inotropic effects, while nisoldipine and nicardipine have minimal to no negative inotropic effects.

Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) postoperative medical management — hemodynamic improvement with reduced PAP and PVR and improved cardiac output can be appreciated immediately; in-hospital mortality ranges between 2.2% and 11%. ICU care focuses on RV preload, inotropes, and vasopressors, while a high CI (> 3.0 liter min/m2) is purposely avoided; routine early diuresis is employed, and patients without complications are typically extubated and weaned off inotropes within the first 24 hours. Residual PH risk stratification shows mortality of 10.3% with residual PVR > 500 dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵ versus 0.9% with postoperative PVR < 500 dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵. Reduction in PVR and/or improved oxygenation can be achieved in some with iNO or ioprost without blood pressure decrease, and extracorporeal support may be required in severe cases as a bridge to transplant or recovery.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of intravenous inotropic therapy in advanced heart failure [^115RxwC6]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Inotrope use in heart failure treatment was associated with improved symptoms, but worse survival in clinical trials. However, these studies predated use of modern heart failure therapies. This study evaluates contemporary outcomes on long-term inotropes.

Methods and Results

We collected baseline and postinotrope data on 197 patients discharged on inotropes between January 2007 and March 2013. Baseline characteristics, hemodynamic and clinical changes on inotropes, and survival were evaluated. Patients initiated on inotropes had refractory heart failure, with median baseline New York Heart Association class IV, cardiac index of 1.7 L/min per m², pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.6 mm Hg, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 18.7%. Inotropes were used in patients listed for transplant or scheduled for left ventricular assist device (LVAD; 60 patients), in patients being evaluated for LVAD/transplant (20 patients), for stabilization pending cardiac resynchronization therapy/percutaneous coronary intervention (4 patients), in patients who were offered LVAD but chose inotropes (15 patients), and for palliation (98 patients). Milrinone was used in 84.8% and dobutamine in 15.2%. At the end of the study, 68 patients had died, 24 were weaned off inotropes, 23 were transplanted, 32 received LVADs, and 50 remained on inotropes. Patients who received inotropes for palliation or those who preferred inotropes over LVAD had median survival of 9.0 months (interquartile range, 3.1–37.1 months), actuarial 1-year survival of 47.6%, and 2-year survival of 38.4%. Of 60 patients who were placed on inotropes as a bridge to transplant/LVAD, 55 were successfully maintained on inotropes until transplant/LVAD.

Conclusions

Survival on inotropes for patients who are not candidates for transplant/LVAD is modestly better than previously reported, but remains poor. Inotropes are effective as a bridge to transplant/LVAD.

Postexplant management and surveillance — ICU care targets include minimizing IV fluids, leaving a Swan Ganz catheter in place postoperatively for at least 48 hours, and titrating fluid balance to invasive hemodynamics. Diuretics should be used to maintain the PA diastolic pressure below 20 mm Hg, inotropes are usually continued for the first few days after explant and then slowly discontinued, and caution is advised with high dose milrinone immediately postoperatively so avoidance or an early wean is advised. As inotropes are weaned off after explantation, the ACE inhibitor should be reintroduced followed by the beta blocker, both should be uptitrated as rapidly as possible, and the aldosterone antagonist should also be reintroduced while monitoring the potassium.

### Role of cardiac resynchronization in end-stage heart failure patients requiring inotrope therapy [^111WhVrz]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Outcomes among inotrope-treated heart failure (HF) patients receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) have not been well characterized, particularly in those requiring intravenous inotropes at the time of implant.

Methods

We analyzed 759 consecutive CRT-defibrillator recipients who were categorized as never on inotropes (NI; n = 585), weaned from inotropes before implant (PI; n = 124), or on inotropes at implant (II; n = 50). Survival free from heart transplant or ventricular assist device and overall survival were compared using the Social Security Death Index. A patient cohort who underwent unsuccessful CRT implantation and received a standard defibrillator (SD; n = 94) comprised a comparison group. Propensity score analysis was used to control for intergroup baseline differences.

Results

Compared with the other cohorts, II patients had more comorbidities. Both survival endpoints differed significantly (P < .001) among the 4 cohorts; II patients demonstrated shorter survival than NI patients, with the PI and SD groups having intermediate survival. After adjusting for propensity scores, overall differences and patterns in survival endpoints persisted (P < .01), but the only statistically significant pairwise difference was overall survival between the NI and II groups at 12 months (hazard ratio 2.95, 95% confidence interval 1.05–8.35). CRT recipients ever on inotropes (PI and II) and SD patients ever requiring inotropes (n = 17) experienced similar survival endpoints. Among II patients, predictors of hospital discharge free from inotropes after CRT included male gender, older age, and ability to tolerate β-blockade.

Conclusions

Inotrope-dependent HF patients show significantly worse survival despite CRT than inotrope-naïve patients, in part because of more comorbid conditions at baseline. CRT may not provide a survival advantage over a standard defibrillator among patients who have received inotropes before CRT. Weaning from inotropes and initiating neurohormonal antagonists before CRT should be an important goal among inotrope-dependent HF patients.

### Parameters associated with successful weaning of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review [^115toPt4]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Step 3: assessing recovery of native heart function

Once tissue perfusion is restored, the next step is to assess native heart recovery. Under constant minute ventilation, an increase in EtCO₂ reflects an increase in transpulmonary flow, a reliable marker of native cardiac output recovery that may be observed earlier than changes in hemodynamics. Higher LVOT VTI, both at minimal and maximal ECBF, is a widely used parameter of LV recovery with good predictive performance for weaning success. Weaned patients also tend to display higher LVEF, t-IVT, FS, MAPSE and mitral S′ velocity. Echocardiographic (RV ejection fraction and TAPSE) and hemodynamic (RA/PCWP ratio, TPG and PAPi) parameters of RV function are also strongly associated with weaning success. On full extracorporeal support, LV indices tend to underestimate true LV performance, while RV indices tend to overestimate true RV performance. Tissue Doppler systolic velocities are relatively load-independent, making them interesting parameters to follow when patients are still supported with high ECBF.

Step 4: performing flow reduction trials

In stable patients with evidence of myocardial recovery, a trial of ECBF reduction is generally attempted prior to decannulation to assess the net hemodynamic effect of reducing the support provided by VA-ECMO. The effect of flow reduction on MAP, CVP and vasopressor-inotropic support is observed. If tolerated, echocardiographic evaluation may be performed. Better indices of LV systolic and diastolic function, ventricular interdependence and RV function during flow reduction trials predict favorable weaning outcomes. Importantly, flow reduction may unmask significant underlying hypoxemic respiratory failure that may be associated with increased pulmonary vascular resistance.

Step 5: pump-controlled retrograde trial off (PCRTO)

Finally, PCRTO may be performed by reducing the centrifugal pump rotation speed until a retrograde flow occurs through the circuit. This creates a controlled arterio-venous fistula, with the blood being pumped through the ECMO circuit by the native heart, returning in the venous system. This significantly challenges the RV which has to accommodate a substantial preload increase. Thereby, it may simulate VA-ECMO decannulation more accurately than flow reduction and may last longer than circuit clamping, which is limited by the risk of clot formation. During retrograde flow, the sweep gas should be turned off to uncover any residual gas exchange impairment. By reversing the flow, there is a theoretical risk of pulmonary embolism through clot detachment from the venous side of the oxygenator. More studies are needed to validate this method.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^1165MG7d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Current pharmacological therapies for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are largely either repurposed anti-hypertensives that blunt overactivation of the neurohormonal system or diuretics that decrease congestion. However, they do not address the symptoms of heart failure that result from reductions in cardiac output and reserve. Over the last few decades, numerous attempts have been made to develop and test positive cardiac inotropes that improve cardiac haemodynamics. However, definitive clinical trials have failed to show a survival benefit. As a result, no positive inotrope is currently approved for long-term use in heart failure. The focus of this state-of-the-art review is to revisit prior clinical trials and to understand the causes for their findings. Using the learnings from those experiences, we propose a framework for future trials of such agents that maximizes their potential for success. This includes enriching the trials with patients who are most likely to derive benefit, using biomarkers and imaging in trial design and execution, evaluating efficacy based on a wider range of intermediate phenotypes, and collecting detailed data on functional status and quality of life. With a rapidly growing population of patients with advanced heart failure, the epidemiologic insignificance of heart transplantation as a therapeutic intervention, and both the cost and morbidity associated with ventricular assist devices, there is an enormous potential for positive inotropic therapies to impact the outcomes that matter most to patients.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Intravenous peripheral vasodilators and positive inotropic agents — refractory heart failure (HF): during hospitalizations for clinical deterioration, patients commonly receive infusions of both positive inotropic agents (dobutamine, dopamine, or milrinone) and vasodilator drugs (nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or nesiritide). Some physicians have advocated pulmonary artery catheter–guided therapy, but the logic of this approach has been questioned. Regardless of whether invasive hemodynamic monitoring is used, once the clinical status has stabilized, every effort should be made to devise an oral regimen that can maintain symptomatic improvement and reduce the subsequent risk of deterioration, and assessment may necessitate observation in the hospital for at least 48 hours after the infusions are discontinued. Patients who cannot be weaned to oral therapy despite repeated attempts may require an indwelling intravenous catheter for the continuous infusion of dobutamine or milrinone, or nesiritide; such a strategy is commonly used while awaiting cardiac transplantation and may also be used in the outpatient setting in patients who otherwise cannot be discharged. The decision to continue intravenous infusions at home should not be made until all alternative attempts to achieve stability have failed repeatedly because this approach may ultimately increase the risk of death, although continuous intravenous support can provide palliative symptom relief as part of an overall plan to allow the patient to die with comfort at home. The use of continuous intravenous support to allow hospital discharge should be distinguished from the intermittent administration of infusions to patients who have been successfully weaned from inotropic support.

Medical treatment of patients in prior trials did not protect them from sudden cardiac death

As displayed in Table 3 14, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 53, 54, 56, 57 most of the landmark trials that tested positive inotropes in heart failure had very low usage of key therapies — β‐blockers and implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) — that are known to protect heart failure patients against sudden cardiac death, the mode of death most commonly provoked by these medications. In fact, many of these trials listed β‐blocker use as an exclusion criterion as they occurred prior to when these medications were found to be of benefit in heart failure. Whereas the actual prevalence of ICD use is unclear from most of the published manuscripts, it generally occurred prior to the landmark trials showing benefit of these devices for primary and secondary prevention of sudden death in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. 92 Furthermore, usage of additional neurohormonal agents was low in these trials, potentially leading to even less protection from the adverse effects of adverse remodelling. Finally, a large portion of patients in positive inotrope trials were on concomitant digoxin, often on higher doses than are currently considered therapeutic. Given the mechanistic intersections between digoxin and cardiac inotropes, it is plausible that concomitant usage might have had a negative synergistic effect. 93 These have been proposed as reasons as to why contemporary outcomes from inotrope usage are better that those seen in trials. 92, 93 In addition, a recent meta‐analysis has suggested that ambulatory inotrope infusions in advanced stage D heart failure may improve NYHA functional class without negatively impacting survival. 94

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^113PfTKx]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Why has positive inotropy failed in chronic heart failure? Lessons from prior inotrope trials [^111UfjTZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Results from clinical trials

Clinical trials of inotropes in heart failure have reinforced an important lesson: whereas short‐term surrogate endpoints such as haemodynamics might improve with these therapies, this does not necessarily translate into improvements in mortality. Inotropic therapies to date have failed to improve 'hard' clinical outcomes in heart failure, and the majority resulted in worse outcomes (Table 2). 14, 32, 34, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57 Furthermore, only a subset of results from trials investigating inotropes have been published, some many years after the results were presented, and the primary data are not available for analysis making a meticulous post‐mortem of disappointing prior results challenging. 58, 59

### Bench-to-bedside review: inotropic drug therapy after adult cardiac surgery – a systematic literature review [^112ZW3Q8]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Many adult patients require temporary inotropic support after cardiac surgery. We reviewed the literature systematically to establish, present and classify the evidence regarding choice of inotropic drugs. The available evidence, while limited in quality and scope, supports the following observations; although all beta-agonists can increase cardiac output, the best studied beta-agonist and the one with the most favourable side-effect profile appears to be dobutamine. Dobutamine and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDIs) are efficacious inotropic drugs for management of the low cardiac output syndrome. Dobutamine is associated with a greater incidence of tachycardia and tachyarrhythmias, whereas PDIs often require the administration of vasoconstrictors. Other catecholamines have no clear advantages over dobutamine. PDIs increase the likelihood of successful weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass as compared with placebo. There is insufficient evidence that inotropic drugs should be selected for their effects on regional perfusion. PDIs also increase flow through arterial grafts, reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure and improve right heart performance in pulmonary hypertension. Insufficient data exist to allow selection of a specific inotropic agent in preference over another in adult cardiac surgery patients. Multicentre randomized controlled trials focusing on clinical rather than physiological outcomes are needed.

INTERMACS profiles — advanced heart failure severity classification (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) defines seven clinical profiles with characteristic features: Critical cardiogenic shock is characterized by life-threatening hypotension with rapidly escalating inotropic/pressor support and critical organ hypoperfusion often confirmed by worsening acidosis and lactate; progressive decline describes patients "dependent" on inotropes with continuing deterioration or refractory volume overload when inotropes cannot be maintained because of tachyarrhythmias, clinical ischemia, or other intolerance; stable but inotrope dependent indicates clinical stability on mild–moderate intravenous inotropes or temporary circulatory support with repeated failure to wean; resting symptoms on oral therapy at home includes frequent congestion at rest or with activities of daily living with possible orthopnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, disabling ascites, or severe lower extremity edema; exertion intolerant patients are comfortable at rest but unable to engage in any activity and are housebound; exertion limited patients are comfortable at rest without fluid overload and can perform minor activities outside the home but develop fatigue within a few minutes or with any meaningful physical exertion; advanced NYHA class III patients are clinically stable with a reasonable level of comfortable activity, usually able to walk more than a block, but any decompensation requiring intravenous diuretics or hospitalization within the previous month should be classified lower. Modifier options include recurrent decompensations for Profiles 3 to 6 defined by frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations (generally at least 2 in past 3 mo or 3 in past 6 mo) for intravenous diuresis, ultrafiltration, or brief inotropic therapy; if a Profile 7 patient meets these criteria, the patient should be moved to Profile 6 or worse; additional modifiers include recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, frequent ICD shocks or external defibrillation, usually more than twice weekly) or temporary circulatory support for hospitalized patients Profiles 1 to 3.

Duration of mechanical ventilation

Information on this outcome was provided by both included studies, which reported that the mean of duration of mechanical ventilation was lower (mean difference ‐1.04, 95% CI ‐1.72 to ‐0.35) in the intervention group with levosimendan compared to 5.97 to 7.40 hours in the control group with dobutamine (140 participants, 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence; low heterogeneity) (Analysis 4.7).

Proportion of weaning failure within 48 hours of extubation

This outcome was not reported in any of the included studies.

Number of patients requiring mechanical circulatory support (IABP)

Only one study provided this outcome (Kandasamy 2017), and reported that 1 out of 40 participants required mechanical circulatory support in both intervention and control groups (Analysis 4.8). Accordingly, no evidence of a difference was found in the risk ratio for this outcome between groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.44; 80 participants, 1 study; low‐certainty evidence; heterogeneity was not applicable) (Analysis 4.8).

Number of patients requiring additional inotropic drugs

The need for overall additional inotropic drugs was restricted to Gandham 2013, who reported that 21 out of 30 patients required additional inotropic drugs in the intervention group with levosimendan compared to 4 out of 30 patients in the dobutamine control group. There was a difference in risk ratio between groups favouring dobutamine (RR 5.25, 95% CI 2.05 to 13.47; 60 participants, 1 study; heterogeneity not applicable) (Analysis 4.9).

Within this outcome category, both included studies reported on specific inotropic drugs, i.e. epinephrine and norepinephrine. Regarding epinephrine, 9 out of 70 participants in the levosimendan group compared to 5 out of 70 participants in the control group received this additional inotropic support (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 8.23) (Analysis 4.10). In addition, it was stated that 28 out of 70 participants in the levosimendan group and 8 out of 70 participants in the dobutamine control group required additional norepinephrine (RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.21 to 10.24) (Analysis 4.11).

Number of patients requiring cardiac transplantation, ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation

These outcomes were not reported in any of the included studies.

### Levosimendan in the light of the results of the recent randomized controlled trials: an expert opinion paper [^114ag7E3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Levosimendan to facilitate weaning from veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation

Veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) is used to restore adequate perfusion to vital organs in patients suffering from refractory cardiogenic shock. However, VA ECMO with femoral artery cannulation provokes an increase in left ventricular afterload while residual blood flow from the pulmonary and bronchial circulations keep flowing towards the left ventricle. Consequently, if the failing left ventricle is unable to eject against the retrograde flow of the VA ECMO, it may dilate and the resulting congestion may lead to pulmonary edema. To avoid this complication, low doses of positive inotropic drugs are commonly administered in order to maintain left ventricular ejection and avoid upstream congestion. Moreover, since the duration of VA ECMO is directly correlated to complications, the weaning of the device should be attempted as soon as possible. Although dobutamine is currently the first-line drug used for patients in cardiogenic shock, the specific features of levosimendan are of interest in this situation. However, despite an attractive rationale, only a few studies support the effectiveness of levosimendan to facilitate the weaning of VA ECMO and they are always retrospective. In addition, we have no clue regarding the ideal dosing and timing to initiate levosimendan infusion in patients suffering from cardiogenic shock and treated by VA ECMO. A multicenter randomized controlled trial is about to start to test the hypothesis that levosimendan in addition to standard care facilitates the weaning from VA ECMO.

### Cardiogenic shock: searching for a better lifeboat [^112c1wnm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Beyond the issue of unloading, one must question why there has been so little progress in identifying therapies that improve mortality in CS. We believe that there are several considerations that will be important going forward.
Shock severity should be assessed in trials and registries at the onset of care. Retrospectively classifying shock severity by the treatment chosen (eg, number of drugs and devices) is convenient to analyze data sets but does not capture the fundamental distinctions between various stages of shock (eg, by the Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention classification). For example, deterioration (Society for Cardiac Angiography and Intervention D) is not simply the use of a mechanical circulatory support device and an inotrope, but an assessment of a downward clinical trajectory. By collecting data in this manner, differences in responses to treatment (if they exist) might be found and leveraged to build evidence for best practices when managing CS.
Granular detailed registries that capture longitudinal data about patients with CS and the responses to therapy are more likely to identify strategies that improve mortality than prospective randomized trials. Although the highest level of evidence is a prospective randomized clinical trial, the difficulties with enrollment, inherent selection bias, and complete failure of prior prospective trials (with the exception of the should we emergently revascularize occluded coronaries for cardiogenic shock [SHOCK] trial) suggest that a new strategy is warranted.
Research should focus on fundamental understanding of the transitions of stages of shock. When does the patient transition from "pump‐responsive" phenotype (where sufficient cardiac output augmentation will reverse the physiologic derangements noted) to the "pump‐unresponsive" phenotype (ie, cardiometabolic shock) where augmentation of cardiac output does little to reverse the calamitous cycle of hemodynamic collapse? This is a similar situation to that of septic shock, which has few treatments and many failed interventions. Examining biomarkers in patients in a serial manner may give insights into the deranged pathways and allow targets for intervention to be identified.
Postcardiotomy shock should be carefully investigated as a unique entity and one that has the advantage of a clear timing of insult (cardiac surgery/cardiopulmonary bypass). Other forms of CS have heterogeneous types of inciting insult (acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and others), timing that is unclear or sometimes unknown, and a monitoring environment that is often variable. On the other hand, postcardiotomy shock occurs with clear chronology, granular data on elements, such as vital signs, transfusions, and drug infusions, and frequent laboratory measurements. It is possible that mechanisms identified in the setting of postcardiotomy shock may not be universally applicable, but some pathways may be conserved across phenotypes.

### Should we wean patients off vasopressors before weaning them off ventilation? [^115VnFzy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Failed extubation and subsequent reintubation are independently associated with mortality and morbidity of patients under mechanical ventilation. This is the reason why, before starting the weaning process, one carefully waits until the patient has reached a sufficient degree of autonomy. Among the criteria used to ensure autonomy, it must be admitted that the absence of vasopressor infusion is one of the least solid. Although it is obvious that the patient must be sufficiently awake and positive end-expiratory pressure and F O 2 must be low, testifying to a minimal respiratory autonomy, the need to be rid of vasopressor support before weaning from mechanical ventilation is less evident.

In many cases, the persistence of vasopressor support is accompanied by persistent dependence on the ventilator or other remaining failures, and the question of extubating the patient under vasopressors does not arise. Also, if there is ongoing myocardial ischemia or major circulatory failure, with obvious signs of tissue hypoxia, and if the doses of vasopressors are increasing, it is obvious that extubation must be avoided. The increase in oxygen consumption owing to the reactivation of the respiratory muscles would aggravate tissue hypoxia, and extubation is clearly unreasonable in this context.

But in other cases, when the infusion of a low dose of a vasopressor is the only obstacle that remains, what justifies refraining from extubating the patient? The answer to this question is still pending.

The risk is not that extubation under vasopressors would expose the patient to weaning-induced cardiac dysfunction, even if it is a frequent cause of weaning failure. Indeed, this acute cardiac failure, and the frequently associated pulmonary edema, are mainly owing to unfavorable changes in the loading conditions of both ventricles during the transition to spontaneous breathing. The increase in cardiac preload owing to the inspiratory fall in intrathoracic pressure, the increase in right ventricular afterload owing to high-volume ventilation, and the increase in left ventricular afterload owing to hypertension are the main mechanisms involved. Then, there is no reason why the persistence of low arterial tone and the administration of a vasopressor should contribute to it. In fact, the reason one refrains from extubating a patient on a low dose of a vasopressor is simply the fear that the underlying disease that led to the intubation did not completely resolve, if there is no other clear hemodynamic reason why the patient should worsen.

### Inotropes [^114Nc7dd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Inotropes have been fundamental to resuscitation of acute cardiogenic shock for decades. Heart failure and cardiogenic shock, in severe cases, are syndromes characterized in many patients by a reduction in myocardial contractile force. While inotropes successfully increase cardiac output, their use has been plagued by excessive mortality due to increased tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption leading to arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia. There is a pressing need for new inotropic agents that avoid these harmful effects. This review describes the mechanism of action and the clinical utility of some of the older inotropic agents, which are still commonly used, and provides an update for physicians on the development of newer inotropic drugs. The field is rapidly changing, and it is likely that new agents will be designed that improve systolic performance without necessarily increasing the myocardial oxygen consumption.

Inpatient management of patients with MCSDs — treatment of right heart dysfunction in the non-ICU post-operative period includes the following: 2013 recommendations (Class I, Level of Evidence C) state that inotropic support may need to be continued into the remote post-operative period (> 2 weeks) when there is evidence for right heart dysfunction such as elevated jugular venous pressure, signs of venous congestion, decreased VAD flows (or low pulsatility in continuous-flow MCSD), or end-organ dysfunction, and once euvolemic, inotrope wean should be done cautiously, with ongoing examination for recurrent signs and symptoms of RV dysfunction. The 2023 updated guidelines provide Class I guidance that the academic research consortium definition of right heart failure should be used to characterize right ventricular failure after LVAD implant as early acute, early post-implant, or late right heart failure (Level of Evidence C [New]) and note "Continuing approval without change".

ISHLT 2023 mechanical circulatory support (MCS) guidelines — Risk stratification for consideration of MCS (Class IIa): Long-term DMCS for patients who are in acute cardiogenic shock should be reserved for patients whose ventricular function is either deemed unrecoverable or unlikely to recover without long-term device support, patients who are deemed too ill to maintain normal hemodynamics and vital organ function with temporary MCSDS or who cannot be weaned from temporary MCSDS or inotropic support, patients with the capacity for meaningful recovery of end-organ function and quality of life, and patients without irreversible end-organ damage. Patients who are inotrope dependent should be considered for DMCS, and patients with end-stage systolic heart failure who do not fall into recommendations 1 and 2 should undergo routine risk stratification at regular intervals, which may be aided by risk assessment calculators and cardiopulmonary stress testing. Heart failure patients who are at high-risk for 1-year mortality using prognostic models should be referred to advanced therapy including heart transplant, or DMCS (BTT or DT) as appropriate.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^114ATchb]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (VA-ECLS) weaning protocol begins by assessing whether "Further cardiac surgery (e.g. CABG, valve surgery, VSD closure, drainage of pericardial effusion) indicated"; if proceeding to weaning, entry hemodynamics require "MAP > 65 mmHg with only low-dose inotropes and/or vasopressors". Initial criteria include "LVEF > 25–30%" and "No severe mitral or tricuspid regurgitation", after which the protocol instructs "VA-ECLS flow reduction to 1.5–2 L/min over 2 days". Before explant, confirm: "LVEF > 25–30%", "Only low-dose vasopressors and/or inotropes", "No worsening of mitral regurgitation", "Stable cardiac rhythm", "Normal lactate and SvO2", "AVO2 difference < 5", and "No signs of secondary organ failure", leading to "VA-ECLS explantation". Alternative branches in the algorithm include "Candidate for durable MCS", "Consider mAFP implantation", "Durable MCS implantation", and "Next steps in VA-ECLS + mAFP weaning protocol". A footnote specifies that "Patients with LVEF 25–30% require further evaluation, including in particular, but not exclusively measurement of SV, PCWP, CVP during pump reduction trial".
