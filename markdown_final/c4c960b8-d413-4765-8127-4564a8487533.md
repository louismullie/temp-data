## Question

Can treatment be delayed in vasculitis in order to collect a biopsy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether treatment can be delayed in vasculitis in order to collect a biopsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical urgency and potential for irreversible organ damage if therapy is delayed. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about starting immunosuppression while awaiting biopsy, especially in ANCA-associated vasculitis and in rapidly progressive renal disease. Next, I will examine disease-specific nuances for large-vessel vasculitides like giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. After that, I need to consider pediatric considerations and special contexts such as immune checkpoint inhibitor–related vasculitis. Finally, I should synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and confirm the exceptions where biopsy should precede treatment, anchoring this to high-credibility sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes. Vasculitis is heterogeneous, but across subtypes, diagnostic delay worsens outcomes, and in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) with kidney involvement, rapid progression over days to weeks is common, with more than half of patients who present needing dialysis recovering renal function only if therapy is started promptly, which underscores why waiting for biopsy can be dangerous [^111wedYA] [^112WgPtT]. Hold on, I should verify the mortality signal: historically untreated AAV carried a 1-year mortality near 80%, and while modern therapy has improved survival, delayed remission or failure to achieve remission is linked to higher mortality and end-stage kidney disease, reinforcing the imperative to treat urgently when suspicion is high [^111W3nFq].

> Next, I should review direct guideline statements on timing. KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends not delaying immunosuppressive therapy while waiting for kidney biopsy to be performed or reported in patients with a compatible small-vessel vasculitis presentation plus positive MPO/PR3-ANCA, especially when the course is rapidly deteriorating, and this is echoed by the KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO, which states that the combination of a compatible clinical picture and positive ANCA is sufficient to begin therapy while awaiting biopsy confirmation [^1163q8wj] [^1129esiC] [^114ZmThN]. Wait, let me verify pediatric guidance: the SHARE initiative similarly advises attempting histopathologic confirmation but not delaying treatment in organ- or life-threatening disease, aligning with the adult AAV stance on urgent therapy in high-risk presentations [^112kJ2tT] [^112mVPhD].

> I will now examine the rationale for not delaying. The risk of waiting is twofold: first, irreversible organ injury accrues quickly in active vasculitis, particularly renal parenchyma and glomeruli; second, biopsy yield is not necessarily negated by a short course of steroids, and interval or later biopsy can still provide valuable information for classification, prognosis, and treatment adjustment without sacrificing early disease control [^111wedYA] [^115Cxiqo] [^112brnQg]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does steroid pretreatment ruin biopsy sensitivity? In GCA, contemporary data suggest inflammatory changes can persist for weeks to months after steroid initiation, and guidelines still support obtaining temporal artery biopsy within about 2 weeks of starting steroids rather than delaying therapy, indicating that limited steroid exposure does not preclude diagnostic utility in that context [^111JPZJJ] [^112FrzpL] [^112brnQg].

> But wait, what if the vasculitis is large-vessel rather than small-vessel? For suspected giant cell arteritis, I need to ensure we prioritize preventing irreversible complications like blindness and stroke; guidelines conditionally recommend starting high-dose glucocorticoids urgently and arranging temporal artery biopsy within 2 weeks, rather than delaying steroids to wait for biopsy, because early treatment reduces ischemic complications even though biopsy yield may diminish over time [^114uLo1V] [^112FrzpL] [^117CUGTr]. Let me consider Takayasu arteritis: when there is limb or organ ischemia, surgical or endovascular intervention is generally deferred until disease is quiescent if feasible, but immunosuppression should not be delayed when disease is active, again emphasizing prompt medical therapy over waiting for procedural confirmation in life- or limb-threatening scenarios [^111kPtDR] [^116M1Hfj].

> I should confirm pediatric-specific considerations. The SHARE recommendations for pediatric AAV explicitly state not to delay treatment in organ- or life-threatening disease while attempting to obtain histology, mirroring adult guidance and reflecting the high risk of permanent damage with delays in children as well [^112kJ2tT] [^112mVPhD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this was SHARE 2018; let me verify — this is the SHARE 2019 consensus, which carries high credibility and directly addresses the biopsy-timing dilemma in pediatrics [^112kJ2tT].

> Next, I should review special contexts. In immune checkpoint inhibitor–related vasculitis, expert guidance recommends a low threshold for urgent corticosteroids in suspected GCA phenotypes and early involvement of rheumatology, again prioritizing timely immunosuppression over waiting for definitive biopsy confirmation when the clinical picture is compelling and complications are imminent [^111ZbDnE] [^116ERnFd]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with general irAE principles — yes, early immunosuppression is standard in serious irAEs, and vasculitis is no exception here [^111ZbDnE].

> Let me synthesize a risk-stratified approach. In high-risk scenarios — rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, CNS vasculitis with ischemic threat, GCA with visual symptoms, or any organ- or life-threatening presentation — treatment must start immediately based on clinical assessment and supportive serology, with biopsy pursued in parallel or shortly thereafter to refine diagnosis and guide long-term management, because the harm of delay outweighs the diagnostic yield lost by brief pretreatment [^1163q8wj] [^1129esiC] [^111JPZJJ]. In lower-risk, non–organ-threatening presentations, it is reasonable to obtain biopsy before initiating immunosuppression if doing so will not meaningfully delay care, recognizing that even then, delays can allow accrual of damage and that shared decision-making is warranted given the conditional nature of many vasculitis recommendations [^1124pnkg] [^112dEkBp].

> I need to ensure I address counterarguments and exceptions. Some clinicians worry that empiric steroids could obscure biopsy findings; however, in AAV, interval kidney biopsies remain informative for treatment response and prognostication, and in GCA, inflammation can persist despite steroids, allowing diagnostic yield for weeks, which mitigates this concern when decisions are time-critical [^115Cxiqo] [^111ZVv1u] [^112brnQg]. Exceptions where I should pause and prioritize biopsy include situations where the diagnosis is uncertain, the clinical syndrome is atypical, or biopsy results would immediately change management in a low-risk patient; even then, the threshold to treat emergently should remain low if organ threat is present [^116gm2Tj] [^113DQEAj].

> Final answer: No, treatment should not be delayed in vasculitis solely to obtain a biopsy when there is high suspicion of organ- or life-threatening disease. Initiate immunosuppression promptly while arranging biopsy in parallel or shortly thereafter, as endorsed by KDIGO, KDOQI, and pediatric SHARE guidance, with disease-specific support from GCA guidelines emphasizing early steroids and timely biopsy logistics rather than treatment deferral [^1163q8wj] [^1129esiC] [^112kJ2tT] [^111JPZJJ].

---

In general, **do not delay treatment** for vasculitis to obtain a biopsy when there is organ- or life-threatening disease [^1163q8wj], especially with ANCA-associated vasculitis or giant cell arteritis [^111JPZJJ]. Start immunosuppression promptly and arrange biopsy as soon as safely possible, ideally within 1–2 weeks for GCA [^112FrzpL] and without delay for ANCA vasculitis with renal or pulmonary involvement [^1129esiC]. Delaying therapy increases the risk of irreversible organ damage, including renal failure and vision loss [^117CUGTr]. Biopsy is still important for definitive diagnosis and management, but treatment should not be withheld while awaiting biopsy in high-risk cases [^1163q8wj].

---

## Clinical scenarios where treatment should not be delayed

### ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV)

- **Renal involvement**: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is common in AAV and can lead to irreversible renal failure if treatment is delayed [^111ZVv1u]. KDIGO 2024 guidelines explicitly recommend not delaying immunosuppressive therapy while awaiting kidney biopsy in patients with clinical presentation compatible with small-vessel vasculitis and positive MPO- or PR3-ANCA serology, especially in rapidly deteriorating patients [^1163q8wj] [^1177Xp4i].

- **Pulmonary involvement**: Alveolar hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of AAV that requires immediate immunosuppressive therapy. Delaying treatment to obtain a biopsy can result in significant morbidity and mortality [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: SHARE guidelines recommend initiating immunosuppressive therapy promptly in pediatric patients with organ- or life-threatening disease, even if biopsy has not yet been performed [^112kJ2tT].

---

### Giant cell arteritis (GCA)

- **Visual symptoms**: GCA can cause irreversible vision loss if treatment is delayed. High-dose glucocorticoids should be initiated immediately upon clinical suspicion, and temporal artery biopsy should be performed within 1–2 weeks of starting steroids to confirm the diagnosis [^111JPZJJ] [^112FrzpL].

- **Large-vessel involvement**: GCA affecting the aorta and its branches requires prompt immunosuppressive therapy to prevent complications such as aneurysm formation and ischemic events [^116fWov9].

---

### Other vasculitides

Takayasu arteritis (TAK) warrants **prompt immunosuppressive therapy** when organ- or life-threatening manifestations are present, such as limb ischemia or myocardial infarction [^111kPtDR]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related vasculitis should be treated **immediately** upon diagnosis, with immunosuppressive therapy initiated without delay to prevent severe complications [^111ZbDnE].

---

## Risks associated with delaying treatment

Delaying treatment for vasculitis to obtain a biopsy can have **significant consequences**:

- **Irreversible organ damage**: Delayed treatment can result in permanent renal failure, vision loss, or neurological impairment [^117CUGTr].

- **Increased mortality**: Untreated or delayed treatment in vasculitis, particularly AAV, significantly increases mortality risk [^111W3nFq].

- **Disease progression**: Vasculitis can rapidly progress, causing extensive tissue damage and complicating future management [^111wedYA].

---

## Clinical scenarios where biopsy may precede treatment

In select scenarios, obtaining a biopsy before initiating treatment may be appropriate — typically when the disease is **non-organ-threatening**, the diagnosis is uncertain, or biopsy results will immediately alter management:

- **Non-organ-threatening disease**: In cases of mild, localized vasculitis without systemic involvement, it may be reasonable to obtain a biopsy before initiating treatment [^112kJ2tT].

- **Uncertain diagnosis**: When the clinical presentation is atypical or the diagnosis is unclear, biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate therapy [^112WgPtT].

- **Alternative diagnoses**: If there is a strong suspicion of infection, malignancy, or other conditions that mimic vasculitis, biopsy may be required to exclude these diagnoses before initiating immunosuppressive therapy [^115Nrb8y].

---

## Balancing risks and benefits

The decision to delay treatment for biopsy must balance the **risks of delayed therapy** against the **benefits of histopathological confirmation**. In organ- or life-threatening disease, the risks of delaying treatment generally outweigh the benefits of waiting for biopsy results. Conversely, in non-organ-threatening cases, obtaining a biopsy before treatment may be reasonable to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management [^1163q8wj].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus consistently recommend **prompt initiation of immunosuppressive therapy** in patients with organ- or life-threatening vasculitis, even if biopsy has not yet been performed. Biopsy should be obtained as soon as safely possible, ideally within 1–2 weeks for GCA and without delay for AAV with renal or pulmonary involvement [^1163q8wj] [^111JPZJJ].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Treatment delay for biopsy?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| ANCA-associated vasculitis with renal or pulmonary involvement | No | Risk of irreversible organ damage and mortality |
| Giant cell arteritis with visual symptoms | No | Risk of irreversible vision loss |
| Takayasu arteritis with limb ischemia or myocardial infarction | No | Risk of irreversible organ damage |
| Non-organ-threatening vasculitis | Yes (if safe) | Confirm diagnosis and guide therapy |
| Uncertain diagnosis or alternative diagnoses suspected | Yes (if safe) | Exclude mimics and confirm diagnosis |

---

In summary, **do not delay treatment** for vasculitis to obtain a biopsy in organ- or life-threatening disease; start immunosuppression promptly and arrange biopsy as soon as safely possible. Delaying therapy increases the risk of irreversible organ damage and mortality, whereas biopsy remains important for definitive diagnosis and long-term management.

The histologic diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis is usually challenging. It is made more so by the failure of most pathologists to realize that the disease is fundamentally neither a vasculitis nor a granulomatous reaction. This problem can contribute to delays in diagnosis and consequent adverse effects for patient prognosis. This article attempts to better describe the essence of Wegener's granulomatosis with the aim of enhancing diagnosis earlier in the course of the disease.

### Utility of interval kidney biopsy in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^115Cxiqo]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare autoimmune disorder that commonly involves the kidney. Early identification of kidney involvement, assessing treatment-response and predicting outcome are important clinical challenges. Here, we assessed the potential utility of interval kidney biopsy in AAV.

Methods

In a tertiary referral centre with a dedicated vasculitis service, we identified patients with AAV who had undergone interval kidney biopsy, defined as a repeat kidney biopsy (following an initial biopsy showing active AAV) undertaken to determine the histological response in the kidney following induction immunosuppression. We analysed biochemical, histological and outcome data, including times to kidney failure and death for all patients.

Results

We identified 57 patients with AAV who underwent at least one interval kidney biopsy (59 interval biopsies in total; median time to interval biopsy ∼130 days). Of the 59 interval biopsies performed, 24 (41%) patients had clinically suspected active disease at time of biopsy which was confirmed histologically in only 42% of cases; 35 (59%) patients were in clinical disease-remission, and this was correct in 97% of cases. The clinician's impression was incorrect in one in four patients. Hematuria at interval biopsy did not correlate with histological activity. Interval biopsy showed fewer acute lesions and more chronic damage compared with initial biopsy and led to immunosuppressive treatment-change in 75% (44/59) of patients. Clinical risk prediction tools tended to operate better using interval biopsy data.

Conclusion

Interval kidney biopsy is useful for determining treatment-response and subsequent disease management in AAV. It may provide better prognostic information than initial kidney biopsy and should be considered for inclusion into future clinical trials and treatment protocols for patients with AAV.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology / vasculitis foundation guideline for the management of giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis [^113yh3vY]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Guideline discussion — diagnostic and treatment preferences and evidence context in giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK): overarching themes include the preference, in the US, for temporal artery biopsy over cranial imaging studies for the diagnosis of GCA, the use of large vessel imaging for GCA and TAK for diagnosis and disease monitoring, and limiting glucocorticoid exposure in order to minimize toxicity. Almost all recommendations are conditional due to low-quality evidence. EULAR indicates that the diagnosis of GCA may be made with a positive imaging test without additional testing such as temporal artery biopsy, but in the US there is limited experience with these modalities and the guideline continues to recommend temporal artery biopsy as the diagnostic test of choice at this time. In contrast to EULAR, the guideline favors initial treatment of GCA with glucocorticoids and a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Key knowledge gaps include that the optimal duration of therapy and how best to monitor disease status is unknown, accurate and validated indicators of disease activity have not been established or widely used for GCA or TAK, and the clinical significance of persistent vascular wall inflammation during clinically quiescent disease is unclear; therefore, additional research into the management of GCA and TAK is encouraged.

### Biopsy-confirmed small vessel primary CNS vasculitis: clinical features and impact of early intensive treatment on remission [^114XhFhB]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic delays were common in our cohort and reflective of real-world challenges. These included the imperfect yield of CNS biopsy, the potential impact of empiric immunosuppression on diagnostic yield, the need to carefully exclude alternate diagnoses, and the wide catchment areas of our tertiary care institution (often resulting in multiple local evaluations before referral). Acknowledging these challenges, these findings underscore the critical need for timely and accurate diagnosis by CNS biopsy when sv-PCNSV is suspected because EIT can affect the disease course. As in this study, various factors may limit or delay cyclophosphamide use after the diagnosis is confirmed, including lack of access to infusion centers and concerns about adverse effects (particularly in older patients such as those with ABRA). Some of these concerns may be less pronounced with newer, more targeted immunosuppressive agents. For example, randomized trials support anti-IL6 receptor therapy in giant cell arteritis and anti-CD20 therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitis, although more data are needed to determine whether they are effective as induction agents in sv-PCNSV. Furthermore, the cumulative glucocorticoid exposure observed in this study was substantial, and future prospective studies should also assess strategies to mitigate the impact of glucocorticoid toxicity. For example, randomized trial data in ANCA-associated vasculitis support the use of adjunctive avacopan, a C5a receptor inhibitor, to limit the use of cumulative glucocorticoid exposure during induction. While the use of avacopan in PCNSV is not yet reported, complement inhibition represents an intriguing therapeutic candidate for future study, particularly in light of CSF proteomics data suggesting a role for complement overactivation in some patients with sv-PCNSV.

We used a clinical and radiographic definition of remission in this study that can be easily applied to future studies and in clinical practice. Among the limited subset of patients who underwent repeat CSF testing, remission was also accompanied by the resolution of CSF abnormalities, suggesting that repeat CSF analysis can help assess treatment response among patients with abnormal baseline CSF testing. This is in contrast to other neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis in which, at least with current standard disease-modifying treatments, oligoclonal bands tend to persist chronically even with disease-modifying immunosuppression. After remission, relapses did occur in a minority of patients, consistent with previously published PCNSV cohorts. Maintenance therapy after induction of remission is likely warranted, as supported by the French PCNSV Registry, which found that maintenance therapy was associated with prolonged remission and good functional status. In clinical practice, prolonged prednisone tapers and traditional steroid-sparing agents are most commonly used.

### Advancing knowledge in CNS vasculitis [^112wZbTG]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Neurology® Neuroimmunology & Neuroinflammation, Paramasivan et al.report an update of one of the few large and well-described cohorts of PCNSV, which now includes 72 adults with PCNSV confirmed either on biopsy (30.5% of the patients; 44 had a biopsy, half of them showing vasculitis) or on angiography and in whom mimicking or secondary processes of CNS vasculitis were excluded as thoroughly as possible. As in most previous cohorts, patients were divided into 2 subgroups: those with medium/large vessel or with small vessel PCNSV. Major findings were younger age at onset, delay in diagnosis and therapy, greater relapse risk, and poorer outcomes at 1 year in the small vessel PCNSV group vs more strokes and more frequent wall imaging abnormalities (as per the definition of this subgroup, somehow) in the medium/large vessel group. Eventually, 69.8% of the patients had a good outcome at 1 year, and relapse occurred in 49% with a median follow-up of approximately 2 years (68% of the patients had at least 1 year of follow-up). Intriguingly, the choice of treatments was not associated with outcomes or relapses. This latter finding seems difficult to reconcile with the overall principles that patients with PCNSV should receive aggressive treatment, as was in fact done in this cohort and, ultimately, recommended by the authors. The authors indeed acknowledge a possible indication bias, not specific or unique to this cohort: "the small vessel vasculitis group… received maintenance therapies which, if not given, could have resulted in further relapses and increased disability". Their standard treatment policies for patients with aggressive presentation have been established and rely on induction with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, then maintenance with glucocorticoids, and a corticosteroid-sparing agent, at least to minimize the adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid exposure. Whether the strongest maintenance regimens effectively reduce the relapse rate and/or improve neurologic outcomes require further studies because evidence from available cohorts remains inconclusive.

Table 3
Randomised controlled trials of GC in GCA

One small RCT, including seven patients in the active group and five in the control group, analysed the efficacy and safety of modified-release prednisone with immediate-release prednisolone in newly diagnosed GCA suggesting a similar outcome profile, but with worse sleeping scores in the modified-release GC. However, the small sample size does not permit definitive conclusions. The differential effect on bone mass loss of deflazacort versus prednisone was assessed in an RCT showing no difference between the two GC compounds.

Data on the most effective initial GC dose to treat GCA derive from uncontrolled observational studies with no conclusive evidence to be drawn and no apparent influence on the maintenance dose. In a retrospective review of 286 TAB +patients with GCA, a higher initial oral prednisone dose (> 40 mg/day) was associated with greater chances of reaching a low dose sooner (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.96) and of discontinuing GC (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.23).

### Treat-to-target in vasculitis: is this a sensible approach? [^111QtTHY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

It is possible to achieve substantial initial control of systemic vasculitis in the majority of patients. However, the 'target' has shifted considerably over the last 20–30 years from keeping patients alive to maintaining good quality disease control, avoiding the development of comorbidities - either as a result of disease or treatment, and also preventing relapses. This expansion of potential targets that can be achieved in systemic vasculitis has arisen because we have more effective therapies, but more importantly we have developed a framework within which targets can be created reproducibly. In other words we have much clearer definitions of what constitutes clinical disease activity, relapse, remission and morbidity. These targets are based on simple clinical evaluation, limited laboratory assessments of patients that can be undertaken by any secondary care facility. As a result of this they remain at a clinical level and may not address the most important targets, which are curing disease and that would be the aspiration to move towards. The first step towards that is to move from clinically-based targets towards mechanistic targets based primarily around the pathophysiological drivers of disease. That in turn may lead to identification of specific targets that can turn off disease. The systemic vasculitides are heterogeneous and although for ANCA-associated vasculitis in the short term treatments are similar, the development of clear understanding of mechanisms and new targets may bring with it the promise of much more focused therapies that will address only individual targets and therefore personalize therapy for each individual condition and patient.

### Utility of interval kidney biopsy in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^111ZVv1u]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic vasculitis associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by leucocyte infiltration and necrosis of predominantly the small vessels. Kidney involvement is seen in two-thirds of patients, classically as a pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents. Induction immunosuppressive treatment for AAV with renal involvement typically involves glucocorticoids alongside cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Once a patient attains disease remission, there follows a course of maintenance immunosuppression.

Identifying AAV early, assessing its response to treatment, and risk-stratifying patients at greatest long-term risk remain important clinical challenges. In those with renal involvement, the measurement of kidney function using serum creatinine is often inadequate because substantial renal damage can occur before function is impaired to a detectable extent. Furthermore, changes in serum creatinine concentration during follow-up may be due to changes in vasculitis disease activity or due to glomerular scarring or tubular injury from infections or medications, scenarios that require different clinical management. Other commonly used measures such as hematuria, circulating CRP and serum ANCA titre lack specificity and sensitivity and do not adequately reflect disease activity. Recent data suggest that glucocorticoid-sparing, or indeed glucocorticoid-free, regimens are able to treat AAV effectively while reducing treatment-related complications.

As clinicians move towards using lower doses of induction immunosuppression in patients with AAV, confirming treatment-induced disease remission becomes even more important as unchecked smouldering inflammation can lead to the accrual of organ damage and increase long-term mortality. Disease activity scores such as the BVAS have limitations as they are often unable to distinguish active disease from established damage. Interval kidney biopsy is an established component of immunological monitoring in kidney transplantation, and its utility in assessing treatment response in lupus nephritis is increasingly recognized. There are, however, few data on the use of interval kidney biopsy in AAV.

Here, we assessed the utility of initial and interval kidney biopsy in a large cohort of patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis with long-term follow-up. We defined interval kidney biopsy as a repeat kidney biopsy (following an initial biopsy showing active AAV) undertaken to determine the histological response in the kidney following induction immunosuppression. Specifically, we sought to determine: (i) the correlation between clinically determined and histologically verified disease activity during follow-up; and (ii) the extent to which an interval biopsy leads to changes in clinical management.

### Outcome of immunosuppression in children with IgA vasculitis-related nephritis [^116bKBTS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Immunoglobulin A vasculitis with nephritis (IgAVN) is the most common vasculitis in children. Due to a lack of evidence, treatment recommendations are based on expert opinion, resulting in variation. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of an extremely large cohort of children with biopsy-proven IgAVN in order to identify prognostic risk factors and signals of treatment efficacy.

Methods

Retrospective data were collected on 1148 children with biopsy-proven IgAVN between 2005 and 2019 from 41 international paediatric nephrology centres across 25 countries and analysed using multivariate analysis. The primary outcome was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and persistent proteinuria at last follow-up.

Results

The median follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range 2–6.2). At last follow-up, 29% of patients had an eGFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, 36% had proteinuria and 3% had chronic kidney disease stage 4–5. Older age, lower eGFR at onset, hypertension and histological features of tubular atrophy and segmental sclerosis were predictors of poor outcome. There was no evidence to support any specific second-line immunosuppressive regimen being superior to others, even when further analysing subgroups of children with reduced kidney function, nephrotic syndrome or hypoalbuminemia at onset. Delayed start of immunosuppressive treatment was associated with a lower eGFR at last follow-up.

Conclusion

In this large retrospective cohort, key features associated with disease outcome are highlighted. Importantly, there was no evidence to support that any specific immunosuppressive treatments were superior to others. Further discovery science and well-conducted clinical trials are needed to define accurate treatment and improve outcomes of IgAVN.

### Large-vessel giant cell arteritis: diagnosis, monitoring and management [^111pF3p8]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

GCA is a chronic, idiopathic, granulomatous vasculitis of medium and large arteries. It comprises overlapping phenotypes including classic cranial arteritis and extra-cranial GCA, otherwise termed large-vessel GCA (LV-GCA). Vascular complications associated with LV-GCA may be due, in part, to delayed diagnosis, highlighting the importance of early identification and prompt initiation of effective therapy. Advancements in imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance angiography, CT angiography, PET and colour duplex ultrasonography, have led to improvements in the diagnosis of LV-GCA; however, the role imaging modalities play in the assessment of disease activity and long-term outcomes remains unclear. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy in LV-GCA, but their prolonged use is associated with multiple, sometimes serious, adverse effects. Recent data suggest that biologic therapies, such as tocilizumab, may be effective and safe steroid-sparing options for patients with GCA. However, data specifically evaluating the management of LV-GCA are limited.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) diagnostic testing — temporal artery biopsy approach and timing: For patients with suspected GCA, we conditionally recommend an initial unilateral temporal artery biopsy over bilateral biopsies. For patients with suspected GCA, we conditionally recommend a long-segment temporal artery biopsy specimen (> 1 cm) over a short-segment temporal artery biopsy specimen (< 1 cm). For patients with suspected GCA, we conditionally recommend obtaining a temporal artery biopsy specimen within 2 weeks of starting oral GCs over waiting longer than 2 weeks for a biopsy.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^114ZmThN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) — screening and initiation of immunosuppression: ANCA directed to either PR3 or MPO is present in 90% of patients with GPA and MPA, so testing is recommended to screen for AAV, and the combined presence of a compatible clinical presentation with a positive MPO/PR3 ANCA serology is sufficient to begin immunosuppressive therapy while awaiting kidney biopsy to be performed or reported.

### What does the future hold for clinical studies in vasculitis? [^111TJkXZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The era prior to 1990 was a time of careful observation of disease presentation, course, outcomes and meticulous pathology studies. These mainly single-centre studies introduced new life-saving therapies for drugs still used effectively today. In the 1970–1980s, cyclophosphamide (CyP) added to glucocorticosteroids (GCS) was shown to be life-saving. The trade-off was often severe adverse events. Some forms of vasculitis were found not as ominous as thought initially. Some could be treated with safer drugs [e.g. methotrexate (MTX)]. However, whether mild or severe, patients were not cured. From 1990 to the present large collaborative networks have provided studies were not possible heretofore. Randomized controlled trials captured and manipulated vast amounts of data, banked biological specimens and shared these resources and intellectual capital, moving the field forward at an extraordinary pace. We now know that even for severe forms of granulomatosis and polyangiitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Wegener's granulomatosus (WG)], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS), we do not need to use CyP for extended periods. We have learned recently that rituximab is as effective as CyP for severe WG and MPA. We should never again see the permanent toxicities born from years of chronic CyP use. However, short courses of CyP remain useful and can be life-saving. Step-down therapy from CyP is now a standard of care, perhaps to be replaced by rituximab in the future. If one accepts the premise that there are few cures at present for idiopathic large- and small-vessel vasculitis, we will serve our patients well if we can determine the most effective initial therapy that leads to a maintenance strategy for remission with least risk. Ultimately, we wish to identify causes of vasculitis so they can be used as a wedge to secure cures. Unmet needs and strategies are as follows: (1) to increase the numbers of vasculitis-trained physicians; (2) to define risk-benefit formulae for chronic maintenance therapy versus discontinuation of treatment after remission; (3) to define risk- and cost-benefit formulae for laboratory monitoring; (4) large-scale studies with longer follow-up that explore inhibition of interleukin-5 in CSS; (5) to explore the value of anti-interferon-γ for GCA, Takayasu's and other granulomatous vasculitides; and (6) identification of aetiological factors: cures will probably be linked to knowledge of the antigen driving the disease, plus vulnerabilities of the patient that prepare them to develop an illness phenotype. Improved outcomes using anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents do not rule out infection as a driver for autoimmunity. Techniques that can facilitate pathogen discovery have never been more sophisticated.

### Managing mesenteric vasculitis [^111QGhq3]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Mesenteric vasculitis is a rare diagnosis, but it comprises a group of disorders that may have devastating manifestations. It is often difficult to diagnose using clinical symptoms and biomarkers. Vascular imaging often provides the best opportunity for the noninvasive diagnosis of vasculitis and obviates the need for performing a biopsy. The medical management of vasculitis involves controlling the inflammatory process with the use of steroids or other immunosuppressants, but medical therapy does not consistently provide regression of the vascular changes (ie, aneurysms or vascular occlusions) seen at the time of the initial diagnosis. Operative management remains the mainstay of therapy for focal occlusive or aneurysms, but the treatment options for multifocal disease remain challenging. Endovascular treatment is increasingly being used as a first line of treatment for symptomatic vasculitis. Interventionalists should be familiar with the indications and outcomes associated with the various therapeutic options for mesenteric vasculitis-associated occlusive disease and aneurysms.

### Giant cell arteritis: is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing? [^1117mPZd]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Isolated extra-cranial GCA represents a diagnostic challenge since signs and symptoms may be nonspecific (fever, fatigue, weight loss) unless local ischemic manifestations appear. A significant proportion of patients with ischemic features attributed to atherosclerosis or embolic origin could represent an extra-cranial form of this vasculitis, particularly when cardiovascular risk factors are scarce or absent. In addition, laboratory inflammatory markers tend to be lower in this group of patients. This difficulty in diagnosis often leads to a greater diagnostic delay compared with patients suffering typical cranial symptoms. Interestingly, patients with predominant large-vessel-vasculitis pattern are younger and have more commonly PMR features and longer duration of symptoms at GCA diagnosis than those with predominant cranial manifestations. Moreover, the frequency of a positive temporal artery biopsy in these is much lower than in those with the classic pattern of GCA. Because of that, in these patients the diagnosis must often be relied on large-vessel inflammatory signs on imaging tests, as retrieval of arterial specimens in other territories entails significant morbidity.

Current diagnostic tools and diagnostic challenges

Although temporal artery biopsy is considered by many clinicians as the gold-standard for the diagnosis of GCA, focal or segmental inflammatory changes and technical pitfalls of the procedure make it difficult to confirm this condition in a significant proportion of patients. Diagnostic yield of biopsy varies greatly depending on the length of the excised specimen and whether it is performed unilaterally or bilaterally. The traditional recommendation was to obtain an arterial sample of at least 2–3 cm of length, although more recent studies consider that 1 cm could be enough for histologic diagnosis.

Some authors have designed predictive models as an aid to select those patients with higher probability of having GCA, but it should be kept in mind that these calculators do not take into account those cases of GCA with a negative biopsy result.

INTRODUCTION

Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and giant cell arteritis (GCA), the most common forms of large‐vessel vasculitis (LVV) in adults, are characterized by granulomatous arterial inflammation. Progressive damage to arterial walls typically results in stenotic remodeling with consequent tissue ischemia and manifestations such as sight loss, stroke, myocardial infarction, and limb claudication. Despite phenotypic similarities, TAK and GCA have different demographics, particularly age at onset, and, to a lesser extent, they affect different arterial territories. TAK affects the aorta and its major branches, whereas traditionally GCA was described as involving the cranial arteries such as the temporal artery (a pattern of disease now referred to as cranial GCA [C‐GCA]). However, following advances in noninvasive vascular imaging techniques, it became clear that the aorta and other large vessels are frequently affected in GCA, and some patients have a large‐vessel‐type presentation (large‐vessel GCA [LV‐GCA]) with nonspecific constitutional symptoms and/or limb claudication similar to TAK. Frequent large‐vessel involvement in GCA and similar histopathologic changes has led to debate regarding whether TAK and GCA represent varying manifestations of the same disease. This question has important implications for drug development and clinical trial design. However, such comparisons are currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the pathogenic underpinnings of these diseases and a lack of comparative molecular data across LVV phenotypes.

There are several important challenges in the clinical management of TAK and GCA. Both initial diagnosis and recognition of relapse may be delayed and are made more difficult by a lack of effective biomarkers. Blood tests such as C‐reactive protein (CRP) lack specificity, whereas vascular imaging can be insensitive, particularly in glucocorticoid‐treated patients, and impractical for frequent serial monitoring. In the era before widespread access to ultrasound scans (USS), the diagnosis of C‐GCA was confirmed by performing a temporal artery biopsy (TAB). Although considered the "gold standard" diagnostic test, the presence of skip lesions may lead to false‐negative results. Therefore, a negative biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis of GCA. Progress in the treatment of LVV, particularly the development of targeted biologic therapy, lags behind that of other rheumatic diseases. Accordingly, there is an overreliance on long‐term glucocorticoids to maintain disease control with resulting iatrogenic harm. Thus, there is a need for better biomarkers and novel therapeutics to improve patient outcomes.

ARTERIOGRAPHY OR BIOPSY. Confirmation of a clinical suspicion of vasculitis usually requires arteriography, biopsy, or both. Evaluation should be directed toward establishing a tissue diagnosis, if possible. In general, because "blind" biopsy of asymptomatic sites or organs generally has a low yield. 2 it is best to "go where the money is. " For example, if a patient is over age 50 and presents with a new, unexplained headache and elevated ESR, with or without a tender or abnormal temporal artery, a temporal artery biopsy would be indicated. Similarly, in a patient who presents with a multisystem illness and testicular pain and swelling, a testicular biopsy should be considered. Sural nerve biopsy may be indicated in a patient with numbness and tingling in a lower extremity. If the urine sediment is abnormal, a renal biopsy might be obtained. If a biopsy is impractical, an angiogram may be diagnostic.

An angiogram should be obtained in cases of suspected large-vessel vasculitis, such as of the branches of the aorta, which may be manifested as extremity ischemia or claudication. A patient with abdominal pain may have mesenteric or renal vasculitis. If visceral involvement is suspected, a visceral angiogram to include the celiac, mesenteric, renal and, perhaps, hepatic arteries should be performed. Finally, a renal biopsy only rarely reveals vasculitis in the renal vessels themselves but may show focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis, a finding that is suggestive of systemic necrotizing vasculitis in the appropriate clinical setting. In addition, renal biopsy findings usually cannot differentiate the type of vasculitis. 16 Patients with giant cell arteritis are almost always over age 50 and have an ESR over 50 mm per hour.

The diagnosis is confirmed by temporal artery biopsy; in centers where this technique is available, the diagnostic yield may be enhanced if biopsy is performed under sonographic guidance that highlights potential areas of involvement. Irreversible blindness is the most common serious sequela of giant cell arteritis and is preventable with corticosteroid therapy.

Takayasu arteritis (TAK) surgical timing — patients with worsening signs of limb/organ ischemia: we conditionally recommend delaying surgical intervention until the disease is quiescent over performing surgical intervention while the patient has active disease. Observational studies have suggested improved outcomes if surgical intervention is performed when disease is not active; however, surgical intervention during active disease may be necessary if the patient has life- or organ-threatening manifestations such as stroke, loss of viability of a limb, or myocardial ischemia, and determining the level of disease activity in TAK can be challenging.

The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a broad group of diseases identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics. These unique entities have a broad spectrum of organ involvement and severity, which influences the approach to diagnosis and treatment. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents are used to manage most vasculitic diseases. Long-term outcome is influenced by chronic sequelae from organ damage, disease relapses, and medication side effects. Further research is needed to understand these diseases and discover more efficacious yet less toxic therapeutic options. This review will focus on vasculitic syndromes more likely to be presented to an allergist/immunologist in an outpatient setting.

A man in his 60s presented to the emergency department with marked bilateral preauricular swelling, associated with jaw claudication, temporal tenderness and blurred vision. He was immediately treated for temporal arteritis by commencing systemic corticosteroids. A temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. However, positron emission tomography-CT demonstrated increased uptake in the medium-large vessels, including the left superficial temporal artery and aorta. This case illustrates that facial swelling may be an under-recognised presenting feature of temporal arteritis, and that a negative temporal artery biopsy does not always rule out a diagnosis of temporal arteritis, and should not delay treatment.

### Diagnostic approach in giant cell arteritis [^116x2oaD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is the most common form of vasculitis in the elderly. While initially described as involving the temporal arteries, GCA can also affect the aorta and its major branches. Despite the increased use of imaging modalities and the availability of temporal artery biopsy, diagnosing GCA remains challenging. GCA should be considered a spectrum, with diagnostic methodologies tailored to the prevalent symptoms. The sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic approaches can vary depending on the clinical setting. Timing in diagnosing GCA is crucial to prevent serious complications, such as blindness and cerebrovascular ischemic events. While the prompt initiation of glucocorticoids (GCs) has reduced the incidence of major ischemic events, an uncertain diagnosis may expose the patient to unnecessary harm, such as complications from overtreatment or organ damage due to inadequate control of vasculitis. This narrative review will summarize the most widely available diagnostic techniques for GCA and outline our approach for cases where the diagnosis may be uncertain.

### Diagnosis and assessment of systemic vasculitis [^113RQjJq]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of systemic vasculitis requires clinical evidence with appropriate symptoms and physical signs, supported by histological or radiological confirmation. Earlier recognition of these diseases has been facilitated by a greater awareness of their incidence, and also by the more widespread introduction of the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test. Early diagnosis provides a greater potential for effective intervention in the course of disease and this may limit subsequent damage. However, an early diagnosis poses the more difficult challenge in the classification of the vasculitides, since traditional classification systems have depended on the presence of well-established manifestations of the disease. The accurate assessment of disease activity and damage in vasculitis has become necessary as a result of significant improvements in survival with the use of chemotherapy. The disease course however is frequently characterised by relapse as well as the scars of irreversible organ damage from disease and drug toxicity. Clinical methods of assessment are simple to apply, reliable and often more effective than any current laboratory test in evaluating the effects of therapy and determining changes in therapy. The increasing use of surrogate clinical measures of disease should provide a greater opportunity to establish the effectiveness of existing and novel therapies in the management of these complex diseases.

### Management guidelines and outcome measures in giant cell arteritis (GCA) [^117KTdTJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a common form of vasculitis that predominantly affects the elderly. Cranial symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers are suggestive of the condition and the diagnosis is usually established by temporal artery biopsy. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for GCA and prolonged therapy is often necessary. Disease relapses and steroid-related adverse effects, however, are common. Serious complications of the disease may include visual loss, stroke, and aortic involvement with aneurysm formation.

### Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis [^114uLo1V]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

GCA is the most common form of primary systemic vasculitis affecting older people. It is considered a clinical emergency because it can lead to irreversible blindness in around 20% of untreated cases. High doses of glucocorticoids should be initiated promptly to prevent disease-related complications; however, glucocorticoids therapy usually results in significant toxicity. Therefore, correct diagnosis is crucial. For many years, temporal artery biopsy has been considered the diagnostic 'gold standard' for GCA, but it has many limitations (including low sensitivity). US has proven to be effective for diagnosing GCA and can reliably replace temporal artery biopsy in particular clinical settings. In cases of suspected GCA with large-vessel involvement, other imaging modalities can be used for diagnosis (e.g. CT and PET). Here we review the current evidence for each diagnostic modality and propose an algorithm to diagnose cranial-GCA in a setting with rapid access to high quality US.

### Long-term renal injury in ANCA-associated vasculitis: an analysis of 31 patients with follow-up biopsies [^114jwcGA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

We reported previously that in renal disease in relation to antineutrophil cytoplasm auto-antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, renal outcome correlates better with the percentage of normal glomeruli than with separate active lesions. This may imply that glomeruli, once affected by necrotizing and crescentic lesions, are irreversibly damaged. We quantified and evaluated the course of renal lesions in the present study.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed 31 patients with renal disease in relation to ANCA-associated vasculitis, all treated with immunosuppressive drugs. In all patients, a renal biopsy was performed at diagnosis. A follow-up biopsy was performed in all patients on the indication of a suspected renal relapse, after a mean interval of 31 months.

Results

The mean percentage of normal glomeruli in the renal biopsy did not change over time (29% in the initial and 30% in the follow-up biopsy). The mean percentage of glomeruli with crescents, however, significantly decreased from 57 to 30% (P < 0.001). The percentage of glomerulosclerosis significantly increased from 12 to 39% (P < 0.001). The data were independent of diagnosis, gender, age, time interval between the biopsies, and treatment.

Conclusions

This is the first study to quantify glomerular changes between two time points in patients with renal vasculitis. Our results suggest that, on average, no new glomeruli are recruited into the active disease process. The sum of the percentage of crescentic and sclerotic glomeruli in the initial biopsies is larger than the percentage of sclerotic glomeruli in the follow-up biopsies. Thus, therapy seems not only to prevent normal glomeruli from being recruited into the active disease process for a certain time, but seems also to allow part of the active lesions to revert into a normal phenotype, although another part of the active lesions will be transformed to a chronic phenotype.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) — clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy are outlined as follows: GCA can present with both cranial and extracranial manifestations, with cranial manifestations including headaches, scalp tenderness, vision loss, and jaw claudication, and large vessel ("extracranial") involvement resulting in arterial stenosis and aneurysms causing absent pulses and limb claudication. GCA is more common in individuals of Northern European descent who are older than 50 years of age. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, pathologic abnormalities on temporal artery biopsy, and/or evidence of large vessel involvement on vascular imaging. Glucocorticoids remain the mainstay treatment for GCA, but tocilizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of GCA.

Timely access to services

Timely response to illness is one of the aspects of healthcare particularly valued by people living with AAV. Waiting times of < 7 days for individuals with newly diagnosed disease to be reviewed by a vasculitis expert are associated with fewer serious infections, fewer emergency hospital admissions and reduced mortality. Evidence also suggests that individuals seen in a timely manner have lower cancer and cardiovascular disease rates.

This should form part of a fast-track referral pathway that includes efforts to raise awareness amongst colleagues in primary care as what to look for, who to contact if AAV is suspected, and in secondary care, the ability to identify red flags and gaps in pertinent clinical information and undertake appropriate triaging and review. We define a vasculitis expert as someone with up-to-date knowledge in managing a range of people living with vasculitis, as opposed to where someone is physically based.

Children living with AAV should initially be managed under tertiary sub-specialty teams, including paediatric rheumatologists, paediatric nephrologists and other allied sub-specialties dependent on clinical presentation and organ involvement. Paediatric AAV is rare, therefore expert opinion asserts that initial new presentations should be discussed acutely with relevant teams.

AAV is a potentially organ- and life-threatening disease and, as such, access to urgent intravenous (IV) treatment is necessary. Across the UK, there is significant variation in how services deliver IV treatments. Average wait time for urgent IV treatment was 2.67 days (range 1–10 days), with 18% of services having wait times over 7 days. Specific challenges included the availability of slots and staff, particularly in shared day case units, due to competition with other services and limited awareness of the importance of timely treatment for AAV. This could impact on timing and treatment decisions (e.g. prolonged GC prescriptions). Access to a dedicated day-case facility was associated with a reduced risk of serious infection, albeit with some uncertainty around the effect estimate. Services offering AAV care should be enabled to access IV therapy for initial treatment or relapse within 7 days to minimize organ damage, especially renal function. Residual renal function is highly predictive of longer-term outcomes.

### ANCA associated vasculitis [^116fTe6y]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

How is it diagnosed?

Clinical

The diagnosis of AAV is clinical, supported by serological and histological data. There are many possible presenting symptoms — none more important than another for making the diagnosis — and no isolated discriminating symptoms of AAV. Rather, the key to diagnosis is prompt recognition of an inflammatory disease pattern when multiple symptoms emerge, especially if more than one organ system is implicated or in combination with chronic systemic symptoms. Therefore, when two or more of these symptoms develop concurrently, the index of suspicion should be high(box 1).

Two clinical scenarios pose particular diagnostic difficulty. The first is alveolar haemorrhage: it can be hard to recognise and is devastating if missed. Alveolar haemorrhage may present with haemoptysis, but this symptom is absent in up to half of cases. Some patients with extensive airspace bleeding will report only of shortness of breath or cough and have a near normal chest examination. Patients with haemoptysis plus other features of AAV warrant same day hospital assessment to rule out pulmonary haemorrhage without further primary care investigations if these would delay referral (box 2). All other patients with suspected vasculitis and dyspnoea or cough should have a full blood count; if there is a recent drop in haemoglobin (or a low haemoglobin with no historic comparator) then we advise urgently discussing the possibility of pulmonary haemorrhage with a specialty service.

### European League Against Rheumatism / European vasculitis study group recommendations for the management of vasculitis [^1114A24b]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the European League Against Rheumatism recommendations in the management of primary systemic vasculitis.

Recent Findings

Important developments in the classification and treatment of systemic vasculitis have led the European League Against Rheumatism to publish recommendations in the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of the small, medium and large-vessel vasculitides. These recommendations resulted from a combination of evidence from systematic analysis of selected studies and the experience of experts in vasculitis when data were not available.

Summary

The purpose of formulating clinical recommendations is to improve quality of care and guide the clinician inexperienced with vasculitis. Nevertheless, patients with vasculitis should be managed by a vasculitis expert whenever possible. As our understanding of this rare and complex group of diseases advances, novel therapeutic options are being developed.

High-dose corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay treatment for GCA and is important for reducing the risk of ischaemic-related complications. The duration of corticosteroid therapy was deemed the single most important clinical parameter and some participants felt strongly that steroid treatment can rapidly influence histological features. A landmark paper was shared with the expert panel prior to the start of the study to 'debunk' the notion that steroid treatment for several days, or even weeks, will result in a false-negative biopsy. Maleszewski et al reported the results of a first-of-its-kind prospective study of second TABs that were randomly assigned to time-period cohorts over a 1-year period. These results showed that despite steroid therapy, the inflammation observed in GCA persisted and the longest interval between steroid initiation and the histological presence of GCA was 420 days. These findings were debated during the first consensus group meeting, and while the participants decided that more research is needed in this area, it was agreed that steroid therapy dose, and start date, should be included as part of the minimum information provided on the request form.

### Microscopic polyangiitis complicated with ileal involvement detected by double-balloon endoscopy: a case report [^1171Y3ZJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Gastrointestinal involvement is common in systemic necrotizing vasculitides, including ANCA-associated vasculitides, polyarteritis nodosa, and rheumatoid arthritis-associated vasculitis. Although gastrointestinal involvement is not rare, it is difficult to diagnose MPA by endoscopic biopsy because it affects small vessels, and endoscopic biopsy specimens are often too small and superficial for a definitive diagnosis. Watts et al. proposed a stepwise algorithm for classification of ANCA-associated vasculitides and polyarteritis nodosa. In this algorithm, in addition to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference definitions, and the Lanham criteria, ANCA and surrogate markers for vasculitis are used because histological data are not available for all patients. Even if there is no histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, treatment should be performed when ANCA-associated vasculitides are strongly suspected clinically. Although histological evidence of vasculitis is important, repeat biopsy should be avoided because it can result in delayed initiation of treatment and adverse sequela.

### Nonhealing abdominal ulcer after robotic sleeve gastrectomy [^112eFSnR]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following statements is true concerning PG?
A. A biopsy with a neutrophilic infiltrate confirms the diagnosis
B. The PARCELUS score was introduced to estimate mortality associated with PG
C. History suggestive of pathergy excludes other diagnoses
D. PG is diagnosed once an underlying disease is found
E. PG is often misdiagnosed and treatment is delayed

Answers:
A. A biopsy with a neutrophilic infiltrate confirms the diagnosis – Incorrect. Although histopathologic findings of sterile neutrophilic infiltrate, mixed inflammation, and/or lymphocytic vasculitis increase suspicion of PG, only the Delphi consensus of international experts considers it a required major diagnostic criterion.
B. The PARCELUS score was introduced to estimate mortality associated with PG – Incorrect. The PARCELSUS score is a diagnostic scoring system where PG is likely with > 10 points based on the following criteria: Major criteria (3 points each): progressing disease, reddish-violaceous wound border, assessment of differential diagnoses; Minor criteria (2 points each): irregular ulcer shape, extreme pain > 4/10 on the visual analog scale, localization at site of trauma, and amelioration by immunosuppressant drugs; Additional criteria (1 point each): undermined wound border, and systemic disease associated.
C. History suggestive of pathergy excludes other diagnoses – Incorrect. Pathergy is also described in other dermatological diseases; therefore, thorough medical history and physical exam accounting for details in clinical presentation are essential in PG diagnosis. Laboratory exams that exclude differential diagnoses should be performed.
D. PG is diagnosed once an underlying disease is found – Incorrect. Proposed diagnostic criteria agree that comorbidities associated with PG augment likelihood of diagnosis, however about 1 of 3 of PG is idiopathic. Nevertheless, laboratory exams for commonly associated systemic diseases are recommended because prompt treatment of the underlying pathology ameliorates cutaneous manifestations.
E. PG is often misdiagnosed and treatment is delayed – Correct. Approximately > 10% of PG is misdiagnosed and 23% of PG patients receive delayed treatment. This may be due to lack of consensus over diagnosis criteria and ill-defined atypical, chronic, and coinfected presentations.

However, the risk of relapse remains high, necessitating prolonged immunosuppressive or immunomodulating maintenance therapy, whose optimal duration remains undetermined.

Patients who relapsed had an inflammatory CSF and positive biopsy with delay in initiation of treatment and required the maintenance regimen with steroid-sparing immunosuppressants. Those who did not relapse had more microbleeds and an abnormal angiogram. It is possible that these features were clues leading to an earlier diagnosis and treatment in these patients. We did not find gadolinium enhancement on MRI to be associated with relapses, contrary to previous reports, probably due to the smaller numbers.

We found no differences in short-term outcome or relapse between those who received induction therapy with steroids alone vs those who received combination treatment. This was similar to few other cohorts, where no association of the treatment modality with outcomes was found. Those who relapsed required the maintenance regimen with another alternative immunosuppressive agent that is explained by their aggressive disease course. However, the French cohort had better outcomes in those who received maintenance immunosuppression as compared with those without it.

It is important to note that we found poor long-term outcomes in the small vessel vasculitis group, which could be contributed by the increased relapse rates. The delay in initiation of treatment although significantly different between the small vessel and medium/large vessel vasculitis did not influence the outcome within each subtype. The delay in treatment initiation was however associated with increased relapses in the small vessel vasculitis subtype. Another factor to consider would be the existence of an indication bias because the small vessel vasculitis group had higher relapses and hence often received maintenance therapies which if not given could have resulted in further relapses and increased disability.

Treatment recommendations for PACNS are based on extrapolations from trials on anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis, with no randomized controlled trials in PACNS to support the same. Conventionally, steroids are the mainstay with additional immunosuppression given with agents such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate, rituximab, and even infliximab and etanercept.

### Granulomatous slack skin presenting as diffuse poikiloderma and necrotic ulcers, with features of granulomatous vasculitis and response to oral prednisone, acitretin, and oral psoralen plus ultraviolet light therapy – A case report [^111ZTwjt]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

GSS is a common mimicker of inflammatory and infectious skin disease. It has a slow progressive course, and diagnosis is often delayed. The presence of bulky skin folds with diffuse erythema should give one a high index of suspicion of GSS and should warrant further histopathologic studies with specific immunohistochemical stains.,

Because of the paucity of cases, there is no standard of treatment yet. Our patient continues to respond to oral PUVA and topical corticosteroids and is being monitored closely.,

Future plans include multiple biopsies and a close follow-up with the oncology service. Oral PUVA will be continued once a week for a year, tapered to every other week in the following year, further tapered to every third week for a year, and every fourth week for the fifth year before the disease is categorized as being in remission. Re-PUVA therapy will be revisited if there is a recurrence of necrotic ulcers or worsening of skin lesions. A repeat biopsy will be done once the poikiloderma and ulcers are no longer evident to assess for a complete response to treatment.

### Cutaneous pseudovasculitis [^115Nrb8y]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2007). Low credibility.

Cutaneous pseudovasculitis represents a heterogeneous collection of disorders that are capable of simulating cutaneous vasculitis and can be broadly classified into diseases that produce hemorrhage (petechiae, purpura, and ecchymoses) or vessel occlusion with resultant livedo, cyanosis, ulcers, digital necrosis, and/or gangrene. Overlap is not uncommon, but if present, one mechanism dominates. Hemorrhagic pseudovasculitis is due to vessel wall dysfunction (incompetence), which can be related to diverse factors that include vessel wall deposition of metabolic substances (amyloid, calcium), nutritional deficiencies (scurvy), nonvasculitic inflammatory purpura (pigmented purpuric dermatitis, arthropod, viral and drug reactions), degeneration of the vessel wall and supporting stroma (senile/solar purpura), direct vessel wall invasion of infective organisms, coagulation-fibrinolytic disorders (eg, thrombocytopenia), and vessel wall trauma. Cyanotic-infarctive pseudovasculitis is due vaso-occlusion by emboli, thrombi, or fibrointimal hyperplasia (endarteritis obliterans) and includes varied conditions such as purpura fulminans, Coumadin necrosis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, cardiac myxoma, cholesterol embolization, calciphylaxis, and radiation arteritis. Delayed and inappropriate diagnosis of pseudovasculitis leads to incorrect management and exposure to potentially deleterious treatment modalities such as corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents. The diagnosis of a pseudovasculitic disorder requires a high index of suspicion and should always be part of the differential diagnosis of vasculitis. Skin biopsy is a crucial step in differentiating pseudovasculitis from authentic vasculitis; absence of histologic evidence of vasculitis, particularly after multiple biopsies, should direct evaluation and diagnosis towards pseudovasculitis.

### Diagnostic delay for giant cell arteritis-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176uXMG]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the reported time-period of diagnostic delay being considerably varied within some article samples, on average, patients experience a 9-week delay between the onset of their symptoms and receiving a diagnosis of GCA. Even when the patient has a 'classical' cranial presentation, delay remains considerable. In view of the potentially serious consequences of a missed GCA diagnosis, a reduction in diagnostic delay would be beneficial and could result in overall cost savings for healthcare systems. Our research provides a new evidence-based benchmark of diagnostic delay of GCA against which future efforts to reduce this problem can be measured and supports the need for improved public awareness and fast-track diagnostic pathways.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporal arteritis… [^117DhFG3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Elderly patients are more likely to be affected by temporal arteritis, an inflammatory vasculitis. Patients with TA tend to present in a variety of ways, with ocular and systemic symptoms. Lee and Brazis developed a guide for the evaluation of patients with TA based on a search of the literature from 1966 to 1998. The authors developed the following criteria for evaluation of patients: clinical suspicion, laboratory testing and temporal artery biopsy. Clinical suspicion can be based, in part, on the American College of Rheumatology study that determined highly sensitive parameters for diagnosis of TA. These parameters include age more than 50 years, a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 50 mm per hour and an abnormal temporal artery biopsy. TA should be suspected in patients more than 50 years of age who have a diagnosis of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Steroid therapy should be initiated.

A unilateral temporal artery biopsy should be performed, and treatment should be initiated if the biopsy is positive for TA. If the biopsy is negative but suspicion remains high, a con-tralateral biopsy should be considered. Patients with medium clinical suspicion for TA should undergo an ESR and a temporal artery biopsy. Medium clinical suspicion is classified as meeting any one of the highest specificity criteria or having anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In addition, any two of the following represents medium clinical suspicion: elevated ESR, new headache in an older patient or a clinical temporal artery abnormality. If both temporal artery biopsies are negative, alternative reasons for an elevated ESR should be sought. A normal ESR and a negative unilateral biopsy make the diagnosis of TA less likely.

However, up to 30 percent of patients have a normal ESR with biopsy-proven TA; thus, other features should be sought. Little information exists about treating TA in patients who have contraindications to steroid therapy, although methotrexate or immunosuppressive treatments have been proposed. Evaluation of patients with TA is thus based on symptoms, laboratory values, temporal artery biopsy and clinical suspicion. An algorithm based on these features is provided.

Definitions for Treatment Analysis

The analyses aimed to incorporate the clinical heterogeneity inherent to this real-world clinical data set. All patients received glucocorticoids at the time of treatment initiation, most commonly pulse-dose IV methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily for 3–5 days) followed by extended oral steroid tapers. This was considered the starting time point for the time-to-remission analysis, even if immunosuppressive treatment was initiated empirically before definitive diagnosis. Two instances of brief empiric glucocorticoid exposure (< 5 days, without ongoing immunosuppression) were not considered treatment initiation for the purposes of this analysis. Cumulative glucocorticoid exposure was calculated for each patient after the first remission and throughout the follow-up period (eMethods 2). Functional status was defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) abstracted from clinical record review at the time of treatment initiation and at one-year and two-year follow-up intervals.

Patients were stratified into 2 treatment groups. The EIT group consisted of patients who received IV or oral cyclophosphamide within 3 months of treatment initiation for vasculitis and who continued cyclophosphamide treatment for at least 3 months. This time frame for cyclophosphamide initiation was selected to account for heterogeneity in access to care and potential logistical barriers in starting cyclophosphamide. The "escalation treatment" (ESC) group consisted of patients who were initially treated with glucocorticoids with or without azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate.

Remission was defined as (1) clinical stability or improvement (no new or worsening neurologic symptoms potentially attributable to PCNSV) and (2) no evidence of new or worsening diffusion abnormalities, hemorrhage, gadolinium enhancement, or other MRI lesions. Because patients with adequate treatment response may continue to demonstrate small, persistent areas of enhancement (including vessel-wall enhancement) for months or years, complete resolution of enhancement was not required to define remission; however, an additional sensitivity analysis was performed to determine whether adjusting this definition of remission affected the results of the analysis. Relapse was defined as imaging worsening consistent with vasculitis (new T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), enhancing, or hemorrhagic lesion) with clinical correlation, after a patient was previously deemed to be in remission. All patients received at least one clinical evaluation from a neurologist or rheumatologist within 6 months of treatment initiation (eTable 1 provides detailed information regarding follow-up intervals for each treatment group).

### An unusual urgent case presenting to the EDX lab: mononeuropathy monoplex [^111PpFTY]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vasculitis presenting with sciatic nerve infarction is a rare and potentially urgent neuromuscular condition requiring timely diagnosis and intervention. We present the case of a previously healthy 30-year-old female who developed sudden-onset left leg pain, tingling, and sensory deficits following hospitalization for presumed urosepsis. Examination revealed weakness and sensory dysfunction in the sciatic nerve distribution, and electrodiagnostic (EDX) studies showed an axonal sciatic neuropathy. Given her amaurosis fugax, persistent fever, and elevated inflammatory markers, a diagnosis of emerging mononeuropathy multiplex due to systemic vasculitis was suspected. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed vasculitis, and treatment with cyclophosphamide was initiated. Delays in diagnosis or treatment of this condition may have resulted in irreversible disability and even death. This case underscores the importance of considering vasculitis in patients presenting with an unexplained focal mononeuropathy in the proper clinical context and highlights the need for urgent diagnosis and referral to prevent progressive end-organ damage and disability.

### An approach to the diagnosis and management of systemic vasculitis [^116Ux7KT]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

The systemic vasculitides are a complex and often serious group of disorders which, while uncommon, require careful management in order to ensure optimal outcome. In most cases there is no known cause. Multi-system disease is likely to be fatal without judicious use of immunosuppression. A prompt diagnosis is necessary to preserve organ function. Comprehensive and repeated disease assessment is a necessary basis for planning therapy and modification of treatment protocols according to response. Therapies typically include glucocorticoids and, especially for small and medium vessel vasculitis, an effective immunosuppressive agent. Cyclophosphamide is currently the standard therapy for small vessel multi-system vasculitis, but other agents are now being evaluated in large randomized trials. Comorbidity is common in patients with vasculitis, including the cumulative effects of potentially toxic therapy. Long-term evaluation of patients is important in order to detect and manage relapses.

### Takayasu arteritis – advances in diagnosis and management [^113C5RZa]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Takayasu arteritis, a rare granulomatous vasculitis affecting young people, is associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality. In most patients the diagnosis is delayed until after the development of substantial arterial injury. Studies of noninvasive imaging techniques suggest that these approaches might facilitate earlier diagnosis and have a role in monitoring disease progress; however, they remain limited in their ability to accurately quantify inflammatory disease activity in the arterial wall. A lack of controlled clinical trial data complicates the choice of therapy for Takayasu arteritis, and clinical indices for monitoring disease activity are currently suboptimal. Increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of the large vessel vasculitides might eventually lead to novel targeted therapies. Preliminary data from open-label trials of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy are encouraging, but there is an urgent need for controlled clinical trials to establish optimum therapeutic approaches for this disease. These trials should include a prospective assessment of the use of noninvasive imaging modalities in the diagnosis and subsequent management of Takayasu arteritis.

### Maintenance of clinical remission in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^116vmTPe]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

A fundamental change in management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis in the past 10 years is the early focussed use of aggressive immunosuppression, using regimens comprised of widely available medications. Using a clinical framework to quantify morbidity, we can induce remission in most patients within 3–6 months using glucocorticoids plus methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or rituximab, with additional plasmapheresis when indicated. Difficulty in maintaining remission probably relates to the difference between true pathophysiological remission and the absence of clinical, serological or radiological evidence of disease activity. For surviving patients, the cumulative problems of relapse, burden of disease, or its treatment are coupled with pre-existing diseases or new conditions arising since diagnosis. Initial early control should reduce subsequent damage, but what effect it will have on relapse is not clear. In the absence of a cure, future trials should focus on reducing toxicity and comorbidity as well as controlling disease.

### Systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis: focus on giant cell arteritis [^117CUGTr]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The incidence of visual loss (defined as new onset of permanent reduction of visual acuity or visual field loss) with respect to early diagnosis and GC initiation compared with delayed treatment was assessed in a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 68 patients with GCA, suggesting the importance of prompt treatment in reducing the rate of permanent visual loss. This approach did not have any effect on the frequency of relapses. Further evidence from a retrospective, multicentre study supports the concept that partial improvement of visual acuity is associated with the very early initiation of GC within 1 day from the onset of visual symptoms, regardless of the route of administration.

The effect of the best route of administration of GC (intravenous vs oral) on visual loss in GCA was assessed in a retrospective longitudinal cohort study. Patients either received 150 mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate every 8 hours for 1–3 days, followed by oral prednisone 80–120 mg/day, or they were given oral prednisone, starting with doses ≥ 80 mg/day. Visual improvement only occurred in a very limited number of cases (only in 4% of eyes and only for overall visual acuity and not for central vision) with no differences in the route of GC administration. Earlier GC initiation was associated with a trend for greater likelihood of improvement. Another retrospective longitudinal study compared the route of GC administration during the first week of treatment on visual loss at presentation of GCA. Different intravenous schemes were used (intravenous methylprednisolone pulses 1000 mg per day, 250 mg 2–4 times per day, 500 mg 1–2 times per day for a median of 3 days (range 2–5 days)) compared with oral GC prednisolone (50–100 mg/day). There was an increased likelihood for improved visual acuity in the group treated with intravenous GC (40%) compared with the oral route (13%); in all except for four patients, vision remained stable 1 month after presentation, supporting the idea that improvement only occurs in the very initial phases of the ischaemic process. Notably, both studies were characterised by high RoB; different baseline characteristics of the two cohorts and different GC doses limited the comparability and possibility to achieve firm conclusions.

Maintenance of remission: duration of immunosuppression

7a. Maintenance of remission treatment should be continued for a period of 24–48 months (GRADE 1A, SoA 97%).
7b. People living with severe renal involvement who remain dialysis dependent have a high risk of infection. Patients with renal limited disease who remain dialysis dependent may not require ongoing immunotherapy. Maintenance of remission therapy to prevent relapses should be balanced against the risks of immunosuppression (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%).

Maintenance of remission: duration of GC treatment

8. The optimum length of treatment with GC during the maintenance phase is uncertain. Depending on concurrent immunosuppression, complete GC withdrawal may be possible within 6–12 months following induction of remission treatment (GRADE 2B, SoA 98%).

Timing of kidney transplant in GPA and MPA

9. People living with GPA or MPA should be in stable clinical remission for at least 6 to 12 months prior to receiving a kidney transplant (GRADE 2C, SoA 98%).

### Diagnostic delay for giant cell arteritis-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Rer3q]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnostic delay is a common problem in many conditions. For example, a median 9-week delay has been identified in diagnosing childhood brain tumours, and a 24-week median delay in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As the delay in receiving a diagnosis for such conditions has been shown to have negative effects on outcomes, much research has looked to reduce this respective diagnostic delay. It remains unclear at what point(s) in the patient pathway the greatest potentially avoidable delay is incurred. Raza et al. examined the reasons for delay in assessment of RA across Europe. They found that delays in receiving a RA diagnosis could be related to the time taken for (1) the patient to consult healthcare after symptom onset, (2) the patient to be given an appointment, (3) the primary care clinician to refer the patients to secondary care, and (4) the patient to receive a secondary care appointment; the extent of delay at each point varied across countries. There may also be more specific reasons for delay, for example, varying test availability (i.e. ultrasonography) due to different service provision by geographical region or local funding allocation. Linked to variations in the point at which delay occurs, the terminology of delay should also be reconsidered. Future research should make the distinction between 'consultation delay' (the period from symptom onset to receiving a consultation) and 'diagnostic delay' (the time between first consultation and final diagnosis). This acknowledges that clinical diagnosis is not possible until the patient initiates contact with a health professional. Research has demonstrated that through disease awareness programmes it is possible to reduce delay at any stage of the disease pathway and thus the importance of our review exists in determining an evidence-based baseline level of delay in GCA diagnosis that future studies must attempt to reduce.

### Discontinuation of therapies in vasculitis [^114tuByT]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

For most patients with vasculitis, treatment will result in prevention of mortality and also lead to clinical remission. This increased survival is of course most welcome, but the burden of surviving an episode of acute vasculitis consists of the effects of the disease as well as the adverse events from treatment. Therefore, we have begun to explore the possibility of withdrawing treatment in order to avoid long-term medication toxicities. Whilst this will reduce short-term side effects, if withdrawal leads to subsequent uncontrolled flares of disease, the need for additional therapy may outweigh any benefit from a drug-free holiday. For very mild forms of vasculitis, such as isolated skin vasculitis, the best option may be to avoid treatment altogether. In those patients with vasculitis secondary to an identifiable agent such as drug toxicity or an infectious organism, discontinuing the offending drug or treating the infection will usually resolve or cure the vasculitis. In patients with localised vasculitis, surgical removal of the affected area can be curative. Other forms of vasculitis have a self-limited duration, after which there does not appear to be any clinical evidence of disease, such as is the case for the majority of patients with giant cell arteritis. By contrast, in many forms of vasculitis, especially those associated with the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA), relapse occurs in at least half the patients. Where glucocorticoid therapy is used for any length of time, in doses of > 5 mg/day, side effects are almost universal. Adding a concomitant agent in the attempt to shorten the course and/or reduce the dose of glucocorticoid treatment may be effective, but can also result in toxicity from the alternative agent, and leaves the patient on immunosuppressive therapy. More toxic therapy, such as cyclophosphamide, usually is administered only for a limited time or cumulative amount, in order to achieve induction of remission or flare in severe disease. The advent of targeted biologic therapy offers the opportunity to provide more effective, less toxic and perhaps more long-lasting control of disease. Rituximab in small-vessel vasculitis can result in long-lasting control of disease, for 18 months or more, from a single course of treatment. Suppression of the interleukin-6 pathway may be effective in large-vessel vasculitis. Unfortunately, none of these therapies is capable of 'cure' for the majority of patients. Therefore, discontinuation of therapy remains unachievable for most patients with vasculitis, at least in the first few years of disease. Short courses of intensive, aggressive therapy are followed by the use of maintenance treatment. Long-term follow-up studies are required to determine the potential benefit of early, more effective control of vasculitis.

### Diagnostic approach in patients with suspected vasculitis [^1128e1Eo]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the common feature of inflammation of the blood vessel wall. Vasculitis can be a systemic or localized process and depending on the disorder can affect large, medium, or small vessels. Vascular physicians including interventional radiologists often may be involved early in these cases before the establishment of a diagnosis as these patients may present with manifestations attributable to occlusive vascular syndromes. In this article, we discuss the presenting signs and symptoms of patients with vasculitis as well as laboratory and imaging studies required to further evaluate these disorders and treatment options, which include interventional as well as noninterventional options.

### Pathways to renal biopsy and diagnosis among patients with ANCA small-vessel vasculitis [^114YiP28]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody small-vessel vasculitis (ANCA-SVV) is an autoimmune systemic process increasingly recogniSed since the advent of antibody testing for the disease. Prompt diagnosis and institution of immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to improve patient outcome. The goal of this study was to better understand how patients navigate the health care system from symptom presentation to biopsy diagnosis, and to study the effects of prompt versus delayed diagnosis.

Methods

Disease symptoms and number of physicians seen prior to renal biopsy were assessed for 127 ANCA-SVV patients. Direct, delayed, and quest pathways to diagnosis and treatment of vasculitis were defined for both patients and providers. Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact tests were used to evaluate continual measures and compare categorical variables across pathways.

Results

Among patients who sought direct care, physician delay in referral to a nephrologist was common (49/127, 71%, p = 0.0023). Patients who delayed seeking care also experienced a delayed diagnosis 57% of the time (p = 0.0023). Patients presenting with prodromal flu or upper respiratory involvement were more likely to have a delay/quest patient pathway (56% and 55%, respectively) than a direct patient pathway (44%, p = 0.033 and 45%, p = 0.019, respectively). There was a trend for patients with more severe loss of renal function to have a more direct referral to a nephrologist.

Conclusions

Delay in diagnosis of ANCA SVV may be due to lack of or non-specific symptoms, especially in patients who present with non-renal manifestations of disease. Better algorithms are needed to identify extra-renal manifestations, expedite diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

### Cutaneous vasculitis and their differential diagnoses [^116oC1yr]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined as an inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction of blood vessels identified upon histologic examination. Cutaneous manifestations are frequent during the course of many systemic vasculitis. Lesions are often not specific, the most frequent being palpable purpura. They may be the first and only manifestation of the disease or be a part of a systemic condition. Histology is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of vasculitis to avoid a delayed and inappropriate diagnosis that could lead to improper management. Cutaneous histology gave some data that may help to classify the vasculitis without determining precisely its type. A histological examination of all other skin lesions is necessary. The result of the biopsy has to be correlated to DIF data, medical history, physical examination, laboratory and radiological findings leading to the correct diagnosis and effective treatment. In this review, we discuss the diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis (CV) and the pitfalls related to the cutaneous pathology. We also describe the essential features of the major categories of skin vasculitis.

### Vasculitis [^112mKDUP]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Vasculitis is defined by the presence of blood vessel inflammation. It can be observed in a wide variety of settings, which can be broadly grouped as secondary vasculitides, which occur in association with an underlying disease or trigger, or primary vasculitides, in which vasculitis is occurring for as-yet unknown causes. The primary systemic vasculitides comprise a range of disease entities that are uniquely identified by their clinical, histopathologic, and therapeutic characteristics. Individual diseases predominantly affect blood vessels of a particular size, which influences their clinical manifestations and has been used in their classification. The vasculitides can also differ in their severity, extending from self-limited illnesses to those that can be life-threatening in the absence of prompt initiation of treatment. Immunosuppressive agents are used to treat many vasculitic diseases. Although such approaches can be effective, the patient's long-term course can be influenced by organ damage from their initial presentation, disease relapses, and medication toxicity. Recent investigations have focused on understanding disease pathophysiology and the exploration of novel therapeutic approaches.

### Giant cell arteritis: strategies in diagnosis and treatment [^112799E3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes current diagnostic assessments and therapeutic strategies in giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium-size vessels. Concurrent symptoms of proximal muscular ache and morning stiffness, polymyalgia rheumatica, are commonly seen. Recent investigations support the contention that polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis are two different expressions of the same underlying vasculitic disorder.

Recent Findings

The symptomatology of giant cell arteritis is quite varying. Recently a frequent occurrence of audiovestibular manifestations was demonstrated, which should be actively searched for in the clinical investigation. Although color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and positron emission tomography have illustrated the widespread nature of giant cell arteritis, none of these techniques may currently replace temporal artery biopsy. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is a safe and simple procedure, and remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. The importance of long biopsies and meticulous histologic examination using sub-serial sectioning is emphasized. Numerous recent publications confirm the low diagnostic yield of a second, contralateral biopsy. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone in the treatment of giant cell arteritis. Although steroid treatment promptly eliminates symptoms of systemic inflammation, its effect on inflammatory morphology is delayed. Consequently, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies. The potential role of aspirin has recently been implicated.

### ANCA vasculitis: time for a change in treatment paradigm? Not yet [^116TrorV]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are conventionally treated with a strategy of remission induction followed by maintenance therapy using glucocorticoids combined with CYC during induction and AZA for maintenance. Recently, several randomized controlled trials have been published that question whether these drugs should remain those of choice. B-cell depletion using rituximab is at least as effective as CYC for remission induction in newly presenting patients, but long-term efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness data are awaited, and thus rituximab should be reserved for patients at high risk of infertility. Rituximab seems to be effective at inducing remission in relapsing patients. Whether routine pre-emptive treatment with rituximab for remission maintenance is a better approach than waiting for relapse is unknown. MTX and LEF have similar efficacy to AZA, but are not significantly safer; while MMF is less effective. Thus, AZA remains the conventional maintenance drug of choice.

### Delayed diagnosis of biopsy-negative giant cell arteritis presenting as fever of unknown origin [^116tsATd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) presents a diagnostic challenge. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) may present with FUO and this entity should be included in the differential of elderly patients who present with constitutional symptoms. While a temporal artery biopsy is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of GCA, a subset of patients with large vessel involvement by GCA may have a negative temporal artery biopsy and no cranial symptoms. We present a 79 year-old woman with FUO and negative temporal artery biopsies in whom diagnosis of GCA was delayed. Further imaging with CT-angiogram and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan showed diffuse extensive active vasculitis. The above case underscores the value of imaging studies in the evaluation of patients with FUO from occult large vessel vasculitis.

Diagnosis

Prior to diagnosis of AAV, suspicion of a vasculitic illness is key and these disorders should be considered in patients with unexplained systemic or organ specific inflammation and/or dysfunction. Diagnostic delay remains an important contributor to poor outcomes especially for those with kidney involvement. The diagnosis of AAV involves a comprehensive approach that includes clinical manifestations, serologic testing [immunoassays for PR3‑ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs, eosinophils, exclusion of anti–glomerular basement membrane disease and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)] and when feasible tissue biopsy. Prompt treatment is often initiated in high-suspicion cases, while biopsy may still be performed later to confirm the diagnosis, exclude AAV mimics and guide further management, particularly from the kidney. The International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitides and the subsequent ACR and EULAR have established classification criteria for AAV to aid in research and clinical studies, but are not designed to be diagnostic criteria.

Background

Primary systemic vasculitides of the young are relatively rare diseases, but are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly if there is diagnostic delay. There have been a number of notable advances recently in the field of paediatric vasculitis research, including the development of classification criteria; and tools to assess disease outcome for use in clinical trials and other research involving children with vasculitis. Treatment regimens continue to improve, with the use of different immunosuppressive medications and newer therapeutic approaches such as biologic agents. With the exception of Kawasaki Disease, most of current treatment approaches for paediatric vasculitides are based on evidence from small case series, anecdotal observations, or adult studies. Therefore, treatment differs substantially throughout Europe; and even within a single country, experience and practices vary considerably. Given that vasculitides are rare, conducting large randomised controlled trials using traditional clinical trial design is usually not feasible. There is, however, a need for a standardized approach to the management of these rare paediatric rheumatic diseases. The SHARE (Single-Hub Access for Pediatric Rheumatology in Europe) project has been set up to address this unmet need, and one of the main aims is to provide recommendations for the management of paediatric rheumatological diseases in European countries. Within this context the SHARE vasculitis working group have recently provided consensus and (where possible) evidence-based statements to optimize and harmonize management of vasculitis (manuscript in preparation). A detailed description of this as yet unpublished guidance is beyond the scope of this review. It is also currently unclear how the impact of the SHARE guidance will be assessed for all the vasculitides; comparative effectiveness research methodologies may be required within the context of national or international patient registries. Indeed this approach is already underway for Kawasaki disease (KD), in the context of a British Paediatric Surveillance Unit study specifically examining the impact of new clinical guidelines for KD in the UK.

This review summarises therapeutic advances in current management strategies for systemic vasculitides, and describes important unmet needs. At the time of writing this review, the SHARE guidelines are not yet published; however, we have aligned the descriptions of vasculitis treatment with the SHARE recommendations, which the reader should refer to (when these become available) for more detailed guidance.

Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 typically present simultaneously with or after other COVID-19 symptoms; however, in 12% of cases, they can occur prior. Diagnosing underlying COVID-19 is paramount, given the associated public health risks, since accurate and timely diagnosis can prevent further spread of the virus through appropriate quarantining measures and possibly provide patients with COVID-19 treatment options earlier in their disease course.

Vasculitis

Vasculitis resulting from ICI treatment is a rare irAE and has been reported involving large vessels, medium vessels, small vessels, and the central nervous system.GCA, a type of large vessel vasculitis, has been seen with PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 blockade and may be associated with PMR symptoms. No deaths have been attributed to ICI-induced vasculitis, and symptoms in each case resolved following withholding of ICIs and/or corticosteroid therapy. Induction with rituximab or cyclophosphamide have also been used in addition to steroids. Vasculitis typically occurs at a median of 3 months following initial ICI treatment. In those patients with suspected GCA, a low threshold for temporal artery biopsy in consultation with a rheumatologist and urgent corticosteroids may be warranted due to risk of visual loss.

Myositis

Myositis is a rare, potentially serious irAE, occurring in 1% of patients treated with anti-PD(L)1 ICIs and < 1% of patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 ICIs. Little systematic data exist regarding the occurrence of myositis during treatment with other ICIs. Myositis is often associated with other serious muscular and neurological dysfunction, including myocarditis (9% of patients with ICI-associated myositis) and myasthenia gravis (9% of patients with ICI-associated myositis). Fatalities in patients with myositis may arise from associated irAEs such as myocarditis, or may occur directly as a result of myositis, particularly if there is diaphragmatic or respiratory muscle involvement. Symptoms of myositis include restricted eye movement, problems with speaking or swallowing, muscle weakness in the limbs, and myalgia. Some patients are asymptomatic, but exhibit elevated levels of CK. Conversely, some symptomatic patients present with normal CK levels. Myositis may require continued monitoring and/or follow-up treatment — in one analysis, 50% of myositis cases were ongoing or had resulted in sequelae at the end of the 5-year observation period.

Fast-track approach

The consequences of disease progression in TAK may be severe, and a rapid diagnosis and treatment would likely reduce the likelihood of vascular damage, as shown for GCA, where implementation of fast-track clinics leads to an improved prognosis. However, this approach to diagnosis is probably not as relevant in TAK as it is for GCA, and may be difficult to implement, given the usual subacute clinical presentation and pattern of disease progression. No studies regarding such an approach in TAK were found.

Role of histology

Histological evaluation is not routinely performed in TAK since this is only possible if surgery is needed or in the event of death. This SLR did not find relevant papers in this regard.

### Early clinical course of biopsy-proven IgA vasculitis nephritis [^112RGwHe]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we see improvement of kidney function and decreasing proteinuria in all patients in within the first months, but complete remission requires more time in most patients. Persistent heavy proteinuria in the first two months rarely developed into long-term proteinuria. Therefore, decisions for more intense treatment should take into account the course of UPE over time. Due to the retrospective design of the study, the effect of different immunosuppressive therapy regimens cannot be compared, but treated and untreated patients showed a similar time course of proteinuria.

For clarifying the effect of immunosuppressive therapy in IgAVN, prospective, randomized controlled multicenter trials are necessary.

### Might maintenance therapy be discontinued once clinical remission is achieved in ANCA-associated vasculitis? [^112n6jak]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) encompasses a group of rare, multisystem autoimmune disorders characterised by the occurrence of inflammation and damage to small blood vessels, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations. They include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Outcomes for patients with MPA and GPA have been transformed over recent years. However, the establishment of effective maintenance therapy aiming to balance the risks of disease relapse with those related to prolonged immunosuppression has become a clinical priority. This review aims to explore two differing perspectives on this unsolved problem. Pros and Cons of the following approaches will be discussed: "Biomarker-guided personalised approach on top of generic maintenance strategy guidelines" or "ANCA specificity-related personalised maintenance treatment after intensive B-cell depletion"?

### Therapeutic advances in the treatment of vasculitis [^117MvRJW]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic advances in TA

There have been no randomised controlled trials to guide treatment, and few evidence-based therapeutic advances. Biologic therapies are increasingly used in children, particularly anti-TNFα, and anecdotally are reported to be efficacious. A major therapeutic challenge, however, is that there remains significant diagnostic delay for TA in children. This leads to significant and sometimes irreversible damage in the pre-diagnostic phase of the illness. At the time of writing, a major clinical trial of tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor) for the treatment of giant cell arteritis in adults is ongoing, and hopefully will report later in 2016. It is debatable, however, what relevance this might have for children with TA.

SHARE guidelines for the treatment of TA in the paediatric population will be formally published soon. The general therapeutic approach is that of induction of remission (high dose corticosteroid combined with another immunosuppressant), followed by maintenance of remission therapy (lower dose corticosteroid combined with a maintenance immunosuppressive agent, usually methotrexate), or institution of second line therapy for failed induction. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of first-line treatment for TA. In addition, methotrexate, azathioprine, MMF, and cyclophosphamide have been used in children as first or second line agents. Ozen, et al. described 6 children with TA, and treatment with steroid and cyclophosphamide induction followed by MTX was suggested as effective and safe for childhood TA. Anti-TNF therapy may be beneficial. Promising results have also been reported with anti-IL6 therapy (tocilizumab) for adults with TA, and in some cases children. Surgical intervention is frequently required to alleviate end-organ ischemia and hypertension resulting from vascular stenosis, although it is preferable to control the vasculitic process before performing revascularisation procedures or other vascular surgery, if possible, since outcomes are worse if these are undertaken when the disease is still active.

The 5 year mortality rate of TA in children has been reported as high as 35%; we recently reported 27% mortality from TA in children. Prognosis is dependent upon the extent of arterial involvement and organ damage at presentation; age of patient at disease onset (children under 5 have poorer prognosis); and on the severity of hypertension. It is unlikely that a randomised controlled trial for TA in children will be undertaken in the foreseeable future; extrapolation from adult trials (such as the soon-to-be reported tocilizumab trial) will provide some evidence base, but with all the caveats around using data from adult trials to inform paediatric practice.

### Childhood-onset Takayasu arteritis: clinical presentation, challenges and disease course [^114g7gjS]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Takayasu arteritis is a rare and potentially life-threatening large-vessel vasculitis, particularly challenging in children due to its diverse and non-specific clinical presentation. Delayed diagnosis and the absence of standardized treatment guidelines often complicate management, necessitating frequent treatment adjustments and, in many cases, surgical or endovascular interventions. Early recognition and timely, aggressive treatment are critical to improving outcomes. Given the rarity and heterogeneity of childhood-onset TAK, large multinational collaborations are vital to advancing our understanding and developing evidence-based treatment strategies to enhance patient care.

### Utility of interval kidney biopsy in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^11149sPN]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare autoimmune disorder that commonly involves the kidney. Early identification of kidney involvement, assessing treatment-response and predicting outcome are important clinical challenges. Here, we assessed the potential utility of interval kidney biopsy in AAV.

Methods

In a tertiary referral centre with a dedicated vasculitis service, we identified patients with AAV who had undergone interval kidney biopsy, defined as a repeat kidney biopsy (following an initial biopsy showing active AAV) undertaken to determine the histological response in the kidney following induction immunosuppression. We analysed biochemical, histological and outcome data, including times to kidney failure and death for all patients.

Results

We identified 57 patients with AAV who underwent at least one interval kidney biopsy (59 interval biopsies in total; median time to interval biopsy ∼130days). Of the 59 interval biopsies performed, 24 (41%) patients had clinically suspected active disease at time of biopsy which was confirmed histologically in only 42% of cases; 35 (59%) patients were in clinical disease-remission, and this was correct in 97% of cases. The clinician's impression was incorrect in one in four patients. Hematuria at interval biopsy did not correlate with histological activity. Interval biopsy showed fewer acute lesions and more chronic damage compared with initial biopsy and led to immunosuppressive treatment-change in 75% (44/59) of patients. Clinical risk prediction tools tended to operate better using interval biopsy data.

Conclusion

Interval kidney biopsy is useful for determining treatment-response and subsequent disease management in AAV. It may provide better prognostic information than initial kidney biopsy and should be considered for inclusion into future clinical trials and treatment protocols for patients with AAV.

### Systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis: focus on giant cell arteritis [^115ZtUxG]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

The SLR focusing on treatment confirmed the need to promptly initiate GC therapy as soon as the diagnosis of GCA is suspected, however, there are conflicting data on the optimal starting dose and route of administration of GC. There is a need to optimise future studies to define the minimum effective initial dose and a safe reduction approach for managing GCA with GC. The treatment challenge of GC dependent or refractory/relapsing disease remains, particularly when reaching low-to-medium doses of GC (10–15 mg/day). The three RCTs conducted to assess the role of MTX in newly diagnosed patients with GCA have been criticised for the application of variable endpoints (time to first relapse, reduction of relapses or influence on cumulative GC dose), the use of different drug doses (maximum 15 mg/week) for a variable period of time, and for their heterogeneous adjunctive GC doses and tapering schemes. Only one of them had reached its primary endpoint. However, a meta-analysis of individual patient data assessed the role of MTX in preventing the first and subsequent relapse, confirming the efficacy and safety of MTX in both disease states and highlighting the relatively slow action of the drug within 2–3 months. MTX was confirmed to reduce the cumulative GC dose. Available evidence on the subsequent long-term use of MTX (although at a maximum dose of only 15 mg/week) in routine clinical care confirmed its efficacy and safety.

### Giant cell arteritis: reviewing the advancing diagnostics and management [^112Am6uN]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is well known to be a critical ischaemic disease that requires immediate medical recognition to initiate treatment and where one in five people still suffer visual loss. The immunopathophysiology has continued to be characterised, and the influencing of ageing in the development of GCA is beginning to be understood. Recent national and international guidelines have supported the directed use of cranial ultrasound to reduce diagnostic delay and improve clinical outcomes. Immediate high dose glucocorticoids remain the standard emergency treatment for GCA, with a number of targeted agents that have been shown in clinical trials to have superior clinical efficacy and steroid sparing effects. The aim of this review was to present the latest advances in GCA that have the potential to influence routine clinical practice.

The vasculitides encompass a group of inflammatory conditions affecting the blood vessels with severe consequences including tissue ischemia, structural abnormalities, such as aneurysms/dissections, and end organ damage. The different forms are commonly classified based on the size of the blood vessel involved as large-vessel, medium-vessel, and small-vessel vasculitis. The American College of Rheumatology/Vasculitis Foundation recently published guidelines on the management of several forms of primary systemic vasculitides. In this review, the recommendations for giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis are discussed. We highlight the key recommendations, aspects where they diverge from other published guidelines, controversies, and areas of uncertainty.

INTRODUCTION

Historically, untreated anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) had a 1-year mortality of 80%. The introduction of glucocorticoids prolonged survival but required the combination with cyclophosphamide to achieve stable remission. The toxicity of prolonged cyclophosphamide encouraged the use of safer oral immunosuppressives and limiting cyclophosphamide use to an induction period of 3–6 months. While cyclophosphamide was established as the routine immunosuppressive for induction, alternative immunosuppressive, methotrexate and mycophenolate, were tested but with limited success. Rituximab, introduced in the early 2000s, was the first effective alternative to cyclophosphamide. It is favoured for relapsing disease and increasingly selected as a first-line induction agent, with its use now extended to the longer term prevention of relapse.

AAV is heterogeneous at presentation with respect to organ involvement and severity and this has led to attempts to subgroup patients based on clinical presentation, to tailor choice of treatment. No system of subgrouping has become widely accepted and this remains a confusing area with terminology, such as severe/non-severe, major/minor and organ threatening/non-organ threatening, used without robust definitions. The goals of treatment is to achieve remission, and delayed remission or failure to achieve remission is reflected in higher mortality and damage, including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) risks. Once remission is achieved the next goal is to prevent relapse, and over 50% of AAV patients will relapse during the course of their disease despite ongoing maintenance therapy.

Most patients survive their disease presentation with some irreversible organ damage exacerbated by further episodes of vasculitic relapse. The accrual of damage, prevention of relapse and development of comorbidities, especially infection, cardiovascular disease and cancer, dominate long-term patient management with important implications for treatment selection and monitoring.

### Large-vessel GCA or a late presentation of Takayasu's arteritis? [^112CQ4Ei]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis that involves medium- and large-sized vessels. Typically presenting with localised headache, temporal artery tenderness, jaw claudication and ophthalmological complications, it can also affect large vessels, leading to limb claudication. We describe a patient presenting with acute coronary syndrome but who was also noted to have absent upper limb pulses, leading to a speculative diagnosis of GCA. According to the American College of Rheumatology, the patient met the criteria for both giant cell arteritis and Takayasu's arteritis. The gold standard investigation for diagnosing GCA is the temporal artery biopsy. Although contemplated, it was argued by the reviewing rheumatologist that this would not alter her management. She was thus commenced on prednisolone 60 mg daily, which led within 2 days to a rapid fall in erythrocyte sedimentation rate to 66 mm/h, and by day 11 this had dropped further to 4 mm/h.
