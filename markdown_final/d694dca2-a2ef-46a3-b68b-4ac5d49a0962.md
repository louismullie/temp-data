## Question

Patient with B cell lymphoma found to have new large left sided abdominopelvic masses with extensive
intra-abdominal and pelvic retroperitoneal, mesenteric, pelvic
and perinephric adenopathy with small amount of intra-abdominal
ascites. He has bilateral leg edema. Explain mechanism of edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of the mechanism of bilateral lower extremity edema in a patient with B-cell lymphoma who has extensive abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy and a small amount of ascites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the Starling forces and the basic pathophysiology of edema. Then, I should verify the venous outflow anatomy from the legs and identify potential compression points. Next, I will examine how bulky lymphadenopathy could obstruct venous and lymphatic channels. After that, I need to consider additional contributors such as hypoalbuminemia, intravascular lymphoma, and hypercoagulability. Finally, I will synthesize a hierarchical mechanism and outline the diagnostic and management implications.

> Let me first confirm the foundational physiology. Edema reflects an imbalance between capillary filtration and lymphatic clearance; when interstitial fluid production exceeds lymphatic transport capacity, fluid accumulates, and in the legs gravity amplifies dependent edema, so I need to ensure I'm anchoring on that principle before attributing specific causes [^113EweB2].

> I will now examine the venous drainage pathway from the lower extremities to identify where compression could occur. Venous return from the legs proceeds via the femoral veins to the iliac veins and then to the inferior vena cava; compression anywhere along the iliocaval segment can impede outflow and cause bilateral leg edema, so I should keep iliocaval compression high on the list given the distribution of disease here [^115ich3L].

> Wait, let me verify the anatomic plausibility of compression in this case. Extensive retroperitoneal, mesenteric, pelvic, and perinephric adenopathy can directly compress the iliac veins and even the infrarenal IVC, producing mechanical venous obstruction; this pattern is well described in abdominopelvic malignancy and is a recognized cause of lower extremity venous congestion and edema, so this fits mechanistically with the clinical picture [^115ich3L] [^1126NdVG].

> Hold on, I should also consider lymphatic drainage because bilateral edema can be mixed venous-lymphatic. The lymphatics from the lower extremities drain through inguinal nodes to pelvic and retroperitoneal channels en route to the thoracic duct; bulky nodal disease can obstruct these channels, causing secondary lymphedema superimposed on venous congestion, which would further worsen edema and may contribute non-pitting features over time [^116gpPru] [^1133P8pY].

> Let me think about additional contributors. Hypoalbuminemia from advanced lymphoma can lower plasma oncotic pressure and exacerbate pitting edema; ascites supports the possibility of hypoalbuminemia and third-spacing, though I should confirm albumin levels rather than assume. I also need to check for intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, which can present with severe peripheral edema via microvascular obstruction and endothelial dysfunction, and I should not overlook malignancy-associated hypercoagulability leading to DVT, which would compound venous outflow impairment [^114FWeKf] [^115FFUXU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the edema might be purely lymphatic because it is bilateral, but I should double-check that assumption. Bilateral edema can be venous, lymphatic, or mixed; in the setting of bulky abdominopelvic adenopathy, combined mechanical venous and lymphatic obstruction is most likely, with venous compression typically producing pitting edema and lymphatic obstruction evolving toward non-pitting or brawny changes over time, so I should correct my initial inclination and frame this as a mixed-mechanism process [^113EweB2] [^116gpPru].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach to substantiate the mechanism. I need to confirm venous compression with contrast-enhanced CT or MR venography of the abdomen and pelvis to visualize iliocaval patency and compression, obtain duplex venous ultrasound of the lower extremities to assess for DVT, and check serum albumin and LDH to evaluate hypoalbuminemia and tumor burden; if lymphatic dysfunction is suspected, lymphoscintigraphy can help characterize lymphatic flow impairment, though it has limited spatial resolution and may be normal early in disease [^1126NdVG] [^1138NWMt] [^111LxMc2].

> I should confirm management implications tied to the mechanism. Definitive control of lymphoma is essential to relieve compression; in the interim, leg elevation and compression therapy can mitigate symptoms, and if there is significant iliocaval obstruction with refractory edema or thrombosis risk, endovascular stenting of the compressed segment can restore venous outflow and improve quality of life, with growing evidence supporting safety and efficacy in tumor-related venous compression [^115ich3L] [^116Fk5Ab].

> Let me reconsider the synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The most parsimonious explanation is that bulky abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy causes extrinsic compression of the iliac veins and possibly the IVC, producing venous hypertension and pitting edema, while simultaneous obstruction of pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphatic channels impairs lymphatic return, yielding a mixed venous-lymphatic edema; contributory factors may include hypoalbuminemia, intravascular lymphoma physiology, and superimposed DVT in a hypercoagulable state, all of which should be actively evaluated and addressed [^115ich3L] [^116gpPru] [^114FWeKf] [^115FFUXU].

The bilateral leg edema in this B-cell lymphoma patient is most likely due to **mechanical compression** of the iliac veins and inferior vena cava by bulky abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy, causing venous outflow obstruction and venous hypertension [^1126NdVG] [^115ich3L]. Additional contributors include **hypoalbuminemia** from protein-losing enteropathy or hepatic/renal dysfunction, and secondary lymphedema from lymphatic channel compression or infiltration [^113EweB2] [^111D7Anp] [^1133P8pY]. The small amount of ascites reflects impaired lymphatic drainage and portal venous pressure from the same compressive disease burden [^116h4L8T].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of bilateral leg edema

### Mechanical compression of venous structures

- **Iliac vein and IVC compression**: Bulky retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and pelvic lymphadenopathy can compress the iliac veins and IVC, causing venous outflow obstruction, venous hypertension, and dependent edema [^1126NdVG] [^115ich3L].

- **Pelvic mass effect**: Large abdominopelvic masses can directly compress pelvic veins, further impairing venous return from the lower extremities [^111uFqa1].

---

### Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia reduces plasma oncotic pressure, promoting interstitial fluid accumulation and edema. In lymphoma, it may result from **protein-losing enteropathy** — lymphomatous involvement of the gut causing protein loss — or from hepatic or renal dysfunction that lowers albumin synthesis or increases urinary protein loss [^111D7Anp] [^116qqUv5].

---

### Lymphatic obstruction

Lymphatic obstruction from **lymphatic channel compression or infiltration** by tumor impairs lymphatic drainage, causing secondary lymphedema and contributing to edema [^112EEUW6] [^1133P8pY].

---

### Increased capillary permeability

Increased capillary permeability from **cytokine release** in lymphoma can increase capillary leak, further worsening edema [^115GytUr].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting proposed mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|
| Mechanical compression | - Extensive abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy on imaging [^1126NdVG] <br/> - Documented venous compression syndromes (e.g. May-Thurner) [^1126NdVG] <br/> - Case reports of leg edema from pelvic masses [^111uFqa1] |
| Hypoalbuminemia | - Hypoalbuminemia reported in lymphoma with protein-losing enteropathy [^116qqUv5] <br/> - Generalized edema in systemic diseases with low albumin [^114FJiuB] |
| Lymphatic obstruction | - Secondary lymphedema from tumor infiltration/compression [^112EEUW6] <br/> - Cancer-related lymphedema described in the literature [^1133P8pY] |
| Increased capillary permeability | - Cytokine-mediated capillary leak in malignancy [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to define the extent of lymphadenopathy and venous/lymphatic compression [^1126NdVG].

- **Oncologic therapy**: Systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy to reduce tumor burden and relieve compression [^1161f6wG].

- **Supportive care**: Leg elevation, compression garments, and diuretics for symptomatic relief [^115GytUr] [^11313SAy].

- **Interventional radiology**: Consider venous stenting for severe iliac/IVC compression causing refractory edema [^115ich3L] [^116Fk5Ab].

---

The bilateral leg edema in this B-cell lymphoma patient is driven by **mechanical venous compression**, with additional contributions from hypoalbuminemia, lymphatic obstruction, and increased capillary permeability. Management should focus on **tumor control** and **supportive measures** to relieve compression and edema.

### Unilateral lower extremity swelling as a rare presentation of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [^111zuGgv]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity oedema is frequently encountered in clinical practice. The challenge is to correctly identify the aetiology of oedema, and hence correctly manage the cause. Oedema can be classified as venous oedema and lymphoedema. Lymphoedema of the lower extremities is usually bilateral. Unilateral leg lymphoedema may occur secondary to radiation, surgery, compression by a tumour or early filariasis infection. Unilateral lower extremity lymphoedema has been reported as a rare initial presentation for lymphoma, mostly in women, usually without B-symptoms, and often with inguinal lymphadenopathies or abdominal masses. In this paper, we report a rare case of unilateral lower extremity oedema in a healthy male presenting to the outpatient clinic following trauma; further work-up revealed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bulky inguinal lymphadenopathy compressing the iliac veins.

Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is seen in less than one per million people and can be an extremely difficult antemortem diagnosis to make due to a vast diversity of presenting symptoms. We present a case of an otherwise healthy 74-year-old woman whose predominant symptom was pitting oedema, and who likely died from multiorgan failure after > 14 months of extensive workup that was unable to secure a definitive diagnosis.

Case report

A 53-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with painful left lower extremity swelling and erythema. He had recently completed a course of cephalexin for cellulitis of the left leg; yet, his symptoms worsened. Six months prior, enlarging bilateral adrenal and periaortic retroperitoneal masses were discovered incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging; however, the patient was lost to follow-up, preventing further work-up. On current presentation, he endorsed intermittent fevers, episodic night sweats, decreased appetite, and palpitations. He denied recent leg trauma or penetrating injury. Physical examination revealed ill-defined, warm, confluent erythema, edema, and tender induration of the left calf (Fig 1).

### Edema: diagnosis and management [^113EweB2]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space that occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the limits of lymphatic drainage, producing noticeable clinical signs and symptoms. The rapid development of generalized pitting edema associated with systemic disease requires timely diagnosis and management. The chronic accumulation of edema in one or both lower extremities often indicates venous insufficiency, especially in the presence of dependent edema and hemosiderin deposition. Skin care is crucial in preventing skin breakdown and venous ulcers. Eczematous (stasis) dermatitis can be managed with emollients and topical steroid creams. Patients who have had deep venous thrombosis should wear compression stockings to prevent postthrombotic syndrome. If clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis remains high after negative results are noted on duplex ultrasonography, further investigation may include magnetic resonance venography to rule out pelvic or thigh proximal venous thrombosis or compression. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bilateral leg edema even in the absence of pulmonary hypertension. Brawny, nonpitting skin with edema characterizes lymphedema, which can present in one or both lower extremities. Possible secondary causes of lymphedema include tumor, trauma, previous pelvic surgery, inguinal lymphadenectomy, and previous radiation therapy. Use of pneumatic compression devices or compression stockings may be helpful in these cases.

On May 5, 2019, the patient returned to our hospital with a right-sided inguinal hernia that had been present for 6 months. A physical examination showed a 3*3-cm mass in the right inguinal region. Abdominal computed tomography showed thickening of the ascending colon with luminal narrowing (Fig. 3 a). Colonoscopy showed an intraluminal proliferative mass in the ascending colon (Fig. 3 b). Biopsy examination confirmed a malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Fig. 3 c, d). The tumor cells stained positive for CD20 (diffuse, strong), CD79a (diffuse+), Ki67 (90%), BCL6 (+), CD10 (weak, sun), BCL6 (+), and c-Myc (30%), and negative for CD5, cyclinD1, CD23, CD21, BCL2, MUM1, CD30, and p53 (wild type), which was consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In situ hybridization test showed that the tumor cells were negative for the Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER).

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^111D7Anp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is another mechanism of edema in PIL, which in fact, is more common than lymphedema. The underlying pathophysiology is lymph loss in bowel lumen, from excessive dilation and eventually rupture of the already ectatic lymphatic vessels of small bowels. Intestinal lymph is rich in long chain triglycerides, lymphocytes, and proteins. The result of excessive lymph loss is the characteristic steatorrhea, lymphopenia, edema, and hypoproteinemia including hypogammaglobulinemia. Interestingly, the case herein predominantly had a combined pitting and non-pitting unilateral edema, despite presenting with systemic manifestations and visceral involvement (PIL and ascites).

The most common clinical presentation in PIL includes bilateral lower extremity edema and intermittent or chronic diarrhea. As discussed earlier, The edema is mainly pitting; due to hypoalbuminemia, but could rarely be non-pitting as well, when it is due to lymphedema. It is oftentimes difficult to distinguish them, especially when both are present. Stemmer's sign can be helpful in such cases, where a positive sign (the inability to pinch the skin at the dorsum of the second toe) indicates lymphedema, rather than pitting edema. Other clinical manifestations of PIL including abdominal mass, chylous effusion (ascitic, pleural, or pericardial), generalized anasarca, and intestinal mechanical obstruction have been rarely reported.

Case presentation

A 72-year-old woman with a 10-year history of hypertension visited a local hospital presenting with anasarca and 15-kg weight gain in the past 3 months. She did not have fever, appetite loss, night sweats, or dyspnea. Because of elevated liver enzymes and abdominal computed tomography (CT) abnormalities, including splenomegaly and multiple splenic tumors, she was referred to our hospital.

On admission, physical examination of the patient revealed the following: temperature, 36.3 °C; pulse rate, 84 beats per minute, regular; blood pressure, 132/74 mmHg; and respiration rate, 18 breaths per minute. Although she had remarkable anasarca, she seemed in no distress. Her height was 143.5 cm, body weight 71 kg, and body mass index 34.2. She had no jugular venous distention. Lymphadenopathy was not noted. No crackles were audible, but there were diminished breath sounds in the base of the right lung. She had remarkable nonpitting and slow pitting mixed edema of the legs. A delayed relaxation time of the Achilles tendon reflex was observed.

### A case of progressive lower leg edema [^116DRWMk]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Answers:

A. Punch biopsy for histologic diagnosis – Correct. The differential diagnosis for a patient with bilateral lower leg edema accompanied with hyperpigmented patches and plaques includes lymphedema, lipodermatosclerosis, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), stasis dermatitis, chronic venous insufficiency, and many other entities. Our patient has poorly controlled HIV, and a biopsy is necessary to rule out KS.
B. Initiation of intravenous vancomycin – Incorrect. Intravenous vancomycin is empiric treatment for cellulitis in a patient at risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HIV positive status). Bilateral lower leg cellulitis is rare, and our patient does not have other stigmata of acute infections, such as fever, pain, or malaise.
C. Potassium hydroxide preparation – Incorrect. A potassium hydroxide preparation is a useful diagnostic test when suspecting a superficial fungal infection. Although an argument may be made for an atypical presentation of superficial fungal infection in our immunocompromised patient, it would not explain the significant edema that developed, and our patient requires a biopsy to rule out KS.
D. Calculate calcium-phosphate product – Incorrect. The calcium-phosphate product is a clinically relevant tool in predicting the risk of extra-skeletal calcification in a patient with renal disease. In our patient, there is no history of renal failure or cutaneous calcification.
E. Complete blood count with Sezary prep – Incorrect. Sezary syndrome is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma classically characterized by the triad of lymphadenopathy, erythroderma, and Sezary cells in the blood, lymph nodes, and skin. Our patient does not have erythroderma or lymphadenopathy; therefore, this test would be inappropriate.

Peripheral edema often poses a dilemma for the clinician because it is a nonspecific finding common to a host of diseases ranging from the benign to the potentially life threatening. A rational and systematic approach to the patient with edema allows for prompt and cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. This article reviews the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation as a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of edema formation in specific disease states, as well as the implications for treatment. Specific etiologies are reviewed to compare the diseases that manifest this common physical sign. Finally, we review the clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment strategies.

### A case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type presenting as lower extremity edema and ulcers [^1157crvV]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 75-year-old man with a history of longstanding Crohn's disease treated with adalimumab was transferred from an outside hospital with leg ulcerations, erythema, pain, and computed tomography (CT) imaging concerning for compartment syndrome. Five months before admission, the patient had experienced bilateral lower extremity swelling, which rapidly progressed into ulcers. He had been followed by a local wound care clinic and was treated with silver dressings, oil emulsion dressings, compression, and numerous courses of antibiotics without any improvement. Because of progression of ulcers with malodor and significantly worsening pain, he presented to a local emergency department and was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone given concern for cellulitis. A CT was performed and demonstrated: "cutaneous thickening over the anterior aspect of the leg, extensive intramuscular edema of the anterior, lateral, and deep compartments of the lower portion of the leg with loss of the fat planes highly concerning for compartment syndrome". The patient was transferred to our tertiary care hospital for further management.

Upon initial evaluation by the dermatology team, the patient had normal vital signs. He endorsed worsening pain to the point that he could no longer elevate his legs and had been unable to sleep. Physical examination demonstrated bilateral lower extremity pitting edema (3+) up to thighs. The left anterolateral shin had a hard, woody, nodular cobblestone texture superimposed upon diffuse erythema. Multiple ulcerations with overlying hemorrhagic and serous crusting were noted on the left, but not right side of the lower extremity (Fig 1). Laboratory evaluation was notable for elevated lactate dehydrogenase of 434 (normal range 135–225). Complete blood cell count revealed a normal white blood cell count but mild anemia (hematocrit = 26%; normal range: 36%-48%) and platelets (91; normal range 150–450 k/uL). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were moderately elevated at 51 (normal 0–12 mm/h) and 15 (normal 0–10 mg/L), respectively.

### Leg edema due to a mass in the pelvis after a large-diameter metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty [^111uFqa1]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of a patient with leg edema after large-diameter metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty. At 1 year and 2 months after primary left large-diameter metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty, the patient complained of left leg edema. At first, we suspected deep venous thrombosis. However, deep venous thrombosis was not detected by venous ultrasonographic examination. Computed tomography imaging revealed a mass in front of the iliac fossa. The mass compressed the left iliac artery and vein. We therefore believed that this lesion was the cause of the leg edema and performed resection of the mass. The resected mass consisted of necrotic tissue infiltrating inflammation cells, so it was diagnosed as pseudotumor. Unilateral leg edema disappeared gradually after the resection.

### A case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type presenting as lower extremity edema and ulcers [^115mjp3Y]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adalimumab (Humira) is a tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody used in a variety of rheumatologic and autoimmune disorders, including inflammatory bowel disorders. Although there were initial concerns for an association between lymphomas and tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, recent study of long-term adverse events of adalimumab in a large group of patients with Crohn's disease found the lymphoma rate for patients on adalimumab was below the estimated background rate. However, there are case reports of adalimumab usage associated with development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and noncutaneous B-cell lymphoma but no reports of an association with any types of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.

Our patient had been misdiagnosed by multiple clinicians, including his local wound care clinic, emergency departments as well as multiple expert consultants after transfer to a tertiary medical center. The diagnosis was made difficult because of the rapid progression of disease, in that the tumors presented as ulcerations, there were clear-cut findings of significant venous and lymphatic insufficiency (due to tumor infiltration of regional nodes), as well as the fact that numerous radiological studies including, ultrasound, CT, and CT angiography did not suggest malignancy as a favored diagnosis. As such, skin biopsy was required for diagnosis and should be performed expeditiously for any wound without a clear etiology, or any wound not responding to appropriate standard treatment.

### Cutaneous telangiectasia and cauda equina syndrome: a presentation of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [^112buMC4]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2013). Low credibility.

We describe a 72-year-old woman with striking cutaneous telangiectatic lesions that chronologically preceded presentation with cauda equina syndrome. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was confirmed on skin biopsies from plaques on the abdominal wall and left ankle, the possibilities including primary cutaneous DLBCL leg-type or systemic DLBCL. We speculate that this clinical appearance may arise due to lymphatic or vascular congestion resulting from the dense lymphoid infiltrate in this case.

### Multicentric castleman disease presenting with orbital involvement progressing to TAFRO syndrome: a case report [^1161f6wG]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old woman has been experiencing progressive redness and protrusion of the eyelid for the past six years, with no apparent pain or vision loss. Despite receiving no treatment, her eye symptoms have shown a slow trend of worsening. In June 2022, the patient developed edema in both lower limbs, followed by chest tightness, abdominal distension, fatigue, and fever. Laboratory findings revealed proteinuria and hypoproteinemia. Before hospital admission, a thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hydrothorax, ascites, and pelvic effusion, no abnormalities were observed in the lungs or pancreas. She was then admitted to our department for consultation. Upon ophthalmic examination, both eyelids appeared erythematous, edematous, and notably protruded without associated pain (Fig. 1 A). Ocular movements were unrestricted in all directions. Visual acuity in both eyes was normal with best-corrected measurements. On palpation, a painless, firm, non-movable mass with indistinct borders was found extending into the orbit from beneath the bilateral temporal orbital rims. Intraocular pressures are normal in both eyes. No abnormalities such as choroidal folds were detected during fundus examination. The patient presented with multiple small, enlarged lymph nodes across the body and a palpable splenomegaly below the left costal margin. Respiratory sounds were diminished in both lower lung fields. The abdomen was distended, exhibiting shifting dullness and a fluid thrill, indicative of ascites. Significant edema was also noted in both lower limbs. Cardiac and neurological examinations revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory investigations are detailed in Tables 1 and Supplementary Table 1, with notable abnormalities including hemoglobin (HGB) at 8.2 g/dl, platelet (PLT) count at 26 × 10⁹/L, positive urine occult blood, urine protein at 1.42 g/24 h, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at 54.0 mm/h, C-reactive protein (CRP) at 17.62 mg/l, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) over 1000 pg/ml, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) at 700.06 pg/ml, serum ferritin at 97.60 ng/ml, creatinine at 92.6 umol/l, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 13.7 mmol/l, albumin at 23.8 g/L and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 445 U/L. No malignant cell was discovered in pleural and abdominal effusion. The orbital CT revealed bilateral lateral orbital masses, suggestive of lymphoma (Fig. 2 A&B). MRI results show lesions located anterolaterally and outside the muscle cone in the areas of the bilateral lacrimal glands, no abnormalities were observed in the sinus (Fig. 2 C-E). The bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Flow cytometry analysis was normal. Left cervical lymph node biopsy indicated mixed-type CD with 'lollipop' vascular formations in the germinal centers and extensive plasma cell infiltration, positive for CD10, CD23, CD38, and CD138 (Fig. 3 A-F). The intraocular mass on the left side was surgically removed and ocular histopathology revealed fibrous tissue hyperplasia and preserved lacrymal gland lobules with extensive lymphocyte infiltration expressing CD20, CD38, and CD138, suggestive of mixed-type CD (Fig. 4 4 A-F). IgG4 + plasma cell was 42 per high power field (HPF) and IgG4 plasma cell was 52 per HPF. Storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis were not observed (Supplementary Fig. 1 A&B). A renal biopsy revealed classical CD with manifestations of diffuse thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), characterized by thickened glomerular basement membranes and double contours. No immune complex deposits were found. The diagnosis of iMCD-TAFRO syndrome was made based on the patient's clinical manifestations, laboratory and imaging examinations, and pathology. After three cycles of chemotherapy with the COP regimen (cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m², prednisone at 60 mg/day, and vindesine at 4 mg, administered every 21 days), The patient responded well to the treatment, showing improvement in general condition, increased platelet count, reduced urine protein, and decreased pleural effusion and ascites. Additionally, the lower limb edema resolved, and symptoms of eye redness and swelling subsided (Fig. 1 B). During the follow-up visit, the swelling and redness had completely resolved, with no abnormalities noted (Fig. 1 C). Unfortunately, before the start of the fourth cycle, the previously shrinking cervical lymph nodes increased in size again. A dose of 375 mg/m² of Rituximab (day 0) was then added to the COP regimen. The patient's cervical lymph nodes rapidly decreased in size. After three courses of R-COP chemotherapy, the patient achieved CR. As of the last follow-up on December 20, 2024, after a follow-up duration of 30 months, the patient has remained in CR and continues under regular follow-up.

B. Bilateral leg edema – Incorrect. IVLBCL is associated with diffuse, anasarca-like edema of the face, body, and abdomen.
C. Violaceous papules and plaques on the oral mucosa – Incorrect. Violaceous spots of the oral mucosa are most closely associated with Kaposi sarcoma.
D. Purpuric papules and pustules with associated ulcerations – Incorrect. Purpuric papules and pustules with ulcerations are most closely associated with vasculitis.
E. Nodules and plaques on the trunk or limbs – Correct. Forty percent of patients with IVLBCL present with cutaneous features, and of those patients, 49% present with nodules and plaques of the trunk and limbs. Other cutaneous findings can include cellulitis, ulcerated nodules, telangiectasia, and erythematous eruptions.

### Large B-cell lymphoma of the leg: clinical and pathologic characteristics in a north American series [^1139VksK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) of the leg is an uncommon subset of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma that has been described in a series of European patients.

Objective

Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical manifestation, diagnostic histopathology, immunophenotype, clinical course, and response to treatment of LBCL of the leg.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective case series of 3 patients with primary LBCL of the leg.

Results

The 3 elderly patients presented with progressive erythematous nodules on bilateral or unilateral lower extremities. All 3 patients had pre-existing peripheral edema or peripheral vascular disease. Histopathologic examination of the nodules showed dense lymphocytic infiltrates composed predominantly of large dysplastic lymphocytes that marked as B cells (CD20(+)). In 2 cases, the neoplastic cells were BCL-2 positive. All patients responded to initial therapy with localized electron beam radiation and chemotherapy but had disease progression. One patient had a complete and durable second response to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab).

Conclusions

The patients described have similar clinical and histopathologic features to those previously described. There may be an association between LBCL and pre-existing lower-extremity vascular disease. Treatment of LBCL is difficult, but 1 patient responded well to systemic anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody.

### A case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type presenting as lower extremity edema and ulcers [^117Di6Rm]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is a rare malignancy, originally described as a separate entity in a 2005 classification of cutaneous lymphomas. It most commonly occurs on the lower extremities in elderly women, accounts for 20% of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas and is the most aggressive subtype. Survival rates are 70% with optimal therapy, although > 50% of patients experience disease relapse. Clinically, it typically presents with infiltrative papules, plaques, or nodules on the legs; ulceration, is less common, and can clinically mimic common vascular ulcers. Diagnosis relies on skin biopsy with histologic findings of reticular dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and confluent sheets of atypical lymphocytes (centroblasts and immunoblasts positive for CD20, CD79a, BCL-2, and MUM-1).

### Primary hepatic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: case report and review of the literature [^114x5ns9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

A 31-yr-old man presented with a 1-wk history of fever, chills, weakness, headaches, and a significant 20-lb weight loss over the preceding 2 months. His past medical history was relevant for liver amebiasis during childhood. Two days before admission, the patient noticed jaundice. He denied abdominal pain or other GI symptoms, and there was no history of alcohol intake, medications, or illicit drugs. His physical examination revealed generalized jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and bilateral leg edema. Neurologically, the patient was agitated, with periods of disorientation, and he had bilateral flapping. His blood tests revealed pancytopenia, renal failure, liver failure, and coagulopathy. Because the patient had a fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia, a further workup also included a bone marrow and liver biopsy. No conclusive diagnosis could be made from the above tests, and the patient died 5 days after admission. Postmortem evaluation, including flow cytometry and gene rearrangement in the tissue obtained from the liver, revealed large B cell lymphoma. This case illustrates an unusual presentation of hepatic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Current information regarding this entity is scant, mainly owing to its rarity. We present a review of the literature, including the incidence, presentation, treatment, and prognosis of primary hepatic lymphoma.

### Hyper-IgG4 disease: report and characterisation of a new disease [^114teRwf]. BMC Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

RPF is probably the most common example of the conditions associated with raised serum IgG4 and an IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrate, which we call hyper-IgG4 diseases. The other most frequently recognised associations are sclerosing pancreatitis, Reidel's thyroiditis, retro-orbital tumour, panniculitis, and sclerosing cholangitis (see Table 2 for synonyms).

It is known that RPF can be associated with a similar fibrotic process in other organs, particularly adjacent tissues such as the mediastinum and pleura. Patients with RPF can have systemic symptoms and be febrile. We used RPF and our knowledge of its aetiology and pathogenesis to review the potential mechanisms of IgG4 disease.

Retroperitoneal disease

Idiopathic RPF generally presents in a non-specific manner with malaise, fatigue, fever and weight loss. Pain in the back (lumbosacral) region, flank or lower abdomen is most common. The pathognomonic feature of RPF is a thick retroperitoneal fibrotic mass covering the abdominal aorta and compressing the ureters. The process of fibrosis can result in obstruction of the ureters and renal failure, or signs and symptoms may be related to the encasement or entrapment of other structures by the inflammatory mass, such as hydrocoeles or unilateral leg oedema. With renal involvement, severe hypertension is common.

The disease presents typically between the ages of 50 and 70 years, and men are affected 2–3 times more commonly than women. The inflammatory nature of idiopathic RPF is demonstrated by elevated ESR and CRP, reduced haemoglobin and elevated gammaglobulins at presentation. An autoimmune nature is suggested by the finding of ANA in 10–20% of cases, an occasional association with different autoimmune diseases and good response to glucocorticosteroids. In one series of RPF associated with periaortitis, 10 of 16 patients were ANA-positive.

Although there are no randomised studies of treatment for RPF, patients who present during the acute inflammatory phase respond quickly to glucocorticosteroids. Patients with late presentation and dense fibrosis will not respond to medical treatment and surgery is often necessary.

Causes and associations

RPF has many causes, although in about 70% of cases the cause is unknown (idiopathic). The rest (secondary) develop as a result of malignant disease, radiation therapy, abdominal surgery, pancreatitis, retroperitoneal haemorrhage, urine extravasation, and infections. Carcinoid syndrome can cause systemic fibrosis, and RPF has been described without metastatic tumour.

### Bilateral lower limbs swelling as uncommon manifestation of primary congenital lymphoedema: navigating diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in resource-limited ende, Indonesia [^1114JnQf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Table 2
Differential diagnosis of lower limbs swelling

Although the diagnosis of primary lymphoedema can be confirmed clinically and with a complete history, several examinations are still needed to rule out the cause of oedema in this case. Venous Doppler ultrasonography is necessary to exclude obstructions, such as thrombosis, and to identify avalvular venous insufficiency. A complete laboratory examination was performed to determine the presence of hypoalbuminaemia and proteinuria. Abdominal-pelvic CT was performed to exclude the possibility of secondary lymphoedema caused by the mass. Lymphoscintigraphy was the gold standard for confirming primary lymphoedema. In the event that no tumours or other disorders are discovered in the patient's soft tissues or bones, lymphoedema is the diagnosis. To properly diagnose the patient, more tests can be carried out if the results do not indicate lymphoedema (figure 3). However, lymphoscintigraphy is not readily available for this purpose. CT is a widely available and easy to perform imaging tomography. MSCT is a more sophisticated CT. Because it uses several detectors, slices that are both thick and thin can be created. This implies that multiple slices can have data captured simultaneously and obtained in a shorter time. In this case, we performed a complete blood count, biochemical profile, urinalysis, baby gram X-ray and MSCT to rule out the possibility of lymphoedema secondary to a specific underlying disease. The laboratory examination results were normal. We did not perform venous Doppler ultrasound or lymphoscintigraphy in our hospital because of the limited resources available in Ende. Based on this examination, we concluded that the findings were suggestive of PCL after excluding the possibility of a secondary cause of lymphoedema in this patient.

### CT imaging findings of abdominopelvic vascular compression syndromes: what the radiologist needs to know [^1126NdVG]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

May-Thurner syndrome

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS), also described with the eponymous of "Cockett syndrome", refers to the chronic compression of the left common iliac vein between the overlying right common iliac artery, anteriorly, and the fifth lumbar vertebra, posteriorly (Fig. 8). Variants of MTS include the right common iliac vein compression by the right common iliac artery or the left iliac vein compressed by the left common iliac artery. MTS is mainly discovered in women between the 2nd and 4th decades of life. The exact prevalence of MTS is unknown, but it is assessed to occur in 2–5% of patients presenting with lower extremity venous disorders.

Fig. 8
Drawing illustrating the coronal and axial views of May-Thurner syndrome

MTS can lead to chronic venous stasis, determining left iliac and femoral veins thrombosis, clinically manifesting with unilateral left lower extremity swelling, edema, varicose veins, venous ulcers, and other potential severe complications, like acute pulmonary embolism or phlegmasia cerulea dolens. This latter is characterized by blue and painful leg, due to massive deep venous thrombosis combined with arterial occlusion determined by concomitant compartment syndrome. Although venous obstruction is commonly caused by extrinsic factors (physical compression of the left common iliac vein), it could also be secondary to intrinsic factors, particularly to endothelial damage due to chronic pulsatile force of the overlying right common iliac artery.

Doppler ultrasound may depict the presence of deep venous thrombosis of the left lower limb. As opposed, left iliac vein thrombosis may be challenging to diagnose because this vessel lies deep in the pelvis and may be concealed by gas-filled intestinal loops. Additional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT should be required in the case of suspected MTS. Contrast-enhanced CT images acquired after the intravenous administration of contrast agent on venous and delayed phases are often sufficient to visualize the iliac vein compression and adjacent deep vein thrombosis (Fig. 9). Moreover, CT helps to exclude other conditions such as pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy compressing the left iliac vein or inferior vena cava. Ascending femoral or iliac venography may be performed to confirm the diagnosis in most difficult cases and to measure the pressure gradients, although this is an invasive procedure.

### Acute upper extremity edema in a 10-year-old girl as presenting symptom of a rare cancer [^112FTtEb]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute onset upper extremity edema can pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency physician, with conditions ranging from mild local allergic reactions to deep venous thrombosis to underlying life threatening conditions. We discuss a case of a 10-year-old female with upper extremity edema and the diagnostic considerations, which ultimately led to uncovering a malignant etiology. This case represents a rare presentation of her underlying diagnosis, anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

### The inferior vena cava: anatomical variants and acquired pathologies [^115FFUXU]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 22
IVC bland thrombosis. a A 20-year-old woman presented with an oedematous left leg and lower back pain in the context of smoking, regular oral contraceptive use and previous DVT. Contrast-enhanced coronal CT shows a non-enhancing filling defect in the infrarenal cava (arrowhead) that propagates into bilateral common iliac veins (arrows). Mild intra-abdominal fat stranding is likely secondary to thrombosis-related oedema. Thrombophilia screen was negative, and there was no evidence of malignancy or venous compression on a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. b A 75-year-old woman presented with a left above knee DVT on a background of cholangiocarcinoma with metastases to the liver and left adnexa. Contrast-enhanced coronal CT demonstrates a partially occlusive non-enhancing inferior vena cava thrombus (asterisk) extending superiorly to the level of the left renal vein (arrowhead), and to the right common iliac vein (arrow) caudally

Clinical presentation depends on acuity and extent of thrombosis and may vary from incidental detection on imaging, to non-specific back pain preceding symptoms of lower limb venous insufficiency, to cardiopulmonary compromise. If untreated, up to 90% of patients may develop post-thrombotic syndrome, while 45% can develop severe venous claudication. In contrast to tumour thrombus, bland thrombus does not enhance and lacks both luminal expansion and contiguity with the mass. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment, and a subset of patients with acute and subacute thrombus may benefit from catheter-directed thrombolysis with or without angioplasty and stenting.

### A case of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma leg type presenting as lower extremity edema and ulcers [^1142ffxB]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
Lower portion of the left leg with scattered, multifocal superficial ulcerations, cobblestoning, and nodularity on a background of tender erythema and 3+ pitting edema to the thigh. Similar, although significantly diminished, findings were seen in the right leg.

Ultrasonography of the lower extremities demonstrated a nonvascular, poorly demarcated, hypoechoic mass present in the left calf, consistent with a fluid collection. CT angiography of the leg demonstrated: diffuse intramuscular edema with smaller muscular enlargement in the anterior, deep, and lateral compartments, and diffuse atherosclerotic disease throughout the lower extremities with severe calcification of both posterior tibial arteries.

The patient was seen in consultation by the Orthopedic, Vascular Surgery, and Infectious Disease services who believed his presentation was not consistent with compartment syndrome, surgically intervenable peripheral arterial disease or infectious myositis. Given the clinical appearance of lymphedema and pitting edema, the Dermatology service believed that wounds were most consistent with ulceration due to venous and lymphatic insufficiency. Recommendations for wound care, compression and close clinical follow-up were made.

Upon outpatient evaluation, the patient had endorsed no improvement in pain or appearance of the wounds. A diagnostic skin biopsy was performed demonstrating primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (Figs 2 and 3) with supportive immunohistochemistry demonstrating CD20 and BCL-2 positivity(Fig 4), whereas negative for MUM-1, BCL-6, CD10, and CD138. At the time of diagnosis, initial positron emission tomography-CT staging scans were negative for distant disease. The patient underwent 3 cycles of rituximab, cyclophosmamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), oncovin (vincristine), prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy. Repeat staging scans unfortunately demonstrated widespread, treatment-refractory metastasis. The patient withdrew from further care, passing away shortly thereafter.

### Iliocaval and iliofemoral venous stenting for obstruction secondary to tumor compression [^115ich3L]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Neoplastic pelvic and abdominal masses can compromise the lower extremity venous drainage in multiple ways. The mere presence of malignancy increases the risk of venous thrombosis due to associated hypercoagulable state. Extrinsic vessel compression or invasion by pelviabdominal masses is another important contributor, which sometimes is associated with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) or iliofemoral venous compression in those situations can present with symptoms of lower limb venous congestion including swelling, pain, ulcer, skin hyperpigmentation, varicosities, and venous claudication, which can greatly affect quality of life Other factors contributing to the lower limb symptoms in this patient population include lymphedema following surgery or radiotherapy, liver compromise and heart failure. Metastatic lymphadenopathy associated with some pelviabdominal masses can also contribute to lower extremity lymphedema.

Endovascular venous reconstruction has proven efficacy in decreasing patients' lower limb venous congestion symptoms through restoring outflow. Since the advent of dedicated venous stents and thrombectomy devices data about venous stenting in this population of venous compression by neoplastic masses is limited to case reports and series.

In this retrospective study we evaluated the safety, technical success and clinical outcomes of IVC, Iliocaval and/or iliofemoral venous stenting in the treatment of venous obstruction caused by abdominal and pelvic tumor compression in addition to identifying anatomic and procedural factors influencing clinical success.

Report

A 74-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of a red, hot swollen lower portion of the right leg without any systemic upset or biochemistry abnormality. She received 5 courses of antibiotics for presumed cellulitis without improvement.

Her past medical history included right knee and hip replacements, previous trauma to the right leg after road traffic accident that required complex reconstruction and was complicated with right leg cellulitis. Additionally, 22 years ago, she was treated for localized DLBCL on the forehead, which achieved remission with 3 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Based on clinical findings of chronic venous insufficiency changes over both lower portion of the legs, she was managed for acute lipodermatosclerosis (Fig 1).

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^11534jRC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

PIL diagnosis is usually made by endoscopic, and histopathologic findings of the small intestines, showing the typical dilated lymphatic vessels in the lamina propria and submucosa. Limb lymphatic vessels can be examined by various radiographic techniques, which can aid in the diagnosis, and to rule out secondary causes of limb lymphedema or chylous effusions. Examples include lymphoscintigraphy, lymphangiography, and magnetic resonance lymphangiography.

Treatment focuses mainly on dietary modification. dietary fat induces dilation of lymphatics even in the normal intestines. Therefore, avoidance of fat decreases excessive dilation and risk of rupture in lymphangiectasia. High MCT containing formulas, and fat restriction along with high protein diet are the cornerstones of treatment for infants, and older children respectively. MCTs are absorbed directly into the portal venous circulation and do not require lymphatic flow for absorption. Octreotide use for the treatment of chylous effusions has been described in the literature. Its effect on the intestines is unclear, but it is hypothesized that it decreases triglycerides absorption, and induces splanchnic vasoconstriction. Albumin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusions are frequently indicated as replacement therapies, depending on the levels and clinical scenarios. Other treatment measures include managing any nutritional deficiencies, specifically fat-soluble vitamins.

The most serious but rare long-term complication reported in PIL is intestinal B cell lymphoma. Other complications include nutritional deficiencies, lower extremity cellulitis, and the effects of chronic foot swelling on quality of life.

In conclusion, PIL is a rare disorder that typically presents with protein-losing enteropathy, diarrhea, and bilateral lower limb edema. Nonetheless, unilateral lower limb edema (non-pitting more so than pitting) should not preclude the diagnosis of a systemic disorder, and a high index of suspicion is required in atypical presentations. A good knowledge about PIL, and physical examination skills to differentiate edema or lymphedema from tissue overgrowth can significantly aid in the diagnosis. PIL responds well to dietary modification, but needs long-term monitoring into adulthood, for potentially serious complications.

### A middle-aged woman with hematochezia, hypotension, and leg cramps [^111bMWfG]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old woman with a history of mantle cell lymphoma presented to the ED with complaints of vomiting, bleeding per rectum, and leg cramps, that started 6 h prior to her arrival. She had received chemotherapy a week prior. Her leg cramps were not associated with pain or swelling of the legs; she also denied any trauma to the legs. She did complain of mild lower abdominal pain at presentation. Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, diarrhea, chest pain, and dizziness. She denied using alcohol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient was tachycardic with a systolic BP (SBP) of 85 mm Hg and was administered 1-L normal saline, with improvement in her SBP to 90 mm Hg. The hematocrit level was 24%, the WBC count was 0.3 × 10⁹/L, and the platelet count was 6 × 10⁹/L in the ED. On arrival in the ICU, she was noted to have an SBP of 70 mm Hg. Resuscitation with IV fluids was initiated, followed by transfusion of packed RBCs and platelets, based on the blood counts. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and improvement in her hemoglobin, the patient remained persistently hypotensive. The diagnosis of underlying septic shock because of neutropenia was considered; the patient was started on vasopressors and empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics, with improvement in her BP. After this, the patient was sent to radiology for a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast to evaluate for mesenteric infarction, enteric or colonic bleeding, and the need for arterial embolization.

A 37-year-old woman from Puerto Rico presented to our clinic with symptoms of an abdominal distension progressively worsening over 1year. A CT of an abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed and revealed bilateral large heterogeneous pelvic adnexal masses with large ascites and right pleural effusion. Tumour markers CA 125 was 766U/mL and lactate dehydrogenase was 654U/L. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection and partial omentectomy. Pathology of ovarian masses revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The staging work-up was negative, which pointed towards the diagnosis of primary ovarian lymphoma. The patient completed 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone chemotherapy. After 18months of chemotherapy completion, she remains in remission.

### Cutaneous extranodal natural killer / T-cell lymphoma mimicking cellulitis: a unique presentation [^1156fMxB]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Laboratory tests showed mild lymphocytopenia, moderate anemia, elevated creatinine protein kinase, elevated aldolase, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Peripheral blood flow cytometry did not show significant immunophenotypic abnormalities. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the leg revealed myositis of the gastrocnemius muscle, extensive subcutaneous and superficial myofascial edema, and popliteal lymphadenopathy without lymphatic obstruction. The patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone for high suspicion of cellulitis and pyomyositis.

A punch biopsy of the skin from the lower portion of the leg showed a sparse perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of enlarged atypical mononuclear cells in the reticular dermis and subcutis, not consistent with cellulitis. Given the findings of a gastrocnemius muscle biopsy flow cytometry performed just prior, which demonstrated 10% natural killer cells expressing CD2, CD3, CD7, CD56, as well as EBV, similar staining was performed on the skin. EBV-encoded RNA was detected by in situ hybridization (Fig 2, A), and immunohistochemical stains were CD 56 + (Fig 2, B) and cytoplasmic CD3 +. Cytotoxic markers TIA-1 and granzyme B were diffusely positive. Bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal examinations were negative. A retroperitoneal mass core needle biopsy showed a similar population of neoplastic cells with Ki-67 immunostain, demonstrating a high proliferative activity of 70%-80%. There was no evidence of lymphoma cells in bone marrow biopsy. Polymerase chain reaction identified EBV DNA in the blood, with a viral load of 600,000 copies/mL. Fiberoptic rhinoscopy did not show a neoplasm of the nasopharynx. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography identified hypermetabolic tissue centered around the left para-aortic space and bilateral adrenal masses; no nasal lesions were found. Based on these findings, stage IV (both the tumor-node-metastasis staging system and the Ann Arbor staging system) extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type was diagnosed. The patient was started on 6 cycles of modified chemotherapy regimen (dexamethasone, ifosfamide, etoposide, and pegaspargase), with the ultimate plan of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

### Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis presenting with recurrent bilateral uveitis [^111CwCyq]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Patients with recurrent uveitis are often evaluated for the presence of underlying systemic disease. The authors describe a 55-year-old black female who presented with isolated recurrent anterior uveitis. Laboratory evaluations were notable for elevated inflammatory markers. She subsequently developed left lower extremity painless swelling; ultrasound evaluation was negative for deep venous thrombosis. CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis demonstrated multiple amorphous soft tissue densities throughout the small bowel mesentery and retroperitoneum, associated with left-sided hydronephrosis. Histopathology of a retroperitoneal mass demonstrated retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF). Treatment with systemic corticosteroids led to shrinkage of her mesenteric and retroperitoneal masses, resolution of uveitis and normalisation of inflammatory markers. Albeit rare, RPF should be considered in the diagnostic investigation of patients with recurrent uveitis, especially those with abdominopelvic or lower extremity complaints.

### Severe hypocalcaemia as a cause of seemingly idiopathic bilateral lower limb oedema [^113BxCcm]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

The existing scientific literature has not drawn a link between severe hypocalcaemia and its role in recalcitrant peripheral oedema. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in oncological and geriatric medicine as bone strengthening but serum calcium-lowering agents such as bisphosphonates and denosumab are used for osteoporosis and/or bone metastasis. This case report, through metastatic prostate cancer in a 66-year-old man with bone metastasis being treated with a monoclonal antibody denosumab, proposes the mechanism of hypocalcaemic oedema as being akin to calcium deprivation such as those induced by calcium channel antagonism. It demonstrates the importance of calcium supplementation as a concurrent treatment while patients are on these osteoclast inhibiting agents.

### Diagnosis and treatment of secondary nephrotic syndrome with rash as the first symptom: a case report [^116gUFMe]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common type of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults, accounting for about 20–30% of cases. Although secondary to specific factors, the coexistence of MN and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has been scarcely reported in clinical literature.

Case presentation

A 59-year-old Chinese male was admitted to the hospital with a generalized pruritic rash with bilateral lower extremity edema, which did not improve significantly after symptomatic treatment. He had undergone renal biopsy, and the diagnosis was thought to be secondary MN (SMN), therefore, we did a lymph node biopsy on the patient and found that MN was complicated with MCL. Soon after, the patient was admitted to the hematology department for a BR chemotherapy regimen (composed of bendamustine 90 mg/m² BSA (body surface area), rituximab 375 mg/m² BSA and dexamethasone 5 mg), and during the post-treatment follow-up, both his symptoms and renal function improved.

Conclusions

The mechanism underlying the combination of SMN and MCL remains elusive and exceedingly rare, consequently often overlooked in clinical practice. This case serves to offer valuable clinical insights for diagnosis and treatment, while emphasizing the pivotal role of renal pathology in clinical assessment.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) uncommonly metastasises to the heart. We present a case of new onset bilateral leg swelling and suspected right heart failure in a previously fit and healthy man, which on further investigation revealed a new diagnosis of HCC with extension into the inferior vena cava and right atrium. This case highlights the importance of considering alternative possibilities when physical examination does not match the initial clinical diagnosis. The management approach was for best supportive care in view of extensive metastatic disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of secondary nephrotic syndrome with rash as the first symptom: a case report [^114vE1FK]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common type of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults, accounting for about 20–30% of cases. Although secondary to specific factors, the coexistence of MN and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has been scarcely reported in clinical literature.

Case Presentation

A 59-year-old Chinese male was admitted to the hospital with a generalized pruritic rash with bilateral lower extremity edema, which did not improve significantly after symptomatic treatment. He had undergone renal biopsy, and the diagnosis was thought to be secondary MN (SMN), therefore, we did a lymph node biopsy on the patient and found that MN was complicated with MCL. Soon after, the patient was admitted to the hematology department for a BR chemotherapy regimen (composed of bendamustine 90 mg/m 2 BSA (body surface area), rituximab 375 mg/m 2 BSA and dexamethasone 5 mg), and during the post-treatment follow-up, both his symptoms and renal function improved.

Conclusions

The mechanism underlying the combination of SMN and MCL remains elusive and exceedingly rare, consequently often overlooked in clinical practice. This case serves to offer valuable clinical insights for diagnosis and treatment, while emphasizing the pivotal role of renal pathology in clinical assessment.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114uqHqG]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

IgG4-related disease

Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in the setting IgG4-RD, being reported in 30–55% of cases. Swollen lymph nodes are usually painless, with a diameter of 1–3 cm, though they can grow as large as 5 cm. In this context, lymphadenopathy may become symptomatic due to compression of adjacent structures (e.g. hydronephrosis due to ureter compression, lower limbs oedema due to inferior vena cava or iliac vein compression). Lymphadenopathy is frequently generalized and the most commonly involved lymph node stations are mediastinal, axillary, intra-abdominal, cervical and inguinal. Lymphadenopathy can be documented in IgG4-RD in four main clinical contexts. First, enlarged lymph nodes are incidentally found in the excision specimen of extranodal tissue demonstrating IgG4-RD features. Second, lymphadenopathy may be documented incidentally with physical examination or imaging during the diagnostic workup of extranodal disease. Third, lymphadenopathy may arise weeks to years after diagnosis of extranodal disease. Fourth, generalized lymphadenopathy may be the first presenting symptom of IgG4-RD, weeks to years before extranodal disease appears. Recently, IgG4-RD has been arrayed into four clinical phenotypes, based on the observation of patterns of clinical presentation. These groups are: (group 1) pancreato-hepatobiliary disease (31% of patients), (group 2) retroperitoneum and aorta (24%), (group 3) head and neck–limited (24%) and (group 4) Mikulicz's syndrome with systemic involvement (22%). Lymphadenopathy is more frequently encountered in group 4, with 67% of frequency (second most common organ involved after submandibular gland). On the other hand, group 1 features the lowest frequency with 15%, while group 2 and 3 display lymphadenopathy in roughly 25% of cases. At the microscopic level, lymph nodes can express five types of histologic pattern, all characterized by increased accumulation of IgG4+ plasma cells and by a IgG4/IgG ratio > 40% at immunohistochemistry. Pattern 1 is highly reminiscent of the plasmacytic histopathological subtype of MCD and is characterized by intact nodal architecture with hyperplastic follicles as well as follicles with some degree of germinal centre regression and possible penetration by venules. The interfollicular space displays increased high endothelial venules and abundant plasma cells. Pattern 2 shows a typical reactive follicular hyperplasia, encountered in other autoimmune diseases such as SLE and RA. Pattern 3 is characterized by normal or variably regressed follicles with marked expansion of the interfollicular space. This area is filled by prominent high endothelial venules, immunoblasts, small lymphocytes plasma cells and eosinophils. Pattern 4 is notable for the presence of 'transformed' germinal centres, two to four times larger than those of background follicles, which become ameboid or stellate shaped. Their follicles display a thickened mantle zone with inward protrusions into germinal centres. Pattern 5, known as 'inflammatory pseudotumor-like', is the least common and is characterized by replacement of the nodal parenchyma by sclero-hyaline tissue. Collagen fibers in this context may organize into a storiform pattern similar to that observed in other organ involved by IgG4-RD. Importantly, histological patterns may not be fully discriminating and specimens may contain more than one pattern at a time (Fig. 1).

### Extrinsic arterial compression and lower extremity ischemia after iliac vein stent placement: case report, review of literature [^1144TMwQ]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 26-year-old with progressively enlarging spindle cell sarcoma of the right pelvis despite multiple rounds of systemic and radiation therapy developed deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to mass effect on the right iliac vein. This was treated with mechanical thrombectomy, inferior vena cava (IVC) and bilateral kissing common iliac vein stents, as well as initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. The patient responded well until approximately two months after the procedure, where he presented to the emergency department with 1 week of worsening lower extremity swelling and pain. Physical exam was notable for diffuse pitting edema of the right lower extremity. Although the swelling limited mobility, there were no focal motor or sensory deficits. The extremity was warm and well perfused with 2 + doppler signals from the popliteal, posterior tibialis, and dorsalis pedis arteries. The left lower extremity was normal.

### Cross-sectional imaging of extranodal involvement in abdominopelvic lymphoproliferative malignancies [^117CX4Vc]. Radiographics (2007). Low credibility.

Extranodal lymphoproliferative diseases are common, and their prevalence is increasing. Non-Hodgkin lymphomas and Hodgkin disease, in particular, frequently involve extranodal structures in the abdomen and pelvis, including both the solid organs (liver, spleen, kidneys, and pancreas) and the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Because virtually any abdominopelvic tissue may be involved, many different imaging manifestations are possible, and lymphoproliferative diseases may mimic other disorders. Familiarity with the imaging manifestations that are diagnostically specific for extranodal lymphoproliferative diseases is important because imaging plays an important role in the noninvasive management of disease. However, a definitive diagnosis requires a biopsy (of bone marrow, a lymph node, or a mass), a peripheral blood analysis, and other laboratory tests. In patients with known disease, the goals of imaging are staging, evaluation of response to therapy, and identification of new or recurrent disease or of complications of therapy. In patients without known disease, imaging permits a provisional diagnosis.

Cancer-related therapy (CRT) and lymphedema — The panel's support for a CRT–lymphedema association is drawn from the extensive breast cancer literature, and edema has been estimated to occur in 19% of people with advanced cancer. From a Western medical context, CRT remains the most prevalent cause of lymphedema, and when addressing an individual who will be treated for cancer, the subject of lymphedema risk should be addressed and, where appropriate, surveillance and risk-reduction measures should be undertaken.

Description

An 85-year-old patient was brought to the emergency department due to progressive weight loss and bed confinement over a period of 6 months. After recollecting a fully detailed medical history, the patient describes the growth of a gruelling mass on her right breast over the course of 1 year, with no mention of other concurrent symptoms such as fever or diaphoresis.

On her physical examination, there was an extremely emaciated patient with a performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 4, presenting with multiple subcutaneous nodules distributed mainly through her upper body, the largest in size being the one on her right breast already with evidence of tissue necrosis and coexisting right axillary lymphadenopathies (figure 1).

Figure 1

### Primary amyloidosis presenting with massive generalized lymphadenopathy [^113gscPe]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Systemic amyloidosis is an unusual cause of generalized massive lymphadenopathy. In such cases the clinical picture may mimic lymphoma. We report a case of generalized massive lymphadenopathy caused by amyloidosis. The 55-year old female patient was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea and edema in the lower extremities. These were diminished breath sounds with bilateral basal congestion hepatosplenomegaly and generalized massive lymphadenopathy in axillary, cervical, and inguinal areas. The diagnosis was made by excisional biopsy of one of the involved lymph nodes. Amyloidosis (AL type) was shown and treatment with melphalan and prednisone was initiated. Unfortunately the patient died after 51 days in hospital.

### Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as a pelvic mass with elevated CA-125 [^1174asFM]. Gynecologic Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

We report a case of pelvic lymphoma with an elevated serum CA-125 level, initially misdiagnosed as ovarian carcinoma. A review of the literature is presented and a possible mechanism for CA-125 elevation in diseases other than ovarian cancer is discussed.

Case

A 50-year-old woman presented with symptoms of progressive dyspnea, early satiety, fatigue, and weight loss. Workup revealed a pelvic mass and an elevated CA-125 level. Paclitaxel and carboplatin were administered to facilitate therapy and provide symptomatic relief for a presumed bulky ovarian carcinoma. A biopsy was obtained after the initiation of chemotherapy, yielding the diagnosis of diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, stage II-B. A regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone followed by radiotherapy resulted in long-term disease remission. A search of the literature revealed several clinical series describing the elevation of CA-125 in a variety of diseases, both benign and malignant.

Conclusions

In the setting of a newly diagnosed pelvic mass, care should be taken when interpreting an elevated CA-125 level. While ovarian cancer is high on the list of differential diagnoses, lymphoma cannot be excluded until a tissue diagnosis is obtained.

### Massive ovarian edema, due to adjacent appendicitis [^112cwpwe]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Massive ovarian edema is a benign clinical entity, the imaging findings of which can mimic an adnexal mass or ovarian torsion. In the setting of acute abdominal pain, identifying massive ovarian edema is a key in avoiding potential fertility-threatening surgery in young women. In addition, it is important to consider other contributing pathology when ovarian edema is secondary to another process. We present a case of a young woman presenting with subacute abdominal pain, whose initial workup revealed marked enlarged right ovary. Further imaging, diagnostic tests, and eventually diagnostic laparoscopy revealed that the ovarian enlargement was secondary to subacute appendicitis, rather than a primary adnexal process. We review the classic ultrasound and MRI imaging findings and pitfalls that relate to this diagnosis.

### Multimodality imaging of indolent B cell lymphoma from diagnosis to transformation: what every radiologist should know [^115277nd]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Progression

Differentiating progression of indolent lymphoma from TIL can be challenging, especially in the case of progression from low- to high-grade indolent lymphoma, as there is wide overlap between clinical, histologic, and molecular characteristics of progressed and transformed lymphoma. On imaging, these can be indistinguishable, with similar imaging characteristics, and histologic confirmation should be obtained to differentiate the two entities, whenever possible (Fig. 1).

Recurrence

Due to the high recurrence rate of indolent lymphomas, the possibility of recurrence of disease after initial response should be always considered when patients present with increased adenopathy or increased extranodal disease on restaging scans. To differentiate recurrence from HT, the clinical presentation can be helpful: elevated LDH, new B or systemic symptoms are most likely associated with HT. On imaging, diffuse mild increase in size of multiple lymph nodes, as well as areas with only mild increase in FDG-avidity, is most likely to be associated with recurrent indolent lymphoma.

Secondary malignancy

Patients with lymphoma are inherently at risk of secondary tumors due to the status of immunosuppression, and patients with history of cancer can develop lymphomas. Differentiating HT from tumor progression can be difficult, especially in cases of tumors which tend to metastasize to lymph nodes. Specific imaging features of the primary cancer, as well as concordance between primary tumor growth and nodal progression, or presence of new sites of metastasis, can be helpful to differentiate tumor progression from HT (Fig. 8).

### A case of rituximab-induced pyoderma gangrenosum [^1156gDdh]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

The dermatology department was consulted for diagnosis and discussion of ongoing management. Examination found large full-thickness ulcers covering 30% of the bilateral buttocks surface and vulvovaginal region (Fig 1). Multiple ulcers extended into subcutaneous tissue, and wound edges were overhanding with purple-grey discolouration compared with the unaffected skin. Histopathology derived from in-patient operative procedures was reviewed by an independent dermatopathologist. This report showed "extensive ulceration of the epidermis with underlying edema of the dermis and mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cells… slight undermining of the inflammation at the periphery of the ulcer is seen. The inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of neutrophils, lymphocytes and rare scattered multinucleated giant cells". The overall features were nonspecific; however, PG was favoured. The diagnosis of PG was made based on the cutaneous findings, review of histopathology, medical history including RA and large B-cell lymphoma, and the rapid onset of extensive ulcers that worsened with sharp debridement. Immediate management included prednisone, 1 mg/kg orally, and gentle wound care with particular avoidance of sharp debridement.

Fig 1
Initial visit to the dermatology office and before prednisone therapy. The figure depicts the patient lying on their left side with the upper body extending to the left and lower body to the right. Examination found large full-thickness ulcers covering 30% of the bilateral buttocks surface and vulvovaginal region with purple-grey discolored wound edges overhanding.

Two weeks later the patient was discharged from the hospital with significant improvement in cutaneous lesions. Three months after their first dose of prednisone, they returned to the dermatology clinic with almost complete healing of all ulcers. The prednisone was tapered over approximately 3 months, and sulfasalazine was initiated as a steroid-sparing agent given the history of RA and lymphoma. Recalcitrant small ulcers on the patient's buttocks were treated with intralesional triamcinolone injection to the active borders. Because of her excellent response to treatment, the patient subsequently underwent reversal of her loop ileostomy.

### Lymphedema: pathophysiology and clinical manifestations [^116gpPru]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a localized form of tissue swelling resulting from excessive retention of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial compartment and caused by impaired lymphatic drainage. Lymphedema is classified as primary or secondary. Primary lymphedema is caused by developmental lymphatic vascular anomalies. Secondary lymphedema is acquired and arises as a result of an underlying systemic disease, trauma, or surgery. We performed PubMed and Google Scholar searches of the English-language literature (1966–2017) using the terms lymphedema, cancer-related lymphedema, and lymphatic complications. Relevant publications were manually reviewed for additional resources. This progressive chronic disease has serious implications on patients' quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed because it mimics other conditions of extremity swelling. There is no definitive cure for lymphedema. However, with proper diagnosis and management, its progression and potential complications may be limited.

Pediatric aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas — clinical presentation includes painless regional or diffuse lymphadenopathy in the head/neck and inguinal region, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and B symptoms; extranodal involvement is common, and abdominal, intrathoracic, and head/neck masses produce location-specific symptoms. Central nervous system involvement can cause bladder or bowel dysfunction, lower extremity weakness, and/or headaches, and oncologic emergencies from rapid tumor growth such as tumor lysis syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, spinal cord compression, and respiratory distress due to airway compression may prompt initial presentation.

### Selumetinib side effects in children treated for plexiform neurofibromas: first case reports of peripheral edema and hair color change [^113p4CKH]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Cases presentation

The first case of peripheral edema occurred to a 7-year-old boy affected by a severe form of NF1, characterized by multiple inoperable plexiform neurofibromas in the neck, thorax, dorsum, and right leg. The masses caused compression of numerous organs and nerves, resulting in dysphagia, dyspnea, and chronic pain with inadequate response to analgesic medications. The boy also presented severe renovascular hypertension that led to two episodes of stroke, from which he gradually recovered. Based on his severe symptoms and poor quality of life, at the age of 5 selumetinib was started, with a significant shrinkage of the PNs after six months of therapy, and a remarkable and constant improvement in performance status. The maximum drug dosage was 25 mg/m² twice a day. After two years of treatment, in approximately three months, the boy slowly developed a unilateral swelling of the right leg. He did not complain of symptoms originating from the edematous area, nor developed any skin complications. Clinically, no other new abnormalities were found. For example, there was no evidence of palpable abdominal masses, and lymphadenopathy was not found. Ultrasonography demonstrated that the PN was in stable remission, and a doppler study showed no signs of deep venous thrombosis. Lymphoscintigraphy was normal as well. No masses were found on abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography. Routine blood laboratory tests did not reveal abnormalities. An echocardiogram also appeared normal. Therefore, since all possible causes of edema were excluded, the right leg's swelling was attributed to the drug itself. In consideration of the absence of symptoms and the drugs' remarkable benefits, we decided to continue the treatment with selumetinib, which is still daily taken by the patient. Peripheral edema is still present, but it has remained stable through the following months.

### Lymphedema [^116SzyMM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a set of pathologic conditions that are characterized by the regional accumulation of excessive amounts of interstitial protein-rich fluid. These occur as a result of an imbalance between the demand for lymphatic flow and the capacity of the lymphatic circulation. Lymphedema can result from either primary or acquired (secondary) disorders. In this review, the pathophysiology, classification, natural history, differential diagnosis, and treatment of lymphedema are discussed.

### Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-leg type masquerading as venous eczema [^115AwiPG]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-leg type (PCDLBCL-LT), is a rare high-grade form of primary cutaneous lymphoma. It often presents as red to violaceous nodules or plaques on lower limbs. We report a case of PCDLBCL-LT presenting initially as cellulitis. The skin changes did not respond to oral and intravenous antibiotics and management for venous eczema was subsequently commenced. The patient then developed 2 large deep subcutaneous masses and core biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of a mature high-grade B-cell lymphoma. Review of the patient's history revealed a prior diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma 22 years previously. This case demonstrates that PCDLBCL-LT can present with clinical signs in keeping with a diagnosis of cellulitis or venous eczema. In the context of progressive nodular skin changes biopsy should always be considered, particularly when the patient has a prior history of a hematologic malignancy.

### Current views on diagnostic approach and treatment of lymphedema [^112EEUW6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is a chronic, progressive, and often debilitating condition. Primary lymphedema is a lymphatic malformation developing during the later stage of lymphangiogenesis. Secondary lymphedema is the result of obstruction or disruption of the lymphatic system, which can occur as a consequence of tumors, surgery, trauma, infection, inflammation, and radiation therapy. In this review, we report an update upon the diagnostic approach and the medical and surgical therapy for both primary and secondary lymphedema.

### The effect of muscles in the treatment of lower limb lymphedema: respiratory muscles or leg muscles? [^111t5iX7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

This study demonstrated the effectiveness of CMT in addition to MLDB in reducing edema, improving gastrocnemius-soleus muscle strength, and enhancing QoL with a large effect size (ES), while functionality improved with a moderate ES. Notably, CMT was the most effective intervention for increasing gastrocnemius-soleus muscle strength compared to other treatment combinations in secondary LLL. Strengthening the calf muscles may enhance the efficiency of the muscle pump mechanism. Fukushima et al. reported that lower-limb volume significantly decreased after high-load active exercise combined with compression therapy compared to compression therapy alone. Their exercise program included cycling on a bicycle ergometer, which is known to stimulate the calf muscle pump mechanism. Similarly, Zhang et al. investigated resistance training of the lower limbs with an elastic bandage in a standing position for patients with LLL after pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical cancer. They found that resistance training effectively prevented lymphedema; however, the specific muscles targeted and the training protocol were not detailed. Katz et al. examined the effects of resistance exercises, including leg press, leg extension, leg curl, hip flexion, leg abduction, prone straight leg lifts, and calf raises, performed twice a week under supervision for two months, followed by three months of unsupervised training in patients with secondary LLL. They reported no clinically significant worsening in total leg volume. Although their study had a small sample size (n = 10), long-term resistance exercises for lower extremity muscles were effective in preventing edema. In the present study, the reduction in edema may have contributed to increased ankle mobility, improved calf muscle strength, and enhanced functional activities. These factors could facilitate venous return, indirectly stimulate lymphatic circulation, and ultimately help reduce edema.

### Treatment of edema [^115GytUr]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Edema is the result of an imbalance in the filtration system between the capillary and interstitial spaces. The kidneys play a key role in regulating extracellular fluid volume by adjusting sodium and water excretion. Major causes of edema include venous obstruction, increased capillary permeability, and increased plasma volume secondary to sodium and water retention. A systematic approach is warranted to determine the underlying diagnosis. Treatment includes sodium restriction, diuretic use, and appropriate management of the underlying disorder. Leg elevation may be helpful in some patients. Loop diuretics often are used alone or in combination. In patients with New York Heart Association class III and IV congestive heart failure, spironolactone has been found to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In patients with cirrhosis, ascites is treated with paracentesis and spironolactone. Dihydropyridine-induced edema can be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. Lymphedema occurs when a protein-rich fluid accumulates in the interstitium. Compression garments and range-of-motion exercises may be helpful in patients with this condition.

### Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated localized extremity edema and erythema [^115K3mqb]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BTK inhibitors are frequently associated with adverse cutaneous reactions. Ibrutinib can inhibit other kinases (Src, Tec, and epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), which can result in adverse reactions because of its off-target effects. An integrated safety analysis found peripheral edema in 22% of patients receiving BTK inhibitors, but these studies did not clinically characterize the presentation. Second generation BTK inhibitors may have fewer off-target effects. A randomized phase 3 trial showed that edema was reported at ≥ 10% higher incidence among patients on ibrutinib compared to zanubrutinib.

Most cutaneous adverse effects of BTK inhibitors can be treated without discontinuation of BTK inhibitor therapy, however, management of edema is challenging. The mechanisms that promote development of edema are unknown, but some have proposed a role for off-target inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which can inhibit lymphangiogenesis and may produce capillary leakage, or platelet derived growth factor receptors, which can decrease interstitial fluid pressure and increase capillary-to-interstitium transport. A prior report of localized extremity edema because of BTK inhibitor therapy found no significant improvement with dose reduction in one case and slight improvement after discontinuation in the second case. In our series, case 1 continued to experience worsening edema after discontinuation of ibrutinib, whereas the skin changes in case 2 were overall well tolerated and acalabrutinib was continued. This patient had progression of body surface area involvement, but the grade of the edema did not worsen. Also, although both patients had previously been on rituximab therapy, and studies do report its association with peripheral edema, typically early on in treatment, to our knowledge, rituximab has not been associated with localized peripheral edema resembling the cases here.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^111LxMc2]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite this great accuracy in detecting true negatives and positives, lymphoscintigraphy does have some drawbacks. First and foremost, lymphoscintigraphy has poor spatial resolution. This may not have a significant impact on its ability to detect the presence of lymphedema, but it does mean that lymphoscintigraphy cannot provide much anatomical information, placing limitations on how much information it can provide clinicians about the specific disease states of individual cases. Lymphoscintigraphy also lacks standardization, particularly regarding quantitative analysis of results. There are no "standardized" sets of drainage times or even acquisition time points by which clinicians can conclusively diagnose lymphedema. Instead, they largely rely on conducting bilateral lymphoscintigraphy, and compare drainage times and patterns between the suspected diseased and healthy limbs. This introduces another variable into the diagnosis process and can open the door to inconsistency in diagnosis from center to center and clinician to clinician. Lastly, although quantitative lymphoscintigraphy does allow for increased sensitivity relative to qualitative methods, lymphoscintigraphy images can still be "normal" for patients in very early stages of the disease process. This means that lymphoscintigraphy may be unable to detect lymphedema early enough, resulting in detection only when more extensive physiological abnormalities such as dermal backflow are manifested more thoroughly.

### Just the tip of the iceberg: difficulties in assessing and managing extreme obesity in routine clinical care [^1141RvmX]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

As obesity prevalence increases worldwide, healthcare professionals are often faced with challenging cases associated with massive obesity. A 33-year-old woman (weight 342kg, body mass index = 100kg/m²) presented with respiratory failure, limb edema and ascites. Abdominal CT scan became feasible after initial weight loss and showed a large pelvic mass in contact with the left ovary. The surgical removal performed despite a high-risk profile led to the diagnosis of a giant mucinous borderline tumor whose growth was due to delayed care and responsible for multiple severe complications: sepsis, anemia, esophagitis, constipation, anorexia due to mechanical compression, undernutrition, sarcopenia and lower limb edema contributing to a severe disability. After 7 months under specialized care, her weight decreased to 180kg, complications were treated and disability improved. This case, showing that, despite barriers, a multidisciplinary approach makes quality of care possible even in massively obese patients, is an educational example to reduce stigma.

### Sirolimus-associated lymphoedema: eight new cases and a proposed mechanism [^116LiA2Z]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Sirolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is increasingly used as an agent for post-transplant immunosuppression and the treatment of solid organ and haematological malignancies and hamartomas. Its advantages include a lack of nephrotoxicity and a lower incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers; adverse effects include delayed wound healing, increased lymphocoele formation and rarely lymphoedema. We report a series of eight cases of severe, sustained, unilateral and bilateral lymphoedema in patients receiving sirolimus for post-transplant immunosuppression, classify their lymphoscintigraphy findings and propose a mechanism of aetiology based on the interaction of mTOR with key mediators of lymphangiogenesis.

### COX2-related multicentric mixed-type Castleman's disease in a young man [^115SP32z]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Background

A 34-year-old male presented with a 5-month history of fatigue, anorexia, low fever, night sweats, and oliguria with edema of the eyelid, exacerbated by abdominal distension and mild diarrhea of 3 weeks duration. Physical examination showed positive signs of ascites, palpable spleen, slight abdominal tenderness and mild rebound tenderness in the lower abdomen, and edema of the lower limbs. Initial laboratory tests revealed abnormal liver biochemistry and increased protein concentration in the urine. Chest X-ray showed minimal pleural effusion in both sides of the thoracic cavity, and ultrasound detected moderate ascites, several small lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, and mild splenomegaly with widening of the splenic vein.

### FDG PET / CT findings in primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type [^113EWWcr]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old man presented with complaints of worsening left foot pain and swelling. MRI showed a soft tissue mass overlying the dorsolateral aspect of the left foot. Following a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), the left foot mass was biopsied and pathology indicated a diagnosis of primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PDLBCL, LT). Review of the PET/CT images demonstrated hypermetabolic activity associated with the left foot mass, multiple subcutaneous nodules/nodes, sclerotic osseous lesions in the lower extremities, and left external iliac/left inguinal lymphadenopathy. At the moment, the patient is undergoing chemotherapy.

### Current and developing lymphatic imaging approaches for elucidation of functional mechanisms and disease progression [^1138NWMt]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphoscintigraphy's status as the go-to imaging approach for lymphedema diagnosis has been well-earned due to its consistent accuracy in detecting lymphedema for decades. A 1988 study using lymphoscintigraphy to assess lymphatic function in a group of 238 patients demonstrated that qualitative analysis of the image alone allowed researchers to identify flow abnormalities in 70.1% of studied extremities and subsequent quantitative analysis allowed for identification in all extremities. Similarly, a 1989 study conducted by Gloviczki et al. in which the authors performed lymphoscintigraphy on 190 patients, found that semiquantitative evaluation of the lymphatics allowed them to detect lymphedema with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 100%. A more recent 2017 study with 227 patients found that lymphoscintigraphy had a 96% sensitivity and 100% specificity, reaffirming and marking a slight improvement on the historical trend. In 2018, a study used traditional lymphoscintigraphy to differentiate primary versus secondary lower extremity lymphedema after surgical lymphadenectomy. The retrospective analysis revealed that the appearance of lower limb lymphedema was not related to cancer therapeutic intervention but points to a primary lymphatic disease prior to treatment (Fig. 4 a).

### Intravascular lymphoma forming massive aortic tumors complicated with sarcoidosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis: a case report and literature review [^114inJHm]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

One month after his discharge, his left leg started to swell and his gait worsened. Urinary protein excretion was 0.6 g per day, serum creatinine was at the baseline level of 1.6 mg/dL, and serum albumin level was 3.8 g/dL. Although no coagulopathy was found, ultrasonography revealed left femoral vein thrombosis that was 41 mm long. Edoxaban was stopped, and heparin was administered intravenously for two weeks. Low mobility due to his gait was presumed to be the cause of development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient was switched to warfarin and was discharged, but the left leg edema persisted. Three months later, he developed complications of urinary retention and constipation.

Four months after discharge, the patient presented to the emergency department with sudden left leg pain and inability to walk. The entire left lower limb was slightly pale and had slow pitting edema. The left dorsal artery was not palpable, and the left femoral artery was barely palpable. Contrast CT revealed occlusion of the left femoral and superficial femoral arteries together with the known DVT in the left femoral vein (Fig. 1a, b). Emergency thrombectomy for acute arterial occlusion was performed and the leg perfusion resumed. The emboli (maximum of 23 mm in diameter) were sent for pathological examination. The patient was admitted to the hospital and started on heparin infusion in place of oral warfarin. The history of recent TIA implied hypercoagulable state, but again no coagulopathy was found. While malignancy screening was being planned, the pathology of the arterial emboli revealed an unusual and surprising finding: the surface of the thrombi was filled with large atypical lymphoid cells (Fig. 1c) and was covering the necrotic interior of the thrombi. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor cells on the surface and the necrotic interior of the thrombi were positive for CD20 and CD79a but negative for CD3 (Fig. 1d, e), which is characteristic of B cells. Leukocytosis was absent (white blood cell, 4,000/μL; segmented neutrophil, 55%; lymphocyte, 34%; monocyte, 9%; eosinophil, 2%). Serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor level was 1,548 U/mL (normal, 122–496 U/mL); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, 808 U/L (normal, 120–245 U/L); LDH-2 fraction, 39% (normal, 28–35%), and LDH-3 fraction, 32% (normal, 21–27%). These findings were consistent with large B-cell lymphoma with intravascular proliferation, but the etiology of the aortic thrombi was unclear.

### Unicentric or multicentric castleman disease? A case report of a pelvic intraperitoneal mass in a middle aged woman [^117MReSX]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Castleman Disease is a lymphoid disorder characterized by the presence of an enlarged or abnormal lymph node/lymphatic tissue. The disease is classified into unicentric or multicentric variants. The unicentric form is a benign disorder that is usually asymptomatic and consists of a single lymphoid mass that is predominantly located in the mediastinum, but can also rarely develop in the neck or abdomen. The multicentric type involves more than one lymphatic station and is related to the presence of type B symptoms (fevers, night sweats and weight loss), HIV/HHV8 infection and increased serum IL-6 levels. We present the case of an unusual pelvic intraperitoneal manifestation of Castleman Disease in a 52-year-old caucasian woman who showed clinical, radiological, histological and laboratory findings common to both Unicentric and Multicentric Castleman Disease.

### Diagnosis and treatment of a patient with kimura's disease associated with nephrotic syndrome and lymphadenopathy of the epitrochlear nodes [^114UQpBh]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 23-year-old Chinese man presented with edema in both legs and a mass in ulnar side of his right upper arm on August 8 th 2013. The patient reported that the edema had been present for 11 days and that the mass had been palpable for 3 years, and was first detected in October 2010. According to the patient's recollection, it had apparently increased in size since June 2013 with accompanying warmth of the overlying skin. The patient had not received any prior treatment for these conditions.

Before admission to our hospital, the patient developed worsened lower limb edema, abdominal distention, and oliguria. Two days later, an ultrasound examination revealed swollen lymph nodes in the medial aspect of his right upper arm, proximal to the elbow. Because the appearance of the swollen nodes was consistent with inflammation, the patient was prescribed cefprozil, which resulted in a reduction in the swelling.

The patient was admitted on August 19 th 2013 as a result of edema, severe proteinuria, and low serum albumin levels. Tender epitrochlear nodes that were poorly mobile were palpable in his right upper arm, with the largest being approximately 30 × 20 mm in size in physical examination. Hematology revealed a white blood cell count of 7.7 × 10⁹ cells/L, 48.5% eosinophils, and a platelet count of 172 × 10 9 platelets/L. Urinalysis revealed 4+ albuminuria and 2+ red blood cells per high power field. His 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 9,3g. A blood panel yielded the following results: total serum protein, 50.3 g/L; serum albumin, 16 g/L; serum cholesterol; 13.36 mmol/L; serum triglycerides, 1.85 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein, 2.32 mmol/L; and low-density lipoprotein level, 9.37 mmol/L. In immunological tests, IgE level was as high as 1,510 IU/ml (reference value 0–100 IU/ml), with normal C3, C4, IgG, IgA, and IgM (1.54g/L, 0.37g/L, 5.82g/L, 3.69g/L and 1.44g/L respectively).

### Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting as limb hemihyperplasia: a case report and literature review [^114vpJaJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is an exceedingly rare disorder. Epidemiology is unknown. It usually presents with lower extremity swelling, diarrhea, ascites, and protein-losing enteropathy. Since the pathogenesis of edema is usually due to hypoalbuminemia; both extremities are typically involved. The edema can rarely be due to abnormal lymphatic circulation, causing lymphedema, which usually involves both extremities as well. Diagnosis is made by the constellation of clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, and histological findings. Treatment involves dietary modification, to reduce lymphatic dilation in response to dietary fat. Other pharmacologic (e.g. octreotide) and replacement measures may be indicated as well. The most serious long-term complication is intestinal lymphoma. Herein is a case of Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia presenting with unilateral lower limb swelling.

Case presentation

A 4-year-old boy presents with left foot swelling since the age of 4 months, in addition to intermittent diarrhea, and abdominal swelling. The foot swelling had been evaluated by different health care professionals in the past, and was mislabeled as either cellulitis, or congenital hemihyperplasia. Physical examination revealed mild ascites, and a non-pitting foot edema with a positive Stemmer's sign (lymphedema). Blood work revealed hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2 g/dl), and hypogammaglobulinemia. Endoscopy showed dilated lacteals throughout the duodenum. Histopathologic examination revealed massively dilated lamina propria lymphatics in the duodenal biopsies. The patient was diagnosed with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia. He was treated with high-protein and low-fat diet, and supplemental formula high in medium chain triglycerides. On follow-up, the patient's diarrhea completely resolved, and his ascites and edema improved significantly.

Conclusions

The presence of unilateral lower limb edema should not preclude the diagnosis of systemic disorders, and a high index of suspicion is required in atypical presentations. A good knowledge about Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia manifestations, and physical examination skills to differentiate edema or lymphedema from tissue overgrowth can significantly aid in the diagnosis.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^116WKmaM]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

A warning is often given when pharmacokinetic data is interpreted into physiological terms, which is frequently warranted, due to tissue binding issues and drug metabolism. Volume kinetics provide functional volumes and rates for fluids and have long given reasonable estimates of plasma volumes and descriptions of physiological events. Currently, it is the best available method by which dynamic whole-body events related to fluid infusions can be understood.

Our data suggest that the rapidly equilibrating fluid pool correspond to the interstitial "free fluid phase" and likely to fluid in very close proximity to capillaries, and that the slowly equilibrating pool corresponds to the "gel phase" or interstitial space remote from capillaries or lymphatic. Our data further suggest that the interstitial free fluid phase normally occupies more volume than the 1% suggested by physiological studies, but the volume may also become very small, probably by compression, when the slowly equilibrating fluid phase swells.

### Progression of clinically stable lymphedema on lymphoscintigraphy [^116YfkKE]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Lymphedema is due to dysfunction in lymphatic transport, and is divided into primary and secondary subtypes. Primary lymphedema is a congenital lymphatic abnormality or dysfunction whereas secondary lymphedema is characterized by pathologic disruption or obstruction of a previously-normal lymphatic system. The stage of lymphedema is determined clinically. Lymphoscintigraphy, however, may be used to assess disease extent, for early detection of disease progression, and can be used to direct therapy. We report a case of a 56-year-old woman with clinically stable lymphedema of 5 years, yet with lymphoscintigraphy findings compatible with disease progression.

### The honeymoon is over… [^114j3nCZ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The importance of a broad differential diagnosis is highlighted by a complex patient case.

Case

A young woman returned from her honeymoon complaining of activity-limiting pain. The evaluation revealed multiple constitutional symptoms, a breast mass, a large pelvic mass, pulmonary abnormalities, an external iliac venous thrombosis, and lytic bone lesions. Biopsies from several sites revealed no evidence of neoplasia.

Conclusion

Consideration of potential etiologies outside of one's practice specialty may be necessary to make a correct diagnosis.

### A rare cause of chylothorax and lymph edema [^116q648s]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Chylothorax is a form of pleural effusion rarely caused by metastasis of solid tumors. Because chylothorax causes complaints by local compression of the lung, as well as weight loss resulting from loss of triglycerides, it needs thorough investigation. We present the case of gastric carcinoma presenting with a chylothorax and unilateral lymph edema. Although rare, the differential diagnosis of chylothorax should include gastric cancer even in the absence of upper abdominal complaints.

### MRI and MRA of a giant hydrocoele in an infant [^113ZLazq]. Pediatric Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

We present a 7-month-old boy with a giant abdominoscrotal hydrocoele associated with right leg oedema. US revealed an abdominoscrotal fluid-filled mass with a normal testis in the scrotum. MRI allowed precise delineation of the mass while MRA sequences showed extrinsic compression of the right iliac vein and its patency. Hydrocoelectomy and laparotomy were performed and confirmed the diagnosis. US followed by MRI are often necessary to diagnose and delineate giant hydrocoeles. MRA is a non-invasive elegant tool for the detection of vascular complications.

### Primary cardiac large B cell lymphoma [^111YTXae]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A female patient in her mid-60s presented with progressive shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain and bilateral leg swelling for 1week. Initial diagnostic workup revealed pericardial effusion, and a localised pericardial tubular mass on CT chest. Pericardial fluid analysis showed elevated white cells, with predominance of medium-large sized atypical lymphoid cells. Atypical lymphocytes stained positive for CD79a, CD10, PAX-5, BCL-2 and BCL6. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation testing demonstrated MYC and BCL6 rearrangements without BCL2 gene rearrangement. The overall morphological, immunohistochemical and cytogenetic findings supported a diagnosis of high-grade B cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL6 rearrangements. After extensive staging workup, localised disease involving the pericardium with a diagnosis of primary cardiac large B cell lymphoma was established. She was treated with dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and rituximab chemotherapy. Rituximab was discontinued owing to largely absent CD20 expression. Interim positron emission tomography-CT after three cycles revealed a complete response, and the patient completed six cycles of therapy.

### An unusual cause of ascites: castleman disease [^1175GbgY]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

CD is clinically divided into unicentric CD (UCD), which is characterised by an asymptomatic mass in patients with one area of lymphadenopathy, and multicentric CD (MCD), which is characterised by constitutional symptoms, multicentric lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, hypergamma globulinemia, and bone marrow plasmacytosis. The incidence of CD is very low. The estimated annual incidence of CD in the United States is 4300 to 5200. There are few epidemiological studies on CD. Male are slightly more often affected with MCD than female, but for UCD, there is no gender preference. The average age for diagnosis of UCD is usually younger (40 years) than MCD (60 years). The diagnostic criteria of MCD include major criteria and minor criteria. Major criteria (both required): (1) histopathologic lymph node, (2) enlarged lymph nodes in ≥ 2 lymph node stations. Minor criteria (need ≥ 2 of 11 with ≥ 1 laboratory criterion): (1) laboratory: elevated ESR or CRP, anemia, thrombocytopenia/tosis, renal dysfunction or proteinuria, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, (2) clinical: constitutional symptoms, large spleen and/or liver, fluid accumulation, eruptive cherry angiomata or violaceous papules, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. The typical pathological characteristics of CD are as follows: the mantle zone lymphocytes surrounding the follicles are arranged in concentric circles, showing a target-like shape. The broad, small and mature lymphocytes have concentrated chromatin with very little cytoplasm, presenting an onion-skin-like appearance. Usually, there may be radially penetrating sclerotic blood vessels that together with the amorphous follicles and concentric cloak areas impart a so-called "lollipop" appearance. The cases described in our article meet the two main criteria of lymph node pathology and multiple lymph node enlargement, and meet the elevated ESR, anemia, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, constitutional symptoms, large spleen, and fluid accumulation in minor criteria. So the final diagnosis of the patient is MCD. There may be multiple mechanisms for the formation of ascites in this patient: (1) The compression of swollen lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity and retroperitoneum leads to blockage of the lymphatic vessels and fluid leakage. (2) Hypoalbuminemia and abnormal renal function cause the decrease of plasma colloidal osmotic pressure and water and sodium retention. There is no uniform conclusion about whether ascites is exudate or leaking fluid in this type of disease.

Stage I or Stage II disease (contiguous) — initial therapy and follow-up: ISRT (24–30 Gy) is the preferred treatment option, with ISRT in combination with CD20-directed monoclonal antibody (mAb) with or without chemotherapy included as an alternate option; CD20-directed mAb with or without chemotherapy can be considered in selected patients with bulky intra-abdominal or mesenteric stage I disease, and active surveillance may be appropriate when potential toxicity of ISRT or systemic therapy outweighs potential clinical benefit. No further treatment is necessary for patients achieving CR or partial response (PR) to initial therapy, and clinical follow-up with a complete history and physical exam and laboratory assessment is recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first 5 years, and then annually (or as clinically indicated) thereafter; surveillance imaging with CT scans can be performed no more than every 6 months up to the first 2 years following completion of treatment, and then no more than annually thereafter. For disease not responding to initial ISRT, treatment should follow stage III or IV guidance; for disease not responding to initial CD20-directed mAb with or without chemotherapy, second-line or subsequent therapy should be used, and rebiopsy to rule out histologic transformation is recommended prior to the initiation of second-line or subsequent therapy.

### Recurrent chylous ascites in patient with previous retroperitoneal radiation treatment [^116h4L8T]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Chylous ascites is the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity due to disruption of lymphatic drainage caused due to obstruction or trauma. We report a man in his 60s who was previously treated for diffuse large B cell lymphoma with radiation to bulky abdominal/mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He was later found to have recurrent chylous ascites several years later, requiring multiple paracentesis. Recurrent lymphoma was ruled out with negative cytology of peritoneal fluid as well as lymph node biopsy with no evidence of malignancy. We believe that the patient had obstruction of lymphatic drainage due to previous radiation therapy causing fibrosis. The patient underwent lymphangiography which did not visualise the central lymphatic duct within the abdomen raising suspicion for obstruction of the ducts secondary to previous radiation.

### Acute inflammatory edema in the setting of bilateral lung transplantation [^111QAavB]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 55-year-old man with a history of Crohn's disease and end-stage interstitial lung disease was admitted for bilateral lung transplantation. His immediate postoperative course was complicated by thoracic compartment syndrome and allograft dysfunction requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and tracheostomy with continuous mechanical ventilation. The patient developed multiorgan complications including multidrug resistant pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, sacral osteomyelitis, and severe volume overload requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis. During the hospitalization, the patient had developed erythematous plaques involving the bilateral thighs. History could not be obtained from the patient due to his altered mentation. There was no apparent trigger to the development of this eruption and no new medications.

On exam, the patient was intubated, mechanically ventilated and frail appearing with a body mass index (BMI) of 16.4 kg/m². His blood pressure was 108/78 mmHg, and heart rate was 84 beats per minute. Skin examination was significant for erythematous, edematous plaques involving the bilateral thighs with extension to the abdominal pannus. These indurated plaques spared the inguinal and infra-abdominal folds and were firm to palpation without tenderness (Fig 1). Laboratory studies were notable for hypoalbuminemia of 3.4 g/dL (Normal: 3.5–5.2 g/dL) and leukopenia of 2600 cells/mm³ (Normal: 4–10,000 cells/mm³). The differential diagnosis included AIE, lipodermatosclerosis (LDS), and stasis dermatitis. A punch biopsy demonstrated superficial dermal edema along with a perivascular and interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrate (Fig 2). These findings along with the patient's clinical presentation were consistent with AIE. Recommendations for frequent repositioning, volume status correction, and increased mobility were made. Over the next few days, the patient continued to receive intermittent dialysis, and nursing staff worked on repositioning and mobility with the patient.

Abstractor Notes Patients may present with nodal or extranodal disease. The most common extranodal site is the gastrointestinal site. Other common sites of extranodal presentation include the bone, testes, spleen, Waldeyer ring, salivary glands, thyroid, liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands. Patients usually present with a rapidly enlarging tumor mass at single or multiple nodal or extranodal sites. Many patients are asymptomatic, but B symptoms may be present. Specific localizing symptoms may be present and are highly dependent on the site of extranodal involvement.

### Non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment-NCI-national cancer institute… [^1167xrmP]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

- Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that travels through the lymph vessels and carries lymphocytes. There are three types of lymphocytes:

- B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. Also called B cells. Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, B lymphocytes that are turning into plasma cells make large amounts of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M antibody. High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood plasma to thicken. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. Patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should be checked for hepatitis C virus infection. It is also called Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Marginal zone lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone.

This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have Helicobactergastritis or an autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjögren syndrome. Extragastric MALT lymphoma. Extragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, salivary glands, thyroid, lung, skin, and around the eye. This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease. Splenic marginal zone lymphoma. This type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only.

It can be a benign nodule that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment. Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also affected. Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may include fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. These are also called B symptoms. Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of fibrous lymph tissue. A tumor most often forms behind the breastbone. It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. This type of lymphoma is more aggressive.

Patients may have a lot of anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein inside the lymphoma cells. These patients have a better prognosis than patients who do not have extra ALK protein. Most cases of extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma have Epstein-Barr virus in the tumor cells. Sometimes hemophagocytic syndrome occurs. Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States. There may also be high levels of gamma globulin in the blood. Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes. This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus gland and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen.

### Physical examination… [^112DCCiR]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physical examination should be regionally directed by knowledge of the lymphatic drainage patterns and should include a complete lymphatic examination looking for generalized lymphadenopathy. Skin should be examined for unusual lesions that suggest malignancy and for traumatic lesions, which can be sites of infectious inoculation. Splenomegaly, while rarely associated with lymphadenopathy, focuses the differential on a limited number of disorders, most commonly infectious mononucleosis, 8 but also the lymphomas, the lymphocytic leukemias, and sarcoidosis. HEAD AND NECK LYMPHADENOPATHY Palpable cervical lymph nodes, which are commonly appreciable throughout childhood, were noted in 56 percent of adult physicals in one outpatient primary care study.

AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY Because the upper extremities that axillary lymph nodes drain are commonly exposed to local infection and injury, most axillary lymphadenopathy is nonspecific or reactive in etiology. Infectious sources of prolonged lymphadenopathy such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and mononucleosis rarely manifest with lymphadenopathy alone. 8 and persistent lymphadenopathy is less commonly found in the axillary nodes than in the inguinal chain. Breast adenocarcinoma often metastasizes initially to the anterior and central axillary nodes, which may be palpable before discovery of the primary tumor. Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas rarely manifest solely or initially in the axillary nodes. 17 although this can be the first region discovered by the patient. Antecubital or epitrochlear lymphadenopathy can suggest lymphoma, or melanoma of the extremity, which first metastasizes to the ipsilateral regional lymph nodes. 18, 19.

INGUINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY Inguinal lymphadenopathy is common, with nodes enlarged up to 1 to 2 cm in diameter in many healthy adults, particularly those who spend time barefoot outdoors. 19 Benign reactive lymphadenopathy and infection are the most common etiologies, and inguinal lymphadenopathy is of low suspicion for malignancy. Infrequently, Hodgkin's lymphomas first present in this area, 11, 17 as do non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Penile and vulvar squamous cell carcinomas, the lymphomas, and melanoma also can occur with lymphadenopathy in this area. When the overlying skin is involved, testicular carcinoma may lead to inguinal lymphadenopathy, 20 which is present in 58 percent of patients diagnosed with penile or urethral carcinoma. 21 In neither case is it the typical presenting finding.

GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as lymphadenopathy found in two or more distinct anatomic regions, is more likely than localized adenopathy to result from serious infections, autoimmune diseases, and disseminated malignancy. It usually merits specific testing. Common benign causes include adenoviral illness in children, mononucleosis, and some pharmaceuticals, and these can usually be identified with a careful history and examination. Generalized adenopathy infrequently occurs in patients with neoplasms, but it is occasionally seen in patients with leukemias and lymphomas, or advanced disseminated metastatic solid tumors. Hodgkin's lymphoma and most metastatic carcinomas typically progress through nodes in anatomic sequence.

### Hodgkin lymphoma treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^117NFT7f]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Anatomy HL most frequently presents in lymph node groups above the diaphragm and/or in mediastinal lymph nodes. Involvement of Waldeyer's ring or tonsillar lymph glands is rarely seen.

Risk factors for HL include:

- Being in early adulthood or late adulthood.
- Being male.
- Having a previous infection with the Epstein-Barr virus in the teenage years or early childhood.
- Having a first-degree relative with HL. Clinical Features These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by HL or by other conditions:

- Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, axilla, or inguinal area.
- Fever defined as 38ºC or higher.
- Drenching and recurrent night sweats.
- Weight loss of 10% or more of baseline weight in the previous 6 months.
- Pruritus, especially after bathing or after ingesting alcohol.
- Fatigue.
- Complete blood cell count and platelet count.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
- Chemistry panel plus lactate dehydrogenase, uric acid, and phosphorus.
- HIV testing.
- Hepatitis B and hepatitis C serology. All stages of HL can be subclassified into A and B categories: B for those with defined general symptoms and A for those without B symptoms. The B designation is given to patients with any of the following symptoms:

- Unexplained weight loss.
- Unexplained fever with temperatures above 38°C.
- Drenching and recurrent night sweats. The most significant B symptoms are fevers and weight loss. Night sweats alone do not confer an adverse prognosis.

The prognosis for a given patient depends on several factors. The most important factors include:

- Presence or absence of systemic B symptoms.
- Stage of disease.
- Presence of large masses.
- Quality and suitability of the treatment administered. Other important factors are:

- Age.
- Sex.
- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
- Hematocrit.
- Extent of abdominal involvement.
- Absolute number of nodal sites of involvement. Solid tumors An increase in second solid tumors has also been observed, especially mesothelioma and cancers of the lung, breast, thyroid, bone/soft tissue, stomach, esophagus, colon and rectum, uterine cervix, and head and neck. These tumors occur primarily after radiation therapy or with combined-modality treatment, and approximately 75% occur within radiation ports. The risk of developing a second solid tumor increases with time after treatment. Lung cancer and breast cancer are among the most-common second solid tumors that develop after therapy for HL.

In two case-control studies of 479 patients who developed breast cancer after therapy for HL, cumulative absolute risks for developing breast cancer were calculated as a function of radiation therapy dose and the use of chemotherapy. With a 30-year to 40-year follow-up, cumulative absolute risks of breast cancer with exposure to radiation range from 8. 5% to
39. 6%, depending on age at diagnosis. These cohort studies show a continued increase in cumulative excess risk of breast cancer beyond 20 years of follow-up.
- At 10 years after therapy with regimens containing MOPP, the risk of AML is approximately 3%, with the peak incidence occurring 5 to 9 years after therapy. The risk of acute leukemia at 10 years after therapy with ABVD appears to be less than 1%.
