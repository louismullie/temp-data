## Question

Silymarin and liver

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about silymarin and the liver, specifically its efficacy and safety across major liver diseases and how to apply the evidence in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the quality hierarchy of the available evidence. Then, I should examine disease-specific randomized controlled trials in hepatitis C, NASH/MASLD, alcoholic liver disease, and drug-induced liver injury prevention. Next, I will consider plausible mechanisms and bioavailability issues to avoid overinterpreting preclinical data. After that, I need to check safety and propose a rational monitoring framework without overextending analogies. Finally, I will synthesize recommendations and grade the strength of evidence, making sure I verify any ambiguities and correct them as needed [^113C6SxG] [^113zYH17].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scope so I don't jump to conclusions: the question encompasses whether silymarin improves clinically meaningful outcomes (enzymes, histology, fibrosis, virologic control, symptoms, survival) in chronic hepatitis C, MASLD/NASH, alcoholic liver disease, and whether it prevents drug-induced transaminitis, while also weighing safety and monitoring implications in real patients, which I will anchor primarily on higher-quality trials and guidelines to minimize bias from small or heterogeneous studies [^113zYH17] [^115ZnMU2] [^112ATVKS].

> I need to verify the evidence hierarchy before diving into diseases. High-credibility anchors include the JAMA 2012 multicenter RCT in interferon-refractory HCV, the randomized NASH trial in Clinical Gastroenterology & Hepatology, contemporary Cochrane syntheses for alcoholic and viral liver disease, and hepatology society guidance on DILI; mechanistic studies and small single-center trials are hypothesis-generating but should not override negative primary endpoints in larger RCTs, so I must keep that in mind to avoid overinterpretation [^113zYH17] [^113NMVTL] [^115ZnMU2] [^112ATVKS].

> Now, for chronic hepatitis C, I will examine the pivotal JAMA trial; it randomized 154 interferon-nonresponders to high-dose silymarin (420 mg or 700 mg three times daily) versus placebo for 24 weeks and found no difference in the primary outcome of ALT normalization or 50% reduction and no virologic benefit, indicating lack of clinical efficacy; older systematic reviews similarly show no improvement in histology or survival, so the totality of evidence argues against using silymarin for HCV, and I should be careful not to let in vitro antiviral findings sway clinical judgment here [^113zYH17] [^115ZnMU2] [^1131HN4Q].

> Wait, let me verify NASH data carefully because secondary signals can be misleading; the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 48-week trial in biopsy-proven NASH showed no significant improvement in the primary endpoint (≥ 30% NAS reduction) with silymarin 700 mg TID versus placebo, though a greater proportion of fibrosis reduction was reported in the silymarin arm, which could represent a real antifibrotic signal or a type I error due to multiple testing; broader MASLD reviews remain cautious, and open-label prediabetes NAFLD studies show within-group improvements with lifestyle but no between-group advantage for silymarin on liver stiffness or enzymes, so I should not infer a standard-of-care role from these exploratory or negative primary outcomes [^113NMVTL] [^111g5Xb2] [^114C9Uuk].

> Hold on, I should also review alcoholic liver disease separately; Cochrane-era syntheses across multiple RCTs report no significant benefit on all-cause mortality, liver-related complications, or histology in higher-quality trials, and while a controlled baboon model showed antifibrotic effects of silymarin with long-term alcohol exposure, translation to human clinical endpoints is uncertain, so routine use for alcoholic liver disease is not supported by reliable human data [^115ZnMU2] [^113C6SxG] [^114yMkRa].

> I will now examine drug-induced liver injury prevention, where signals might differ; there is a double-blind randomized trial in patients taking isotretinoin showing that silymarin 140 mg/day attenuated increases in AST and ALT over 30 days compared with placebo, suggesting hepatoprotective potential in a defined DILI-risk context; I initially thought this was a JAMA Dermatology study — wait, let me verify and correct that — it is actually published in Dermatologic Therapy in 2020, which modestly supports silymarin for short-term prevention of isotretinoin-associated transaminitis but requires replication and careful generalization to other hepatotoxins [^116kLJQ1].

> But wait, what if mechanisms can clarify where benefit is more plausible; contemporary work shows silymarin can remodel gut microbiota and increase microbial vitamin B12 production, upregulating one-carbon metabolism and downregulating hepatic lipogenesis genes, which provides a biologically coherent pathway for lipid-lowering in fatty liver states, though clinical confirmation on hard outcomes is pending; conversely, earlier in vitro HCV studies demonstrate effects on entry and polymerase at supratherapeutic concentrations, underscoring why clinical HCV trials were negative despite mechanistic plausibility [^117NxGHm] [^113WTCvh] [^115Ng9Ro].

> I need to ensure safety is considered rigorously; across liver disease RCTs, silymarin appears well-tolerated without excess adverse events versus placebo, but there is no formal, silymarin-specific hepatotoxicity monitoring standard; to avoid overextending, I will cautiously adapt a reasonable monitoring framework from FDA DILI guidance principles and tolcapone labeling — baseline AST/ALT prior to initiation, with periodic monitoring early in therapy — recognizing this is an analogy, not a requirement, and that EASL DILI guidance prioritizes individualized risk–benefit in those with underlying liver disease who are exposed to potential hepatotoxins [^113zYH17] [^113ev5jH] [^112ATVKS].

> Hold on, I should verify the specifics before proposing a schedule; the tolcapone label recommends baseline AST/ALT and monitoring every 2–4 weeks for the first 6 months, then periodically thereafter — if I transpose this conservatively for off-label adjunctive silymarin use in higher-risk settings, it errs on the side of early detection, but I must emphasize this is not evidence-based for silymarin per se and should be individualized by clinical judgment and patient risk profile [^113ev5jH] [^1142hN8H].

> Next, I should review key limitations to avoid overstating conclusions; doses range from 140 mg/day to 700 mg three times daily, formulations differ (silymarin versus silibinin or phosphatidylcholine complexes), and NAFLD alters disposition via transporter changes, all of which may influence pharmacokinetics; patient heterogeneity, including PNPLA3 genotype effects, may further modulate response; outcomes vary from enzymes to biopsy fibrosis to noninvasive stiffness, with primary endpoints often negative even when secondary signals appear, which argues for replication in larger, longer, rigorously controlled trials [^113NMVTL] [^117HS96t] [^114KgtR3].

> Let me synthesize carefully so I don't miss a nuance; high-quality data show no clinical benefit of silymarin in chronic HCV, moderate-quality randomized data in NASH do not meet primary endpoints though an antifibrotic signal is possible, alcoholic liver disease trials do not demonstrate consistent benefit on major outcomes, and the most reproducible positive finding is attenuation of isotretinoin-associated transaminase rises in a small, short-term trial; mechanistic lipid-lowering effects via the microbiome are intriguing but not yet validated for clinical endpoints, so current use should remain adjunctive and investigational rather than substitutive of guideline-directed care [^113zYH17] [^113NMVTL] [^115ZnMU2] [^116kLJQ1].

> I should now translate this into practical recommendations with appropriate caution; do not use silymarin for chronic hepatitis C or as a disease-modifying therapy in alcoholic liver disease, consider it only as an adjunct in NASH/MASLD when lifestyle and risk-factor control are already optimized and when fibrosis is a particular concern, and consider short-term use to mitigate isotretinoin-associated enzyme elevations in selected patients while monitoring, recognizing the evidence is limited to one small RCT and may not generalize to other DILI contexts [^113zYH17] [^115ZnMU2] [^113NMVTL] [^116kLJQ1].

> Let me double-check the monitoring advice so it is clinically coherent; if silymarin is used adjunctively in patients with pre-existing liver disease or concurrent hepatotoxins, obtain baseline AST/ALT and consider periodic checks early in therapy following a conservative schedule adapted from tolcapone labeling (e.g., every 2–4 weeks initially), while applying EASL DILI guidance to weigh continuation against evolving risk–benefit if enzymes rise, and promptly discontinue the offending agent if clinically significant liver injury is suspected, keeping in mind that this framework extrapolates from hepatotoxic drug management rather than silymarin-specific requirements [^113ev5jH] [^112ATVKS].

> Finally, I should grade the evidence transparently to avoid overstatement; for hepatitis C, high-quality evidence supports a strong recommendation against silymarin; for NASH/MASLD, moderate-quality randomized evidence with a negative primary endpoint supports a weak recommendation against routine use while acknowledging a possible antifibrotic signal; for alcoholic liver disease, low-quality evidence yields no recommendation; for prevention of isotretinoin-related transaminase elevations, low-quality but positive randomized evidence supports a weak, context-specific consideration with monitoring [^113zYH17] [^113NMVTL] [^115ZnMU2] [^116kLJQ1].

Silymarin shows **modest benefits** in NAFLD/NASH [^113NMVTL] [^111g5Xb2], with small improvements in liver enzymes and possible antifibrotic effects [^113NMVTL], but **no clear histologic or survival benefit** in viral or alcoholic liver disease [^113zYH17] [^113C6SxG] [^115ZnMU2]. It is **generally safe**, with mild GI effects and rare hypersensitivity, but standardization and bioavailability issues limit clinical impact [^1173ZuWL] [^117HS96t]. Silymarin is **not a substitute** for standard care and should be used cautiously in advanced liver disease or with hepatotoxic drugs [^113zYH17] [^112ATVKS].

---

## Pharmacological properties and mechanisms of action

Silymarin's **hepatoprotective effects** are attributed to several mechanisms:

- **Antioxidant activity**: Scavenges free radicals and enhances glutathione, reducing oxidative stress in hepatocytes [^114cwZCx].

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Inhibits NF-κB and reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) [^114cwZCx].

- **Antifibrotic properties**: Inhibits hepatic stellate cell activation and collagen synthesis, potentially slowing fibrosis [^114cwZCx] [^113NMVTL].

- **Antiviral activity**: In vitro inhibition of HCV entry and replication, though clinical relevance is limited [^115Ng9Ro] [^115JJ8zG].

---

## Clinical evidence in liver diseases

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)

In NAFLD/NASH, **histologic outcomes** from a randomized trial in biopsy-proven NASH showed no significant reduction in NAFLD activity score versus placebo, but a higher proportion experienced fibrosis reduction (22.4% vs 6.0%; p = 0.023) [^113NMVTL]. However, **enzyme changes** across trials show modest ALT/AST reductions with uncertain clinical significance [^111g5Xb2].

---

### Alcoholic liver disease

In alcoholic liver disease, **clinical outcomes** evidence is limited and inconsistent, with a Cochrane review finding no significant effects on mortality, complications, or histology [^113C6SxG] [^115ZnMU2]. However, **enzyme changes** include modest ALT/AST reductions reported in some studies, though their clinical relevance is unclear [^113C6SxG].

---

### Viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C)

In viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), **clinical outcomes** include a large RCT in chronic hepatitis C showing no significant effect on ALT normalization, viral load, or quality of life [^113zYH17]. Although **enzyme changes** with modest ALT/AST reductions are reported in some studies, there is no clear histologic or virologic benefit [^113zYH17] [^1131HN4Q].

---

### Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)

In drug-induced liver injury (DILI), **clinical outcomes** are limited; existing evidence suggests silymarin may reduce liver enzymes, but robust data are lacking [^116kLJQ1] [^112ATVKS].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Silymarin is **well tolerated**:

- **Common adverse effects**: Mild gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia) and rare hypersensitivity reactions [^1173ZuWL].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare hepatotoxicity has been reported, particularly with high doses or prolonged use.

- **Drug interactions**: Potential interactions with CYP3A4 substrates and P-glycoprotein inhibitors.

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Standardization issues**: Variability in preparations and dosing limits comparability and reproducibility [^111g5Xb2] [^111EzJBS].

- **Bioavailability**: Poor oral bioavailability limits therapeutic concentrations in the liver [^117HS96t].

- **Study quality**: Many trials have small samples, short duration, and methodological limitations [^113C6SxG].

- **Clinical relevance**: Modest enzyme changes may not translate into meaningful clinical outcomes [^113zYH17].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Silymarin may be considered an **adjunctive therapy** for NAFLD/NASH, but not as a substitute for lifestyle interventions or standard care [^111g5Xb2]. It is **not recommended as primary therapy** for alcoholic liver disease or viral hepatitis due to limited evidence [^113C6SxG] [^113zYH17]. For DILI, it may be considered in select cases, though robust evidence is lacking. Overall, silymarin has **modest benefits** in NAFLD/NASH [^113NMVTL], with limited evidence in alcoholic and viral hepatitis [^113C6SxG] [^113zYH17]. It is generally safe [^1173ZuWL], but standardization and bioavailability issues limit its clinical utility [^117HS96t].

### Effect of silymarin (milk thistle) on liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C unsuccessfully treated with interferon therapy: a randomized controlled trial [^113zYH17]. JAMA (2012). High credibility.

The botanical product silymarin, an extract of milk thistle, is commonly used by patients to treat chronic liver disease, despite scant and conflicting evidence of its efficacy. This study's objective was to determine the effect of silymarin on liver disease activity in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection unsuccessfully treated with interferon-based therapy.

This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at four medical centers in the United States. Participants included 154 persons with chronic HCV infection and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 65 U/L or greater who were previously unsuccessfully treated with interferon-based therapy. Enrollment began in May 2008 and was completed in May 2010, with the last follow-up visit completed in March 2011.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 420-mg silymarin, 700-mg silymarin, or matching placebo administered three times per day for 24 weeks. The primary outcome measure was a serum ALT level of 45 U/L or less (considered within the normal range) or less than 65 U/L, provided this was at least a 50% decline from baseline values. Secondary outcomes included changes in ALT levels, HCV RNA levels, and quality-of-life measures.

After 24 weeks of treatment, only two participants in each treatment group (P ≥ .99) met the primary outcome measure, with 3.8% [95% CI, 0.5% to 13.2%] for placebo, 4.0% [95% CI, 0.5% to 13.7%] for 420-mg silymarin, and 3.8% [95% CI, 0.5% to 13.2%] for 700-mg silymarin.

### A randomized trial of silymarin for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^113NMVTL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Silymarin is a complex mixture of six major flavonolignans and other minor polyphenolic compounds derived from the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum. It has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects, and may be useful in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We aimed to study the efficacy of silymarin in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the more severe form of NAFLD.

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of consecutive adults with biopsy-proven NASH and a NAFLD activity score (NAS) of four or more at a tertiary care hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from November 2012 through August 2014. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given silymarin (700 mg; n = 49 patients) or placebo (n = 50 patients) three times daily for 48 weeks. After this 48-week period, liver biopsies were repeated. The primary efficacy outcome was a decrease of 30% or more in NAS; findings from 48-week liver biopsies were compared with those from the baseline biopsy. Secondary outcomes included changes in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, NAS and fibrosis score, and anthropometric measurements, as well as glycemic, lipid, and liver profiles, and liver stiffness measurements.

The percentage of patients achieving the primary efficacy outcome did not differ significantly between the groups (32.7% in the silymarin group vs. 26.0% in the placebo group; p = 0.467). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the silymarin group had reductions in fibrosis based on histological assessments.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^1142TQYb]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The study investigates the impact of lifestyle modifications and silymarin on liver damage associated with NAFLD in prediabetic patients.

- **Study participants**: Main demographic and clinical characteristics of prediabetic subjects (n = 212) and healthy controls (n = 126) were assessed at baseline, prior to intervention.

- **Statistical methods**: Differences between groups were evaluated using the Independent t-test for continuous variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for ordinal variables such as steatosis grade, liver stiffness classes, NAFLD score, and FIB-4 score.

- **Key abbreviations**: CAP (controlled attenuation parameter), HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), HbA1c (glycosylated hemoglobin), NAFLD (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease), FIB-4 (Fibrosis-4).

- **Data presentation**: Data were presented as numbers (%) for ordinal variables or means ± standard error for continuous variables.

- **Correlation analysis**: A nonparametric Kendall's tau-b correlation was conducted between patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) genotypes (CC or CG/GG) and various biochemical parameters such as BMI, AST, ALT, HbA1c, GGT, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The CC genotype was coded as "0" while CG/GG genotypes were coded as "1". Tau-b values range from -1 to +1.

- **Genotype association test**: A chi-square test for the association was conducted between PNPLA3 genotypes (CC or CG/GG) for liver stiffness (LS ≥ 7.9 KPa). Results indicated χ²(1) = 76.466, p < 0.001, with a phi coefficient φ = 0.601, p < 0.001.

- **Predictors of fibrosis**: Table 4 presents the univariate analysis of demographic and clinical factors associated with significant fibrosis in the prediabetic state, defined as LS ≥ 7.9 KPa. BMI emerged as the strongest predictor of liver stiffness in this population.

### Tasmar [^113ev5jH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Laboratory tests: Although a program of frequent laboratory monitoring for evidence of hepatocellular injury is deemed essential, it is not clear that periodic monitoring of liver enzymes will prevent the occurrence of fulminant liver failure. However, it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury, along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug, enhances the likelihood of recovery. Accordingly, the following liver monitoring program is recommended.

Before starting treatment with Tasmar, the physician should conduct appropriate tests to exclude the presence of liver disease. In patients determined to be appropriate candidates for treatment with Tasmar, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT/ALT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT/AST) levels should be determined at baseline and periodically (i.e. every 2 to 4 weeks) for the first 6 months of therapy. After the first six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant. Although more frequent monitoring increases the chances of early detection, the precise schedule for monitoring is a matter of clinical judgment.

If the dose is increased to 200 mg tid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), liver enzyme monitoring should take place before increasing the dose and then be conducted every 2 to 4 weeks for the following 6 months of therapy. After six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant.

Discontinue Tasmar if SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST levels exceed 2 times the upper limit of normal or if clinical signs and symptoms indicate liver injury.

### Effect of addition of silymarin to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors on proteinuria in type 2 diabetic patients with overt nephropathy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111488zJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). High credibility.

A large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have diabetic nephropathy. Despite therapies including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, diabetic nephropathy progresses to end-stage renal disease in most of these patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new treatments for such patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of silymarin, an herbal drug with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

- **Study design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm parallel trial.
- **Setting and participants**: 60 patients with type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion > 300 mg/24 h) despite treatment with the maximum dose of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor for more than 6 months and estimated glomerular filtration rate > 30 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Intervention**: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 equal groups to receive three 140-mg tablets of silymarin or 3 tablets of placebo daily for 3 months.
- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was absolute change in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to the end of the treatment phase.
- **Measurements**: UACR and urinary and serum levels of TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α; an inflammatory marker), malondialdehyde (MDA; an oxidative stress marker), and TGFβ (transforming growth factor β; a marker of fibrosis) at baseline and the end of the treatment phase.

Although UACR decreased in both groups, this decrement was significantly higher in the silymarin compared with the placebo group.

### Multiple effects of silymarin on the hepatitis C virus lifecycle [^115Ng9Ro]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Silymarin, an extract from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and its purified flavonolignans have been recently shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, both in vitro and in vivo. In the study, we further characterized silymarin's antiviral actions. Silymarin had antiviral effects against hepatitis C virus cell culture (HCVcc) infection that included inhibition of virus entry, RNA and protein expression, and infectious virus production. Silymarin did not block HCVcc binding to cells but inhibited the entry of several viral pseudoparticles (pp), and fusion of HCVpp with liposomes. Silymarin, but not silibinin, inhibited genotype 2a NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity at concentrations 5 to 10 times higher than required for anti-HCVcc effects. Furthermore, silymarin had inefficient activity on the genotype 1b BK and four 1b RDRPs derived from HCV-infected patients. Moreover, silymarin did not inhibit HCV replication in five independent genotype 1a, 1b, and 2a replicon cell lines that did not produce infectious virus. Silymarin inhibited microsomal triglyceride transfer protein activity, apolipoprotein B secretion, and infectious virion production into culture supernatants. Silymarin also blocked cell-to-cell spread of the virus.

In conclusion, although inhibition of in vitro NS5B polymerase activity is demonstrable, the mechanisms of silymarin's antiviral action appear to include blocking of virus entry and transmission, possibly by targeting the host cell.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^115tjFMV]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

As aforementioned, lifestyle modifications are recommended for control of NAFLD. It has been demonstrated that an intensive weight loss program led to resolution of NASH and improvement of fibrosis. Moreover, follow-up studies on morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery have also shown that the extent of weight loss correlates with the degree of NASH and fibrosis.

We herein show that prediabetic patients who follow a Mediterranean diet and achieve weight loss greater than 5% experienced a significant regression of fibrosis after 6 months (mean LS is 6.70 vs. 5.90; p < 0.001, Table 6). In recent years, the use of natural products has been considered for the treatment of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, the protective effects of silymarin as a powerful ROS scavenger and its hepato-protective effects via attenuation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in the liver have been previously discussed.

There is also recent experimental evidence that in diabetic rats treated with silymarin, in which weight reduction was achieved, markers of hepatic injury were significantly reduced, and favorable histopathological changes were observed. Randomized control trials have shown that regimens with either silymarin alone or its most active biological compound, silybin, lead to liver aminotransferase reduction in patients with NAFLD after only 3 months. One of these studies also investigated the role of silymarin therapy in the context of PNPLA3 polymorphism and showed that PNPLA3 G-allele carriers did not receive any benefits from treatment with silymarin.

### Herbal medicines for fatty liver diseases [^111EzJBS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Fatty liver disease is potentially a reversible condition that may lead to end-stage liver disease. Since herbal medicines such as Crataegus pinnatifida and Salvia miltiorrhiza have increasingly been used in the management of fatty liver disease, a systematic review on herbal medicine for fatty liver disease is needed.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of herbal medicines for people with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded up to 1 March 2012. We also searched the Chinese BioMedical Database, Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP Information, Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database, Chinese Dissertation Database, and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database up to 2 March 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised clinical trials comparing herbal medicines with placebo, no treatment, a pharmacological intervention, or a non-pharmacological intervention such as diet or lifestyle, or Western interventions in participants with fatty liver disease.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data independently. We used the 'risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias of the included trials. We assessed the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcomes.

### Tasmar [^116V7fwa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Warnings: Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute fulminant liver failure, Tasmar (tolcapone) should ordinarily be used in patients with Parkinson's disease who are on l-dopa/carbidopa, experiencing symptom fluctuations, and are not responding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies (see Indications and Dosage and Administration sections).

Because of the risk of liver injury and because Tasmar, when effective, provides an observable symptomatic benefit, patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within three weeks of the initiation of treatment should be withdrawn from Tasmar.

Tasmar therapy should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of liver disease, or if there are two SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST values greater than the upper limit of normal. Patients with severe dyskinesia or dystonia should be treated with caution (see Precautions: Rhabdomyolysis).

Patients who develop evidence of hepatocellular injury while on Tasmar and are withdrawn from the drug for any reason may be at increased risk for liver injury if Tasmar is reintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not ordinarily be considered for retreatment.

In controlled Phase 3 trials, increases to more than three times the upper limit of normal in ALT or AST occurred in approximately 1% of patients at 100 mg tid, and in 3% of patients at 200 mg tid. Females were more likely than males to have an increase in liver enzymes (approximately 5% vs 2%). Approximately one-third of patients with elevated enzymes had diarrhea.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^112iTMWA]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and increased physical activity, have been documented as interventions for controlling NAFLD. Exercise contributes to NASH regression by reducing insulin resistance and decreasing the synthesis and storage of free fatty acids (FFAs) into triglycerides. Insulin sensitizers, like metformin, have shown improvement in liver enzymatic factors, although they have no effect on liver histology. Similarly, therapy with herbal drugs like silymarin — a complex derived from the flowers and leaves of Silybum marianum (milk thistle) — has demonstrated improvement in transaminase levels within the context of liver disease. Nevertheless, the combined effect of nutraceuticals and diet on liver fibrosis and its potential regression in prediabetic patients remains understudied.

With these considerations in mind, we propose to investigate which specific genetic factors and patient demographics can be effectively utilized as critical variables in the risk stratification analysis of prediabetic patients with NAFLD. Finally, by using TE with CAP measurement, we specifically evaluate whether prediabetic patients who undergo lifestyle changes and the use of silymarin experience a significant regression of fibrosis relative to their initial baseline.

### Tasmar [^111GBzBo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute fulminant liver failure, TASMAR (tolcapone) should ordinarily be used in patients with Parkinson's disease who are on l-dopa/carbidopa, are experiencing symptom fluctuations, and are not responding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies (see INDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).

Due to the risk of liver injury, and because TASMAR, when effective, provides an observable symptomatic benefit, patients who fail to show substantial clinical benefit within 3 weeks of initiation of treatment should be withdrawn from TASMAR.

TASMAR therapy should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of liver disease or if there are two SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST values greater than the upper limit of normal. Patients with severe dyskinesia or dystonia should be treated with caution (see PRECAUTIONS: Rhabdomyolysis).

- **Caution**: Patients who develop evidence of hepatocellular injury while on TASMAR and are withdrawn from the drug for any reason may be at increased risk for liver injury if TASMAR is reintroduced. Accordingly, such patients should not ordinarily be considered for retreatment.

Cases of severe hepatocellular injury, including fulminant liver failure resulting in death, have been reported in post-marketing use. As of May 2005, three cases of fatal fulminant hepatic failure have been reported from more than 40,000 patient years of worldwide use. This incidence may be 10- to 100-fold higher than the background incidence in the general population.

### Silymarin treatment of viral hepatitis: a systematic review [^1131HN4Q]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2005). Low credibility.

Silymarin from the milk thistle herb (Silybum marianum) is used by many patients with chronic viral hepatitis, but its efficacy remains unknown. We conducted a systematic review of silymarin for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis B and C. An exhaustive search strategy identified 148 papers that studied silymarin compounds in liver disease. Of these, four trials included patients with hepatitis C, one included hepatitis B patients, and two addressed unspecified chronic viral hepatitis. However, only one trial exclusively studied patients with hepatitis C, and none involved patients with only hepatitis B. Silymarin treatment resulted in a decrease in serum transaminases compared with baseline in four studies, and compared with placebo in only one study. There is no evidence that silymarin affects viral load or improves liver histology in hepatitis B or C. No studies were found that investigated the use of silymarin concomitantly with interferon, nucleoside analogues, or other conventional treatments for hepatitis B or C. In conclusion, silymarin compounds likely decrease serum transaminases in patients with chronic viral hepatitis but do not appear to affect viral load or liver histology. Nevertheless, it may be worthwhile to determine its effects in conjunction with standard antiviral treatment.

### Tasmar [^112qUxiT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Dosage and administration: Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute fulminant liver failure, TASMAR (tolcapone) should ordinarily be used in patients with Parkinson's disease on l-dopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies (see INDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections).

- **Risk of liver injury**: Because of the risk of liver injury and because TASMAR, when it is effective, provides an observable symptomatic benefit, the patient who fails to show substantial clinical benefit within three weeks of initiation of treatment should be withdrawn from TASMAR.

- **Caution in initiation**: TASMAR therapy should not be initiated if the patient exhibits clinical evidence of liver disease or two SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST values greater than the upper limit of normal. Patients with severe dyskinesia or dystonia should be treated with caution (see PRECAUTIONS: Rhabdomyolysis).

- **Hepatocellular injury consideration**: Patients who develop evidence of hepatocellular injury while on TASMAR and are withdrawn from the drug for any reason may be at increased risk for liver injury if TASMAR is reintroduced. These patients should not ordinarily be considered for retreatment with TASMAR.

- **Dosage specifics**: Only prescribe TASMAR for patients taking concomitant carbidopa levodopa therapy. The initial dose of TASMAR is always 100 mg three times per day. The recommended daily dose of TASMAR is also 100 mg tid. In clinical trials, elevations in ALT occurred more frequently at the dose of 200 mg tid.

### Sirtuin 1-mediated inhibition of p66shc expression alleviates liver ischemia/reperfusion injury [^116QZwxe]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Ischemia/reperfusion is a leading cause of liver damage following surgical intervention, trauma, and transplantation. Previous reports indicate that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 attenuates myocardial, cerebral, and renal ischemia/reperfusion damage. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of sirtuin 1-mediated p66shc inhibition in liver ischemia/reperfusion and explore the effect of carnosic acid and ischemic preconditioning on liver ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage.

- **Design**: Laboratory investigation.

- **Setting**: University laboratory.

- **Subjects**: Male Sprague-Dawley rats and HepG2 cells.

- **Interventions**: The rats were subjected to 45 minutes of ischemia on 70% of the liver, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. The HepG2 cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury.

- **Measurements and main results**: In the rats with liver ischemia/reperfusion injury, carnosic acid pretreatment and ischemic preconditioning significantly reduced serum aminotransferase activity and proinflammatory chemokine levels and improved liver histological evaluations. Carnosic acid and ischemic preconditioning also increased manganese superoxide dismutase and Bcl-xL, but down-regulated cleaved caspase-3. Interestingly, the protective effect of carnosic acid and ischemic preconditioning was positively associated with sirtuin 1 activation. By contrast, p66shc, a kinase that promotes oxidative injury and apoptosis, was inhibited by carnosic acid and ischemic preconditioning. Sirtuin 1 small interfering RNA knockdown experiments confirmed these findings.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^115mEw3i]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may present as a spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic steatosis, with or without elevated aminotransferases, to cirrhosis with complications such as liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The interaction between genetic background and environmental factors plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

Regarding genetic factors, a single-nucleotide polymorphism occurring in the sequence of the human patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 gene (PNPLA3), known as the I148M variant, is one of the most investigated variants. It is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic steatosis and progressing to advanced fibrosis. Specifically, the rs738409 C > G variant of the PNPLA3 gene and its encoded protein adiponutrin have been associated with a variety of roles, ranging from an acquired lipogenic function to a loss of lipolytic activities.

NAFLD is closely associated with obesity, and due to the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome among younger age groups, it is expected to affect a substantial proportion of the population. The high prevalence of NAFLD and its low risk of progression to steatohepatitis make large-scale screening for NAFLD unsuitable for the general population. Thus, focusing screening efforts on individuals at higher risk of progressing to more advanced liver disease is more cost-effective. Patients with prediabetes fall into this category as they are not only at high risk of developing NAFLD, but also show a higher rate of progression to significant hepatic fibrosis relative to other patients.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^111CBhW5]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

A univariate analysis was conducted to identify factors correlated with significant liver fibrosis, which is defined by liver stiffness of ≥ 7.9 kPa in prediabetic patients prior to intervention. For continuous variables, medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were used to describe central tendency and dispersion, while categorical variables were presented as frequencies (%).

Furthermore, a binomial logistic regression was utilized to assess the impact of various factors — gender, BMI, ALT, AST, GGT, HbA1c, and cholesterol — on the likelihood of developing significant liver fibrosis (defined as liver stiffness ≥ 7.9 kPa) in prediabetic patients. Results indicated that the model had a good fit, as evidenced by a non-significant Hosmer and Lemeshow test (p = 0.76). The logistic regression model itself was statistically significant, χ²(7) = 191.9, p < .001, explaining 85.2% (Nagelkerke R²) of the variance. The seven-predictor model is as follows: Predicted logit of (significant liver fibrosis) = -71.821–0.126 * gender + 2.084 * BMI + 0.254 * AST + 0.183 * ALT - 0.045 * HbA1c + 0.121 * GGT - 0.029 * cholesterol. In this model, female gender is coded as 0 and male gender as 1. Among the predictor variables, three were statistically significant: BMI,…

### Milk thistle for the treatment of liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173ZuWL]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Milk thistle, an herbal compound, is the dietary supplement taken most frequently by patients with chronic liver disease. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the efficacy and safety of this herb for the treatment of liver disease.

- **Methods**: We searched English and non-English reports through July 1999 using thirteen databases and reference lists, and by contacting manufacturers and technical experts. Reviewers independently screened all reports to identify randomized placebo-controlled trials that evaluated milk thistle for the treatment of liver disease. Outcomes of primary interest included mortality, histological findings on liver biopsy specimens, serum aminotransferase and albumin levels, and prothrombin times.

- **Results**: Fourteen trials met inclusion criteria. Four trials reported outcomes for mortality among 433 participants. The overall summary odds ratio for mortality in the milk thistle group compared with placebo was 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 1.5; P = 0.6). Three trials assessed histology on liver biopsy; study quality was inversely associated with the likelihood of histological benefit for milk thistle compared with placebo. There were no differences in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, or albumin levels, or prothrombin times among participants assigned to milk thistle compared with those assigned to placebo. The only statistically significant difference was a greater reduction in alanine aminotransferase levels among patients with chronic liver disease assigned to milk thistle (-9 IU/L).

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^112dzVnV]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in both prediabetic patients and healthy overweight individuals, yet it remains understudied. This study investigates the effects of hepatic steatosis on fibrosis and evaluates the major predictors of liver injury in prediabetes and whether this damage is reversible with a Mediterranean diet and administration of the nutraceutical silymarin.

- **Methods**: First, a case-control study was conducted where 212 patients with prediabetes, not known to have NAFLD, and 126 healthy controls underwent clinical evaluation, transient elastography with measurement of liver stiffness (LS), and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Subsequently, the 212 prediabetic patients were enrolled into a prospective randomized interventional study: 104 followed a Mediterranean diet alone while 108 followed a Mediterranean diet with supplementation of silymarin (a flavonolignan complex isolated from Silybum marianum and Morus alba). The administered silymarin dose was 210 mg twice daily for 6 months. Clinical and instrumental evaluations were repeated at the end of the 6-month study period. Prediabetics were genotyped for patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3).

- **Results**: In the case-control study, 29% of prediabetic patients have significant fibrosis, defined as LS ≥ 7.9 kPa, compared to only 3% of controls (p < 0.001). The PNPLA3 genotype CG/GG is significantly associated with significant fibrosis LS ≥ 7.9 relative to the CC genotype, χ²(1) = 76.466, p < 0.001. Binomial regression analysis shows that increases in BMI, ALT, and AST are significantly associated with fibrosis severity.

### Silybin treatment is associated with reduction in serum ferritin in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111zHFy9]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to examine the effect of a standardized silybin and soy phosphatidylcholine complex (IdB 1016) on serum markers of iron status.

Milk thistle and its components are widely used as an alternative therapy for liver disease because of purported antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and iron chelating properties.

Thirty-seven patients with chronic hepatitis C and Batts-Ludwig fibrosis stage II, III, or IV were randomized to one of three doses of IdB 1016 for 12 weeks. Serum ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and transferrin-iron saturation were measured at baseline, during treatment, and four weeks thereafter. Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare baseline and posttreatment values.

- **Results**: There was a significant decrease in serum ferritin from baseline to the end of treatment (mean, 244 vs. 215 µg/L; median, 178 vs. 148 µg/L; P = 0.0005). Seventy-eight percent of subjects had a decrease in serum ferritin level. There was no significant change in serum iron or transferrin-iron saturation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis in a model that included dose, age, sex, HFE genotype, history of alcohol use, and elevated baseline ferritin levels demonstrated that stage III or IV fibrosis was independently associated with decreased posttreatment serum ferritin level.

Treatment with IdB 1016 is associated with reduced body iron stores, especially among patients with advanced fibrosis stage.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^114C9Uuk]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Pre-diabetic patients who undergo a Mediterranean diet, with a weight reduction greater than 5% of the original body weight either alone or in conjunction with nutraceutical, experience a significant regression of fibrosis and a significant decrease in ALT, HbA1c, and FBS after 6 months (p < 0.001 for each variable). Patients who followed a Mediterranean diet alone (group 1) saw significant regression of fibrosis after 6 months, with mean liver stiffness (LS) decreasing from 6.70 to 5.90. The combination of a Mediterranean diet and silymarin treatment (group 2) also led to regression of fibrosis, with mean LS decreasing from 6.80 to 5.40; however, there was no significant difference when compared to the diet alone (p = 0.696). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two groups in ALT, AST, and FBS after treatment. Notably, a diet with weight reduction greater than 5% together with the silymarin regimen (group 2) results in a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to diet alone (group 1), with a 95% CI of 37.8–38.6 versus 39.5–40.3 (p < 0.001).

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^116H4VVn]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

After the case-control study phase, pre-diabetic patients were asked to participate in this open-label, prospective randomized interventional study in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and after approval by the local Ethics Committee (IRB n. 176/18). All consecutive adult patients with a prediabetic state (HbA1c from 5.7 to 6.4%), not under pharmacological treatment, evaluated at the Diabetes Clinic of the Castelli Hospital in Verbania and at the Hepatology Clinic of the Madonna del Popolo Hospital in Omegna, in Northern Italy, between March 2017 and March 2018, were offered to participate in this study, in accordance with the approved protocol. A written informed consent was obtained from all eligible patients (n = 212, of whom n = 157 were males) before participation. All were subjected to full history and clinical examination to assess history of hypertension, history of drug use, any chronic illness, and family history of diabetes.

All patients met, at least once, with a dietician for nutritional guidance, and were encouraged to start and maintain a low-calorie diet before study enrollment. The moderate-fat, restricted-calorie, Mediterranean diet was rich in vegetables and low in red meat, with poultry and fish replacing beef and lamb. We restricted energy intake to 1500 kcal per day for women and 1800 kcal per day for men.

At enrollment, 210 mg BID of silymarin (a flavonolignan complex isolated from Silybum marianum and Morus alba [Meda Pharma]) were added to the regimen of 108 patients (group 2).

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^113MdTDf]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the impact of lifestyle changes and silymarin on liver damage in patients with NAFLD associated with prediabetes. In this initial phase, 212 patients in a prediabetic state (HbA1c 5.7–6.4% or 39–46 mmol/mol) who had not yet received pharmacological treatment, and 126 healthy controls with a BMI ranging from 25 to 29, were recruited and enrolled. All patients underwent clinical assessment, transient elastography to measure liver stiffness (LS), and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP).

At the time of enrolment, blood samples were taken for biochemical evaluations. Patients were registered for age, sex, and BMI. The inclusion criteria included age ≥ 18 years and prediabetic subjects who had not been treated for more than 12 weeks with antidiabetic drugs or with diet and exercise.

Exclusion criteria were positive serology for hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), presence of other causes of chronic liver disease (such as autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, cholestatic liver disease, drug-induced damage), focal hepatic lesions of suspected malignant origin, excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages (≥ 3 drinks per day), obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), and inability to obtain valid transient elastography measurements.

Total cholesterol, HDL, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured using enzymatic methods. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was analyzed by high-pressure chromatography. Plasma glucose concentration was measured using the hexokinase method (ADVIA, Siemens Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were also assessed.

### Milk thistle and prostate cancer: Differential effects of pure flavonolignans from Silybum marianum on antiproliferative end points in human prostate carcinoma cells [^113eqvHW]. Cancer Research (2005). Low credibility.

Extracts from the seeds of milk thistle, Silybum marianum, are known commonly as silibinin and silymarin and possess anticancer actions on human prostate carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Seven distinct flavonolignan compounds and a flavonoid have been isolated from commercial silymarin extracts. Most notably, two pairs of diastereomers, silybin A and silybin B and isosilybin A and isosilybin B, are among these compounds. In contrast, silibinin is composed only of a 1:1 mixture of silybin A and silybin B.

With these isomers now isolated in quantities sufficient for biological studies, each pure compound was assessed for antiproliferative activities against LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 human prostate carcinoma cell lines. Isosilybin B was the most consistently potent suppressor of cell growth relative to either the other pure constituents or the commercial extracts. Isosilybin A and isosilybin B were also the most effective suppressors of prostate-specific antigen secretion by androgen-dependent LNCaP cells.

Silymarin and silibinin were shown for the first time to suppress the activity of the DNA topoisomerase IIalpha gene promoter in DU145 cells and, among the pure compounds, isosilybin B was again the most effective. These findings are significant in that isosilybin B composes no more than 5% of silymarin and is absent from silibinin.

Whereas several other more abundant flavonolignans do ultimately influence the same endpoints at higher exposure concentrations, these findings are suggestive that extracts enriched for isosilybin B, or isosilybin B alone, might possess improved potential.

### Microbially produced vitamin B12 contributes to the lipid-lowering effect of silymarin [^117NxGHm]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To examine whether there was a causal relationship between silymarin-altered microbiota and improved liver lipid metabolism, we conducted a daily gavage of fecal samples from the silymarin group to two groups of HFD-fed rats. The first group received heat-killed fecal microbiota; this group, along with rats receiving fecal microbiota from the HFD group, served as the double control groups. After 12 weeks of FMT, the FMT-silymarin group showed significantly lower levels of liver TG and TC, as confirmed by histological analyses of liver tissues (Fig. 3A–C). However, the mean liver TG difference between groups attributed to FMT was 28.1 μmol/g, which was only half of that from direct silymarin treatment (56.6 μmol/g). Lower levels of plasma ALT and AST were also observed in the FMT-silymarin group (Fig. 3D, E). The inflammation marker IL-6 showed only a trend of difference, and no significant difference was found for TNF-α between groups, potentially due to the less pronounced improvement of liver lipid metabolism by FMT (Fig. 3F, G). Consistent with our silymarin treatment experiment results (Fig. 2A), the FMT-silymarin group also exhibited higher alpha diversity (Fig. 3H). Seventeen ASVs were consistently changed between FMT-silymarin vs. FMT-control and HFD + silymarin vs. HFD (Fig. 3I). The two most prevalent ASVs that showed positive correlations with silymarin treatment were ASV30, affiliated with Escherichia/Shigella, and Bilophila wadsworthia (ASV37).

### The ameliorative effect of silibinin against radiation-induced lung injury: Protection of normal tissue without decreasing therapeutic efficacy in lung cancer [^11495xLm]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy has been used to treat lung cancer; however, because radiation can damage normal tissues, many complications may develop in patients receiving lung irradiation. Radiation-induced pulmonary damage to normal lung tissue can lead to early-phase pneumonitis and late-phase fibrosis months to years after irradiation, which can adversely affect a patient's quality of life. An animal model for pulmonary fibrosis has been established using total body irradiation at 15 Gy. Previous studies have shown that fibrosis was not induced in C3H/HeJ and CBA/J mice, but was found in C57BL/6 mice during the late phase after thorax irradiation. Although radioprotective agents, including soy isoflavone, have been found to mitigate the inflammation and fibrosis induced by irradiation, the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis induced by thorax irradiation remains unknown. However, inflammation has been proposed to involve radiation-induced fibrosis formation.

Silibinin, a standardized extract from the fruits and seeds of milk thistle, is the major active constituent of silymarin and is used clinically and consumed as a dietary supplement for liver disease. Silibinin has shown promising and potential anti-tumor efficacy in several cancers, including lung cancer models. Previous research demonstrated that the oral administration of silibinin produced a profound effect in protecting mice against radiation-induced mortality and preventing DNA damage in vitro. However, the potential protective effect of silibinin against radiation-induced lung fibrosis is unknown.

### Milk thistle for alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C liver diseases — a systematic Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group review with meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials [^115ZnMU2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Our objectives were to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of milk thistle (MT) or MT constituents versus placebo or no intervention in patients with alcoholic liver disease and/or hepatitis B and/or C liver diseases.

- **Methods**: Randomized clinical trials studying patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C liver diseases were included (December 2003). The randomized clinical trials were evaluated by components of methodological quality.

- **Results**: Thirteen randomized clinical trials assessed MT in 915 patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C liver diseases. The methodological quality was low: only 23% of the trials reported adequate allocation concealment and only 46% were considered double blind. MT versus placebo or no intervention for a median duration of 6 months had no significant effects on all-cause mortality (relative risk (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–1.15), complications of liver disease, or liver histology. Liver-related mortality was significantly reduced by MT in all trials (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.29–0.88), but not in high-quality trials (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28–1.19). MT was not associated with a significantly increased risk of adverse events.

- **Conclusions**: Based on high-quality trials, MT does not seem to significantly influence the course of patients with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C liver diseases. MT could potentially affect liver injury. Adequately conducted randomized clinical trials on MT versus placebo may be needed.

### A silymarin antioxidant serum improves facial acne alone and as part of a treatment regimen [^1116V782]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Silymarin is an antioxidant that can protect against free radicals that cause premature signs of aging and oil oxidation that may contribute to breakouts.

- **Aims**: The objective of these studies was to evaluate a silymarin antioxidant serum alone and in combination with a prescription acne treatment regimen in improving facial appearance in blemish-prone skin.

- **Methods**: Two international studies were conducted. A 12-week study in Brazil enrolled 56 subjects to examine the effect of silymarin antioxidant serum on facial acne. Clinical grading on acne lesions, skin tone, clarity, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) were conducted. In addition, consumer self-assessment, analysis for markers of lipid peroxidation, and sebumeter analysis were completed. Another United States (US)/German study enrolled 40 subjects who were on topical prescription acne medications to which silymarin antioxidant serum was added. Acne lesion counts, tolerability, and facial appearance assessments were conducted in this study.

- **Results**: The Brazilian study demonstrated a 45% reduction in inflammatory lesions and a 43% reduction in noninflammatory lesions after 12 weeks of silymarin antioxidant serum use. In addition, sebumeter testing showed a 16% reduction in oiliness at week 1. The US/German study showed the benefits of the serum in persons already on prescription acne therapy by reducing facial erythema by 60%, dryness by 49%, and scaling by 67%.

- **Conclusion**: Silymarin is shown in clinical testing to have significant benefits in reducing lipid peroxidation and oiliness.

### Considerations for physiologically based modeling in liver disease: From nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [^117HS96t]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Low credibility.

Milk thistle extract contains two major flavonolignans, silybin A and silybin B, both of which undergo extensive glucuronidation by various UGT enzymes (i.e. hepatic UGT1A1 and UGT1A3, intestinal UGT1A8, and UGT1A10). Interestingly, although systemic exposure (AUC) of intact and conjugated silybin A and B was higher in NAFLD patients compared with those in healthy individuals, the fraction metabolized to glucuronides was not significantly different. These data suggest that lower activity of MRP2 and OATP1B1/1B3, and higher MRP3 activity are responsible for changes in hepatic disposition of the silybin glucuronides in NAFLD patients compared with healthy individuals.

Similarly, higher observed systemic concentrations of glucuronide metabolites of morphine and acetaminophen in patients with NASH are consistent with decreased MRP2 and increased MRP3 efflux. Systemic exposures of apixaban and rosuvastatin in patients with NAFLD are slightly lower, albeit not significantly different than those in healthy lean individuals. Despite being a CYP3A substrate, apixaban only undergoes minor metabolism by the isoenzymes (fraction metabolized < 0.25), and thus, the NAFLD‐associated decrease in CYP3A activity may be attenuated by a presumed increase in intestinal (and hepatic) BCRP and/or P‐gp activity. The reason for a lack of significant change in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics between patients with NAFLD and the non‐NAFLD cohort is not clear, but might be related to the counterbalance of increased BCRP‐mediated efflux in enterocytes (and hepatocytes) and decreased OATP1B1/1B3‐mediated hepatic transport.

### Prevalence of potentially harmful multidrug interactions on medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients [^115ZanXY]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

It has been hypothesized that polypharmacy may increase the frequency of multidrug interactions (MDIs), where one drug interacts with two or more other drugs, amplifying the risk of associated adverse drug events (ADEs). The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MDIs in medication lists of elderly ambulatory patients and to identify the medications most commonly involved in MDIs that amplify the risk of ADEs.

- **Methods**: Medication lists stored in the electronic health record (EHR) of 6,545 outpatients aged 60 years or older were extracted from the enterprise data warehouse. Network analysis identified patients with three or more interacting medications from their medication lists. Potentially harmful interactions were identified from the enterprise drug-drug interaction alerting system. MDIs were considered to amplify the risk if interactions could increase the probability of ADEs.

- **Results**: MDIs were identified in 1.3% of the medication lists, the majority of which involved three interacting drugs (75.6%), while the remainder involved four (15.6%) or five or more (8.9%) interacting drugs. The average number of medications on the lists was 3.1 ± 2.3 in patients with no drug interactions and 8.6 ± 3.4 in patients with MDIs. The prevalence of MDIs on medication lists was greater than 10% in patients prescribed bupropion, tramadol, trazodone, cyclobenzaprine, fluoxetine, ondansetron, or quetiapine, and greater than 20% in patients prescribed amiodarone or methotrexate. All MDIs were potentially risk-amplifying due to pharmacodynamic interactions.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^111sFZAZ]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Our study shows that, in an unselected cohort of patients with prediabetes not previously known to have NAFLD, the prevalence of liver disease is unexpectedly high. The clinical characteristics of the recruited patients explain most of the variability observed, with a significant contribution from the genetic profile. As shown in Table 4, the age and the duration of the prediabetic condition do not contribute significantly to the prevalence of NAFLD. Yet, as previously shown, we also observe that excess body weight facilitates the progression of liver fibrosis.

- **Obesity and liver damage**: The reason obesity affects the pathophysiology of liver damage is likely related to the fact that leptin induces pro-inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines, thus altering the liver wound-healing response.

- **Genetic predictors**: In recent years, in addition to environmental factors and comorbidities, genetic predictors of the progression of liver disease have also been identified. The strongest genetic predictor of the progression of chronic liver disease is SNS rs738409 in the PNLPA3 gene, which encodes a membrane-bound triacylglycerol lipase mediating the hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol. This "missense" mutation causes a reduction in the enzymatic activity of PNPLA3, leading to the development of macrovascular steatosis. In our study, we evaluate how the PNPLA3 mutation plays a part in the progression of liver disease in prediabetes. Increased risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with DMT2 who are carriers for the mutated variant of rs738409 was previously reported; yet, the estimate of liver fibrosis was based on Fibrotest ra

### Silibinin and related compounds are direct inhibitors of hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [^115JJ8zG]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Silymarin is a mixture of flavonolignans extracted from milk thistle. It contains several molecules, including silibinin A, silibinin B, isosilibinin A, isosilibinin B, silicristin, and silidianin. Intravenous infusion of silibinin induces a dose-dependent reduction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the principal isomers in silymarin preparations for their ability to inhibit HCV enzymatic functions and replication in various models.

- **Methods**: The inhibitory activity of silymarin components was tested in HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NS3/4A protease enzyme assays. The ability of these compounds to inhibit replication of an HCV genotype 1b replicon model and the JFH1 infectious HCV model in cell culture was also studied.

- **Results**: Silibinin A, silibinin B, their water-soluble dihydrogen succinate forms, and Legalon SIL — a commercially available intravenous preparation of silibinin — inhibited HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function, with inhibitory concentrations 50% of the order of 75–100 µM. Silibinin A and silibinin B also inhibited HCV genotype 1b replicon replication and HCV genotype 2a strain JFH1 replication in cell culture. None of these compounds inhibited HCV protease function.

- **Conclusions**: Silibinin A, silibinin B, and Legalon SIL inhibit HCV replicon and JFH1 replication in cell culture. This effect is at least partly due to the ability of these compounds to inhibit HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. These results provide a basis for the optimization and further development of these compounds as antiviral agents against HCV.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - Prediabetic disease [^11764uFE]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Abdominal ultrasonography was conducted following a fasting period of 12 hours by a radiologist who was blinded to the patients' information. All patients underwent ultrasound examination of the liver using a sagittal sonographic plane to demonstrate hepatic parenchyma and right kidney echogenicity. If the kidney cortex and liver parenchyma echogenicity are the same, it is evaluated as normal, indicating no fatty liver (Grade 0). Liver steatosis was classified into three grades:

- **Mild (Grade 1)**: Minimal diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity with normal visualization of the diaphragm and intrahepatic vessels.
- **Moderate (Grade 2)**: Medium diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity with impaired visualization of intrahepatic vessels and diaphragm.
- **Severe (Grade 3)**: Severe diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity with difficulty displaying the posterior segment of the right hepatic lobe, failure to visualize the walls of the intrahepatic vessels, and a marked decrease in the reflectivity of the hemidiaphragm.

Liver stiffness (LS) was evaluated by transient elastography (TE) using FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris, France). Measurements of LS and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) were performed on the same day as abdominal ultrasonography after fasting for at least 12 hours. The LS measurements from TE were taken from the right lobe of the liver through the intercostal space of patients in the dorsal decubitus position with the right arm in maximum abduction.

TE was performed by a blind expert technician who did not have access to patient clinical data. The median value of the successful measurements was selected as the representative data point.

### Silybin, a component of sylimarin, exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic effects on human hepatic stellate cells [^114cwZCx]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hepatic fibrogenesis, a consequence of chronic liver tissue damage, is characterized by the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Silybin has demonstrated anti-fibrogenic effects in animal models. However, scant information is available on the cellular and molecular events responsible for this effect. The aim of this study was to assess the mechanisms regulating the anti-fibrogenic and anti-inflammatory activity of Silybin.

Experiments were performed on HSC isolated from the human liver and activated by culture on plastic. Silybin was able to inhibit dose-dependently (25–50 µM) growth factor-induced pro-fibrogenic actions of activated human HSC, including cell proliferation (P < 0.001), cell motility (P < 0.001), and de novo synthesis of extracellular matrix components (P < 0.05). It also inhibited the IL-1-induced synthesis of MCP-1 (P < 0.01) and IL-8 (P < 0.01), showing potent anti-inflammatory activity. Silybin exerts its effects by directly inhibiting ERK, MEK, and Raf phosphorylation, reducing the activation of NHE1 (Na+/H+ exchanger, P < 0.05) and IkBalpha phosphorylation. In addition, Silybin was confirmed to act as a potent anti-oxidant agent.

The results of the study provide molecular insights into the potential therapeutic action of Silybin in chronic liver disease. This action seems primarily related to a marked inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a clear anti-oxidant effect, and a reduction of the direct and indirect pro-fibrogenic potential.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^114KgtR3]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Interaction between patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) genotypes (CC or CG/GG), BMI, and biochemical parameters shows interesting findings. The nonparametric Kendall's tau-b correlation was conducted to assess the strength and direction of the association between these PNPLA3 genotypes (CC or CG/GG) and various biochemical parameters including BMI, AST, ALT, HbA1c, GGT, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Each biochemical parameter and CG/GG genotype displayed a positive correlation coefficient τb, and each association was statistically significant (p < .05). A notable observation was that all patients with a BMI greater than 28, who were homozygous rs738409 G/G, demonstrated significant liver stiffness.

Among the 22 patients who were homozygous rs738409 G/G, 13 exhibited LS greater than 7.9 KPa, and notably, all 13 patients had a BMI exceeding 28. Additionally, 9 out of the 22 patients homozygous for rs738409 G/G had LS of 28 or greater.

### Tasmar [^112zkXLS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Cases of severe hepatocellular injury, including fulminant liver failure resulting in death, have been reported in postmarketing use. As of May 2005, three cases of fatal fulminant hepatic failure have been reported from more than 40,000 patient-years of worldwide use. This incidence may be 10- to 100-fold higher than the background incidence in the general population. All three cases were reported within the first six months of initiation of treatment with Tasmar. Analysis of the laboratory monitoring data in over 3,400 Tasmar-treated patients participating in clinical trials indicated that increases in SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST, when present, generally occurred within the first six months of treatment with Tasmar.

The imprecision of the estimated increase is due to uncertainties about the base rate and the actual number of cases occurring in association with Tasmar. The incidence of idiopathic potentially fatal fulminant hepatic failure (i.e. not due to viral hepatitis or alcohol) is low. One estimate, based upon transplant registry data, is approximately 3/1,000,000 patients per year in the United States. Whether this estimate is an appropriate basis for estimating the increased risk of liver failure among Tasmar users is uncertain. Tasmar users, for example, differ in age and general health status from candidates for liver transplantation. Similarly, underreporting of cases may lead to significant underestimation of the increased risk associated with the use of Tasmar.

### The effect of silymarin on liver enzymes in patients taking isotretinoin: A randomized clinical trial [^116kLJQ1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). High credibility.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of silymarin (Livergol) on liver enzymes in patients taking isotretinoin (Roaccutane). In this double-blind clinical trial, 74 patients with acne and taking isotretinoin were randomly assigned into intervention (N = 37) and control (N = 37) groups. The intervention group received a 140 mg Livergol capsule per day for 30 days. The control group received a starch-containing capsule as a placebo once a day for 30 days. Liver enzyme levels were measured before and after the intervention. The data were analyzed using chi-square test, independent t-test, paired sample t-test, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

The results showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups at the beginning of the study in levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (p > .05). At the end of the study, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups in levels of AST and ALT (p < 0.05). Livergol prevented liver enzymes from increasing, so it can be used as an effective, low-cost, and low-complication treatment for the problem of increased levels of liver enzymes following the use of isotretinoin.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^115CLimu]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Though genetic variants may be considered in constructing prediction models aimed at detecting the progression of NAFLD to fibrosis in patients with prediabetes, the use of Fibroscan in this patient population remains paramount. The prevalence of moderate to advanced steatosis, scored using CAP, independently of BMI, does not significantly differ between the control group and patients with prediabetes (52% vs. 58%, p = 0.3); nevertheless, when using LS as a measure of liver fibrosis, there appears to be a significant difference in advanced steatosis when comparing these two groups (3% vs. 29%, p < 0.001), indicating that a prediabetic state plays a critical factor in the progression of steatosis to fibrosis.

- **The role of TE**: This should be particularly underscored in that group of prediabetic patients with mild fibrosis (LS 5.9–7.9 kPa) since transaminase levels are not elevated in this patient group, indicating that transaminase levels are not a good indicator of mild fibrosis and can lead to a sense of false reassurance.

Nonetheless, we show that transaminases, together with BMI, remain the principal indicators associated with significant fibrosis.

### Tasmar [^1142hN8H]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

A prescriber who elects to use Tasmar in the face of the increased risk of liver injury is strongly advised to monitor patients for evidence of emergent liver injury. Patients should be advised of the need for self-monitoring for both the classical signs of liver disease (e.g. clay-colored stools, jaundice) and the nonspecific ones (e.g. fatigue, loss of appetite, lethargy).

Although a program of periodic laboratory monitoring for evidence of hepatocellular injury is recommended, it is not clear that periodic monitoring of liver enzymes will prevent the occurrence of fulminant liver failure. However, it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood of recovery. Accordingly, the following liver monitoring program is recommended:

- **Liver monitoring program**: Before starting treatment with Tasmar, the physician should conduct appropriate tests to exclude the presence of liver disease. In patients determined to be appropriate candidates for treatment with Tasmar, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT/ALT) and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT/AST) levels should be determined at baseline and periodically (i.e. every 2 to 4 weeks) for the first 6 months of therapy. After the first six months, periodic monitoring is recommended at intervals deemed clinically relevant. Although more frequent monitoring increases the chances of early detection, the precise schedule for monitoring is a matter of clinical judgment.

### Microbially produced vitamin B12 contributes to the lipid-lowering effect of silymarin [^113WTCvh]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To identify the potential gene target for microbially produced B12, we performed liver transcriptome analyses in rats and germ-free mice supplemented with silymarin or B12 versus the high-fat diet (HFD) control groups. As expected, the one-carbon metabolism pathway interconnected with folate, B12, and the methionine cycles was significantly upregulated based on the liver transcriptome data in rats (Fig. 5H), demonstrating that the improvement of liver lipid metabolism upon silymarin or B12 treatment might act through this pathway and associated epigenetic regulation, as previously proved in cell experiments.

In addition, we observed that the expression of key lipogenic genes or transcription factors such as FASN, ACACB, SCD1, and SREBF1 was repressed, whereas the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including PPARA, CPT1, and BDH1, was increased by silymarin and B12. The expression levels of FGFR4 and GCK, known to enhance lipogenesis, were also reduced (Fig. 5I). Of note, MT1 and MT2, two genes encoding different metallothioneins which can protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) via their antioxidant properties, showed reduced expression levels in B12-treated rats. Further pathway enrichment analysis confirmed the upregulation of the fatty acid degradation pathway (Supplementary Fig. 6C).

Furthermore, liver transcriptome analyses in germ-free mice revealed that only 26 genes showed significant changes in silymarin-treated mice versus the HFD control group, whereas 482 genes altered upon B12 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5D and Supplementary Data 5). Targeted analyses showed that 9 out of 1…

### High lipophilicity and high daily dose of oral medications are associated with significant risk for drug-induced liver injury [^1172iwXz]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of drug failure in clinical trials and a major reason for drug withdrawals from the market. Although there is evidence that dosages of ≥ 100 mg/day are associated with an increased risk for hepatotoxicity, many drugs are safe at such dosages. There is an unmet need to predict risk for DILI more reliably, and lipophilicity might be a contributing factor. We analyzed the combined factors of daily dose and lipophilicity for 164 US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral medications and observed a high risk for hepatotoxicity (odds ratio [OR], 14.05; P < 0.001) for drugs given at dosages ≥ 100 mg/day and octanol-water partition coefficient (logP) ≥ 3, defining the "rule-of-two".

Similar results were obtained for an independent set of 179 oral medications, with 85% of the rule-of-two positives being associated with hepatotoxicity (OR, 3.89; P < 0.01). Using the World Health Organization's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, the rule-of-two performed best in predicting DILI in seven therapeutic categories. Among 15 rule-of-two positives, 14 were withdrawn hepatotoxic drugs, and one was an over-the-counter medication labeled for liver injury. We additionally examined drug pairs that have similar chemical structures and act on the same molecular target but differ in their potential for DILI. Again, the rule-of-two predicted hepatotoxicity reliably. Finally, the rule-of-two was applied to clinical case studies to identify hepatotoxic drugs in complex comedication regimes, further demonstrating its use.

### Silymarin for adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^111g5Xb2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a major public health challenge, with approximately 32.4% of adults globally diagnosed with the condition and a steadily increasing prevalence. Currently, no specific medicines are approved to manage MASLD effectively. Silymarin, a common herbal agent with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties, presents potential therapeutic benefits for MASLD in both its monotherapy and complex forms (complexation with solubilising agents, such as vitamin E, phosphatidylcholine, etc).

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of silymarin monotherapy and silymarin complex in adults with MASLD.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Web of Science, three Chinese regional bibliographic databases, and two trial registries; we also performed reference checking and contacted trial authors for relevant studies (search date: 15 May 2024).

- **Eligibility criteria**: We included randomised clinical trials comparing silymarin monotherapy or silymarin complex versus no intervention, placebo, or other interventions in adults with MASLD. We excluded quasi-randomised and observational studies. There were no restrictions on the publication language, date, or status.

- **Outcomes**: Critical outcomes were the proportion of people with serious adverse events, all-cause mortality, and quality of life. Some of the most important outcomes were liver enzymes (i.e. alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)), and the proportion of…

### Microbially produced vitamin B12 contributes to the lipid-lowering effect of silymarin [^115f86iK]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Levels of liver lipids in rats and germ-free mice were supplemented with or without B12, and the association of plasma triglycerides (TG) and B12 in humans was assessed.

In rats, levels of liver TG (A) and total cholesterol (TC) (B) were measured in diets supplemented with or without B12 (n = 6 for each group). Significant statistical differences were determined using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with groups labeled by different letters (a, b, or c).

For germ-free mice, levels of liver TG (C), TC (D), and plasma B12 (E) were assessed across the HFD, HFD + silymarin, and HFD + B12 treated groups (n = 7, 8, and 7, respectively). Oil Red O staining was used to observe liver lipid droplets in these groups (n = 6, 7, and 6 for HFD, HFD + silymarin, and HFD + B12, respectively; FDR adjusted P values were 0.032 and 0.080 for HFD + B12 versus HFD + silymarin and HFD groups, respectively).

An association between serum vitamin B12 levels and triglycerides in 398 responders was analyzed using a linear mixed-effect model. Additionally, rat liver transcriptome analyses revealed the upregulation of key genes involved in one-carbon metabolism mediated by folate, B12, and the methionine cycles.

Key hepatic genes involved in lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation in rats and germ-free mice were regulated by silymarin or B12. The symbols −, *, +, and # indicate P values smaller than 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively. The Wald test, embedded in the DESeq2 package, was used to identify differentially expressed genes, and a hypergeometric test was utilized for pathway enrichment analysis. For bar plots, values were presented as mean ± S.E.M.

### Lifestyle and silymarin: A fight against liver damage in NAFLD associated - prediabetic disease [^1114EZoX]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, it is critical to acknowledge that patients with prediabetic status have a high prevalence of liver disease characterized by significant fibrosis, which goes largely unnoticed in the absence of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. We herein show how increased BMI and genetic factors represent critical variables in the risk stratification analysis of prediabetic patients with NAFLD. Lastly, we propose that the Mediterranean diet, together with the intake of the nutraceutical silymarin, contributes to the regression of liver damage and diabetes markers.

### Silymarin retards the progression of alcohol-induced hepatic fibrosis in baboons [^114yMkRa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

The hepatoprotective effects of silymarin in patients with alcoholic liver disease are controversial. To ensure strict control, this was assessed in non-human primates. Twelve baboons were fed alcohol with or without silymarin for three years while receiving a nutritionally adequate diet.

- **Results**: Silymarin opposed the alcohol-induced oxidative stress, which was assessed by plasma 4-hydroxynonenal, and the rise in liver lipids and circulating ALT. Alcohol increased hepatic collagen type I by 50% over the three years, with a significant rise in mRNA for alpha1 (I) procollagen, both prevented by silymarin. Corresponding morphologic changes were observed: at 36 months, 2 of 6 animals fed alcohol developed cirrhosis and 2 had septal fibrosis, with perivenular fibrosis in 2. In contrast, with alcohol + silymarin, there was only 1 case of cirrhosis and 1 of septal fibrosis, with perivenular fibrosis in 2, and virtually no lesions in the remaining 2.

- **Conclusions**: Silymarin retards the development of alcohol-induced hepatic fibrosis in baboons, consistent with several positive clinical trials. The negative outcome observed in other trials possibly reflects poor compliance resulting in irregular or low silymarin intake. Thus, given the innocuity of silymarin, it might be advisable in future clinical studies to ensure the controlled administration of sufficient amounts of silymarin.

### Tasmar [^112zcqdV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Indications**: TASMAR is indicated as an adjunct to levodopa and carbidopa for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Because of the risk of potentially fatal, acute fulminant liver failure, TASMAR (tolcapone) should ordinarily be used in patients with Parkinson's disease taking l-dopa/carbidopa who are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not responding satisfactorily to, or are not appropriate candidates for, other adjunctive therapies. Due to the risk of liver injury and the need for TASMAR to demonstrate observable symptomatic benefit, patients failing to show substantial clinical improvement within 3 weeks of treatment initiation should be withdrawn from TASMAR.

The effectiveness of TASMAR was demonstrated in randomized controlled trials involving patients receiving concomitant levodopa therapy with carbidopa or another aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor. These trials included patients who experienced end-of-dose wearing-off phenomena as well as those who did not.
