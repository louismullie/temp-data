## Question

Paradoxical IRIS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining paradoxical IRIS and distinguishing it from unmasking IRIS. Then, I should verify the immunopathogenesis and why timing matters. Next, I will review epidemiology and risk factors across pathogens. After that, I need to check clinical manifestations by organ system and timing. Then, I should confirm diagnostic criteria and the exclusion of mimics. Next, I will examine management principles, including ART handling, antifungal or anti-mycobacterial therapy, and immunomodulation. Finally, I will consider prevention strategies, special populations, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with monitoring and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Paradoxical IRIS is a clinical deterioration with inflammatory features that occurs after initial improvement on pathogen-directed therapy, triggered by immune recovery following ART initiation; by contrast, unmasking IRIS is the first presentation of a previously occult opportunistic infection uncovered by immune restoration, typically within weeks of ART start [^112LRRhi] [^111Lp3zK]. Hold on, I should verify that both forms share the same immunologic driver — pathogen-specific immune reconstitution — but differ in whether the OI was diagnosed before ART; yes, that's consistent with consensus case definitions and guideline frameworks [^114xRHqS] [^113oM5Hw].

> I need to check the immunopathogenesis next. Paradoxical IRIS arises when rapid ART-mediated CD4+ recovery and Th1/Th17 reactivation meet a high residual antigen burden, producing dysregulated hyperinflammation with elevated cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18; innate pathways including inflammasome activation and neutrophil recruitment also contribute, particularly in CNS disease [^112LRRhi] [^1156J2qu] [^112JdLfL]. Wait, let me verify the timing piece: the highest risk window is typically within 1–4 weeks of ART, aligning with the kinetics of immune reconstitution and antigen clearance dynamics [^111Lp3zK].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors across pathogens. For TB-IRIS, pooled incidence is about 18% with mortality around 2%, and risk rises with CD4 < 100 cells/mm³, high pre-ART viral load, disseminated/extrapulmonary TB, and a short interval between TB therapy and ART. Early ART increases IRIS risk but improves survival overall, so timing must balance both [^111Lp3zK] [^11723vSQ]. For cryptococcal meningitis, IRIS occurs in roughly 10–30% and is more likely with low baseline inflammatory response, low CD4, high organism/antigen burden, and early ART before CSF sterilization. Deferring ART 4–6 weeks after antifungal induction reduces risk [^116Qs1fi]. For PCP, IRIS is less common but associated with high pre-ART viral load and early ART; for KS, IRIS risk is higher with advanced tumor stage, high HIV/HHV-8 loads, and ART without concurrent chemotherapy [^1171NUbu] [^1126jYCF] [^116euVzv].

> I will now examine clinical manifestations by organ system to anchor pretest probabilities. Systemic features include fever, malaise, and weight loss; lymphatic disease with new or enlarging, often suppurative lymphadenopathy is common; pulmonary findings include new or worsening infiltrates, nodules, effusions, and intrathoracic nodes; CNS disease spans meningitis, tuberculomas or cryptococcomas, radiculomyelitis, and edema with mass effect; hepatobiliary involvement includes granulomatous hepatitis and cholestasis; cutaneous disease may show erythema nodosum or other inflammatory dermatoses; and musculoskeletal features include synovitis and inflammatory arthropathy [^113H1zPk] [^113CXwuU] [^1116rfu5]. Hold on, I should verify timing again: most cases cluster in the first month of ART, but some persist or recur beyond a year, especially with suppurative lymphadenitis or CNS lesions [^111Lp3zK].

> Next, I should review diagnostic criteria and the principle of exclusion. There is no definitive biomarker; diagnosis relies on structured case definitions (e.g. INSHI) requiring proven or highly probable OI, initial clinical response to pathogen-directed therapy, and subsequent inflammatory deterioration after ART, with exclusion of treatment failure, drug resistance, nonadherence, drug toxicity, and alternative infections or malignancies [^114xRHqS] [^113oM5Hw]. I need to ensure I include key differentiators: for cryptococcosis, a negative CSF culture with sterile CSF PCR supports IRIS over relapse; for TB, drug resistance must be actively excluded; for KS, steroid-induced flares are a major pitfall and argue against corticosteroids [^112uxYrJ] [^116e8iPj] [^116euVzv].

> Let me consider management principles, and I should double-check ART policy first. ART should not be interrupted because of IRIS; instead, continue ART and optimize pathogen-directed therapy while managing inflammation, as immune control is ultimately protective despite short-term morbidity [^112LRRhi] [^1116rfu5]. For cryptococcal meningitis, maintain induction/consolidation antifungals and prioritize therapeutic lumbar punctures for elevated intracranial pressure; for TB, ensure an appropriate rifamycin-based regimen and address drug–drug interactions with ART [^113CXwuU] [^114ugSrg].

> Now, immunomodulation: I should confirm steroid indications and dosing. For moderately severe TB-IRIS, prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks then 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks reduces morbidity. Adjust for rifampin induction and taper over 4 weeks, extending to 2–3 months if symptoms persist or recur. NSAIDs suffice for mild cases, and aspiration of suppurative nodes or effusions can palliate symptoms [^115VVS3N] [^116e8iPj]. For cryptococcal IRIS, high-dose prednisolone or prednisone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day (or dexamethasone 0.2–0.3 mg/kg/day) tapered over 4–6 weeks is reasonable for persistent symptoms despite repeated therapeutic LPs; avoid stopping ART and escalate to expert-guided second-line agents if steroid-refractory [^113CXwuU] [^115PwXps]. But wait, what if KS-IRIS is suspected? Steroids are contraindicated due to tumor exacerbation; use chemotherapy and supportive care instead [^116euVzv].

> I should confirm prevention strategies, especially for high-risk patients. For TB-IRIS, preemptive prednisone 40 mg/day for 2 weeks then 20 mg/day for 2 weeks at ART initiation reduces incidence by about 30% in patients with CD4 ≤ 100 cells/mm³ starting ART within 30 days of TB therapy, without excess severe infections or malignancy in the PredART trial; consider this when KS and active HBV are absent and rifampin resistance is not suspected [^112N7eSb] [^115TMLvQ] [^115VVS3N]. For cryptococcal meningitis, defer ART 4–6 weeks after starting antifungals, aim for CSF sterilization before ART, and use high-dose fluconazole consolidation to mitigate IRIS risk; screening for cryptococcal antigen pre-ART with preemptive therapy for positives reduces unmasking IRIS [^116Qs1fi] [^116Jd3UP].

> Let me think about special populations and edge cases. In children, IRIS is common early after ART and often reflects unmasking. Management mirrors adults with continuation of ART and OI therapy, adding short-course steroids for severe cases. Pediatric-specific case definitions exist but evidence is limited [^1129Sxn6] [^113v2FrQ]. In TB meningitis, paradoxical neurologic deterioration is frequent and may require prolonged corticosteroids with careful imaging and CSF follow-up; early ART timing remains controversial due to IRIS risk, so individualized decisions are prudent [^111Fc4w8] [^112X2Dy3]. For HIV-negative patients, paradoxical reactions can still occur and should be differentiated from treatment failure using clinical trajectory and microbiologic reassessment [^113ecs7z].

> Hold on, I should verify a practical bedside approach so nothing critical is missed. Suspect paradoxical IRIS when inflammatory worsening follows initial improvement after starting pathogen therapy and ART; immediately exclude drug resistance, nonadherence, drug toxicity, and alternative diagnoses with targeted labs, cultures, imaging, and, for CNS disease, MRI and CSF analysis; apply validated case definitions to structure diagnosis; continue ART and OI therapy; treat symptoms with NSAIDs and procedural drainage as needed; escalate to corticosteroids for moderate–severe disease using pathogen-specific dosing and tapers; and arrange close follow-up to monitor for relapse versus steroid dependence, engaging specialty input for refractory cases [^116e8iPj] [^113CXwuU] [^112LRRhi].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent. Paradoxical IRIS is an iatrogenic inflammatory consequence of successful immune reconstitution, not treatment failure. It demands a high index of suspicion, disciplined exclusion of mimics, and timely immunomodulation when indicated, all while maintaining life-saving ART and pathogen-directed therapy. With these principles, most patients recover, though CNS involvement carries higher morbidity and may require prolonged management and multidisciplinary care [^112LRRhi] [^113CXwuU] [^111Lp3zK].

Paradoxical IRIS is a **paradoxical worsening** of pre-existing infections after starting ART, driven by immune recovery [^112LRRhi]. It typically occurs within **1–4 weeks of ART initiation** [^111Lp3zK] and is most often associated with TB, cryptococcal meningitis, and MAC [^1126jYCF] [^116Qs1fi] [^11318qj1]. Diagnosis is clinical, requiring exclusion of alternative causes and supported by case definitions [^114xRHqS] [^113oM5Hw]. Management includes continuing ART, treating the underlying infection, and using corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe cases [^115VVS3N] [^113CXwuU]; preemptive prednisone can reduce TB-IRIS incidence in high-risk patients [^112N7eSb] [^115TMLvQ]. Prognosis is generally good with appropriate management, though severe CNS involvement can cause significant morbidity or mortality [^111Lp3zK] [^112X2Dy3].

---

## Pathogenesis

Paradoxical IRIS reflects **immune reconstitution** after ART, with rapid CD4+ recovery and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6) driving excessive inflammation at pre-existing infection sites [^112LRRhi] [^111DTLgJ]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Rapid immune recovery**: Sudden restoration of pathogen-specific T-cell responses causes hyperinflammation [^112LRRhi] [^111DTLgJ].
- **Cytokine storm**: Elevated TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6 mediate tissue damage [^115QkQ3a] [^111DTLgJ].
- **Antigen burden**: High residual antigen load fuels the inflammatory response [^112LRRhi] [^116Jd3UP].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Paradoxical IRIS presents with **new or worsening inflammatory features** of a previously treated infection, typically within 1–4 weeks of ART initiation [^notfound]. Common features include:

| **Pathogen** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Mycobacterium tuberculosis | - Fever <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - New or worsening pulmonary infiltrates <br/> - Hepatic granulomas <br/> - Neurologic deterioration (tuberculomas, meningitis) [^111Lp3zK] [^112X2Dy3] [^113H1zPk] |
| Cryptococcus neoformans | - New or worsening meningitis <br/> - Cryptococcomas <br/> - Raised intracranial pressure <br/> - Visual loss [^113CXwuU] [^113oM5Hw] |
| Mycobacterium avium complex | - Fever <br/> - Night sweats <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Lymphadenopathy <br/> - Hepatosplenomegaly <br/> - Bone lesions [^11318qj1] [^114jqkHr] |
| Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy | - Contrast-enhancing lesions <br/> - Mass effect <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Rapid neurologic decline [^1114rwX4] [^113wjopG] |

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of paradoxical IRIS:

- **Low baseline CD4 count**: Especially < 50–100 cells/mm³ [^112LRRhi] [^11723vSQ].
- **High antigen burden**: Disseminated or extrapulmonary disease [^112LRRhi] [^113qE99D].
- **Short interval between OI treatment and ART**: Particularly within 2–4 weeks [^112LRRhi] [^114SSGq9].
- **Rapid immune recovery**: Rapid CD4 rise and viral load decline [^112LRRhi].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

Diagnosis is clinical and requires exclusion of alternative causes; **validated case definitions** guide diagnosis:

- **INSHI criteria**: Standardized definitions for TB-IRIS and cryptococcal IRIS [^114xRHqS] [^113oM5Hw].
- **Exclusion of alternatives**: Rule out treatment failure, drug resistance, nonadherence, and other infections [^116kEozN] [^111Fc4w8].
- **Supportive tests**: Imaging (MRI, CT), CSF analysis, and cultures to exclude relapse or alternative diagnoses [^113CXwuU] [^112uxYrJ].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management balances **immune recovery** with **control of inflammation**:

- **Continue ART**: Do not interrupt ART; manage inflammation while maintaining virologic suppression [^112LRRhi] [^1116rfu5].
- **Treat underlying infection**: Ensure optimal antimicrobial therapy [^113CXwuU] [^114ugSrg].
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 1–1.5 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks, then taper; dexamethasone for CNS involvement [^115VVS3N] [^113CXwuU].
- **Supportive care**: Analgesics, antipyretics, and management of complications (e.g. raised intracranial pressure) [^113CXwuU] [^116e8iPj].
- **Prevention**: Preemptive prednisone (40 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 20 mg/day for 2 weeks) reduces TB-IRIS in high-risk patients [^112N7eSb] [^115TMLvQ].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate management, though **severe CNS involvement** (e.g. TBM, cryptococcal meningitis) can cause significant morbidity or mortality [^111Lp3zK] [^112X2Dy3]. Most patients experience clinical resolution within weeks to months, but some have protracted or recurrent disease [^111Lp3zK] [^116hSz1M].

---

Paradoxical IRIS is a **reversible inflammatory response** to immune recovery after ART, characterized by clinical worsening of pre-existing infections. It requires careful diagnosis, continued ART, and targeted anti-inflammatory therapy, with outcomes generally good when managed appropriately [^1126jYCF].

Management

The central tenets of CM management are aggressive fungicidal treatment at diagnosis followed by long-term fungistatic treatment to achieve clearance and suppression; and proactive management of raised ICP, which develops in up to 75% of patients. Online supplemental material 1 discusses medical management of CM in depth. Table 2 outlines the side effects of antifungal agents used in CM and gives a treatment algorithm based on consensus global guidelines. Box 2 lays out important principles of CM management.

Table 2
Antifungal treatment guidelines

Box 2
Principles of cryptococcal meningitis (CM) treatment

All patients require prolonged courses of antifungal treatment, usually lasting 6–12 months — split into induction, consolidation and maintenance phases.
Aggressive, combination fungicidal therapy during the induction phase is associated with reduced risk of acquired antimicrobial resistance and reduced mortality.
Once the disease is controlled, the patient can be transitioned to fungistatic treatments (fluconazole), which have good oral bioavailability and central nervous system penetration.
For HIV-CM in low-resource settings, induction therapy with single-dose intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and oral flucysotine 25 mg/kg four times per day for 1 week, followed by high dose oral fluconazole 1200 mg once daily for a further week, is non-inferior to a 1-week liposomal amphotericin B -based induction period, reducing care costs and side effect burden.
There is no established role for adjuncts; corticosteroids are reserved for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), postinfectious inflammatory response syndrome and cryptococcomas.
In non-HIV CM cases with a compelling need for ongoing immunosuppression, avoid abrupt medication withdrawal to mitigate the risk of paradoxical treatment reactions and wean corticosteroids first.
In CM patients with a new diagnosis of HIV, delay antiretroviral therapy for 4–6 weeks after starting antifungals to mitigate the risk of IRIS.
The key complication of CM is raised intracranial pressure, which may not be present at time of diagnosis — all patients should undergo early repeat lumbar puncture and may require serial therapeutic taps or cerebrospinal fluid diversion.
Where possible, all CM patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting involving neurologists, infectious disease physicians, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, therapists and pharmacists.

### HIV-tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is characterized by toll-like receptor and inflammasome signalling [^115S4X7e]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately one-third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), 5%–10% of whom will develop active diseasewith human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection being the greatest recognized risk factor for disease. Seventy-eight per cent of those with HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) live in Africa. Increased access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved the clinical outcome of such patients in resource-limited settings. However, up to 54% of patients develop hyperinflammatory reactions known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) within the first month of ART initiation. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is directed towards MTB antigens and is characterized by recurrent, new or worsening symptoms and signs of treated TB.

Three clinical risk factors for HIV-associated paradoxical TB-IRIS are recognized: (i) low baseline CD4 + T-cell count (< 50–100 cells per mm 3) before ART; (ii) a short time interval between commencing TB treatment and ART; and (iii) dissemination of TB to extrapulmonary sites, possibly reflecting higher bacterial load. Nevertheless, the immunopathological basis of the syndrome remains incompletely understood and there is no biomarker to predict which patients will develop IRIS. Studies to date have suggested that both innate and adaptive immunity are involved, leading to hypercytokinemia and severe inflammation.

### Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in Peru [^113ZLoeU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has not been widely studied in children, especially in resource-poor settings.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected children initiating HAART between 2001 and 2006 at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Lima, Peru. Charts were reviewed for 1 year after HAART initiation. IRIS was defined as a HAART-associated adverse event caused by an infectious or inflammatory condition in patients with documented virologic or immunologic success.

Results

Ninety-one children (52% female) received HAART for at least 1 year. Median age at initiation was 5.7 years; 91% were ART naive and 73% had CDC stage C disease. The incidence of IRIS was 19.8 events per 100 person years (95% CI: 11.5–28.0). Median time to IRIS was 6.6 weeks after HAART initiation (range: 2–32 weeks). There were 18 IRIS events, 11 unmasking and 7 paradoxical. These included associations with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 4 cases, Bacillus Calmette Guerin lymphadenitis in 1 case, varicella zoster virus in 6 cases and herpes simplex labialis in 6 cases. Children who developed IRIS had a higher baseline HIV viral load (P = 0.02) and an indicator of malnutrition (P = 0.007) before HAART initiation.

Conclusion

IRIS occurred in 20% of HIV-infected children starting HAART in Peru and was associated with more advanced disease and malnutrition. Future research is needed to examine specific risk factors associated with pediatric IRIS to allow prompt identification and treatment of IRIS.

### Pitfalls in the management of TB-associated uveitis [^111stRXU]. Eye (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

The aim of this study is to highlight the pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of case records of four patients with TB-associated uveitis.

Results

In cases 1 and 2, failure to treat tubercular uveitis with anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) and unopposed steroid therapy led to a serious systemic consequence — development of intra-cranial tuberculoma. In case 4, similar failure to initiate ATT caused recurrent disease (focal choroiditis) in the eye. All four cases showed appearance of new lesions or worsening of existing lesions in the eye, following initiation of ATT. Such paradoxical reactions resolved by adding/increasing corticosteroid therapy.

Conclusion

TB-associated uveitis needs a strong index of suspicion for diagnosis and a combined anti-tubercular plus anti-inflammatory therapy for successful outcome.

### Matrix degradation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-associated tuberculosis and tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: a prospective observational study [^116jJfGj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are global pandemics with complex interplay. HIV-1 increases the risk of TB, while TB accelerates HIV-1 progression and is the commonest cause of HIV-related death. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces mortality, but is frequently complicated by development of tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). TB-IRIS is characterized by an acute inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) presenting either in an uncharacteristically exaggerated form (unmasking IRIS), or as deterioration in a patient already receiving TB treatment (paradoxical IRIS).

In immunocompetent adults, Mtb typically causes apical pulmonary disease with cavitation, which drives transmission and spread. Conversely, in advanced HIV-1 infection, disseminated disease is more common and pulmonary cavitation less frequent. In paradoxical TB-IRIS, focal inflammatory pathology primarily affects the lung and lymph nodes, causing tissue damage. Although specific features have been described, such as hypercytokinemia and inflammasome activation, the final effectors of this immunopathology are poorly defined. In HIV-uninfected TB patients, pulmonary immunopathology is driven by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in particular the collagenase MMP-1, releasing matrix degradation products. Pulmonary MMPs are suppressed in advanced HIV-1 infection, providing a mechanism for reduced lung cavitation.

In this study, we systematically explored MMP activity and immunopathology in HIV-1–associated TB. We hypothesized that HIV-1–associated TB would be characterized by reduced MMP activity at TB diagnosis compared to HIV-uninfected TB, but that increased MMP activity would associate with inflammatory pathology during TB-IRIS. Our insights inform novel approaches to risk stratify and diagnose TB-IRIS, and also host-directed interventions to prevent pathology.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114ugSrg]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) disease — empiric therapy, first-line regimen, durations, drug-resistant approaches, and supportive measures: After collecting specimen for culture and molecular diagnostic tests, empiric TB treatment should be started in individuals with clinical and radiographic presentation suggestive of TB (AII). Initial phase is 2 months, given daily by DOT (AI), with INH (plus pyridoxine) plus (RIF or RFB) plus PZA plus EMB (AI), followed by continuation with INH (plus pyridoxine) plus (RIF or RFB) daily (AI). Total duration for pulmonary, drug-susceptible TB is 6 months (BII); for pulmonary TB with positive culture after 2 months of TB treatment or severe cavity or disseminated extrapulmonary TB it is 9 months (BII); for extra-pulmonary TB with CNS infection it is 9–12 months (BII). If rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) indicates resistance to rifampin with or without other drugs, options include INH (plus pyridoxine) plus EMB plus PZA plus (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) plus an aminoglycoside, or capreomycin (BII). For drug-resistant TB resistant to INH, use (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) plus (RIF or RFB) plus EMB plus PZA for 6 months (BII); if resistant to rifampins plus or minus other drugs, therapy should include at least 5 active drugs and be individualized with consultation with experienced specialists (AIII). DOT is recommended for all patients (AI); all rifamycins may have significant pharmacokinetic interactions with ARV drugs, therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered in patients receiving rifamycin and interacting ART, adjunctive corticosteroids improve survival for TB with CNS involvement (AI), and paradoxical IRIS that is not severe can be treated with NSAIDs without a change in TB or HIV therapy (BIII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

TB-associated IRIS — forms, timing, manifestations, and frequency: TB-IRIS is a frequent early complication of ART in patients with recently diagnosed or undiagnosed active TB, and the condition is thought to result from the recovering immune system driving inflammatory reactions directed at M. tuberculosis antigens present at sites of disease; two forms of TB-IRIS are recognized: paradoxical TB-IRIS and unmasking TB-IRIS. Paradoxical TB-IRIS occurs in patients diagnosed with active TB prior to starting ART and typically after clinical improvement on TB treatment; within the first 1 to 4 weeks of ART (though sometimes later), they develop new or recurrent symptoms and new, worsening, or recurrent clinical and radiologic features of TB, with common manifestations including hectic fevers, new or enlarging lymphadenopathy, and new or worsening pulmonary infiltrates. In disseminated TB, hepatic TB-IRIS is common and can manifest with nausea and vomiting, tender hepatic enlargement, cholestatic liver function derangement, and occasionally jaundice, and a liver biopsy reveals a granulomatous hepatitis. Reported frequency varies: paradoxical TB-IRIS is relatively common among patients starting ART while on TB treatment (incidence 48% to 54%), whereas a meta-analysis of 40 studies reported a pooled incidence of TB-IRIS of 18% in adults with HIV-associated TB initiating ART, with death attributed to TB-IRIS in 2% of the cases. Onset is typically between 1 to 4 weeks after ART is initiated and the syndrome lasts for 2 to 3 months on average, though symptoms may continue for months and in rare cases local manifestations may persist or recur over a year after onset; in prolonged cases, manifestations usually include suppurative lymphadenitis and abscess formation.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113RLExa]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in children with HIV — IRIS recognition and steroid use: Apparent worsening after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may be a paradoxical inflammatory reaction called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and inflammatory PML should be suspected in cART-treated children with advanced HIV who show acute neurologic deterioration and contrast-enhancing demyelinating lesions on MRI, even if immunological and virological measures show improvement. Retrospective data suggest that early and prolonged treatment with steroids may be beneficial for some patients in whom immune reconstitution with ART activates an inflammatory response to JCV, but no clinical trial data exist to substantiate the anecdotal evidence.

### A paradoxical decline: intracranial lesions in two HIV-positive patients recovering from cryptococcal meningitis [^112i5j4B]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS) is an increasingly important manifestation among patients with HIV/AIDS, especially as the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expanding worldwide. Cryptococcus and associated C-IRIS are common causes of meningitis. While intracranial lesions are common in HIV/AIDS, they are rarely due to cryptococcosis or C-IRIS. We describe two cases of paradoxical C-IRIS associated with the development of intracranial cryptococcomas in HIV/AIDS. Both patients had an initial episode of cryptococcal meningitis treated with antifungal therapy. At the time, they had initiated or modified ART with subsequent evidence of immune reconstitution. Two months later, they developed aseptic meningitis with intracranial lesions. After exhaustive work ups, both patients were diagnosed with paradoxical C-IRIS and biopsy confirmed intracranial cryptococcomas. We review the important clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic features of cryptococcomas associated with C-IRIS in HIV/AIDS.

### Immunopathogenesis and diagnosis of tuberculosis and tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome during early antiretroviral therapy [^116Rutb2]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

In many settings, the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are reduced by the high early incidence of tuberculosis and tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS).

Methods

We used tuberculin skin testing and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay to investigate cellular immune responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) and region of difference 1 (RD1) antigens during the first 24 weeks of ART.

Results

TB-IRIS and ART-associated tuberculosis occurred in 15 of 75 (20%) and 11 of 231 (4.8%) participants at risk, respectively. Greater increases in interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and skin test responses to PPD were seen at week 24 and 12 in participants with TB-IRIS (P ≤ .04), respectively. Raw IFN-gamma responses to RD1 antigens and PPD corrected for pre-ART CD4(+) T cell counts were higher at all time points in individuals with ART-associated tuberculosis (P < .001) and were associated with areas under receiver operator characteristic curves of 0.90 for RD1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–1.00) and 0.92 for PPD (95% CI, 0.83–1.00) for the diagnosis of ART-associated tuberculosis. Pre-ART IFN-gamma responses enabled stratification of participants into groups with risks of subsequent tuberculosis of 0.7%, 9.3%, and 30.0%.

Conclusions

Type 1 effector T cell responses are prominent in ART-associated tuberculosis, but additional immune defects may be more important in paradoxical TB-IRIS. IFN-gamma release assays may contribute to the prediction and diagnosis of tuberculosis during early ART.

### Defining immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: evaluation of expert opinion versus 2 case definitions in a South African cohort [^116mNxfx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

There is no validated case definition for human immunodeficiency virus-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We measured the level of agreement of 2 published case definitions (hereafter referred to as CD1 and CD2) with expert opinion in a prospective cohort of patients who were starting antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.

Methods

A total of 498 adult patients were monitored for the first 6 months of antiretroviral therapy. All new or worsening clinical events were reviewed by 2 investigators and classified on the basis of expert opinion, CD1, and CD2. Events were categorized according to whether they were paradoxical or unmasking in presentation. We measured positive, negative, and chance-corrected agreement (kappa) with expert opinion for CD1 and CD2, and reviewed areas of disagreement.

Results

A total of 620 clinical events were recorded, of which, on the basis of expert opinion, 144 (23.2%) were defined as probable IRIS and 112 (18.1%) were defined as possible IRIS. Of the 144 probable IRIS events, 93 (64.6%) were unmasking in presentation, 99 (68.8%) were associated with dermatological or orogenital disease, and 45 (31.3%) were associated with tuberculosis or major opportunistic infections. Of the 620 clinical events recorded, 41 (6.6%) were classified as IRIS on the basis of CD1, and 156 (25.2%) were classified as IRIS on the basis of CD2. Positive agreement between CD1 and expert opinion was low for both unmasking (17.2%; kappa = 0.24) and paradoxical events (37.3%; kappa = 0.43), mainly because 1 major criterion requires IRIS to be atypical and either an opportunistic infection or a tumor, although negative agreement was > 98%. In contrast, CD2 had good positive agreement (> 75% for most event types), with a kappa value of 0.75 for paradoxical and 0.62 for unmasking.

Conclusions

CD2 agreed well with expert opinion, with additional clinical events, such as arthropathy and inflammatory dermatoses, being classified as IRIS and added to CD2. We propose revised case definitions for both paradoxical and unmasking IRIS.

### New onset or exacerbation of uveitis with infliximab: paradoxical effects? [^114nSSAL]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Objective

To report four cases of new onset or exacerbation of uveitis following administration of infliximab.

Methods

This retrospective observational case series includes four patients who developed new onset or exacerbation of uveitis paradoxically during infliximab treatment.

Results

Four patients were assessed, including three women, with a mean age of 33 (14–84) years. Infliximab was introduced for the treatment of scleritis associated with rheumatoid arthritis (two cases), chronic anterior uveitis associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (one case) and Crohn's disease (one case). Anterior scleritis associated with rheumatoid arthritis successfully improved following infliximab administration; however, macular oedema or dense vitritis paradoxically developed in two cases. In one case, infliximab was switched to tocilizumab. In another case, infliximab was discontinued, and additional corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications were added. In one patient with JIA, new-onset macular oedema and exacerbation of anterior uveitis were observed during infliximab treatment, so the patient was switched to adalimumab. In the patient with Crohn's disease treated with infliximab, severe vasculitis and macular oedema occurred, requiring intravitreal triamcinolone injection. The patient was switched to adalimumab. Given that these reactions were paradoxical effects of infliximab, infliximab treatment was discontinued in all cases, and additional corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications were added. All cases remained free of ocular inflammation at the last visit.

Conclusion

Uveitis rarely occurs de novo or is exacerbated during infliximab treatment. Cessation of infliximab led to resolution of this paradoxical adverse effect.

### Randomized placebo-controlled trial of prednisone for paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^117EFYfS]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is a frequent complication of antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited countries. We aimed to assess whether a 4-week course of prednisone would reduce morbidity in patients with paradoxical TB-IRIS without excess adverse events.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of prednisone (1.5 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks then 0.75 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks). Patients with immediately life-threatening TB-IRIS manifestations were excluded.

Methods

The primary combined endpoint was days of hospitalization and outpatient therapeutic procedures, which were counted as one hospital day.

Results

One hundred and ten participants were enrolled (55 to each arm). The primary combined endpoint was more frequent in the placebo than the prednisone arm {median hospital days 3 [interquartile range (IQR) 0–9] and 0 (IQR 0–3), respectively; P = 0.04}. There were significantly greater improvements in symptoms, Karnofsky score, and quality of life (MOS-HIV) in the prednisone vs. the placebo arm at 2 and 4 weeks, but not at later time points. Chest radiographs improved significantly more in the prednisone arm at weeks 2 (P = 0.002) and 4 (P = 0.02). Infections on study medication occurred in more participants in prednisone than in placebo arm (27 vs. 17, respectively; P = 0.05), but there was no difference in severe infections (2 vs. 4, respectively; P = 0.40). Isolates from 10 participants were found to be resistant to rifampicin after enrolment.

Conclusion

Prednisone reduced the need for hospitalization and therapeutic procedures and hastened improvements in symptoms, performance, and quality of life. It is important to investigate for drug-resistant tuberculosis and other causes for deterioration before administering glucocorticoids.

### Corticosteroids for reducing tuberculosis mortality in persons living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis using reconstructed individual patient data [^115F1kda]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Persons living with HIV (PLHIV), particularly those more severely immunocompromised, face an increased risk of developing and dying from tuberculosis (TB). According to the 2024 WHO, there were approximately 662 000 incident TB cases and 161 000 TB deaths among PLHIV globally in 2023.

Corticosteroids are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for certain forms of TB, such as pleural TB, TB meningitis and TB pericarditis, to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes, regardless of HIV status. In PLHIV, however, the use of corticosteroids during TB treatment presents a more complex risk-benefit balance. Corticosteroids may reduce the risk of paradoxical TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a complication that affects up to 18% of PLHIV treated for TB. However, corticosteroid use has been associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in immunocompromised individuals, including Kaposi's sarcoma and potentially other opportunistic infections.

As a result, whether adjunctive corticosteroids should be routinely used in PLHIV treated for TB remains uncertain. Some randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been conducted to evaluate the impact of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of TB disease. Results are inconsistent. The PredART trial, for example, showed that in PLHIV on TB treatment, initiating a 4-week course of prednisolone at the start of ART reduced the incidence of TB-associated IRIS by 30% (risk ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; p = 0.03). However, the ACT HIV trial, which included 520 PLHIV with TB meningitis, found that adjunctive dexamethasone did not significantly reduce mortality over 12 months as compared with placebo. Furthermore, several previous meta-analyses have suggested that at least for some forms of TB, corticosteroids reduced mortality during TB treatment from 15% to 17%. However, these reviews included few if any PLHIV. A recent meta-analysis of seven RCTs involving 1410 PLHIV receiving TB treatment found no evidence that corticosteroids reduced the risk of all-cause mortality or increased the risk of serious adverse events. These past meta-analyses used aggregated data, which were limited to evaluating mortality in the same endpoint.

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of adjunctive corticosteroids on mortality in PLHIV undergoing treatment for TB. Given the heterogeneity in the time points and trial designs across studies, we reconstructed individual patient data (rIPD) from published Kaplan-Meier survival curves to enable standardised time-to-event analysis.

### Approach for tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-negative patient [^113ecs7z]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

As there is neither a specific diagnostic tool nor defined clinical, serological or radiological markers, diagnosis of TB-IRIS is a diagnosis by exclusion. In 2008, the International Network for Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) elaborated a consensus case definition for TB-IRIS in HIV-positive patients in low-income settings. According to INSHI, infection with M. tuberculosis has to be proven corresponding to WHO definition. In addition, initial response to an appropriate therapy must be observed. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is defined as new or worsening of lymphadenopathy, radiological features, neurological signs or serositis as major criteria and of B-symptoms, respiratory symptoms or abdominal pain as minor criteria. Unmasking TB-IRIS is defined as a new presentation of a TB infection within 3 months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). There is no consensus case definition in HIV-negative patients. In a review on TB-IRIS, Lanzafame et al suggested that the diagnosis of TB-IRIS in HIV-negative patients has to be taken into consideration if there is worsening of TB-related symptoms and/or radiological findings observed shortly after an initial improvement on an adequate antituberculosis therapy. This deterioration can occur at the primary site of TB infection or at a new location. Other conditions reducing the efficacy of the antituberculosis therapy or explaining clinical worsening such as poor treatment adherence, malabsorption of antituberculosis therapy, drug side effects, drug-resistant TB, malignancies and other infections must be ruled out.

In our case, non-adherence was ruled out due to reliably performed DOT and sufficient drug levels. Therapeutic drug monitoring allowed excluding altered drug metabolism like rapid metabolism. Clinically, there were no signs for additional infection or malignancies.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116euVzv]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) with HHV-8–related KS — frequency, risk factors, and management: "When initiating ART, IRIS may occur among patients with HHV-8-related KS, PEL, or MCD", and in KS "KS-IRIS is characterized by either first presentation of KS ("unmasking") or paradoxical worsening of pre-existing KS and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality". Reported frequency includes that KS-IRIS is "occurring in 6% to 29% of patients with KS and HIV who are initiating ART", with sub-Saharan African cohorts reporting "18% to 31% of adults initiating ART". Risk factors listed are "advanced KS tumor stage (T1), pre-treatment HIV viral load > 5 log10 copies/mL, detectable pre-treatment plasma HHV-8, and initiation of ART alone without concurrent chemotherapy". Management statements are that "Treatment of KS-IRIS includes systemic chemotherapy and supportive measures" and "Steroids are strongly discouraged for managing KS-IRIS because corticosteroid therapy has been associated with exacerbation of pre-existing KS in people with HIV (AIII)".

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Managing paradoxical TB-IRIS includes evidence from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing that prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) reduced a combined endpoint of days hospitalized plus outpatient therapeutic procedures, with more rapid symptom and radiographic improvement and no reduction in mortality, noting life-threatening neurological cases were excluded; for central nervous system involvement, corticosteroids (either intravenous dexamethasone or oral prednisone) are described as beneficial at presentation. If 4 weeks of prednisone is insufficient, a more gradual steroid taper over 2 to 3 months is recommended (BIII) and should be guided by repeated clinical assessment; corticosteroids should be avoided in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, and case reports describe responses to TNF-blockers or thalidomide in steroid-refractory, prolonged IRIS.

### Plasma interleukin-18 levels are a biomarker of innate immune responses that predict and characterize tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^1156J2qu]. AIDS (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is a substantial problem in HIV/TB coinfected patients commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART). The immunopathogenesis of TB-IRIS includes increased production of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, including interleukin-18, which is a signature cytokine of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pyrin containing protein-3 inflammasome. We compared plasma levels of interleukin-18 and other biomarkers of monocyte/macrophage activation in the prediction and characterization of TB-IRIS.

Methods

Biomarkers were assayed pre-ART and during TB-IRIS, or equivalent time-point, in a case-control study of Malaysian HIV patients with paradoxical or unmasking TB-IRIS (n = 15), TB no IRIS (n = 14), and no TB or IRIS (n = 15). Findings for interleukin-18 were verified in another cohort of patients with paradoxical TB-IRIS (n = 26) and their controls (n = 22) from India.

Results

Interleukin-18 was higher in TB-IRIS patients pre-ART and during the event in both Malaysian patients (P < 0.0001) and Indian patients (P < 0.01). CXCL10 was higher pre-ART (P < 0.001), mainly in paradoxical TB-IRIS patients, and during TB-IRIS (P < 0.001), whereas CXCL8 was only higher during TB-IRIS (P < 0.001). Soluble(s) CD14 was increased in all patients with HIV/TB coinfection pre-ART and during TB-IRIS or equivalent time-point, compared with patients without TB. In contrast, interferon-γ was lower before and during TB-IRIS. By receiver operating curve analysis, CXCL10, and/or interleukin-18 pre-ART were predictive of TB-IRIS.

Conclusion

Plasma interleukin-18 levels pre-ART are candidate biomarkers for predicting paradoxical and unmasking TB-IRIS and should be investigated for risk stratification and elucidation of disease pathogenesis.

### Elevated interleukin 8 and T-helper 1 and T-helper 17 cytokine levels prior to antiretroviral therapy in participants who developed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome during ACTG A5164 [^112Q6PvE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) reflects an aberrant immune response that can develop in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Its pathogenesis remains unclear.

Methods

We performed a nested case-control study using specimens from ACTG A5164. We compared plasma biomarkers and T-cell subsets in 19 IRIS and 39 control participants at study entry, ART initiation, and IRIS and used conditional logistic regression to develop IRIS predictive models. We evaluated the effect of corticosteroids on biomarker levels.

Results

Eleven and 8 participants developed paradoxical and unmasking IRIS, respectively, none while still receiving corticosteroids. Compared to controls, cases displayed elevations at study entry in interleukin (IL) 8, T-helper (Th) 1 (IL-2, interferon [IFN]-γ, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) and Th17 (IL-17) cytokine levels that persisted through ART initiation and IRIS. In logistic regression, baseline higher IFN-γ and TNF were strong predictors of IRIS. Participants who received corticosteroids and later developed IRIS had marked increases in IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-γ at the time of IRIS. T-cell activation markers did not differ in cases and controls prior to ART but were increased in cases at the time of IRIS.

Conclusions

Increased IL-8, Th1, and Th17 cytokine levels in IRIS patients precede ART initiation and could help identify patient populations at higher risk for IRIS.

### Standardized methods for enhanced quality and comparability of tuberculous meningitis studies [^111Fc4w8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Paradoxical Reactions

Clinical deterioration after the start of antituberculosis treatment — commonly called paradoxical reactions and associated with increased intracerebral inflammation — occurs in approximately 30% of HIV-uninfected individuals with TBM and around 50% of those who are HIV infected. Paradoxical reactions are associated with new or worsening intracerebral tuberculomas, hydrocephalus, infarcts, and/or spinal radiculomyelitis. In HIV-infected subjects recently started on antiretroviral therapy, these events may be defined as TBM- IRIS following the International Network for the Study of HIV-Associated IRIS criteria, modified for TBM.

All suspected paradoxical reactions and their timing with respect to antituberculosis drug initiation should be recorded (Table 4). When possible, providers should investigate all suspected paradoxical reactions with brain imaging and document the findings, management given, and outcomes. Alternative causes that should be excluded as far as possible include drug resistance, poor adherence to treatment, drug-related adverse events, and other opportunistic infections. We also recommend that all WHO HIV stage 4 illnesses should be recorded throughout the course of TBM treatment (Table 4).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) monitoring and adverse events, including immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS): Patients may develop PML before starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or may manifest PML as an unmasking IRIS event after immune reconstitution with antiretroviral therapy (ART); during cART, neurologic stability or improvement and prolonged survival are associated with reduced levels of JCV DNA in CSF, appearance of JCV-specific antibody in CSF, and presence of JCV-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses. After cART is initiated and CD4 counts rise, some patients experience neurologic improvement, but worsening neurologic manifestations after initiation of ART may represent the natural history of PML or a paradoxical reaction from inflammatory responses to JCV potentiated by cART-induced immune reconstitution, called IRIS; examples have occurred in children, and the overall prevalence of cART-associated IRIS in children is unknown. Inflammatory PML should be considered in cART-treated children with advanced neurologic deterioration and contrast-enhancing demyelinating lesions on MRI, even if immunological and virological measures show improvement in HIV status. Retrospective data suggest that early and prolonged treatment with steroids may be beneficial for some patients in whom immune reconstitution with ART activates an inflammatory response to JCV; no clinical trial data exist to substantiate the anecdotal evidence.

### Unmasking of PML by HAART: unusual clinical features and the role of IRIS [^112cNAZW]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2010). Low credibility.

For patients with HIV/AIDS, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently the only effective therapy for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a viral-induced demyelinating disease caused by polyomavirus JC. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) following initiation of HAART can cause paradoxical clinical deterioration in patients with established PML. Because the onset of PML follows soon after initiation of HAART in some cases (unmasking), we investigated the role IRIS plays in unmasked PML. We reviewed records of 20 PML cases seen from 1997–2006 at the UCSD HIV primary care clinic. Eight cases presented with PML symptoms within 6months of initiating HAART (referred to hereafter as unmasked PML), six patients were diagnosed with PML before initiating HAART, and six were diagnosed more than 6months after starting HAART. Patients with unmasked PML constituted 40% of our series, had relatively long survival, and commonly (50%) had lesions exclusively in the posterior fossa, a localization not previously reported with such a high prevalence. Only 3 of the 8 patients with unmasked PML had IRIS reactions as evidenced by contrast enhancement around lesions on MRI, suggesting that IRIS is not necessary for the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

### Recurrence of symptoms following cryptococcal meningitis: characterizing a diagnostic conundrum with multiple etiologies [^116X1vtS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cryptococcal meningitis is a common cause of AIDS-related mortality. Although symptom recurrence after initial treatment is common, the etiology is often difficult to decipher. We sought to summarize characteristics, etiologies, and outcomes among persons with second-episode symptomatic recurrence.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled Ugandans with cryptococcal meningitis and obtained patient characteristics, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cryptococcosis histories, clinical outcomes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis results. We independently adjudicated cases of second-episode meningitis to categorize patients as (1) microbiological relapse, (2) paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), (3) persistent elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) only, or (4) persistent symptoms only, along with controls of primary cryptococcal meningitis. We compared groups with chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis tests as appropriate.

Results

724 participants were included (n = 607 primary episode, 81 relapse, 28 paradoxical IRIS, 2 persistently elevated ICP, 6 persistent symptoms). Participants with culture-positive relapse had lower CD4 (25 cells/μL; IQR: 9–76) and lower CSF white blood cell (WBC; 4 cells/μL; IQR: 4–85) counts than paradoxical IRIS (CD4: 78 cells/μL; IQR: 47–142; WBC: 45 cells/μL; IQR: 8–128). Among those with CSF WBC < 5 cells/μL, 86% (43/50) had relapse. Among those with CD4 counts < 50 cells/μL, 91% (39/43) had relapse. Eighteen-week mortality (from current symptom onset) was 47% among first episodes of cryptococcal meningitis, 31% in culture-positive relapses, and 14% in paradoxical IRIS.

Conclusions

Poor immune reconstitution was noted more often in relapse than IRIS as evidenced by lower CSF WBC and blood CD4 counts. These easily obtained laboratory values should prompt initiation of antifungal treatment while awaiting culture results.

### New onset or exacerbation of uveitis with infliximab: paradoxical effects? [^114B83MH]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Materials and methods

This retrospective study included four patients with new-onset or exacerbated uveitis following administration of infliximab who were followed up at Japan Community Health Care Organization (JCHO) Osaka Hospital in Japan.

The medical records of the patients were reviewed for demographic data (age and gender), ocular and systemic diagnoses, type of TNF inhibitors and dosage schedule, previous immunosuppressive therapies, concurrent drug usage, response to ocular and articular treatment, and ophthalmic findings (laterality, the location and degree of ocular inflammation, and visual acuity levels).

Patient and public involvement statement

Patients were not directly involved in the conception, design or interpretation of this study. However, we have a plan to disseminate this information widely to ophthalmologists and rheumatologists as well as potential patients.

### Circulating inflammatory biomarkers can predict and characterize tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^111rMp5L]. AIDS (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify inflammatory biomarker profiles during paradoxical and unmasking tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS), and determine whether differences in biomarkers prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) predict subsequent development of TB-IRIS.

Design

Case-control study within a cohort of patients initiating ART in South Africa (n = 498).

Methods

Participants were followed up for 24 weeks for development of TB-IRIS. Plasma samples were collected at baseline and presentation with symptoms. Groups of cases and controls were as follows: pre-ART TB and developed paradoxical TB-IRIS (n = 9); pre-ART TB but no IRIS (n = 12); no pre-ART TB but developed unmasking TB-IRIS (n = 13); no pre-ART TB and no TB or IRIS during treatment (n = 12). Concentrations of 18 cytokines and chemokines, and C-reactive protein (CRP), were measured and compared.

Results

Event samples were drawn a median of 28 days after ART initiation [interquartile range (IQR) 14–56 days]. During paradoxical TB-IRIS events, there were lower median concentrations of interleukin-10 [IL-10; 22.1 (IQR 15.3–34.9) vs. 82.2 (29.4–128.4) pg/ml, P = 0.047] and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [MCP-1; 27.6 (20.0–29.7) vs. 71.4 (40.6–77.8) pg/ml, P = 0.005], and higher CRP: IL-10 ratio [2.2 × 10³ (1.8–3.4) vs. 0.3 × 10³ (0.2–0.5), P = 0.003] than in controls. Patients who developed unmasking TB-IRIS had higher median pre-ART levels of CRP [25 (8–47) vs. 6 (lower limit of detection, LLD-12) mg/l, P = 0.046] and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) [9.1 (4.4–24.7) vs. 0.9 (LLD-8.7) pg/ml, P = 0.032] than controls.

Conclusion

Patients with unmasking TB-IRIS had higher pre-ART levels of plasma IFN-γ and CRP, consistent with preexisting subclinical TB. Paradoxical TB-IRIS was associated with lower levels of biomarkers of monocyte and regulatory T-cell activity, and higher CRP.

### Pulmonary manifestations of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^116u3MrN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a common occurrence in HIV patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART), and pulmonary involvement is an important feature of tuberculosis-IRIS and pneumocystis-IRIS. Pulmonologists need an awareness of the timing, presentation and treatment of pulmonary IRIS.

Recent Findings

Case definitions for tuberculosis-IRIS and cryptococcal-IRIS have been published by the International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI). A number of studies have addressed validation of clinical case definitions and the optimal time to commence ART after diagnosis of an opportunistic infection in HIV patients. The pathogenesis of IRIS is being assessed at a molecular level, increasing our understanding of mechanisms and possible targets for future preventive and therapeutic strategies.

Summary

Tuberculosis-IRIS, nontuberculosis mycobacterial-IRIS and pneumocystis-IRIS occur within days to weeks of starting ART, causing substantial morbidity, but low mortality. Cryptococcal-IRIS usually occurs later in the course of ART, and may be associated with appreciable mortality. Early recognition of unmasking and paradoxical IRIS affecting the lung allows timely initiation of antimicrobial and/or immunomodulatory therapies.

Talaromycosis — starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) indicates that no studies exist regarding the optimal time to start ART in patients with HIV who have talaromycosis; in the IVAP trial, the median time to ART initiation was 3 weeks (range: 1 week–5 weeks), and paradoxical IRIS events occurred only in the itraconazole arm (in 11.4% of patients).

### Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in children [^116jW7Sy]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Paradoxical tuberculosis (TB)-associated Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) is a common complication of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) initiation in adults residing in resource-limited regions. Little is known about the burden and presentation of TB-IRIS in children initiating cART while receiving TB treatment.

Methods

Prospective cohort study of South African children initiating cART while on TB treatment. Children were assessed clinically and by chest x-ray before starting cART and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks post cART initiation. All children who presented with any signs or symptoms suggestive of paradoxical TB-IRIS were classified according to the consensus adult TB-IRIS case definition developed by the International Network for Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) and reviewed by an independent expert panel.

Results

In 7 of the 104 children enrolled in the cohort, symptoms and/or clinical or radiological signs suggestive of paradoxical TB-IRIS developed after a median of 14 days of cART. In two of these cases, there was agreement between the INSHI case definition and the expert panel. In an additional 3 cases, the INSHI criteria were fulfilled but the expert panel made an alternative diagnosis of pneumonia (n = 2) and poor adherence to cART (n = 1).

Conclusions

The burden of paradoxical TB-IRIS in children with underlying TB initiating cART is low. Including response to antibiotic treatment for pneumonia as a criterion for an alternative diagnosis may improve the specificity of the INSHI case definition.

### Disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a patient who is immunocompromised in the setting of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^115KqwG3]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection first described in 1892. More than 95% of annual cases occur in Arizona and California. It is an opportunistic infection (OI) transmitted via inhalation of airborne spores (arthroconidia) and rarely via percutaneous inoculation into a tissue or solid organ transplantation in patients who are immunocompromised and with HIV. With the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence of OIs has markedly reduced; however, OIs continue to occur, particularly in patients who present late for medical care or delay ART initiation. In rare cases, immunodeficient individuals may experience a paradoxical worsening or unmasking of OI symptoms, known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We present a case of a 31-year-old man with disseminated coccidioidomycosis affecting the spleen, lymph nodes, lungs, bone marrow, and adrenals who developed IRIS after the initiation of ART.

### Neurologic manifestations of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: a case series [^113JikSj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Paradoxical neurologic tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs within 3 months after starting combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). The reports in the published literature are anecdotal, and the prevalence and outcomes of neurologic TB-IRIS are unknown.

Methods

We prospectively assessed patients with suspected TB-IRIS from June 2005 through October 2007 at our hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. We defined paradoxical TB-IRIS and paradoxical neurologic TB-IRIS with use of consensus clinical case definitions. We collected data on tuberculosis diagnosis, ART, details of TB-IRIS diagnosis, other opportunistic infections, corticosteroid use, and outcome.

Results

We reviewed 279 patients with suspected TB-IRIS, 54 (19%) of whom had suspected neurologic TB-IRIS, and 225 (81%) of whom had suspected non-neurologic TB-IRIS. Paradoxical TB-IRIS was diagnosed in 190 patients; 23 (12%) of these 190 patients had neurologic TB-IRIS (95% confidence interval, 7%-17%). Eight had meningitis, 7 had tuberculoma, 5 had both tuberculoma and meningitis, and 3 had radiculomyelopathy. Twenty (87%) of the 23 patients with neurologic TB-IRIS required hospital admission (median duration, 12 days; interquartile range, 6–24 days), and 21 (91%) received corticosteroids (median duration, 58 days; interquartile range, 29–86 days). Outcomes 6 months after the initial assessment for neurologic deterioration were as follows: 16 (70%) of the patients were alive (10 of these patients had documented full physical and mental recovery), 3 (13%) were dead, and 4 (17%) were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions

Paradoxical neurologic TB-IRIS accounts for 12% of paradoxical TB-IRIS cases. Neurologic TB-IRIS causes considerable short-term morbidity but has reasonable long-term outcomes. Further research is needed to devise optimal diagnostic and management strategies for patients with tuberculosis who experience neurologic deterioration after starting ART.

### Cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV-1-infected individuals: proposed clinical case definitions [^113oM5Hw]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may present as a clinical worsening or new presentation of cryptococcal disease after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and is thought to be caused by recovery of cryptococcus-specific immune responses. We have reviewed reports of cryptococcal IRIS and have developed a consensus case definition specifically for paradoxical crytopcoccal IRIS in patients with HIV-1 and known cryptococcal disease before ART, and a separate definition for incident cryptococcosis developed during ART (termed ART-associated cryptococcosis), for which a proportion of cases are likely to be unmasking cryptococcal IRIS. These structured case definitions are intended to aid design of future clinical, epidemiological, and immunopathological studies of cryptococcal IRIS, to standardise diagnostic criteria, and to facilitate comparisons between studies. As for definitions of tuberculosis-associated IRIS, definitions for cryptococcal IRIS should be regarded as preliminary until further insights into the immunopathology of IRIS permit their refinement.

### Efficacy of adjunctive sertraline for the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: an open-label dose-ranging study [^115mKgw5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Unlike prior cohorts, we observed no excess mortality over 12 weeks in persons who remained CSF culture positive at 2 weeks, – suggesting the benefit of sertraline may be extended into the consolidation phase due to the additive antimicrobial effects of combination sertraline and fluconazole. Depression is common in this population (77%), and sertraline would be the obvious antidepressant of choice, if indicated. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of sertraline in consolidation and maintenance phases of therapy, during induction therapy in the absence of amphotericin, and for non-meningitis manifestations of cryptococcosis including asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia identified as part of screening programs.

A possible, unanticipated benefit of extending adjunctive sertraline beyond the induction period was the observed low incidence of symptomatic recurrence, including both culture-positive cryptococcal relapse and paradoxical IRIS. Although patients were only actively followed for 12 weeks and passively thereafter, the incidence of ~5% paradoxical IRIS and two late relapse cases appeared to be lower than the 17% IRIS incidence during the COAT trial, and lower than the 25–30% paradoxical cryptococcal-IRIS observed in two cohorts using amphotericin alone as induction therapy with fluconazole 400mg/day consolidation therapy. The lack of achieving eventual CSF culture sterility is a major risk factor for IRIS and relapse. Improved overall microbiologic activity on active and quiescent yeasts may be plausible explanations for the low level of recurrence observed. It is also plausible that sertraline may have immunoregulatory effects on immune activation resulting in a decreased incidence of paradoxical IRIS. The possible decreased IRIS and relapse with adjunctive sertraline is intriguing and requires further investigation in a randomized trial.

### Early ART after cryptococcal meningitis is associated with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and macrophage activation in a multisite randomized trial [^114rfSzP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Previous cryptococcal-IRIS studies have demonstrated CSF elevations in many proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-α, interferon-γ, G-CSF, IL-6). In this trial, IL-13 was the only T-cell–related cytokine increased with early ART. However, CSF was only systematically sampled 6 days after ART initiation. Had later samples been collected, it is possible that an evolution in CNS immune response may have been demonstrated: from cellular infiltrate, increased macrophage activation and chemokine secretion, to widespread elevation of proinflammatory cytokines. In a separate COAT trial analysis using flow cytometry, highly activated CD8 + T cells predominated in CSF at diagnosis (median CD4:CD8 ratio = 0.06), yet at paradoxical-IRIS, CD4 + T cells had increased in CSF (median CD4:CD8 ratio = 0.33).

In contrast to the CSF effects observed with early ART, there was no evidence to suggest early ART led to increased systemic inflammatory response. Serum cytokine and chemokine concentrations were not elevated, and CRP initially decreased. This may reflect compartmentalization of immune response, which has been reported in tuberculosis meningitis paradoxical-IRIS, where individuals had marked elevation in CSF proinflammatory cytokines but little change in serum. However, in our study at 21 days, serum CRP was higher among persons receiving early ART (median 14 days of ART), possibly reflecting the evolution of inflammatory response on the path to paradoxical cryptococcal-IRIS in certain patients.

There are limitations of this study. Due to the COAT trial being halted prematurely, these immunologic analyses are underpowered. Reported associations are significant in terms of calculated P values, but due to the exploratory nature of the study, no adjustment was made for multiple comparisons. In addition, some of the significant findings reported here are from subgroup analyses; this was considered appropriate given the heterogeneity in demographics, clinical parameters, and immune response between the 3 trial sites. Finally, CSF was not available for all study subjects at day 14 (due to early mortality, approximately 10% LP refusal, and approximately 8% normalized intracranial pressure with a small volume of CSF collected); however, CSF was available for over 80% of trial participants.

### Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: case definitions for use in resource-limited settings [^114xRHqS]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has emerged as an important early complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, especially in patients with tuberculosis. However, there are no consensus case definitions for IRIS or tuberculosis-associated IRIS. Moreover, previously proposed case definitions are not readily applicable in settings where laboratory resources are limited. As a result, existing studies on tuberculosis-associated IRIS have used a variety of non-standardised general case definitions. To rectify this problem, around 100 researchers, including microbiologists, immunologists, clinicians, epidemiologists, clinical trialists, and public-health specialists from 16 countries met in Kampala, Uganda, in November, 2006. At this meeting, consensus case definitions for paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS, ART-associated tuberculosis, and unmasking tuberculosis-associated IRIS were derived, which can be used in high-income and resource-limited settings. It is envisaged that these definitions could be used by clinicians and researchers in a variety of settings to promote standardisation and comparability of data.

### Robust reconstitution of tuberculosis-specific polyfunctional CD4 + T-Cell responses and rising systemic interleukin 6 in paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^111DTLgJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The immunopathogenesis of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) remains unclear. We determined the association between pathogen-specific T-cell responses and development of paradoxical TB-IRIS on antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Methods

This study was nested within a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and baseline CD4 counts ≤ 125 cells/µL initiating ART. T-cell immune activation (CD38, HLA-DR, and PD-1 expression), phenotype, and polyfunctional pathogen-specific cellular immune responses prior to and 4 weeks after ART initiation were determined by flow cytometry. Patients with TB-IRIS were compared to non-IRIS controls using χ(2) and rank-sum tests and logistic regression.

Results

TB-IRIS patients and controls had similar CD4 counts, levels of T-cell-associated immune activation, frequencies of T-cell memory subsets, and frequencies of interferon gamma (IFN-γ(+))/interleukin 2 (IL-2(+))/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α(+)) CD4(+) T-cells prior to ART initiation. After ART initiation, cellular immune activation and T-cell subsets also were similar in TB-IRIS patients and controls. In contrast, TB-IRIS patients had significantly greater early increases in the frequency of tuberculosis-specific polyfunctional IFN-γ(+)/IL-2(+)/TNF-α(+) CD4(+) T-cells on ART (P = .02); each quartile increase in the percentage of these cells was independently associated with a 2.8-fold increased risk of TB-IRIS (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 7.5-fold). In a secondary analysis, patients with TB-IRIS had rapid, concomitant increases in tuberculosis-specific adaptive immune responses and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels, whereas controls with similarly rapid increases in cellular immune function had IL-6 levels that tended to decrease on ART.

Conclusions

Rapid expansion of tuberculosis-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T-cell responses, likely linked to increases in IL-6, is associated with development of paradoxical TB-IRIS.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) — immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) may occur among HHV-8-infected patients initiating ART, and in KS-IRIS either first presentation of KS or paradoxical worsening after ART initiation can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality; in the U.S. and Europe, KS-IRIS has been reported in 6% to 34% of KS patients with HIV who are initiating ART, and in sub-Saharan Africa in 18% to 61% of adults initiating ART treatment. Risk factors for developing KS-IRIS include advanced KS tumor stage (T1), pre-treatment HIV viral load > 5 log10 copies/mL, detectable pre-treatment plasma HHV-8, and initiation of ART alone without concurrent chemotherapy; treatment includes systemic chemotherapy and supportive measures, and steroids are strongly discouraged for management of KS-IRIS (AIII). No data exist on ART complicating primary effusion lymphoma at initiation, and a small number of patients with HHV-associated MCD have experienced clinical decompensation upon initiation of ART; although incidence and predictors are not well-described, initiation of ART should not be delayed (AIII).

### Therapy insight: CNS manifestations of HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^114RRXPY]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection has prolonged the lives of patients with AIDS. It is increasingly being recognized, however, that following initiation of this therapy some patients can develop a paradoxical neurological deterioration, despite dramatic improvements in HIV viral load and CD4+ T-cell counts. This immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in the CNS is emerging as an important neurological complication, particularly as antiretroviral therapy is now becoming readily available worldwide. Currently, there are no guidelines for prevention, diagnosis or treatment of the CNS manifestations of IRIS. Even in patients with an acute presentation, the diagnosis can be challenging. Furthermore, it is possible that more-chronic forms of the syndrome exist but remain unrecognized. Here, we review the various clinical presentations of CNS IRIS, and discuss options for their management.

### The immunopathogenesis of cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome: understanding a conundrum [^114PXUFB]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cryptococcal meningitis causes significant mortality among HIV-infected patients, despite antifungal therapy and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In patients with cryptococcal meningitis, ART is often complicated by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), manifesting as unmasking of previously unrecognized subclinical infection (unmasking CM-IRIS) or paradoxical worsening of symptoms in the central nervous system after prior improvement with antifungal therapy (paradoxical CM-IRIS). We review our current understanding of the pathogenesis of this phenomenon, focusing on unifying innate and adaptive immune mechanisms leading to the development of this often fatal syndrome.

Recent Findings

We propose that HIV-associated CD4 T-cell depletion, chemokine-driven trafficking of monocytes into cerebrospinal fluid in response to cryptococcal meningitis, and poor localized innate cytokine responses lead to inadequate cryptococcal killing and clearance of the fungus. Subsequent ART-associated recovery of T-cell signaling and restored cytokine responses, characterized by IFN-γ production, triggers an inflammatory response. The inflammatory response triggered by ART is dysregulated because of impaired homeostatic and regulatory mechanisms, culminating in the development of CM-IRIS.

Summary

Despite our incomplete understanding of the immunopathogenesis of CM-IRIS, emerging data exploring innate and adaptive immune responses could be exploited to predict, prevent and manage CM-IRIS and associated morbid consequences.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112LRRhi]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — IRIS is described as ART-induced restoration of pathogen-specific immune responses to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB), resulting in paradoxical or unmasking presentations with inflammatory manifestations; TB-IRIS has been reported in 8% to more than 40% of people who start ART after TB diagnosis and is infrequently associated with mortality. Predictors include a baseline CD4 count < 50 cells/mm3, higher on-ART CD4 counts, high pre-ART and lower on-ART HIV viral loads, severity of TB disease (especially high pathogen burden), and a short interval between initiation of TB and HIV treatments; most IRIS in HIV/TB disease occurs < 3 months from ART start. In general, the Panel recommends continuing ART without interruption during IRIS (AIII).

### Role of the interleukin 10 family of cytokines in patients with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with HIV infection and tuberculosis [^115f3291]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Baseline Characteristics of Participants

A total of 20 patients with paradoxical tuberculosis-IRIS and 20 non-IRIS controls were analyzed.shows a summary of the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for the patients analyzed in this study. The 2 groups of patients were well matched with respect to sex, age, and baseline CD4 + T-cell count. There were no significant differences between the tuberculosis-IRIS and non-IRIS groups in terms of previous tuberculosis, tuberculosis form, and median days from cART initiation to IRIS onset (or to sample collection, in the case of non-IRIS controls). However, tuberculosis-IRIS patients were more likely to have a shorter duration between tuberculosis treatment and commencement of cART (P = .028).

### Frequency, severity, and prediction of tuberculous meningitis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^112X2Dy3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Paradoxical tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs in 8%–43% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected patients receiving tuberculosis treatment after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). Tuberculosis IRIS results from rapid restoration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis –specific immune responses, but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood.

Neurological tuberculosis IRIS occurs in a substantial proportion (12%) of tuberculosis IRIS cases and is the commonest cause of central nervous system (CNS) deterioration during the first year of ART in settings of high tuberculosis/HIV prevalence. Mortality is high (up to 30%) in those affected. Manifestations of neurological tuberculosis IRIS include meningitis, intracranial tuberculomata, brain abscesses, radiculomyelitis, and spinal epidural abscesses. There are no prospective studies describing tuberculous meningitis (TBM) IRIS; only isolated cases and 1 case series of neurological tuberculosis IRIS have been published. Although consensus now exists that ART should be started early (around 2 weeks) in HIV/tuberculosis-coinfected patients with severe immunosuppression, a potential exception is TBM because of the perceived risk of TBM-IRIS. However, the frequency and severity of this complication are not well documented and no means exist to predict the syndrome.

We therefore investigated clinical and laboratory findings in ART-naive HIV-infected patients who presented with TBM. We undertook serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling in patients who did and did not develop TBM-IRIS.

### HIV-associated opportunistic CNS infections: pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^114rdnN8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Nearly 30 years after the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), CNS opportunistic infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive individuals. Unknown HIV-positive disease status, antiretroviral drug resistance, poor drug compliance, and recreational drug abuse are factors that continue to influence the morbidity and mortality of infections. The clinical and radiographic pattern of CNS opportunistic infections is unique in the setting of HIV infection: opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients often have characteristic clinical and radiological presentations that can differ from the presentation of opportunistic infections in immunocompetent patients and are often sufficient to establish the diagnosis. ART in the setting of these opportunistic infections can lead to a paradoxical worsening caused by an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In this Review, we discuss several of the most common CNS opportunistic infections: cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis and cytomegalovirus infection, with an emphasis on clinical pearls, pathological findings, MRI findings and treatment. Moreover, we discuss the risk factors, pathophysiology and management of IRIS. We also summarize the challenges that remain in management of CNS opportunistic infections, which includes the lack of phase II and III clinical trials, absence of antimicrobials for infections such as PML, and controversy regarding the use of corticosteroids for treatment of IRIS.

C-IRIS (panel 12) — for suspected paradoxical C-IRIS, carefully exclude recurrent cryptococcal disease or new infective or non-infective conditions before attributing symptoms and signs to C-IRIS; perform a brain MRI and lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure and get CSF for microbiological and biochemical analyses, and treatment of C-IRIS should include therapeutic lumbar puncture and symptomatic therapy, such as analgesia, antiemetics, and antiepileptics, if appropriate. Continue antifungal therapy. High-dose prednisolone or prednisone (usually 0·5–1·0 mg/kg daily) or dexamethasone (usually 0·2–0·3 mg/kg daily), planned over 4–6 weeks, can be considered in those with persistent symptoms who are unresponsive to therapeutic lumbar punctures; rarely a second steroid course with taper is needed. Do not stop ART. Cases of steroid-refractory or recurrent C-IRIS should be discussed with experts in the field, and steroids could be considered for PIIRS.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1114rwX4]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

PML–immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) — PML has been reported to occur within the first weeks to months after initiating ART with clinical and radiographic features that differ from classical PML, including lesions with contrast enhancement, edema and mass effect, and a more rapid clinical course. As with other presentations of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), it is more likely after advanced HIV with low CD4 counts and greater decline in HIV viral load on initiation of ARV. This presentation has been referred to as inflammatory PML or PML-IRIS. Both unmasking of cryptic PML and paradoxical worsening in a patient with an established PML diagnosis have been observed. Histopathology typically demonstrates perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltration.

### Proposed clinical case definition for cytomegalovirus-immune recovery retinitis [^114BRWYg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis has been extensively described in patients with advanced or late human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease under ineffective treatment of opportunistic infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure. However, there is limited information about patients who develop active cytomegalovirus retinitis as an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after successful initiation of ART. Therefore, a case definition of cytomegalovirus-immune recovery retinitis (CMV-IRR) is proposed here.

Methods

We reviewed medical records of 116 HIV-infected patients with CMV retinitis attending our institution during January 2003-June 2012. We retrospectively studied HIV-infected patients who had CMV retinitis on ART initiation or during the subsequent 6 months. Clinical and immunological characteristics of patients with active CMV retinitis were described.

Results

Of the 75 patients under successful ART included in the study, 20 had improvement of CMV retinitis. The remaining 55 patients experienced CMV-IRR; 35 of those developed CMV-IRR after ART initiation (unmasking CMV-IRR) and 20 experienced paradoxical clinical worsening of retinitis (paradoxical CMV-IRR). Nineteen patients with CMV-IRR had a CD4 count of ≥ 50 cells/µL. Six patients with CMV-IRR subsequently developed immune recovery uveitis.

Conclusions

There is no case definition for CMV-IRR, although this condition is likely to occur after successful initiation of ART, even in patients with high CD4 T-cell counts. By consequence, we propose the case definitions for paradoxical and unmasking CMV-IRR. We recommend close follow-up of HIV-infected patients following ART initiation.

TB Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)

Two major forms of TB immune reconstitution syndrome (TB-IRIS) are recognized and these are called paradoxical TB IRIS and unmasking TB-IRIS and case definitions have been published. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is an important cause of morbidity in patients known to have HIV-associated TB and occurs within the first weeks of ART. The typical clinical course of paradoxical TB-IRIS is as follows. Initiation of TB treatment in a patient with HIV infection and newly diagnosed TB results in clinical stabilization or improvement. However, subsequent introduction of ART is accompanied by recurrence or exacerbation of TB symptoms with new or worsening clinical signs of TB that often have a marked inflammatory component.

While seldom life-threatening, deaths due to paradoxical TB-IRIS have been described. Two major risk factors identified in observational studies and in clinical trials are a low CD4 count prior to ART and a shorter interval between starting TB treatment and ART. There is no diagnostic test for TB-IRIS; the diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and exclusion of alternative diagnoses such as bacterial infection or drug resistant TB. However, drug-resistant TB is not only in the differential diagnosis as an alternative cause of the clinical deterioration but may also be a risk factor for the development of paradoxical TB-IRIS.

### T cell infiltration into the brain triggers pulmonary dysfunction in murine cryptococcus-associated IRIS [^115u5eXs]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Although our mouse model mimics human C-IRIS, the inherent differences in biology and immune responses between the mouse C-IRIS model and human C-IRIS situation should not be ignored. For instance, C-IRIS patients develop respiratory failure at the point of brain/uncal herniation. However, although our C-IRIS model mice show brain edema, which may trigger brain herniation, such mice do not show brain/uncal herniation when mice develop respiratory failure. The basis for these differences is not understood and merits further investigation. It is unlikely that any single animal model will fully recapitulate the human disease in all its details. Thus, developing other C-IRIS animal models that overcome current limitations or mimic paradoxical C-IRIS is essential. Further investigation of IRIS pathogenesis using our and future models would lead to developing therapies for C-IRIS.

In conclusion, we illustrate that pulmonary dysfunction associated with the C-IRIS condition in mice may be attributed to the infiltration of CD4 + T cells into the brain via the CCL8-CCR5 axis, which triggers NTS neuronal damage and neuronal disconnection via upregulated ephrin B3 and semaphorin 6B in CD4 + T cells. Currently, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids are prescribed to suppress excessive inflammation in C-IRIS patients. However, such immunosuppressive medications may impair the immune response to existing infections and render patients more vulnerable to contracting new infections. Collectively, we propose that the prevention of CCR5-specific CD4 + T cell migration and/or regulation of ephrin B3 and semaphorin 6B functions could be promising therapeutic candidates for the treatment or the prevention of C-IRIS.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115VVS3N]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — for preventing paradoxical TB-IRIS in high-risk patients (i.e., starting ART within 30 days after TB treatment initiation and a CD4 count ≤ 100/mm3) who are responding well to TB therapy and who do not have rifampin resistance, Kaposi sarcoma, or active hepatitis B (BI): prednisone 40 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 20 mg/day for 2 weeks. Managing paradoxical TB-IRIS: paradoxical reaction/IRIS that is not severe may be treated symptomatically (CIII), and for moderately severe paradoxical TB-IRIS, use of prednisone is recommended (AI), with dosing in patients on a rifampin-based regimen of prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, then 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks; in patients on a rifabutin plus boosted PI-based regimen: prednisone 1.0 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, then 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks; taper over 4 weeks (or longer) based on clinical symptoms, and a more gradual tapering schedule over 2 to 3 months is recommended for patients whose signs and symptoms have not improved or have worsened due to tapering (BIII).

### Successful repeat ECMO in a patient with AIDS and ARDS [^1119Vqde]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Due to the continuation of TMP/SMX for PjP and a negative bacterial culture result on reinstitution of ECMO, recurrent worsening of the primary disease or a new bacterial infection was less likely. Therefore, we suspected IRIS, a paradoxical clinical worsening after the initiation of ART, as the cause of his deteriorating respiratory status.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^11723vSQ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Paradoxical TB-IRIS risk factors and ART timing — risk factors are a low CD4 count at the start of ART, especially a CD4 count < 100 cells/mm3, high HIV viral load before ART, disseminated or extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and a short interval between starting TB treatment and initiating ART, particularly if ART is started within the first 1 to 2 months of TB treatment; although early ART increases the risk for TB-IRIS, ART should be started within 2 weeks of the diagnosis in patients with CD4 counts < 50 cells/mm3 and within 2 to 8 weeks of TB diagnosis in those with higher CD4 counts to reduce the risk of HIV progression and death (AI).

### Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome after early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in a randomized clinical trial [^114SSGq9]. AIDS (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze cases of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) in the CAMbodian Early versus Late Introduction of Antiretrovirals (CAMELIA) randomized trial designed to compare early (2 weeks) versus late (8 weeks) antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation after tuberculosis treatment onset in Cambodia (NCT00226434).

Methods

ART-naive adults with CD4 cell count of 200 cells/μl or less, newly diagnosed tuberculosis, and at least one follow-up visit after ART initiation were included in this analysis. Each case of suspected TB-IRIS was systematically validated by two physicians not involved in patients' management. Factors associated with occurrence of TB-IRIS were identified using the Cox proportional hazard model.

Results

Among 597 patients, 26% experienced TB-IRIS with an incidence rate of 37.9 cases per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 32.4–44.4]. Main clinical manifestations included new or worsening lymphadenopathy (77.4%) and fever (68.4%). Chest radiograph revealed new or worsening abnormalities in 53.4%. Symptoms resolved in 95.5% of patients. Six deaths were directly related to TB-IRIS. Initiating ART early increased the risk of TB-IRIS by 2.61 (95% CI 1.84–3.70). Extrapulmonary or disseminated tuberculosis, CD4 cell count of 100 cells/μl or less, and HIV RNA concentration more than 6 log10 copies/ml were also significantly associated with higher risk of TB-IRIS.

Conclusion

Shortening the delay between tuberculosis treatment onset and ART initiation to 2 weeks was associated with an increased risk of developing TB-IRIS. However, TB-IRIS was generally easily manageable. Given the marked reported survival advantage of early ART initiation after tuberculosis treatment onset, these data indicate that fear of TB-IRIS should not be an impediment to early ART in adults with advanced immunodeficiency in resource-limited, high burden settings.

### AIDS-related kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114muXJE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma — immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) clinical presentation and definition: IRIS is characterized by first presentation or paradoxical worsening of pre-existing KS infection following ART initiation, typically occurs within 3 months of ART initiation, but possible to occur any time after starting ART, and the risk of IRIS is higher in patients with baseline low CD4 T-cell counts and high HIV viral loads. Clinical manifestations may include development of new lesions or enlargement of existing lesions, worsening lymphadenopathy, or worsening edema, and the clinical presentation of IRIS may be challenging to distinguish from the natural history of progressive disease. PWH with advanced KS not on ART at the time of presentation, should start systemic therapy as soon as possible after the initiation of ART to minimize the risk of severe KS-IRIS, and if IRIS is suspected, consult with an HIV specialist.

### Reframing the clinical phenotype and management of cryptococcal meningitis [^1139i4wX]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Complications of cryptococcal meningitis

Clinical deterioration in patients established on treatment may herald CM relapse or treatment failure; an inflammatory treatment reaction; stroke or concurrent pathology (especially in immunocompromised hosts). In this scenario, reimaging and repeat CSF analysis for fungal culture are essential. Repeat CSF CrAg does not help and the presence of yeasts on microscopy should be ingored if cultures are sterile, as this implies non-viability. In patients with negative fungal cultures but persistent lymphocytic pleocytosis, one should consider a diagnosis of an inflammatory syndrome. In HIV-CM, starting antiretroviral therapy boosts immune function, improving recognition of fungal antigens and prompting a significant inflammatory response ('paradoxical' immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)). In a high-quality clinical trial, starting antiretroviral therapy 1–2 weeks after CM diagnosis was associated with increased 10-week mortality versus delayed initiation at 5 weeks. As such, in HIV-CM, one should measure the CD4 count at diagnosis, defer starting antiretroviral therapy until 4–6 weeks of antifungal treatment, and use the CD4 count to define fluconazole duration. Fluconazole can be stopped once viral suppression has been achieved and CD4 count exceeds 200 cells/µL. Inflammatory reactions also occur in HIV-negative subgroups, often in immunocompetent hosts. This is termed postinfectious inflammatory response syndrome, a rare phenomenon that occurs 3–5 weeks after starting treatment. Clinically, it resembles CM relapse but patients demonstrate fungal clearance. Consensus global guidelines advocate corticosteroid therapy with close monitoring and management of CSF pressure changes. Steroid-refractory patients may require cyclophosphamide.

Cryptococcomas are single or multifocal space occupying CNS lesions, more common in C. gattii. A more prolonged induction period of 4–6 weeks should be considered in these patients. Corticosteroids are indicated if there is perilesional oedema (seen in 75% of cases) and mass effect; they should be slowly tapered over 4–6 weeks to mitigate the risk of IRIS. Where possible, all cases should be discussed in an multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting involving a surgeon and neuroradiologist, given the wide radiological differential diagnosis for these lesions (including pyogenic brain abscess, tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis and neurocysticercosis), and their frequent need for surgical intervention. There are case reports of persistent radiological lesions in patients who have achieved microbiological and clinical cure.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116Qs1fi]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — epidemiology and prevention in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis state that an estimated 10 to 30% of people with HIV who have cryptococcal meningitis experience IRIS after initiation or reinitiation of effective ART and both unmasking (before start of antifungal therapy) or paradoxical (after start of antifungal therapy) IRIS may occur. People with HIV who have cryptococcal IRIS are more likely to be ART naive and those whose CSF has less inflammation on presentation seem to be at higher risk of cryptococcal IRIS. The risk of IRIS can be minimized by achieving CSF culture sterility before starting ART, using fluconazole 800 mg per day as consolidation therapy, and deferring ART initiation for 4 to 6 weeks from the start of antifungal therapy (AII).

### Validation of a published case definition for tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^116Axsxd]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) case definitions for tuberculosis (TB)-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in a South African cohort.

Methods

Prospective cohort of 498 adult HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy. Patients were followed up for 24 weeks and all clinical events were recorded. Events with TB-IRIS as possible cause were assessed by consensus expert opinion and INSHI case definition. Positive, negative, and chance-corrected agreement (kappa) were calculated, and reasons for disagreement were assessed.

Results

One hundred and two (20%) patients were receiving TB therapy at antiretroviral therapy initiation. Three hundred and thirty-three events were evaluated (74 potential paradoxical IRIS, 259 potential unmasking IRIS). Based on expert opinion, there were 18 cases of paradoxical IRIS associated with TB and/or other opportunistic disease. The INSHI criteria for TB-IRIS agreed in 13 paradoxical cases, giving positive agreement of 72.2%, negative agreement in 52/56 non-TB-IRIS events (92.9%), and kappa of 0.66. There were 19 unmasking TB-IRIS cases based on expert opinion, of which 12 were considered IRIS using the INSHI definition (positive agreement 63.2%). There was agreement in all 240 non-TB-IRIS events (negative agreement 100%) and kappa was 0.76.

Conclusion

There was good agreement between the INSHI case definition for both paradoxical and unmasking TB-IRIS and consensus expert opinion. These results support the use of this definition in clinical and research practice, with minor caveats in its application.

### Corticosteroid therapy, vitamin D status, and inflammatory cytokine profile in the HIV-tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^115QkQ3a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Africa accounts for 82% of the global human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associated tuberculosis burden. Combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) roll-out has grown steadily, with 54% of HIV-infected tuberculosis patients started on ART in South Africa. When HIV-1-infected persons start ART, the resulting rise in CD4 count and improved immune function partially restore pathogen specific immunity. However, 8%–43% of patients will experience paradoxical deterioration, termed tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). Initiating ART at lower CD4 count and advanced tuberculosis disease are the main factors associated with this syndrome. We have previously shown an association between increased circulating proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin [IL]-6, and interferon γ [IFN-γ]) and TB-IRIS. Corticosteroids (CTC) are antiinflammatory molecules, which have an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory T-cells while stimulating antiinflammatory and regulatory T cells. Our randomized placebo-controlled trial of prednisone for the treatment of paradoxical TB-IRIS showed reduced duration of hospitalization and therapeutic procedure numbers, as well as hastened improvements in TB-IRIS symptoms, and more rapid reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP).

We also recently showed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in Cape Town and is associated with active tuberculosis in both HIV-uninfected and infected patients, in whom the association is stronger. Others have shown that patients with tuberculosis have significantly lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels than those without in Tanzania and West Africa. These findings are supported by the requirement of 25(OH)D for activating an IFN-γ mediated antimicrobial effector pathway via induction of antimicrobial peptide synthesis and autophagy in human monocytes and macrophages, highlighting the importance of adequate amounts of 25(OH)D for sustaining innate and acquired immunity against infections. In vitro, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D has also been shown to inhibit leukocyte secretion of IL-6, IL-12p40, and IFN-γ, while inducing IL-10 and regulatory T-cell polarisation, suggesting that one of its primary roles is to prevent chronic inflammation and limit immunopathology.

### Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV [^115TmDTV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Retention in HIV care at 12 months after a positive HIV test. We defined retention according to WHO guidelines, as PLWH "who are enrolled in HIV care and routinely attend these services in accordance to their needs" (WHO 2016). This definition excludes those PLWH who either die or are lost to follow‐up. We considered the follow‐up period to start at the point of randomization to the intervention or comparator arm of any study. There is a lack of consensus on the period of time that a PLWH has to be disengaged with HIV services to be considered lost to follow‐up, usually ranging from three to six months after the last attendance to services (Hønge 2013; Pilcher 2017). A systematic review that analysed the sensitivity and specificity of thresholds for loss to follow‐up in 41 countries concluded that the most appropriate definition would be failure to engage with services for more than 180 days after the last visit (Chi 2011). Due to the variability and lack of a standard definition, we used the investigators' study definitions of loss to follow‐up.
Uptake of ART, defined as the proportion of eligible PLWH offered ART who initiated the therapy.
ART adherence, as documented by self‐report, pill count, pharmacy refills, or real‐time electronic monitors such as MEMScaps or Wisepill (Pellowski 2014), or a combination of any or all of these.
Incidence of treatment modification, defined as the number and proportion of PLWH on ART who experience a regimen modification in the intervention and control groups.

Adverse outcomes

We analysed the number and proportion of PLWH experiencing adverse drug reactions associated with ART in the intervention and control groups and the number of HIV‐negative people partnered with a HIV‐positive person who became infected with HIV during the study in each group. We also analysed the incidence of IRIS, as defined by the study authors, and we included both paradoxical and unmasking IRIS (AIDSinfo 2017).

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116u2bQs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy initiation in hospitalized people with HIV — The Panel recommends initiating ART during hospitalization whenever possible (BIII). Certain situations, such as in the setting of TB meningitis or cryptococcal meningitis, may warrant a short delay in ART initiation due to concerns of severe consequences related to paradoxical IRIS; however, in most other situations, the benefits of starting ART during hospitalization outweigh the concerns. A multicenter study that enrolled hospitalized people with HIV from 2012 to 2014 demonstrated that starting ART in hospitalized patients who had a recent history of substance use was associated with shorter time to linkage to their first HIV clinical appointment after discharge and more clinic visits in the first 12 months after ART initiation than those who were not started on ART before discharge; however, no difference was observed in the rate of viral suppression and retention in care over 12 months.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115WzeHW]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in talaromycosis — both unmasking and paradoxical IRIS have been described in patients with talaromycosis when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated. In the IVAP trial, 188 of 432 (44%) patients had started ART a median of 3–4 months before developing talaromycosis, indicating the role of ART in the unmasking of subclinical infection, and in patients starting ART after a diagnosis of talaromycosis, paradoxical IRIS events only occurred in patients treated with itraconazole induction therapy, demonstrating the role of effective induction therapy with amphotericin B in the prevention of paradoxical IRIS. ART should not be withheld because of concerns for possible development of IRIS (AIII). Patients with paradoxical IRIS typically present with inflammatory manifestations that include erythematous or immunological skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, large and painful peripheral lymph nodes, and synovitis of small joints; most symptoms can be managed by judicious use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory medicine, and corticosteroids are reserved for synovitis that interferes with daily function. Although the IRIS events in the IVAP trial were not associated with increased mortality and were managed effectively with continuation of ART and antifungal therapy, they were associated with higher morbidity, including lower quality of life and increased diagnostic testing, duration of hospitalization, and cost.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1129Sxn6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation in children with HIV presents as new or worsening symptoms within 3–6 months and occurs in two clinical scenarios, including unmasking or incident TB IRIS that usually occurs within 3 months of ART initiation and paradoxical clinical worsening of TB disease after ART initiation in TB/HIV coinfection where treatment failure because of microbial resistance or poor adherence must be excluded. In prospective observational studies, IRIS occurred in nearly 5% to 10% of children, usually within 4 weeks of ART initiation, resulting mostly from atypical mycobacteria, BCG, and TB (more prevalent in older children). Mild-to-moderate symptoms of IRIS can be treated symptomatically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, short-term use of systemic corticosteroids can be considered in more severe cases (expert opinion), and treatment for TB and ART should not be discontinued.

### Paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with cryptococcal meningitis in China: a 5-year retrospective cohort study [^116W2otR]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalised cryptococcal meningitis (CM) patients at a single centre to evaluate the clinical epidemiological features of paradoxical cryptococcal-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (CM-IRIS) in a setting in China. A total of 154 AIDS patients with CM were involved, and 17.5% experienced IRIS at a median of 27 days after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Overall, 3 deaths were directly attributed to IRIS. The occurrences of CM-IRIS were independently associated with the pre-ART CD4+count, pre-C-reactive protein level, and the timing of ART initiation.

### Invariant natural killer T-cell dynamics in human immunodeficiency virus-associated tuberculosis [^112qs6vp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) causes 1.6 million deaths annually and is the leading cause of death in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (PLWH). Antiretroviral therapy (ART)–naive PLWH with active TB are at risk of the paradoxical TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) after commencing ART. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is characterized by an acute inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis presenting as a clinical deterioration in a patient already receiving TB treatment, typically around 2 weeks after ART initiation. Paradoxical TB-IRIS is difficult to manage, frequently requiring nonspecific immunosuppression with corticosteroids. Risk factors include disseminated TB and low CD4 T-cell count at ART initiation, but the pathophysiology is incompletely defined. Recent studies have identified potential contributory innate immune mechanisms, including neutrophil recruitment, inflammasome activation, and proinflammatory cytokine excess. These potential mechanisms have been recently reviewed.

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a T-cell subset that bridge innate and adaptive immunity, and as such are of interest in TB-IRIS pathogenesis. Distinct from natural killer cells and conventional T cells, iNKT cells express an invariant T-cell receptor comprised of Vα24 and Vβ11 in humans, and specifically recognize CD1d-presented lipid antigens, responding on activation with rapid cytokine production. Additionally, iNKT cells recognize and are potently activated by the marine sponge glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (α-galcer), bound to CD1d.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall is lipid-rich and therefore CD1d-presented molecules that activate iNKT cells may have a role in host immunity to M. tuberculosis. In vitro, iNKT cells directly restricted M. tuberculosis growth and were bactericidal. In mice, augmenting iNKT cell responses with α-galcer improved BCG vaccine efficacy and antituberculosis treatment responses. In nonhuman primates, increased iNKT cell frequency was associated with TB resistance. In humans, a limited number of studies have demonstrated numerical and functional defects of iNKT cells in active TB.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^1138cGtN]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — poor clinical response despite adequate virologic and immunologic responses requires careful evaluation because not all such cases represent antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure; clinicians must carefully evaluate children who experience clinical disease progression despite favorable immunologic and virologic responses to ART. After initiation of ART, clinical deterioration can occur due to paradoxical worsening of a known opportunistic infection (OI) or unmasking of a previously undiagnosed OI due to a profound immune response (i.e. IRIS) related to successful viral suppression, and these circumstances, including IRIS, do not represent ART treatment failure.

The management of corticosteroid refractory immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is currently unclear. Infliximab administration was associated with clinical improvement without significant adverse events in 3 patients with mycobacterial IRIS. Immunologic and virologic responses to antiretroviral therapy were unaffected. Tumor necrosis factor blockade may be beneficial for IRIS and warrants further study in clinical trials.

### Toxoplasmic encephalitis IRIS in HIV-infected patients: a case series and review of the literature [^111ioBB1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Toxoplasmic encephalitis associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TE-IRIS) is rarely described.

Methods

To identify TE-IRIS cases, the authors performed a retrospective study of all HIV-infected patients diagnosed as having TE in our unit between January 2000 and June 2009, and a review of published cases.

Results

Three patients out of 65 toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) cases, together with six from the literature, fulfilled the unmasking TE-IRIS definition. None fulfilled the paradoxical TE-IRIS definition. TE occurred within a median time of 48.5 days (IQ(25–75) 21–56) after starting antiretroviral therapy. Cases did not have distinctive clinical or neuroimaging features from TE occurring without immune reconstitution. However: (1) cases occurred at a median CD4 lymphocytes count of 222/μl (IQ(25–75) 160–280); (2) TE occurred in five patients who were supposed to take an effective chemoprophylaxis; (3) two patients had a brain biopsy showing an intense angiocentric inflammatory infiltrating with predominantly CD8 lymphocytes; (4) in one patient, the abnormal length of evolution under treatment might be due to the heightened immune response.

Conclusion

Although rare, unmasking TE-IRIS exists and might occur despite effective prophylaxis and an unusually high CD4 lymphocyte count. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome does not modify TE diagnosis and treatment but might extend its clinical course.

### Prednisone for the prevention of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS [^112N7eSb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who have tuberculosis reduces mortality among patients with low CD4 counts, but it increases the risk of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

Methods

We conducted this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess whether prophylactic prednisone can safely reduce the incidence of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS in patients at high risk for the syndrome. We enrolled HIV-infected patients who were initiating ART (and had not previously received ART), had started tuberculosis treatment within 30 days before initiating ART, and had a CD4 count of 100 cells or fewer per microliter. Patients received either prednisone (at a dose of 40 mg per day for 14 days, then 20 mg per day for 14 days) or placebo. The primary end point was the development of tuberculosis-associated IRIS within 12 weeks after initiating ART, as adjudicated by an independent committee.

Results

Among the 240 patients who were enrolled, the median age was 36 (interquartile range, 30 to 42), 60% were men, and 73% had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis; the median CD4 count was 49 cells per microliter (interquartile range, 24 to 86), and the median HIV type 1 RNA viral load was 5.5 log 10 copies per milliliter (interquartile range, 5.2 to 5.9). A total of 120 patients were assigned to each group, and 18 patients were lost to follow-up or withdrew. Tuberculosis-associated IRIS was diagnosed in 39 patients (32.5%) in the prednisone group and in 56 (46.7%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 0.96; P = 0.03). Open-label glucocorticoids were prescribed to treat tuberculosis-associated IRIS in 16 patients (13.3%) in the prednisone group and in 34 (28.3%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.81). There were five deaths in the prednisone group and four in the placebo group (P = 1.00). Severe infections (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illnesses or invasive bacterial infections) occurred in 11 patients in the prednisone group and in 18 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.23). One case of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Prednisone treatment during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of ART for HIV infection resulted in a lower incidence of tuberculosis-associated IRIS than placebo, without evidence of an increased risk of severe infections or cancers.

### Cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^116Jd3UP]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The epidemiology and pathogenesis of, and risk factors for, cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (CM-IRIS) are reviewed with an emphasis on how new insights inform a rational management approach and prevention strategies.

Recent Findings

Risk factors for paradoxical CM-IRIS are a low inflammatory response and CD4 cell count at baseline, rapid immune restoration from this low baseline, and a high organism or antigen load at baseline and at antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Detailed immune mechanisms are still unclear. Rapidly fungicidal induction therapy, allowing prompt initiation of ART (from around 3 weeks in resource-limited settings in the context of amphotericin B induction) at a time when organism and antigen loads are low, may reduce overall mortality without exacerbating paradoxical CM-IRIS, compared with initiation of ART at later time points. Recent cohorts suggest early recognition and management can reduce the mortality associated with paradoxical CM-IRIS. Unmasking CM-IRIS is preventable through screening for cryptococcal antigen prior to ART and preemptive antifungal treatment for those testing positive, although prospective studies are needed.

Summary

Optimal antifungal induction and judicious ART timing, together with early recognition and management of developing cases, with thorough exclusion of alternative diagnoses, should help reduce paradoxical CM-IRIS-related mortality. Unmasking CM-IRIS cases should be preventable.

### Floppy iris syndrome: why BPH treatment can complicate cataract… [^114Ydm6P]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Discovering the association between the alpha-1 antagonist tamsulosin and a new complication called intraoperative floppy iris syndrome solved a troublesome mystery for cataract surgeons. 1 Characterized by sudden intraoperative iris prolapse and pupil constriction, IFIS causes a significant increase in surgical complications, particularly when it is not recognized, understood, or anticipated. 1–6 Some complications have been sight-threatening, including severe iris defects associated with permanent pupil deformity, glare, and photophobia. All of the alpha-1 antagonists can impair pupil dilation and cause IFIS. However, a number of prospective and retrospective studies suggest that the frequency and severity of IFIS is greater in patients taking tamsulosin compared with the nonselective alpha-1 antagonists. Another unexpected and remarkable finding is that IFIS can occur more than one year after tamsulosin has been discontinued.

1, 2 Ninety-five percent of ASCRS survey respondents have experienced IFIS in patients with only a previous history of alpha-1 antagonist use. 8 Histopathologic analysis of autopsy eyes from patients who were taking tamsulosin shows atrophy of the iris dilator muscle, which would be consistent with a semipermanent drug effect. 9 Because stopping alpha blockers pre-operatively is of questionable benefit, only 11 percent of survey respondents routinely discontinue tamsulosin before cataract surgery.
8. Ophthalmologists can now anticipate IFIS by eliciting a history of past or current systemic alpha-blocker use, and a number of alternative surgical strategies can be used to improve outcomes for these patients. 1, 2 However, ophthalmologists remain wary of the surgical complications associated with IFIS, such as iris damage, torn lens capsules, and vitreous prolapse.

8 Ninety-five percent of the ASCRS survey respondents believe that tamsulosin still increases the difficulty of cataract surgery, and 77 percent believe that it increases the risks. 8 Nearly two thirds of respondents would avoid tamsulosin if they themselves had a mildly symptomatic cataract. 8 This group would take a non-selective alpha-1 antagonist, avoid alpha-1 antagonists altogether, or have their mildly symptomatic cataract removed first.

### Neutrophil-associated central nervous system inflammation in tuberculous meningitis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^112JdLfL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Although this is the first comprehensive analysis hitherto of the disease site coupled with blood immune mediators in TB-IRIS, we acknowledge certain limitations. We did not include HIV-uninfected patients with TBM as controls, and we excluded patients with neurological deterioration before ART initiation. We were therefore unable to compare the inflammatory response in TBM-IRIS to that of the "paradoxical reaction" characterized by neurological deterioration, which can occur in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients with TBM after the start of tuberculosis treatment. This is a descriptive study of mediators in patients with TBM; cellular contributions to mediator production in CSF and blood were not determined by functional experiments.

Our findings have several important implications. First, oral corticosteroid therapy during TBM treatment is insufficient to prevent, or rapidly reduce, the inflammatory response that characterizes TBM-IRIS; in addition to investigations through randomized trials of different corticosteroid doses and routes of administration in the management of TBM-IRIS, alternative immunomodulatory therapies should be explored for the prevention and treatment of the disease. Second, although the adaptive immune system seems to be activated in TBM-IRIS, the sequence of immunological events in the CNS suggests a major contribution of the innate response in this condition. Cerebrospinal fluid neutrophils, which may be driven through an IL-17– and S100A8/A9-dependent pathway, are associated with the most severe CNS inflammation manifesting as TBM-IRIS; these findings are likely to direct future research into TB-IRIS immunopathogenesis and management strategies.

Prevention of paradoxical TB-IRIS with prednisone — pre-emptive treatment with prednisone may prevent or reduce the consequences of TB-IRIS; in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of prednisone (40 mg/day for 2 weeks, then 20 mg/day for 2 weeks) versus placebo in 240 ART-naive adults at high risk of developing IRIS at ART initiation, the incidence of TB-IRIS was 47% in the placebo arm and 33% in the prednisone arm (RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96) with no excess risk for malignancy, severe infections, or other complications, and based on these findings, preemptive prednisone therapy should be offered for high-risk patients as defined in this study.

### An official ATS workshop report: emerging issues and current controversies in HIV-associated pulmonary diseases [^1126jYCF]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Medium credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV — definition, risk factors, presentation, timing, and management — is described as a paradoxical worsening of clinical status related to recovery of the immune system after initiation of ART, with mycobacterial infections, particularly M. tuberculosis and MAC, most frequent and fungal (Cryptococcus, PCP) and viral (cytomegalovirus) infections also associated; initiating ART in close proximity to treatment for an acute opportunistic infection increases risk of IRIS, patients who develop IRIS are more likely to be antiretroviral naive at ART initiation, and lower CD4+ cell counts are also associated. Common presenting symptoms consist of fever and lymphadenopathy with chest radiographic patterns including pulmonary infiltrates, nodules or masses, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion, and diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion of other causes; the majority of IRIS cases occur within the first 1 to 3 months after ART initiation. Most cases are mild and outcomes are generally good with supportive therapy; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and steroids may be used, patients on ART can continue their regimens, and when to start ART in patients with opportunistic infections remains controversial although early ART may be beneficial, with caution that timing in critically ill patients is not well studied and may carry potential harm from ART-related toxicity or inflammatory reactions.

### New onset or exacerbation of uveitis with infliximab: paradoxical effects? [^113mmVbW]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Sclerouveitis is presumed to have autoimmune origins and is frequently associated with systemic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease. Cases with anterior uveitis are typically treated with local therapy alone, but cases with posterior uveitis are often treated with systemic therapy. Treatment of severe uveitis requires a similar approach to systemic inflammatory conditions, namely corticosteroids, systemic immunomodulation agents and biologics. Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) plays a key role in ocular inflammation as demonstrated by animal studiesand is detected in the ocular fluids of inflamed eyes in humans. Clinically, the use of TNF inhibitors has also been very successful in controlling ocular inflammation, although patients receiving TNF inhibitors are at high risk of infections and reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection and the overall risk of opportunistic infections should be considered before beginning a course of TNF inhibitors.

Intriguingly, paradoxical adverse effects (PAE), which are defined as the onset or exacerbation of disorders that are typically improved by TNF inhibitors, have been reported. These paradoxical effects mainly include psoriasiform skin reaction, uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis and vasculitis. Paradoxical ocular inflammation in response to TNF inhibitors has been mainly observed with etanercept. Although less frequently, other TNF inhibitors, such as infliximab and adalimumab, can also induce paradoxical adverse events. Twenty-two cases of inflammatory eye disease have been reported to be associated with the use of infliximab for rheumatic disease or inflammatory bowel disease. However, details regarding the type of uveitis and clinical course were unclear in most cases. The aim of this article is to report four cases of new onset or exacerbation of uveitis following administration of infliximab.

### Risk factors for IRIS in HIV-associated Pneumocystis-pneumonia following ART initiation [^1171NUbu]. The Journal of Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis-pneumonia (PCP) may develop paradoxical immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), when combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is started early during the course of PCP-treatment (PCPT). The aim of this study was to identify risk factors and predictors for PCP-IRIS and to improve individualized patient care.

Methods

An ICD-10 code hospital database query identified all Frankfurt HIV Cohort patients being diagnosed with PCP from January 2010 - June 2016. Patient charts were evaluated retrospectively for demographic, clinical and therapeutic (cART/PCPT) characteristics and incidence of paradoxical IRIS according to French's case definitions.

Results

IRIS occurred in 12/97 patients that started cART while on PCPT (12.4%). They had a higher rate of re-hospitalization (41.7vs. 4.7%; odds ratio (OR) 14.46; p = 0.009), intensive care treatment (66.7vs. 30.6%; OR = 4.54; p = 0.018), and longer median hospitalization (48 days vs. 23; p < 0.001). A high HIV-RNA level (> 6Log 10 /ml) before cART initiation was associated with IRIS development (41.6vs. 15.0%; OR 4.05; p = 0.042). Serum immunoglobulin G-levels (IgG) [mg/dl] were lower (894.0 vs. 1446.5; p = 0.023).

Conclusion

Higher hospitalization rate and morbidity parameters underscore the clinical importance of PCP-related paradoxical IRIS. A baseline viral load of > 6Log10/ml and serum IgG may help to assess individual risks for PCP-IRIS.

### Preventing tuberculosis-associated IRIS | NEJM resident 360… [^114BxB24]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 14, 2018 Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is associated with considerable morbidity, and 25% of patients with this syndrome are hospitalized. Meintjes et al. conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that a low dose of glucocorticoids to attenuate the aberrant inflammatory response that underlies tuberculosis-associated IRIS during early antiretroviral therapy would reduce the risk of this syndrome. Read the latest NEJM Original Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are features of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS.

A: Paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS — an immunopathologic reaction characterized by recurrent or new inflammatory features of tuberculosis that manifest shortly after the initiation of ART in patients receiving antituberculosis treatment — occurs in 18% of patients, according to a pooled estimate derived from 40 observational cohort studies. Features include recurrent symptoms, fever, lymphadenitis, and worsening pulmonary infiltrates on radiography. These findings informed World Health Organization guidelines, which emphasize accelerating ART initiation in patients with tuberculosis and low CD4 counts. However, despite the survival benefit, early initiation of ART more than doubles the risk of tuberculosis-associated IRIS. No evidence-based strategy to prevent tuberculosis-associated IRIS exists. The prednisone or placebo was started within 48 hours after the initiation of ART.

Patients in the prednisone group received 40 mg of prednisone per day for 14 days, followed by 20 mg per day for 14 days. The primary end point was the development of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS within 12 weeks after initiating ART. Prophylactic prednisone during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of ART in adult patients at high risk for tuberculosis-associated IRIS resulted in a 30% lower incidence of tuberculosis-associated IRIS than placebo. A total of 39 of 120 patients in the prednisone group and 56 of 120 patients in the placebo group received a diagnosis of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS.

### Tuberculosis immune reconstitution syndrome (TB-IRIS) followed by recurring lymphadenitis up to 8 years post-antituberculous treatment [^116hSz1M]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present the case of a patient with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) coinfection who initially developed paradoxical TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) post-antituberculous treatment and post-antiretroviral therapy initiation. Despite being managed effectively, lymphadenitis recurred as many as three times over the course of several years. Due to consistent culture-negative lymph node biopsies, the recurring lymphadenitis was eventually deemed inflammatory rather than microbiological recurrences. Cessation of anti-TB treatment led to symptom remission followed by a long asymptomatic period, corroborating the immunological nature of the episodes. However, 5 and 6 years after cessation of anti-TB treatment, respectively, lymphadenitis returned. In both instances, her symptoms regressed without treatment with anti-TB drugs. This case underscores the complexities of managing TB-IRIS and the necessity of differentiating between paradoxical TB-IRIS and other paradoxical reactions for appropriate treatment decisions. Recognition of such distinctions is crucial in guiding effective therapeutic interventions in TB-HIV coinfection scenarios.

### Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome: report of a case and histopathologic analysis… [^112Hdoat]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

We confirm the presence of α1A-ARs in human iris by results of immunohistochemical analysis. The α1A-ARs localize to iris arteriolar muscularis in addition to the iris dilator muscle. This localization suggests that IFIS may develop because of iris vascular dysfunction and that iris vasculature may have structural in addition to nutritive functions. Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome is a well-known risk factor for complications during cataract extraction. It was first described in 2005 by Chang and Campbell1 and is characterized by the triad of iris billowing, iris prolapse through the surgical wound, and progressive miosis. It has been previously suggested that IFIS is caused by blockade of the α1A-ARs at the level of the iris dilator muscle.

1, 15 However, even in the original report on IFIS, 1 it was pointed out that discontinuation of the α1A-AR antagonist therapy preoperatively does not necessarily eliminate its occurrence but solely decreases intraoperative miosis. Once they lose this ability and become flaccid, iris dilation would not only be decreased but the iris arterioles cannot coil. Although the idea that vascular dysfunction may contribute to the development of IFIS has been raised in the past because of the poor dilation often seen in patients with diabetes, 20 our finding of α1A-ARs in the iris arteriolar muscularis provides significant support for this hypothesis. Atrophy and vacuolation of the iris dilator muscle and elimination of the associated nerve endings, along with differences in the distribution and size of pigment granules and the presence of lipofuscin-like granules, have also been reported in IFIS.

11 Based on these findings, a mechanism for the development of IFIS has been proposed that involves the atrophy of nerve terminals to the dilator smooth muscle and the absorption and rerelease of α1A-AR agonists by melanin-containing granules. Independent works by Prata and Ritch25 and Santaella26 suggest that thinning of the iris stroma and dilator muscle is a mechanism that contributes to IFIS. The hypothesis put forth previously of vascular dysfunction is not necessarily contradictory to such a mechanism because the malfunctioning vasculature could lead to atrophy of these tissues.

### Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in HIV-infected immigrants [^111jEVo3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) includes a group of potentially serious inflammatory processes that may be present in HIV-infected patients after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Paradoxical IRIS is a worsening of symptoms, after an overwhelming response to a previously diagnosed opportunistic infection (OI); unmasking IRIS reveals a previously occult OI. The main objective of the study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and outcome data of HIV-infected immigrants, stratified according to high- or low-income countries of origin, who developed IRIS and to compare them with native-born Spanish patients. This retrospective study reviewed all patients with HIV infection admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine between 1998 and 2014. IRIS was identified in 25/138 (18%) immigrant patients and 24/473 (5%) native-born Spanish patients infected with HIV. Most cases, 19/25 (76%), were of unmasking IRIS. The time elapsed between initiation of HAART and development of IRIS was significantly longer in patients with unmasking versus paradoxical IRIS. OIs, in particular due to mycobacteria, were the most frequently involved processes. Twenty percent of patients died. The comparison of immigrant and native-born patients found significant differences for both IRIS type (higher incidence of paradoxical forms among immigrants) and for the absence of malignancies in native-born patients. No significant differences were found when the data of immigrants from low- and high-income countries were compared.

### The clinical pattern, prevalence, and factors associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in Ugandan children [^113v2FrQ]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine clinical pattern, prevalence, and factors associated with pediatric immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in Uganda.

Design

A prospective, multicenter cross-sectional study.

Methods

We enrolled HIV-infected children receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) between 0.5 and 6 months duration from December 2006 to October 2007 at three pediatric clinics in Uganda. Children were evaluated for IRIS at a one-time study visit by a standardized pediatric case definition.

Results

The IRIS prevalence was 38% [95% confidence interval (CI) 31–46] among 162 children (57% female) with a median age of 6 years (interquartile range 2.5–11 years). Of the IRIS events, 77% were unmasking of a new opportunistic infection and 23% were probable paradoxical IRIS events toward prior opportunistic infections. The majority of IRIS events (55%) occurred in the first month of ART. The clinical events were diverse, with tuberculosis-IRIS (29%) being the most frequent presentation. Independent risk factors for IRIS were pre-ART CD4(+) cell percentage below 15% (odds ratio = 3.1, 95% CI 1.2–8.4, P = 0.027), current CD8(+) cell absolute count below 1000 cells/microl (odds ratio = 4.3, 95% CI 1.8–10.4, P = 0.001), male sex (odds ratio = 2.6, 95% CI 1.06–8.4, P = 0.01), and a cough of more than 1 week duration at the current clinic visit (odds ratio = 4.3, 95% CI 1.7–10.7, P = 0.002). A more than 25 CD4(+) T-cells increase at current study visit from the pre-ART baseline was associated with IRIS by univariate (P = 0.005) but not multivariate analysis.

Conclusion

IRIS events commonly occur early after ART initiation in children with advanced immunosuppression, as commonly seen in resource-limited areas. Both healthcare providers and caregivers of the children need awareness of IRIS to minimize ART nonadherence.

### Invariant natural killer T-cell dynamics in human immunodeficiency virus-associated tuberculosis [^113wiVTG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

This study supports a role for iNKT cells in innate immune dysfunction in paradoxical TB-IRIS. We have shown profound CD4 + iNKT cell subset depletion in advanced HIV-1 infection and a lesser effect of active TB in HIV-uninfected patients. In patients with advanced HIV and a new diagnosis of active TB, iNKT cell populations were skewed towards a proinflammatory, cytotoxic phenotype. Patients who developed TB-IRIS had increased iNKT cells compared to those without IRIS and iNKT cell degranulation occurred at the time of IRIS, potentially contributing to immunopathology.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^11318qj1]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

MAC-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in people with HIV — presentation and management note that IRIS is recognized as a systemic inflammatory syndrome and can occur as "unmasking" IRIS with subclinical MAC or "paradoxical" IRIS with previously established disease, occurring primarily in those with advanced immunosuppression who begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) and have a rapid and marked reduction in plasma HIV RNA; elevated alkaline phosphatase levels may be a predictor; for moderate to severe IRIS, people with HIV on ART should receive initial treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (BIII), and if symptoms do not improve, short-term (4–8 weeks) systemic corticosteroid therapy, in doses equivalent to 20 to 40 mg of oral prednisone daily, can be used to reduce symptoms and morbidity (BII); severe forms with a hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis phenotype may occur and lower hemoglobin prior to ART may help predict this more severe form, with some cases requiring additional immunosuppression reported.

### Management of HIV-associated tuberculosis in resource-limited settings: a state-of-the-art review [^117MgT5r]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The second major form of TB-IRIS is commonly referred to as 'unmasking' TB-IRIS. This occurs when active TB is present but remains undiagnosed at the time of starting ART. Subsequent immune recovery triggers the overt symptomatic presentation of TB. In a proportion of cases, unusual inflammatory features may also develop and such cases are regarded as having 'unmasking' TB-IRIS. Risk of unmasking TB-IRIS is therefore directly related to the efficiency of the pre-ART screening process and the resulting prevalence of undiagnosed disease.

Both types of TB IRIS have a wide range of clinical features often with involvement of multiple organ systems, reflecting widespread dissemination of M. tuberculosis in those with profound immunosuppression. Common features include fever, recurrence of respiratory symptoms with worsening infiltrates on chest radiographs, enlargement of lymph nodes (often with suppuration), formation of tuberculous abscesses and serous effusions. There are many case reports of unusual and diverse complications, including granulomatous nephritis with renal impairment, parotitis, epididymo-orchitis, granulomatous hepatitis, splenic enlargement and abscess formation, psoas abscess, peritonitis, ascites and intestinal involvement. Neurological TB-IRIS is particularly severe, manifesting with tuberculomas, tuberculous abscesses, cerebral edema, meningitis and radiculomyelopathy. Neurological TB IRIS has a much poorer outcome compared to other forms, with a mortality of 13% to 75%.

In most cases, the onset of paradoxical TB-IRIS is within the first 4 weeks of ART (median 14 days (IQR, 8 to 23) in 1 series) but can occur within a few days. The proportion of patients affected ranges widely from 0% to over 40% and this may relate to differences in risk factors and case definitions. In a meta-analysis, the summary risk estimate was 15.7%. Of these, 3.2% died, representing approximately 1 in 200 patients with HIV-associated TB who start ART. The median duration of TB-IRIS symptoms has been reported to be 2 to 3 months but a minority of cases have a protracted course which may last for more than 1 year. Such protracted cases typically have persistent or recurrent suppurative lymphadenitis or abscess formation. However, the majority of cases have a favorable long-term outcome.

### Early ART after cryptococcal meningitis is associated with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and macrophage activation in a multisite randomized trial [^113bmwfk]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Th2 immune responses have been shown to be detrimental during infection with intracellular organisms such as Cryptococcus neoformans, whereas Th1 responses are protective. In the overall cohort, mean CSF IL-13 concentrations increased from diagnosis to day 14 by approximately 20% with early ART, and by approximately 100% with early ART in Kampala participants. Among persons deferring ART, CSF IL-13 levels declined by approximately 40% over 14 days. Conversely, CSF concentrations of interferon-γ gradually declined by approximately 50% in both arms over 14 days as the infection was treated. Given that the majority of mortality occurred in Kampala, the finding that early ART was associated with increased CNS macrophage activation and Th2 response (just 6–7 days after ART initiation) in Kampala participants further supports the hypothesis that ART-associated immunopathology was likely responsible for the increased mortality observed in this trial.

In the COAT trial, there was no statistically significant increase in paradoxical CM–IRIS with early ART initiation (20%) versus deferred ART (13%) (P = .32). This is in contrast to the increased incidence of tuberculosis-IRIS reported with early ART in HIV-associated tuberculosis. However, the case definition of paradoxical CM-IRIS specifies that persons must undergo a pattern of clinical improvement prior to their ART-associated clinical deterioration. In the COAT trial, early ART was often initiated prior to the resolution of meningitis symptoms, making it difficult to identify such a biphasic clinical course with distinct second events. Yet, the hypothesis that early ART resulted in adverse inflammatory responses is supported by the ART-associated CSF cellular infiltrate occurring exclusively among participants who failed to mount a CSF leukocyte pleocytosis initially (WCC < 5/µL). This was the same subgroup of participants found to be at high risk of mortality with early ART in the COAT trial, and the same group previously shown to be at > 3-fold increased risk of CM-IRIS. Further examination of participants in this study with a paucicellular CSF response prior to ART initiation showed they also had significantly reduced CSF macrophage activation markers (sCD14, sCD163) and significantly increased serum IL-4 and IL-17 concentrations prior to ART. Pre-ART elevations of IL-4 and IL-17 have previously been reported in persons who subsequently developed CM-IRIS after starting ART. It is possible this group in the COAT trial may have responded similarly.

### Tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in children initiating antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection: a systematic literature review [^113pCKzr]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

People with HIV initiating combination antiretroviral therapy are at risk for tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). While this syndrome has been well researched in adults, little is known about the incidence, case fatality, underlying immunopathology and treatment approaches in children.

Methods

Major databases were searched for articles related to TB-IRIS in children. Data were abstracted using standardized forms.

Results

Thirteen studies were identified: 6 retrospective and 2 prospective cohort studies, 1 cross-sectional study, 3 case reports and 1 case series. In total, 303 cases of TB-IRIS were described, of which 270 were unmasking TB-IRIS, 12 paradoxical TB-IRIS and 21 were not classifiable due to lack of key information. None of the cohort studies had investigation of TB-IRIS as its primary aim. Nine studies were from Africa, 3 from Asia and 1 from Latin America. Age at cART initiation (reported by 12 studies) ranged from 1 month to 16 years. Median time from start of cART to IRIS diagnosis (reported by 8 studies) ranged from 8 days to 16 weeks. Few deaths attributable to TB-IRIS were recorded. Treatment was only discussed in 2 case studies, both of which reported children receiving corticosteroids. No studies evaluated risk factors for, or immunopathogenesis of, pediatric TB-IRIS.

Conclusions

There is a paucity of information available on TB-IRIS in children. Future research assessing incidence, risk factors, case fatality and optimal treatment or prevention strategies of TB-IRIS is needed.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116e8iPj]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Paradoxical TB-IRIS management — most cases are self-limiting and symptomatic therapy may be used, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for mild TB-IRIS (CIII) and needle aspiration of enlarging serous effusions, large tuberculous abscesses, or suppurative lymphadenitis for symptom relief (CIII). In people with moderately severe paradoxical TB-IRIS, treatment with prednisone is recommended (AI), and a randomized trial showed prednisone 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks reduced a combined endpoint of days hospitalized plus outpatient therapeutic procedures, although 4 weeks of prednisone was insufficient in a subset; patients on prednisone experienced more rapid symptoms and radiographic improvement, and no reduction in mortality was demonstrated. If signs and symptoms do not improve or worsen as corticosteroids are tapered, a more gradual taper over 2 to 3 months is recommended (BIII). Rifampin increases the clearance of prednisolone, and dosing of prednisone should therefore be adjusted in patients receiving rifampin or rifabutin-containing regimens; corticosteroids should be avoided in people with Kaposi sarcoma because life-threatening exacerbations can occur, and case reports describe responses in steroid-refractory and prolonged IRIS or paradoxical reactions to TNF-blockers, IL-1 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, or thalidomide.

### Clinical case definition and manifestations of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^113qE99D]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) recently published criteria for tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) diagnosis. The performance of this definition and clinical manifestations of TB-IRIS were studied.

Methods

Antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV/TB Thai patients receiving antituberculous therapy were enrolled during 2006–2007 and prospectively followed through 24 weeks of antiretroviral therapy. Patients were defined as having paradoxical TB-IRIS if they fulfilled the 'study definition' by French 2004 and were confirmed by an external reviewer. All were later compared by the classification according to 'INSHI-2008'.

Results

For the 126 patients, median baseline CD4 cell count was 43 cells/microl and HIV-1 RNA was 5.9 log(10) Y copies/ml. Seventy-three (58%) had extrapulmonary/disseminated TB. Twenty-two (18%) and 21 (17%) fulfilled TB-IRIS criteria according to the study definition and INSHI-2008 definition, respectively. Two (2%) were diagnosed by study definition only and one (1%) by INSHI-2008 definition only. Twenty (16%) were concordantly diagnosed by both definitions and 103 (82%) were consistently negative. Eighteen (82%) had worsening of a preexisting site, whereas four (18%) had TB-IRIS in a new location. Lymph node enlargement (73%) and fever (59%) were common in TB-IRIS. Sensitivity and specificity of INSHI-2008 was 91% (95% confidence interval, 72–98%) and 99% (95% confidence interval, 95–99.8%), respectively. Positive predictive value was 95% and negative predictive value was 98%. By multivariate analysis, factors predicting TB-IRIS were extrapulmonary TB (odds ratio, 8.63) and disseminated TB (odds ratio, 4.17).

Conclusion

There was high concordance between the INSHI-2008 and French 2004 definition for TB-IRIS diagnosis in HIV/TB patients with relatively high rate of paradoxical TB-IRIS. This suggests that lack of HIV-1 RNA and CD4 cell count monitoring does not impede the ability to diagnose TB-IRIS.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111Lp3zK]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Paradoxical tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) in adults with HIV-associated tuberculosis initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a pooled incidence of 18% with death attributed in 2% of cases. The onset of paradoxical TB-IRIS symptoms is typically between 1 to 4 weeks after ART is initiated, and the syndrome lasts for 2 to 3 months on average, but may continue for several more months and, in rare cases, persist or recur over a year after onset. Common and important manifestations include fevers, new or enlarging lymphadenopathy, and new or worsening pulmonary infiltrates, and mortality due to paradoxical TB-IRIS is uncommon.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of cryptococcosis: an initiative of the ECMM and ISHAM in cooperation with the ASM [^115PwXps]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

C-IRIS evaluation and treatment — for patients with suspected paradoxical cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (C-IRIS), carefully exclude recurrent cryptococcal disease or new infective or non-infective conditions before attributing symptoms and signs to C-IRIS, and perform a brain MRI and lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure and get CSF for microbiological, cellular, and biochemical analyses. Treatment of C-IRIS should include therapeutic lumbar puncture and symptomatic therapy, such as analgesia, antiemetics, and antiepileptics if appropriate. High-dose prednisolone or prednisone (usually 0·5–1·0 mg/kg daily) or dexamethasone (usually 0·2–0·3 mg/kg daily), weaned over 4–6 weeks can be considered in those with persistent symptoms who are unresponsive to therapeutic lumbar punctures; rarely, a second steroid course with taper is needed. Do not stop ART.

Cryptococcosis microbiologic assessment in suspected IRIS or relapse — a negative CSF PCR has a high predictive value for sterile CSF cultures and can be diagnostically useful for distinguishing paradoxical IRIS with a negative CSF PCR from culture‑positive relapse with a positive CSF PCR; the primary microbiological criterion for treatment failure is a CSF culture that yields Cryptococcus rather than visual appearance of yeasts during treatment.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — clinical manifestations in advanced immunosuppression often present as disseminated, multi-organ infection in people not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with early symptoms that may be minimal, can precede detectable mycobacteremia by several weeks, and may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities associated with disseminated disease include anemia and elevated liver alkaline phosphatase levels; hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy may be found on examination or imaging, and localized disease can produce other focal findings. In people receiving and responding to ART with an increase in CD4 cell counts, localized manifestations have been reported more often, including cervical, intraabdominal or mediastinal lymphadenitis, pneumonitis, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, or central nervous system infection. Localized syndromes may also reflect immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is recognized as a systemic inflammatory syndrome clinically indistinguishable from active MAC infection with bacteremia generally absent; MAC-associated IRIS can occur as "unmasking" IRIS in subclinical MAC or "paradoxical" IRIS in those with previously established MAC disease.
