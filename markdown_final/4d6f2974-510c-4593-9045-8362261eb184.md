## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a 43-year-old man with recurrent, somewhat painful, slightly erythematous nodules on both lower legs that last 1–2 weeks, resolve, and recur for at least 6 months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical pattern and whether this fits erythema nodosum. Then, I should verify that erythema nodosum is a reaction pattern and outline key secondary causes to consider in a 43-year-old man. Next, I will review mimickers that must be excluded on clinical grounds and, when needed, by biopsy. After that, I need to check the recommended initial work-up and decide when to biopsy. Finally, I will consider management, monitoring, and red flags that would prompt escalation or re-evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical pattern: symmetric, tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules localized to the pretibial lower legs, nonulcerative and resolving without scarring, with self-limited flares lasting 1–2 weeks and then recurring, is classic for erythema nodosum (EN), the most common panniculitis, which characteristically presents on the anterior shins and heals without atrophy or ulceration, often in crops over weeks to months [^112ezHfy] [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U].

> Wait, let me verify the time course matches EN: typical EN lesions are self-limited and often resolve within a few weeks; recurrences can occur, and supportive care alone often suffices for symptom control during these episodic flares, which aligns with the described 1–2 week episodes over several months [^115yyDjP] [^116v5Ts2] [^114SFc7U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: EN is a reaction pattern rather than a final diagnosis, so in a 43-year-old man I need to systematically search for secondary causes including infections (notably streptococcal pharyngitis and tuberculosis, but also enteric pathogens and endemic fungi), inflammatory diseases (sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, Behçet), medications, and malignancy, recognizing that up to half of cases may be idiopathic depending on the population and work-up depth [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U] [^113F5Fda].

> I should confirm key associations and their relevance here: streptococcal infection is a leading identifiable trigger of EN in many series; sarcoidosis frequently has EN as a nonspecific cutaneous manifestation; IBD (particularly colitis flares) can drive concurrent EN activity; endemic fungal exposures and enteric infections have been implicated in clusters; and although less common, hematologic malignancies (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma) have been temporally linked to recurrent EN, so a targeted review of systems and screening labs are prudent in unexplained, recurrent cases [^112ezHfy] [^1116ZirE] [^115yyDjP] [^113LeJeG] [^115wr1NG].

> Let me think about drugs: while oral contraceptives are classically cited, they are not relevant for a male patient; however, I should review for antibiotics temporally linked to flares and newer agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors like everolimus, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have all been associated with EN or EN-like panniculitis in case reports and small series [^114SFc7U] [^111XXZXL] [^112Bgtqb] [^116Mn9Jx].

> Next, I should review important mimickers of EN that can present as tender subcutaneous nodules on the legs: erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis) often ulcerates and shows vasculitis histologically, frequently linked to tuberculosis; cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa produces painful nodules with livedo and can ulcerate; Sweet's syndrome can present with tender nodules/plaques plus fever and neutrophilia; pancreatic panniculitis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis tend to be lobular panniculitides with necrosis and drainage; and exceedingly rare entities like subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma can mimic panniculitis clinically but require histology for distinction [^1115ycX1] [^116FMXgw] [^116dTwgp] [^113dje8d] [^116M1aCr] [^112iK5mj].

> I will now examine the clinico-pathologic hallmarks that separate EN from these mimics: EN is a septal panniculitis without vasculitis, often with Miescher radial granulomas, and lesions do not ulcerate, whereas erythema induratum shows lobular panniculitis with vasculitis and tends to ulcerate; PAN reveals medium-vessel vasculitis; pancreatic panniculitis shows enzymatic fat necrosis; and A1AT panniculitis exhibits neutrophilic lobular panniculitis with oily drainage; when clinical features are atypical or systemic features suggest alternative pathology, a deep incisional biopsy is indicated to visualize subcutaneous septa adequately [^112ezHfy] [^1115ycX1] [^113dje8d] [^116M1aCr].

> Let me first confirm the recommended initial work-up for suspected EN: obtain CBC, ESR and/or CRP; assess for streptococcal infection with throat culture or rapid antigen testing and serologies such as ASO; screen for TB risk with IGRA or PPD and chest radiography; consider chest radiograph to evaluate for sarcoidosis (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy) even if TB risk is low; and tailor tests to epidemiology and symptoms, e.g., stool/IBD evaluation with GI symptoms or coccidioidal serologies with desert exposure; biopsy if the presentation is atypical, persistent, or if age ≥ 40 with recurrences where diagnostic certainty is important [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U] [^115rkh5r] [^1119rQXk] [^113LeJeG].

> I should double-check whether his age and sex change threshold for biopsy or imaging: EN affects all ages and is more common in women, but in adults ≥ 40 years, biopsy and chest imaging were commonly pursued in practice-based series, which supports a lower threshold for tissue confirmation and chest radiography in this 43-year-old man with recurrent disease, especially if there is any atypical feature or systemic symptom [^115rkh5r] [^113F5Fda] [^112PiVyi].

> Next, I should review management: treat the underlying trigger when identified; otherwise, provide symptomatic care with rest, leg elevation, compression, and NSAIDs; for recurrent or more symptomatic disease, potassium iodide or colchicine are reasonable steroid-sparing options; systemic corticosteroids can be effective but should be reserved until infection (notably TB and deep fungal disease) is reasonably excluded; in IBD-associated EN, controlling bowel inflammation often resolves the skin lesions [^1115ycX1] [^114SFc7U] [^115yyDjP].

> Hmm, wait a minute — thalidomide comes up with EN acronyms, but I need to ensure I'm not conflating EN with ENL: thalidomide is indicated for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), not idiopathic or reactive EN, so it should not be used here unless managing ENL in the context of leprosy, which is not the case in this scenario [^114Wdoew].

> But wait, what if the nodules start to ulcerate or the pattern changes? New ulceration, nodules outside the pretibial sites, persistent single nodules, systemic B symptoms, neuropathy, or livedo should prompt reconsideration for entities like nodular vasculitis, PAN, hematologic malignancy, or infiltrative lymphoproliferative disorders, and should trigger biopsy and expanded systemic evaluation, recognizing rare but important mimics and paraneoplastic associations reported with recurrent EN-like presentations [^1115ycX1] [^114roHjG] [^112iK5mj] [^115wr1NG] [^116QgPuX].

> Hold on, I should verify the geographic and infectious context: history of pharyngitis supports streptococcal testing; TB risk factors or endemic exposures (e.g., desert Southwest) warrant TB testing and targeted fungal serologies; outbreak reports underscore the value of early, paired serologies or PCR in suspected infectious clusters, which may be relevant if others in his environment have similar symptoms [^112ezHfy] [^113LeJeG].

> In summary, the most likely diagnosis, based on symmetric, recurrent, somewhat painful, nonulcerating erythematous subcutaneous nodules confined to the pretibial lower legs with 1–2 week flares and spontaneous resolution, is erythema nodosum; however, I need to ensure a structured evaluation for secondary causes (strep, TB, sarcoidosis, IBD, drugs, and less common malignancy) and to reserve biopsy for atypical, persistent, or diagnostically uncertain cases in this 43-year-old man, while initiating supportive care and a steroid-sparing plan if symptoms recur or impair function [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U] [^1116ZirE] [^115yyDjP].

The most likely diagnosis is **erythema nodosum (EN)** [^112ezHfy], given the classic presentation of intermittent, tender, erythematous nodules on the lower legs that resolve without scarring [^114nhw2a]. EN is often idiopathic [^114SFc7U] but **can be triggered by** infections (streptococcal, tuberculosis, COVID-19 [^115jM6Np]), **sarcoidosis** [^1116ZirE], **inflammatory bowel disease** [^116Kh3gB], **medications** (e.g. antibiotics, NSAIDs) [^112ezHfy], or **malignancy** [^115wr1NG]. Other considerations include erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis) [^1115ycX1], panniculitis (pancreatic [^113dje8d], alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^116M1aCr]), vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa) [^1134j1ct], rheumatoid nodules [^117BZShc], and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma [^112iK5mj]. Workup should include CBC, ESR/CRP, ASO titer [^112ezHfy], chest X-ray [^114SFc7U], and biopsy if atypical or persistent.

---

## Infectious etiologies

- **Streptococcal infections**: Commonly associated with EN; consider recent pharyngitis or upper respiratory infections [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U].

- **Tuberculosis**: EN can be a manifestation of primary tuberculosis [^1119rQXk], particularly in endemic areas.

- **COVID-19**: EN-like lesions [^115jM6Np] have been reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114HoXrY].

- **Other infections**: Yersinia, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and fungal infections (e.g. histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis) can trigger EN [^113LeJeG].

---

## Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions

- **Sarcoidosis**: EN is a common nonspecific cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis [^1116ZirE].

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: EN is frequently associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^116Kh3gB] [^115yyDjP].

- **Behçet's disease**: Recurrent EN-like lesions can occur in Behçet's syndrome [^114SFc7U] [^112YxxqU].

- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Rheumatoid nodules can present similarly to EN [^117BZShc].

---

## Medication-induced panniculitis

Medication-induced panniculitis includes EN-like reactions to **antibiotics** (e.g. sulfonamides, penicillins) [^112ezHfy] and to **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** [^112ezHfy]. EN-like panniculitis has also been reported with **immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy** [^116Mn9Jx].

---

## Vasculitis and panniculitis

- **Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis)**: Typically associated with tuberculosis, presenting as tender nodules on the lower legs [^1115ycX1].

- **Polyarteritis nodosa**: Medium-vessel vasculitis presenting with painful subcutaneous nodules [^1134j1ct].

- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis**: Lobular panniculitis with neutrophilic infiltrate [^116M1aCr].

- **Pancreatic panniculitis**: Associated with pancreatic disease, presenting as tender nodules on the lower extremities [^113dje8d].

---

## Malignancy-associated panniculitis

**Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma** is a rare malignancy presenting with recurrent subcutaneous nodules [^112iK5mj]. EN-like lesions have also been reported with **Hodgkin's lymphoma** [^115wr1NG].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic diagnostic approach begins with a detailed history (recent infections, medications, systemic symptoms) and physical examination [^114SFc7U]. Initial laboratory tests should include CBC, ESR, CRP, antistreptolysin O (ASO) titers, tuberculosis screening (PPD or IGRA) [^112ezHfy], and a chest X-ray [^115rkh5r]. Deep incisional or excisional **biopsy** is recommended **for atypical or persistent lesions** [^112ezHfy]. Additional testing can be guided by clinical suspicion and may include autoimmune serologies, pancreatic enzymes, and imaging studies.

### Erythema nodosum [^114nhw2a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis. It is characterized by the presence of rounded or oval, slightly raised, nonulcerative painful red nodules in the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue, ranging from 1 to 6 cm in diameter and sometimes coalescing. These nodules tend to be symmetrical in distribution and are usually located bilaterally on the lower extremities, particularly on the anterior tibial surface. However, they may also involve the ankles, lower parts of the thighs, and forearms.

### Erythema nodosum: A sign of systemic disease [^112ezHfy]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. Erythema nodosum may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Certain drugs, including oral contraceptives and some antibiotics, may also be etiologic.

The hallmark of erythema nodosum is tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that are typically located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. Erythema nodosum does not ulcerate and usually resolves without atrophy or scarring. Most direct and indirect evidence supports the involvement of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to numerous antigens. A deep incisional or excisional biopsy specimen should be obtained for adequate visualization.

Erythema nodosum represents an inflammatory process involving the septa between subcutaneous fat lobules, with an absence of vasculitis and the presence of radial granulomas. Diagnostic evaluation after comprehensive history and physical examination includes complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; testing for streptococcal infection (i.e. throat culture, rapid antigen test, antistreptolysin-O titer, and polymerase chain reaction assay); and biopsy. Patients should be stratified by risk for tuberculosis, with further evaluation such as purified protein derivative test and chest radiography.

### Erythema nodosum: A practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^114SFc7U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules mainly in the lower limbs on the pretibial area. The exact cause of erythema nodosum remains unknown, although it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to various antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, ruling out an underlying disease is imperative before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum.

Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease triggered by a wide range of processes such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, or drugs. The most common identifiable causes include streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy.

We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, which facilitates prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes an initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported; however, these options address the symptoms rather than the triggering cause. An accurate diagnosis will enable the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

### Crohn's disease: A clinical update [^116Kh3gB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

Crohn's disease can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. Common manifestations include weight loss, digital clubbing, erythema nodosum, epigastric abdominal pain, inflammation, fever, and a recent history of NSAID use. Patients may also experience abdominal pain, pyoderma gangrenosum, painful joints, and mouth sores. The disease is prevalent among individuals of Eastern European descent.

Additional symptoms include chronic lower abdominal pain, kidney stones, scleritis, anemia, and the passage of blood in stools. Positive p-ANCA, fatigue, chronic diarrhea, arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and the presence of positive anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies are also observed. Genetic predispositions, aphthous ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and urine calcium oxalate stones are relevant factors.

- **Demographics and risk factors**: Peak age of onset is between 20–40 years. Other factors include skin erythema, vomiting, growth delay, autoantibodies, iron deficiency, uveitis, macrocytic anemia, cigarette smoking, iron deficiency anemia, flu-like symptoms, nausea, and Crohn's disease.

### Outbreak of erythema nodosum of unknown cause - New Mexico, November 2007-January 2008 [^113LeJeG]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis and has been associated with several infectious and noninfectious etiologies. EN clusters have been linked to outbreaks of infections by Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. In December 2007, a physician from a rural New Mexico community of approximately 10,000 persons reported to the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) that 13 patients had been diagnosed with EN since mid-November. No EN outbreak had ever been detected in this community; since 2006, only one diagnosis of EN had been made at the local health-care facility. The NMDOH initiated an investigation to confirm the existence of the outbreak, determine the underlying etiology, and implement control measures. This report describes the results of that investigation.

Twenty-five EN cases were identified. Seventeen of 20 patients who answered a standard questionnaire reported being at a construction site with crowded and dusty conditions before EN onset. Nine of 15 chest radiographs were abnormal. Serologic test results were interpreted as negative for mycotic agents and inconclusive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. No etiology of the outbreak could be found. During an EN outbreak, timely (acute and convalescent) specimen collection, ideally from case-patients and control subjects to determine baseline seropositivity, and sensitive tests (e.g. polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are essential to differentiate among possible causes of EN.

### Primary tuberculosis cases presenting with erythema nodosum [^1119rQXk]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is seen only in the primary tuberculosis (TB) form of tuberculous diseases. Among the etiologies of EN, TB is the most frequent disorder in developing countries. We aimed to assess our patients with EN in reference to primary TB. We evaluated 335 patients with the diagnosis of TB during the last 20 years; retrospectively, 61 (18%) of these cases had pulmonary and 274 (82%) had extrapulmonary TB. Ten (16%) of the pulmonary TB cases were primary. All 10 patients with primary TB presented with EN. Among 50 patients with EN diagnosed and followed during the last 10 years, the etiology was determined in 56%, and primary TB was the most frequent: 20%.

### Behcet's syndrome in nonendemic regions [^112YxxqU]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Behcet's syndrome, though more common in certain geographic regions, can also occur outside these areas. It is essential to include it in the differential diagnosis of many patients due to its overlapping features with numerous rheumatologic conditions.

- **Recent findings**: In regions with immigrant populations, there seem to be similarities in Behcet's prevalence to that of originating countries. However, the syndrome is not confined to individuals from specific backgrounds and can be observed in others as well. Emerging evidence indicates that even though the prevalence of Behcet's may mirror endemic areas, the condition in nonendemic regions may manifest less severely. This suggests potential environmental factors influencing the disease's severity. Additionally, women are overrepresented in nonendemic areas, possibly contributing to less severe symptoms, as Behcet's tends to be more severe in men.

- **Summary**: The distinct presentation of Behcet's syndrome in nonendemic regions must be considered when evaluating Behcet's in differential diagnoses. Investigating the potentially milder form of the disease in these areas may offer new insights into the pathogenesis of this condition.

### Cutaneous sarcoidosis: differential diagnosis [^1116ZirE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with cutaneous lesions present in 20%-35% of patients. Given the wide variability of clinical manifestations, it is considered one of the "great imitators", necessitating the consideration of clinical, epidemiological, radiographic, laboratory, and histopathological criteria for diagnosis.

Cutaneous lesions are classified as specific and nonspecific, depending on the presence of noncaseating granulomas on histologic studies. Specific lesions include maculopapules, plaques, nodules, lupus pernio, scar infiltration, alopecia, ulcerative lesions, and hypopigmentation, among others. Nail, mucosal, and childhood sarcoidosis represent a distinct subset of the disease process. The most common nonspecific lesion is erythema nodosum, with others including calcifications, prurigo, erythema multiforme, nail clubbing, and Sweet syndrome.

The importance of considering cutaneous sarcoidosis in the clinical differential diagnosis of a given skin lesion lies in the association with systemic involvement and the convenience of skin as a tissue source for histologic analysis.

### Erythema nodosum as a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 infection [^115jM6Np]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a common dermatological manifestation with many different aetiologies. Often, however, the aetiology remains unidentified. We present here a 42-year-old male patient with EN due to an acute COVID-19 infection. Most of the usual aetiologies were excluded by laboratory testing and imaging studies. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of this cutaneous manifestation in the context of a COVID-19 infection. The EN was successfully treated with the resolution of the COVID-19 infection and the application of topical corticosteroids.

### Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa with clinical features of pyoderma gangrenosum [^1134j1ct]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 49-year-old White female smoker with a history of intravenous drug use and chronic hepatitis B complicated by early cirrhosis presented to the emergency room for painful ulcers on her right third finger and right second toe. She reported a 4-year history of spontaneous, painful black nodules, which would ulcerate and then heal with scarring. She had been treated with multiple rounds of oral and intravenous antibiotics for presumed infections without resolution. Review of systems was significant for subjective fevers, occasional aphthous ulcers, nonspecific eye redness, morning stiffness, and weight gain. She denied genital ulcers, fatigue, chills, photosensitivity, and leg cramps on exertion.

Physical examination found an afebrile woman in no acute distress, with tender papules on the right dorsal third finger (Fig 1, A) and right first and second toes. There were tender, stellate-shaped plaques with underlying indurated-to-firm discrete nodules on her bilateral thighs (Fig 1, B), right forearm, and left elbow. Cribriform scarring was present on the left posterior lower leg. Evaluation of conjunctivae and sclera was normal.

- **Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa: Presentation**:
	- A, Hemorrhagic crusted papule with background soft tissue erythema and edema on the right dorsal third finger at presentation.
	- B, Subcutaneous nodules on thighs.

Her liver transaminase levels were slightly elevated consistent with her known liver cirrhosis, but otherwise, her comprehensive metabolic profile and complete blood count values were within normal limits.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^115yyDjP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a reactive cutaneous process most frequently associated with infections, sarcoidosis, rheumatologic diseases, IBD, drugs, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, and malignancies (lymphomas). In up to 60% of cases, no underlying cause is found. EN is the most common form of septal panniculitis and the most frequent skin manifestation associated with IBD. It has been linked with IBD in 11% of cases, occurring more frequently in patients with ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease.

EN is mainly seen in females and in patients with colonic involvement and/or arthritis, typically associated with an exacerbation of the colitis (90%), but not with the severity or colonic extent, although it may even occur before the diagnosis of IBD. EN typically presents as multiple, deep-red tender, painful nodules, usually distributed over the shins. These lesions do not show suppuration, ulceration, or scarring, and they change to a yellowish color, similar to a deep bruise. Outbreaks appear suddenly and may be accompanied by general symptoms.

- **Figure 2**: Erythema nodosum. Multiple red, warm, and tender nodules, classically located on the pretibial surface of the lower extremity.

EN usually regresses spontaneously following a few weeks of supportive treatment with compression stockings, leg elevation, and rest. It sometimes leaves mild hyperpigmentation on the skin. When associated with IBD, EN typically resolves with control of the IBD and often recurs with exacerbations of the bowel disease.

### Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma presented as erythema nodosum: A case report [^112iK5mj]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is an extremely rare subtype of primary cutaneous T cell lymphomas that mimics panniculitis. Clinically, patients usually present with subcutaneous nodules, often leading to an initial misdiagnosis as a benign cutaneous condition. This case report details a 40-year-old female who presented with subcutaneous erythematous nodules on her extremities accompanied by fever. Based on clinical presentation, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of SPTCL was made. The patient received injections of recombinant human interferon α-1b (30μg) every other day for three months. The lesions gradually regressed, and no new erythema nodules reappeared during the 10-month follow-up.

In 18.3% (n = 26) of cases, a skin biopsy was taken to confirm the diagnosis, most commonly among those aged ≥ 40 years (p < 0.01). At the time of diagnosing erythema nodosum (EN), a chest X-ray was performed in most cases (89.4%), but least often in the youngest age group (p = 0.039). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was analyzed in 127 out of 142 (89.4%) cases, with the mean (SD, min‐max) value being 39.3 mm/h (28.9, 2.0–104.0) in children (normal range, 1–15 mm/h) and 44.4 mm/h (28.0, 2.0–107.0) in adults (normal range, varying from < 10 to < 45 depending on age and sex).

### Erythema nodosum and erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis): Diagnosis and management [^1115ycX1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common type of panniculitis; it may be due to a variety of underlying infectious or otherwise antigenic stimuli. The pathogenesis remains to be elucidated, but both neutrophilic inflammation and granulomatous inflammation are implicated. Beyond treating underlying triggers, therapeutic options consist mainly of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, symptomatic care, potassium iodide, and colchicine.

Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis) is a related but distinctly different clinicopathologic reaction pattern of the subcutaneous fat. It is classically caused by an antigenic stimulus from Mycobacterium tuberculosis but may be associated with several other underlying disorders. After appropriate antimicrobial treatment in tuberculous cases, therapy for erythema induratum is similar to options for erythema nodosum.

A 27-year-old woman with a 5-month history of recurrent erythema nodosum was found to have Hodgkin's disease. A temporal relationship between the two disorders suggested a causative role of the lymphoma. A review of the literature yielded 15 cases of this association, suggesting that the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease should be considered in patients with unexplained erythema nodosum.

### Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma-induced panniculitis [^113dje8d]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Upon examination at the dermatology clinic, the patient presented with numerous tender 2- to 3-cm subcutaneous nodules with overlying erythema. On the right lower extremity, these nodules became confluent, forming a homogeneous pink plaque with poorly demarcated borders. Clinically, the nodules suggested panniculitis. The differential diagnosis included pancreatic panniculitis associated with metastatic acinar cell carcinoma, erythema nodosum, drug-induced panniculitis, lupus panniculitis, and nodular vasculitis. Four-millimeter punch biopsies were performed on the superior and inferior right shin, revealing adipocyte necrosis within fat globules.

- **Fig 1**: A, Indurated erythematous to violaceous nodule on the right shin. B, Several erythematous ulcers with peripheral induration and active yellow to white discharge and tenderness within a large violaceous plaque on the right shin.

- **Fig 2**: Lobular panniculitis with saponification and enzymatic necrosis of fat cells (ghost cell) with some degree of calcification.

Laboratory studies showed an elevated lipase level (810 U/L; reference range, 13–51 U/L). The patient received clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily and reported some symptomatic relief, though she understood that definitive treatment of the panniculitis would require addressing the underlying pancreatic malignancy.

At a follow-up appointment four months later, the patient complained of lower extremity bilateral joint pain, joint swelling, and drainage from the nodules on the right.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^114HoXrY]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

With the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, we have learned a great deal about the potential cutaneous sequelae following infection. The variable dermatologic complications reported from viral infection thus far include pernio-type lesions, urticarial eruptions, vesicular eruptions, and more. Here, we report an atypical presentation of erythema nodosum (EN) following infection with SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, there have only been three other reports of EN secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as COVID-19.

### Panniculitis in a pediatric patient [^116M1aCr]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A 13-year-old girl presented with a 3-month history of intermittent, tender, draining lesions on her trunk, and upper and lower extremities. Physical examination demonstrated several well-defined, pink, indurated tender plaques (Fig 1). The patient was treated for a presumed superficial skin/soft tissue infection with intravenous vancomycin and meropenem. Findings recurred after transitioning to oral antibiotics.

A total of 4 mm punch biopsies obtained from bilateral thighs and right shoulder lesions demonstrated lobular neutrophilic panniculitis without vasculitis (Fig 2, A, B). Wound and tissue cultures showed no significant growth. Workup to determine the underlying cause of panniculitis revealed low levels of α-1 antitrypsin.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
- A. Subcutaneous Sweet's syndrome
- B. α-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) panniculitis
- C. Infection
- D. Erythema nodosum
- E. Pancreatic panniculitis

### Erythema nodosum-like panniculitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: Two cases reporting a rare cutaneous adverse event [^116Mn9Jx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old woman with vulvar melanoma treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab for 4 months and subsequently nivolumab monotherapy for 6 months presented with painful erythematous nodules on the left ankle and right shin. On examination, several red, tender subcutaneous nodules on the lower parts of both legs were observed. A review of systems was negative for fever, arthralgias, pharyngitis, and other upper respiratory symptoms, and there were no changes in her medications.

A punch biopsy of the right leg demonstrated thickening of septa within the adipose tissue with focal granulomas and an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and occasional neutrophils, consistent with erythema nodosum-like panniculitis. Laboratory tests for antinuclear antibodies, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Special stains were negative for fungi, acid-fast bacilli, and bacteria, and tissue cultures were negative for bacterial, fungal, and atypical mycobacterial organisms. A chest X-ray appeared normal and specifically revealed no hilar lymphadenopathy.

A trial of high-potency topical steroid ointment (augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%) was prescribed for 2–3 weeks with clinical resolution of the nodules. She remained on therapy with nivolumab without recurrence. She eventually developed distant metastases and her therapy was changed to regorafenib.

### Exploring the combination of sski and topical heparin in a case of erythema nodosum migrans [^114zPixg]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum migrans (subacute nodular migratory panniculitis) is an uncommon type of panniculitis characterized by migrating subcutaneous nodules or plaques on the lower extremity. There are very few cases of erythema nodosum migrans reported, and thus its appropriate treatment modality is not defined. We describe a case of a 30-year-old male with idiopathic erythema nodosum migrans, which presented as a centrifugally spreading, slightly morpheaform erythematous plaque on the lower left leg. The patient was initially diagnosed and treated as a case of furunculosis with poor clinical response. The skin biopsy showed features consistent with subacute nodular panniculitis. Saturated solution of potassium iodide along with topical heparin successfully treated the patient when the conventional treatment modalities failed. In cases of a morpheaform centrifugally expanded plaque, erythema nodosum migrans should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in the lower extremities in cases of unknown etiology.

### Smoldering cutaneous course of lymphomatoid granulomatosis [^1137YLoa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of granuloma annulare presented in 2010 with bilateral lower-extremity cutaneous lesions. A biopsy specimen showed a septal panniculitis most consistent with erythema nodosum. A second biopsy indicated a lobular panniculitis with primarily granulomatous inflammation without vasculitis. These lesions ultimately resolved in late 2011, following prednisone and dapsone therapy. Subsequently, in December 2015, she developed a new, pruritic, tender, scaly rash on the right arm. A biopsy specimen revealed a nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis of unknown etiology without typical features of granuloma annulare. This lesion resolved with topical steroid use.

In June 2016, she again presented with a new, enlarging, tender, subcutaneous nodule without ulceration or drainage. She was otherwise asymptomatic, without any shortness of breath, cough, fever, or weight loss. On physical examination, she had a single, firm, 5-cm × 3.5-cm nodule located on the left buttock (Fig 1).

- **Figure 1**: Left buttock. Firm, somewhat tender, 5-cm × 3.5-cm, subcutaneous nodule; no overlying epidermal change.

Histologic evaluation revealed involvement of the dermis and subcutis, with an atypical lymphocytic proliferation admixed with abundant macrophages surrounding an extensive area of necrosis, with foci of the atypical lymphocytes involving vessels (Fig 2). The atypical lymphocytes were reactive for CD20 and CD30, while the T cells were reactive for CD3, CD4, and CD5 staining. In situ hybridization for EBV was positive in the tumor, while the serum EBV vir…

### An unusual presentation of Stewart-Treves syndrome on the lower extremity [^114WAcpD]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 94-year-old African-American woman was admitted for cellulitis of the right lower extremity and a 3-month history of painful and bleeding cutaneous lesions in the same area. The lesions developed rapidly and spread proximally. There was no history of trauma, malignancy, pelvic surgery, long-standing infection, or thrombosis of the lower extremities. The patient's chronic bilateral lower extremity lymphedema appeared at age 34, shortly after the birth of her son, but she denied any significant birth trauma. She also denied a family history of lymphedema. Significant medical history included diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and chronic venous stasis with ulcerations.

Physical examination found an ulcerated plaque with jagged borders, studded with multiple firm black nodules above the right medial malleolus. Smaller skin-colored to black nodules and a few bullae were dispersed around the lesion and extended up the proximal right lower leg (Fig 1). Diffuse non-pitting edema and hyperpigmented macules and patches were present on the bilateral lower extremities. No popliteal or inguinal lymphadenopathies were noted. Our differential diagnosis included acroangiodermatitis, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and angiosarcoma.

Two punch biopsies were performed at the edge of the tumor, which found an inflamed scale/crust with underlying epidermal hyperplasia and prominent ectasia of the superficial vasculature. In the mid to deep reticular dermis, there were poorly formed vessels lined by pleomorphic and hyperchromatic endothelial cells.

### Use of etanercept in management of tyrosine kinase-inhibitor-induced erythema nodosum [^112Bgtqb]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

After two weeks, the patient reported sustained clinical improvement; physical examination did not reveal any deep nodules on palpation. The decision was made to restart ponatinib at 15 mg daily. Etanercept, 50 mg once weekly, allowed dosing of ponatinib at 15 mg without recurrence of erythema nodosum (EN). Upon dose escalation to ponatinib, 30 mg, breakthrough EN while on weekly etanercept necessitated the addition of prednisone, 15 to 20 mg, for EN control. Five months later, his BCR-ABL on polymerase chain reaction continued to decrease while on this regimen.

### A rapidly-growing erythematous nodule on the right upper neck [^115w7hoV]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Question**: Which of the following histopathologic features is present in pilomatrical carcinoma?
A. Islands of large oval squamous cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and evidence of clear cell differentiation
B. Nodules, nests, and trabeculae of neoplastic cells within the dermis with round nuclei, scant cytoplasm, conspicuous mitoses, and apoptotic bodies
C. Irregularly shaped nests of large anaplastic basaloid cells with an infiltrative growth pattern, follicular matrical differentiation, and intra-tumoral melanocytic hyperplasia
D. Basaloid lobules with peripheral palisading and the presence of shadow cells
E. Solid nests of basaloid cells undergoing trichilemmal-type keratinization with foreign body reaction and calcification

- **Answers**
- **A. Islands of large oval squamous cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and evidence of clear cell differentiation**: Incorrect. These are features of clear cell squamous carcinoma.
- **B. Nodules, nests, and trabeculae of neoplastic cells within the dermis with round nuclei, scant cytoplasm, conspicuous mitoses, and apoptotic bodies**: Incorrect. These are histopathological features typically seen in Merkel cell carcinoma, a cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma typically affecting older and immunosuppressed individuals.
- **C. Irregularly shaped nests of large anaplastic basaloid cells with an infiltrative growth pattern, follicular matrical differentiation, and intra-tumoral melanocytic hyperplasia**: Correct. Pilomatrical carcinomas also demonstrate central areas with necrotic debris and shadow cells.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^113xM1Sx]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a 3-week history of painful, red, swollen skin nodules on her bilateral lower extremities. Her past medical history was significant for a recent COVID-19 infection, diagnosed using rapid nasal swab polymerase chain reaction 7 weeks prior to the presentation. Her symptoms due to the COVID-19 infection included 3 weeks of nausea, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient first noticed tender nodules developing on the lower portion of her legs 3 weeks after she tested positive for COVID-19 infection. She reported that the nodules were painful and interfered with her ability to ambulate. By the onset of nodule development, all other known COVID-19 infection symptoms had resolved. Physical examination revealed tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules involving the anterior and posterior aspects of the bilateral lower extremities (Fig. 1).

The Doppler ultrasound findings of the bilateral lower extremities were negative for venous occlusion prior to her presentation to the dermatology department. A 4-mm punch biopsy from the left distal calf showed septal panniculitis without vasculitis, consistent with erythema nodosum (Figs. 2 and 3). A chest radiograph was negative for acute cardiopulmonary disease, antistreptolysin O titers were negative, and, although she had traveled to Southern California in the preceding 3 months, Coccidioides antigens were absent in the patient's serum. She was treated with a 3-week prednisone taper and betamethasone 0.05%.

### Longstanding red, lobular nodule on an elderly male's thigh [^112M7uxE]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 69-year-old male presented with two adjacent lesions on the left thigh (Fig 1). The initial lesion was first noted nine years prior and was reported to be slow-growing with associated bleeding. Months later, the patient noticed an adjacent asymptomatic lesion. Clinical examination demonstrated a 2.7 × 3.2 centimeter exophytic nodule and a distal flesh-colored, firm, subcutaneous nodule. He denied systemic symptoms. A biopsy of the exophytic nodule showed acrosyringeal cells, ducts, an invasive growth pattern, atypia, mitoses, and necrosis (Fig 2). Immunohistochemical staining for p53 demonstrated a focal null phenotype (Fig 3).

- **Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?**

- **A. Juxtaepidermal poroma** – Incorrect. Poromas are commonly found on the palms or soles as a solitary papule or nodule with a vascular appearance. A poroma is a benign sweat gland tumor and does not have cytologic atypia or mitoses. When a poroma occurs in the papillary dermis with continuity into the epidermis, it is termed juxtaepidermal poroma.

- **B. Eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC)** – Correct. EPC is an uncommon sweat gland malignancy and usually occurs in the elderly. The location of the lesions is helpful for this diagnosis as the lower extremity is the most common site for porocarcinomas. Histology resembles classic poroma but has infiltrative growth, cytologic atypia, mitoses, and necrosis.

- **C. Malignant mixed tumor** – Incorrect. Malignant mixed tumor (malignant chond…

### A child with a long-standing, intensely itching subcutaneous nodule on a thigh: an uncommon (?) reaction to commonly used vaccines [^112kWXeV]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old girl presented with an intensely itching subcutaneous nodule on the front of her thigh. The nodule persisted for 10 months until it was excised. Investigation for malignancy and systemic disease showed no pathological findings. The diagnosis of persistent itching vaccination granuloma was revealed almost two years after the onset of symptoms.

- **Persistent itching subcutaneous nodules**: These nodules at the injection site for aluminum-containing vaccines, mostly diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis combination vaccines for primary immunization of infants, may appear months after vaccination. They can cause prolonged itching lasting years and are often associated with contact allergy to aluminum. The condition is poorly recognized in healthcare, which may lead to prolonged symptoms and unnecessary investigations.

### Recurrent erythema nodosum: A red flag sign of hidden systemic vasculitis [^115nse5B]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Takayasu's arteritis is a rare systemic vasculitis with varied presentations across multiple medical specialties. Here, we present a young woman who had recurrent episodes of erythema nodosum against a background of low-grade fever and no vascular manifestations. The presence of a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate generated a high index of suspicion for underlying vasculitis, and radioimaging confirmed the suspicion of Takayasu's arteritis. The patient was found to have type III disease in the vasculitic stage and was managed with systemic corticosteroids.

### Prurigo nodularis imitators unmasked [^11731t93]. Clinics in Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is characterized by chronic, nodular lesions on the extensor surfaces of the extremities and back. For experienced clinicians, recognizing this diagnosis is usually not difficult; however, it is essential to consider differential diagnoses and identify PN imitators.

We report five patients with severe chronic pruritus who presented with skin lesions resembling PN. They were treated accordingly but were subsequently diagnosed with different underlying diseases, including nodular marginal zone lymphoma (1 case), delusional parasitosis (1 case), well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas arising among PN lesions (2 cases), and PN-like pemphigus foliaceus (1 case).

Critical reassessment of the diagnosis of PN is important to avoid cognitive biases such as availability bias, anchoring bias, or attribution bias, which could lead to delayed diagnosis of the actual disease, inappropriate treatment, and poorer outcomes.

### Non-infectious granulomatous diseases of the skin and their associated systemic diseases: An evidence-based update to important clinical questions [^117RoG46]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Non-infectious granulomatous diseases of the skin are a broad group of distinct reactive inflammatory conditions that share important similarities. They are relatively difficult to diagnose and distinguish both clinically and histologically. Many of these disorders have significant associations with systemic diseases that impact the patient's overall prognosis. In this update, we present emerging concepts and controversies in this field, offering evidence-based answers to seven important clinical questions regarding palisading and epithelioid granulomata.

These questions provide an opportunity to review ten non-infectious granulomatous conditions that have implications for systemic disease: granuloma annulare, annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma, necrobiosis lipoidica, methotrexate-induced accelerated rheumatoid nodulosis, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, interstitial granulomatous drug reaction, palisaded neutrophilic granulomatous dermatitis, sarcoidosis, and metastatic Crohn disease. Recent clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory studies have shed light on these diseases, their association with systemic disorders, and their overall prognoses.

### Thalomid [^114Wdoew]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The primary data demonstrating the efficacy of thalidomide in the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) are derived from published medical literature and a retrospective study of 102 patients treated by the U.S. Public Health Service.

Two double-blind, randomized, controlled trials reported the dermatologic response to a 7-day course of 100 mg thalidomide (administered four times daily) compared to control. Dosage was adjusted for patients weighing under 50 kg.

Waters reported the results of two studies, both double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trials involving a total of 10 hospitalized, steroid-dependent patients with chronic ENL. These patients were treated with either 100 mg thalidomide or a placebo (administered three times daily). All patients also received dapsone. The primary endpoint was the reduction in weekly steroid dosage.

Data on the efficacy of thalidomide in preventing ENL relapse were derived from a retrospective evaluation of 102 patients treated under the auspices of the U.S. Public Health Service. A subset of patients with ENL controlled on thalidomide demonstrated repeated relapses upon drug withdrawal and remission when therapy was reinstated.

Twenty U.S. patients between the ages of 11 and 17 years were treated with thalidomide, generally at a dosage of 100 mg daily. The response rates and safety profiles were similar to those observed in the adult population.

Thirty-two other published studies, involving over 1600 patients, consistently report successful treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL with thalidomide.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are called on to diagnose a variety of skin conditions in diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis is based on the identification of a primary lesion and uses morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. In addition, the distribution and grouping of lesions help support a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists, consciously or unconsciously, use pattern recognition to arrive at their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and previous exposure to similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely common in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and presents an approach to diagnosis.

### Erythema nodosum-like rash in a Covid-19 patient: A case report [^115LUCqG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) is a viral disease first described in Wuhan, China, which has quickly emerged as a global pandemic with a myriad of manifestations, including dermatologic [1,2]. A variety of cutaneous symptoms have presented throughout various stages of the disease [3–5,7,8]. We describe a case of a female patient who presented with an erythema nodosum-like exanthema likely secondary to Covid-19. The patient tested positive for Covid-19 three days prior to presentation for the rash, with minimal other symptoms of Covid-19. Given the high infectivity rate as well as multisystem presentation, it is important to continue to report on novel presentations of the virus for early identification and treatment of complications.

### Erythema nodosum and granulomatous lesions preceding acute myelomonocytic leukemia [^1147pvvN]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

A 65-year-old female with a one-month history of painful eruptions on her lower extremities was admitted to our hospital. Histological examination revealed erythema nodosum (EN), and the patient was treated with oral prednisolone (PSL; 20 mg daily). The eruptions subsided in two weeks. One month later, painful reddish eruptions recurred on her upper limbs and abdomen in addition to her lower extremities. A skin biopsy from an abdominal erythematous plaque revealed a non-caseating granuloma without microorganisms or foreign-body materials. These eruptions also disappeared with treatment with oral PSL (20 mg daily). No underlying disease, including sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, or rheumatoid arthritis, was found. However, five months later, the patient developed conspicuous leukocytosis. She was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4) and treated with chemotherapy. After complete remission had been achieved, the EN reappeared in association with an increase in blastic cells in the bone marrow. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta, which are thought to be essential for granuloma formation and induction of EN, were markedly elevated. Physicians must remember that reEN and granulomatous lesions can be a prodromal sign of leukemia.

### FDG PET/CT showing erythema nodosum associated with tuberculous lymphadenitis [^112YkaWL]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is histopathologically characterized as an acute septal panniculitis of the subcutaneous adipose lobule. It can be either idiopathic or secondary to various underlying conditions. A female patient with EN underwent FDG PET/CT to search for the underlying cause. The images showed enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum with moderately elevated FDG uptake and multifocal increased FDG uptake over her lower extremities. The patient's condition was subsequently diagnosed as EN associated with mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis based on skin biopsy, tuberculin skin test, and treatment response.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^113F5Fda]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is observed across all ages with varying and often unidentified etiology. We studied the etiology and characteristics of EN in Northern Finland by retrieving and analyzing medical records of all patients with a diagnosis code for EN between 1996 and 2019 from Oulu University Hospital. In total, there were 142 EN cases with a female predominance (n = 112, 72.9%). The mean age of the patients was 35.9 years. There were five cases diagnosed with EN in those younger than 2 years of age.

Almost one-third had EN nodules in multiple anatomical locations. In addition to skin findings, systemic symptoms were common (81.0%) and observed more often in men (p < 0.05). In children and adolescents, the most common etiological factors were gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella or Campylobacter', followed by inflammatory bowel diseases and hormonal contraception. Bacterial infections were the most common etiological factor among adults. In 28.2% of the cases, no causative factor was identified.

In this study, EN was seen surprisingly often in small children. Etiological factors varied markedly among different age groups and symptoms differed between the sexes in adults. These aspects should be taken into account when diagnosing EN patients.

### Erythema nodosum after COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient [^116v5Ts2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Discussion

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a type of septal panniculitis believed to be a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. In pediatric patients, systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and arthralgias are less common. EN can be idiopathic or associated with infections, systemic inflammatory conditions, medication use, pregnancy, malignancy, and other conditions. Among pediatric patients, group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infection is the most frequent trigger. Generally, regardless of etiology, it is a self-limiting condition that resolves in 3–6 weeks without long-term sequelae such as scarring or atrophy. Diagnosis primarily relies on clinical presentation; however, in atypical cases, a skin biopsy may be considered. In our case, the diagnosis of EN was based on classic clinical presentation and consultation with an on-site pediatric dermatologist, and a biopsy was not performed due to the typical findings and expected course.

The workup for EN involves assessing potential underlying causes, including tuberculosis (via chest x-ray or interferon-gamma release assays), Streptococcus (antistreptolysin-O titers), and malignancy (complete blood count). For our patient, these tests did not identify an underlying cause. Notably, vaccine-related reactions can manifest up to 6 weeks post-inoculation, per the Centers for Disease Control's timeline for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety. Thus, the recent COVID-19 vaccination was considered a potential factor in our patient's EN.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^112PiVyi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Panniculitis is a condition where the subcutaneous fat tissue becomes inflamed. The most common clinical form of panniculitis is erythema nodosum (EN), characterized by painful, red, rounded nodules traditionally localized on the anterior surface of the limbs. The most common localization is the shins, although other localizations are possible. The etiology of EN is still unknown, with around half of the cases considered idiopathic. The known causes of EN include infections, sarcoidosis, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), drugs (such as contraceptive pills), and neoplastic diseases.

The annual incidence of EN is estimated to be around 15 per 100,000 persons, varying depending on the incidence rate of the causal conditions between populations. EN is more common among females, appearing up to five times more often in women than in men. EN is most often diagnosed in patients from their teens to their 30s, but it can be seen at any age.

The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and etiology associated with EN in patients at the Oulu University Hospital (OUH) in Northern Finland.

### Smoldering cutaneous course of lymphomatoid granulomatosis [^116QgPuX]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Our patient had a long history of recurrent crops of infiltrative papules and nodules that had previously been diagnosed as granuloma annulare and erythema nodosum, respectively. After her diagnosis of lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LyG) in 2016, a review of all biopsies since 2010 revealed findings consistent with LyG, demonstrating an indolent disease process occurring intermittently over the six years prior to the LyG diagnosis.

LyG has, rarely, been reported to have a chronic, cyclic disease course that can exhibit subcutaneous, dermal, and epidermal presentations that heal spontaneously, with or without residual scarring. However, overall, this is atypical for LyG, so we found our patient's chronic course particularly notable.

In conclusion, although primarily a disease of the lungs, LyG can present initially in the skin and may have diverse dermatologic manifestations that mimic a number of other, more common cutaneous disorders. The clinical behavior of LyG can vary widely, from spontaneous remission to behaving as an aggressive large-cell lymphoma. This case demonstrates that some patients with a skin-only presentation can do well for years with skin-directed therapies. However, the transformation to a more aggressive phenotype may eventually occur. At that time, aggressive chemotherapy can lead to a durable remission.

### Atypical erythema nodosum in atypical tuberculosis presentation [^114aqLcj]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory disease affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissue, often associated with systemic conditions such as infectious diseases, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and tumors, particularly lymphoma. EN can also be induced by certain drugs, primarily estroprogestinics, salicylic acid, minocycline, and sulfamidic acid. Given the numerous potential causes, achieving a correct diagnostic interpretation can be challenging, especially when isolated EN is the only revealing symptom, as demonstrated in the following case.

We report a case of a young patient in good clinical condition who developed EN during the course of abdominal tuberculosis. The diagnosis was confirmed through a histologic examination of the abdominal formation, as positron emission tomography and total body axial tomography were not effective in distinguishing EN from malignancies.

### Sweet's syndrome evolved from recurrent erythema nodosum in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome [^113WR2rZ]. The Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man presented with painful nodules on his lower legs. Microscopic examination revealed septal and lobular panniculitis composed of lympho-histiocytic infiltrates. Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the diagnosis of erythema nodosum (EN) was established. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were temporarily effective. However, the eruptions recurred, and 16 months later, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was diagnosed. Six months following this diagnosis, the patient developed a high fever and edematous, fresh red-colored nodules on his neck, arm, and upper trunk. Histopathological examination showed a diffuse, dense dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, leading to the diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome (SS).

SS is known to develop in patients with MDS, and EN is one of the dermatoses associated with hematoproliferative disorders. Furthermore, SS evolving from recurrent EN and the simultaneous occurrence of SS and EN have been documented in some patients. In this case, it is suggested that certain mediators, such as cytokines associated with MDS, might have initially induced EN, and as the MDS progressed, they were replaced by others that led to the development of SS.

### Etiology and therapeutic management of erythema nodosum during pregnancy: An update [^113mmUWG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis. It is characterized by erythematous, raised, tender nodules that usually occur bilaterally on the extensor surfaces of the lower extremities. EN is associated with many underlying conditions, including infection, sarcoidosis, malignancy, and pregnancy. Its underlying etiology, however, is unknown in up to half of cases. Pregnancy is thought to create an optimal background for EN to develop, although the exact mechanisms are unclear.

Immune complexes may play a role in the pathogenesis of EN during pregnancy, or EN may be a hypersensitivity reaction to either estrogens or progesterone. EN is a self-limiting process, and non-pharmacologic means such as bed rest and elastic web bandages may be sufficient to control the symptoms. Potassium iodide, systemic and intralesional corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylates, tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, and dapsone are other treatment options available, but some of these drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy while others are considered safe.

Before prescribing one of these treatments to a pregnant patient, the patient's obstetrician should be consulted, and a careful risk-benefit analysis should be performed.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^116v5B1Q]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, while erythema nodosum (EN) usually resolves with only symptomatic treatment, it is important to exclude the underlying causes. Our study highlights the most common etiologies in Northern Europe and the differences between different age groups. The leading symptoms, as well as their severity, can vary drastically, which may cause the patient to attend a number of different specialist clinics. Thus, awareness of features of EN is important among all physicians.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^113Vjjj8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) can occur at any age, with varying and often unidentified etiology. We studied the etiology and characteristics of EN in Northern Finland by analyzing medical records of all patients with a diagnosis code for EN between 1996 and 2019 from Oulu University Hospital. A total of 142 cases of EN were identified, with a predominance of females (n = 112, 72.9%). The mean age of the patients was 35.9 years, with five cases of EN diagnosed in children younger than 2 years. Almost one-third had EN nodules in multiple anatomical locations.

Systemic symptoms were common, occurring in 81.0% of cases and more frequently seen in men (p < 0.05). Among children and adolescents, the most common etiological factors were gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella, or Campylobacter', followed by inflammatory bowel diseases and hormonal contraception. In adults, bacterial infections were the most common etiological factor. In 28.2% of cases, no causative factor could be identified. This study highlights that EN was surprisingly frequent in small children and that etiological factors varied significantly among different age groups, with symptoms differing between the sexes in adults. These aspects should be considered when diagnosing EN patients.

### Erythema nodosum masking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis as initial skin manifestation [^116fkx7j]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our experience with this patient shows that the early skin features of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) can be histopathologically indistinguishable from erythema nodosum (EN). Furthermore, the acute inflammatory-like reaction experienced by patients post-gadodiamide administration has further raised the suspicion of EN. Nevertheless, we believe that the patient's presentation is within the spectrum of manifestation of NSF. By highlighting this case, we hope to avoid the potential pitfall of missing the early phase of NSF in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who have received gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA).

### HLA-DRB1 associations in biopsy proven erythema nodosum [^116EjnxJ]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the HLA-DRB1 associations in patients with erythema nodosum (EN), establish HLA-DRB1 differences among patients with idiopathic and secondary EN, and identify the HLA-DRB1 associations with specific conditions presenting with EN.

Methods involved a retrospective study of 100 patients (83 women) with biopsy-proven EN diagnosed within a defined population in Northwest Spain. Patients were classified as idiopathic or secondary if skin nodules appeared in the context of a well-defined disease, or if there was a precipitating event temporally related to the onset of EN. Both patients and controls underwent HLA-DRB1 genotyping from DNA using molecular-based methods.

Results indicated that, at the time of diagnosis, no precipitating events or underlying diseases were identified in 35 cases, which were considered idiopathic. Although no strong associations exist between HLA-DRB1 and unstratified EN, the idiopathic group showed a significantly lower frequency of the HLA-DRB1✱04 phenotype compared with controls. Among patients with secondary EN, those with sarcoidosis exhibited a significantly increased frequency of HLA-DRB1✱13 compared with healthy controls.

The conclusion is that idiopathic and some groups of secondary EN exhibit different HLA-DRB1 associations. These differences may hold prognostic value in identifying patients with specific conditions associated with this syndrome.

### Transient leg nodules [^113aYyJP]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male presented to a pediatric dermatology clinic with painful, skin-colored leg nodules (Fig 1). For the past 7 months, these nodules would transiently appear and disappear on his left lower leg while walking long distances or uphill. In the clinic, standing or bearing weight on the leg elicited the appearance of the nodules, while plantar flexion of the foot and cessation of weight bearing caused the nodules to disappear (Video 1, available).

The patient had previously seen other medical providers and underwent static leg ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, which revealed no abnormalities.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Lipoma
	- B. Vascular malformation
	- C. Epidermal inclusion cyst
	- D. Dermatofibroma
	- E. Tibialis anterior muscle herniation

- **Answer**:
	- A. Lipoma — Incorrect. Lipomas are slow-growing benign fat tissue tumors that can present as flesh-colored nodules. They would not disappear upon movement and are not typically painful.
	- B. Vascular malformation — Incorrect. Vascular malformations result from abnormal development of capillaries, veins, arteries, or lymphatics. While not always noticed at birth, they typically present in the first decade of life and would be visualized by ultrasound or MRI.
	- C. Epidermal inclusion cyst — Incorrect. Epidermal inclusion cysts present as a subcutaneous nodule that may fluctuate in size over time. However, movement would not cause them to transiently appear and disappear.
	- D. Dermatofibroma — Incorrect. Dermatofibromas are common fibrous nodules that dimple upon pinching of surrounding skin.

### Erythema nodosum-like lesions in treated Whipple's disease: Signs of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [^116LwupS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment of systemic infections due to mycobacteria and HIV infection can lead to paradoxical worsening, known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, in a minority of patients. Herein, we describe a patient with Whipple's disease, a chronic systemic inflammatory disease caused by Tropheryma whipplei, who developed cutaneous and later ocular disease after initiation of antibiotic therapy.

A 42-year-old man with a 12-year history of arthralgias presented with deteriorating health, including weight loss, diarrhea, fever, and acral hyperkeratosis. Whipple's disease was suspected and subsequently confirmed by finding periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive foamy macrophages and T. whipplei DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in duodenal biopsy specimens. After five weeks of antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone, erythema nodosum (EN)-like lesions developed on the legs and trunk. Notably, lesional and nonlesional skin harbored intracellular and extracellular degenerated bacteria that were associated with a neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammatory response in lesional skin.

Continued antibiotic therapy was associated with recurring EN-like skin nodules, orbital swelling, and facial herpes simplex virus 1 infection. Corticosteroid therapy controlled the duration and severity of the EN-like nodules and orbital swelling. Apart from cutaneous hyperpigmentation, skin disease in Whipple's disease is infrequent and can be categorized as disorders due to malnutrition from malabsorption or so-called reversal reactions consisting of reactive erythemas and neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammatory responses.

### Erythema nodosum masking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis as initial skin manifestation [^113ARX67]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The patient was a 23-year-old lady with end-stage renal failure (ESRF) secondary to glomerulonephritis. She had been receiving automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for 5 years before presenting to the emergency department with an asymptomatic right-sided clavicular lump. The attending emergency physician treated the lump conservatively. During one of the subsequent APD clinic follow-ups, she again raised concerns about the persistent right clavicular lump. She was referred to the orthopedic surgeon for a second clinical opinion.

An ultrasound scan of the clavicle was carried out, reporting the lump as an isoechoic lesion in which the possibility of abscess formation could not be ruled out. In order to further clarify the nature of the lump, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan with gadodiamide (Omniscan, GE Health Diagnostics, Amersham, UK) at a dose of 0.1 ml/kg was conducted. Two days after the MRI scan, she experienced a febrile illness that lasted for more than two weeks. The illness was associated with migratory joint pains, malaise, and fatigue. Concurrently, she was noted to have multiple dusky erythematous nodules over her lower limbs with corresponding pitting edema up to the ankles (Fig. 1).

A skin biopsy of the lesion revealed erythema nodosum (EN), with lymphocytes and histiocytes reported to have infiltrated the subcutaneous layers, mainly involving the fibro adipose septa and the lower part of the dermis. There was also necrosis of the adipose tissues. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltration was observed.

### An unusual presentation of Vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^113YhS8W]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 77-year-old woman was referred to our dermatology clinic with a 5-month history of an enlarging, erythematous to brownish indurated lesion on the left thigh. The lesion was mildly tender and expanding centrifugally over the last 5 months. No physical trauma or infection preceded the lesion. Her medical history included a hip replacement surgery, cataracts, and hypothyroidism. She was taking L-thyroxin for her hypothyroidism, and her thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within the normal range.

Physical examination found a large annular plaque on the medial left thigh with an erythematous mildly tender border (Fig 1). No overlying ulceration was observed. Based on the clinical presentation, our differential diagnosis included eosinophilic cellulitis, necrobiosis lipoidica, and morphea. A punch biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis; however, results were inconclusive.

At the second clinical visit, the lesion appeared to have migrated from the left medial thigh to the left lower limb (Fig 2). A punch biopsy of the new tender area found mixed histopathologic findings consistent with the clinical course (Figs 3 and 4).

- **Histopathologic findings**: Mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with vascular proliferation in the superficial and deep dermis was observed. The subcutaneous tissue showed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and slight thickening. Some of the lymphohistiocytic infiltrate extended to the periphery of the subcutaneous lobules. No neutrophilic infiltrate or well-formed granulomas were seen. Overall, the changes were that of dermal and subcutaneous septal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with vascular changes.

### Erythema nodosum masking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis as initial skin manifestation [^113X46dz]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a complication associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents used in imaging studies. It is typically characterized by hard, erythematous, and indurated skin plaques with surrounding subcutaneous edema. Distinct papules and subcutaneous nodules can also be observed. Fibrocytes in NSF are immunohistochemically positive for CD34.

- **Case presentation**: We present a case of NSF occurring after gadolinium exposure, wherein the initial presentation mimicked an erythema nodosum (EN)-like picture. An initial skin biopsy indicated EN. Subsequently, the patient developed progressive skin and joint contractures. A repeated skin biopsy conducted three months later confirmed the diagnosis of NSF. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of NSF that mimicked the presentation of EN in the early phase of the disease.

- **Conclusions**: The appearance of EN-like disease can be one of the early manifestations of NSF. We hope that early recognition of this unusual presentation can alert physicians or nephrologists to the potential diagnosis of NSF.

### Concurrent Sweet's syndrome and erythema nodosum [^116dTwgp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old Mexican man was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, sore throat, and red, tender leg nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum. The white blood cell count was 35,000. Several days later, annular plaques and pustules developed on his face, neck, and forearms. A facial skin biopsy showed neutrophilic dermatitis without evidence of infection or vasculitis, consistent with Sweet's syndrome. The biopsy of the thigh was non-diagnostic but showed a mixed neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

- **Erythema nodosum (EN)**: A form of panniculitis characterized by painful red nodules over the pretibial area.
- **Sweet's syndrome (SS)**: An acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and erythematous plaques involving the arms, trunk, and neck. Vesiculopustules, nodules, and ulcers may also occur.

Simultaneous occurrence of EN and SS has been increasingly reported. Both appear to be reactive dermatoses with overlapping clinical and histopathologic features. Although often idiopathic, both disorders are associated with upper respiratory infections, medications, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease). Treatment includes corticosteroids, potassium iodide, or colchicine. SS generally responds well to therapy but recurs in up to…

### Recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura with bullous rash and pulmonary nodules [^116ksWMa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Low credibility.

A 12-year-old girl presented in early October with a one-week history of a progressive and painful bullous rash on the distal lower extremities, abdominal pain, a nonproductive cough, and pleuritic chest pain (Fig. 1a). She denied experiencing fevers, mucosal lesions, hematemesis, arthralgia, hematuria, melena, or hematochezia. Her medical history was notable for an identical rash diagnosed as Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) four years prior, which was accompanied by significant abdominal pain, hematuria, and proteinuria, though no pulmonary involvement was noted at that time. She had been treated with a high-dose oral prednisone taper but did not show improvement until several weeks after the completion of that treatment course. She remained symptom-free in the interim. The patient had traveled to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in the months preceding the presentation but had no other travel history.

- **Physical exam**: On physical examination, the rash on her feet and ankles was bullous and in various stages of healing, with exquisite tenderness to palpation and a positive Nikolsky's sign. She had clustered vesicles with an erythematous base on the bilateral extensor surfaces of her elbows and scattered non-blanching pinpoint erythematous macules on the inferior aspect of her bilateral buttocks. The cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for an intermittent, dry cough. Her chest pain was not reproducible with palpation.

- **Laboratory findings**: Basic laboratory tests were remarkable for elevations in inflammatory markers.

### Papules developing in an old tattoo [^112yd6Qh]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Two months later, this patient suddenly developed a low-grade fever and 2- to 4-cm tender, erythematous swollen areas on the shins. There was no scarring or atrophy.

- **Question 3**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Erythema nodosum
	- B. Necrobiosis lipoidica
	- C. Nodular vasculitis
	- D. Pretibial myxedema
	- E. Factitial disease

- **Answers**:
	- A. Erythema nodosum – Correct. Of the nonspecific manifestations of sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum is the most common. It is a hypersensitivity reaction in fat septae, but the pathophysiologic basis of this condition in sarcoidosis is unknown. It manifests as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often on the anterior tibia. It can be accompanied by fever, malaise, and polyarthralgia.
	- B. Necrobiosis lipoidica – Incorrect. This condition is associated with diabetes mellitus and presents with atrophy, which was not seen in this patient.
	- C. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. Nodular vasculitis involves medium-sized arteries in the reticular dermis and can appear much like the nodular swellings of erythema nodosum. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
	- D. Pretibial myxedema – Incorrect. Pretibial myxedema is the result of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. It is most commonly associated with Graves disease. It is typically asymptomatic and is characterized by swelling and induration of the lower legs. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
	- E. Factitial disease – Incorrect. This would be a consideration if the nodules in the tattoo were thought to be of factitial origin. Histopathology for factitial disease would be nonspecific.

### Nodular granulomatous phlebitis: An uncommon tuberculid [^116Kqtm1]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Nodular granulomatous phlebitis is a tuberculid that should be considered in patients with tender subcutaneous nodules, granulomatous phlebitis on histology, and resolution of lesions when starting antituberculous therapy. The presence of a granulomatous vasculitis or phlebitis should prompt a thorough search for tuberculosis and exclude other causes of granulomatous vasculitis.

### Nodules developing after radiofrequency ablation of varicosities: A potential clinical and histopathologic mimic of polyarteritis nodosa [^114roHjG]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 46-year-old nurse with a history of hypothyroidism presented for evaluation of persistent tender nodules on her lower legs. Five months prior, she had undergone RFA of her bilateral great saphenous veins on three separate visits over three weeks' time. No associated sclerotherapy or microphlebectomy was performed. Tender and erythematous nodules developed on the lower legs distal to the areas of ablation within days of each treatment. She denied systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or abdominal pain. Empiric treatment for suspected infection with oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, and topical bacitracin did not result in improvement. Oral prednisone led to some relief of symptoms and diminution of lesions, but her skin lesions persisted and worsened once her oral corticosteroid taper was complete.

Examination found scattered pink and tender indurated 1- to 2-cm nodules on the bilateral lower legs, most noticeably on the right medial lower leg (Fig 1). Biopsy found inflammation involving the wall of a medium-sized vessel at the dermal-subcutaneous junction (Fig 2). There was inflammation immediately around blood vessels but no diffuse lobular inflammation indicative of erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis). Tissue culture for fungal, mycobacterial, and aerobic organisms was negative. Thorough duplex ultrasound examinations of the legs found changes of prior venous ablation but were negative for superficial or deep venous thrombosis. A diagnosis of PAN was suspected, but findings of laboratory studies including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, comprehensive…

### Unexplained recurrent fever: When is autoinflammation the explanation [^115cW19G]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Recurrent fever can be the sole or leading manifestation of a variety of diseases, including malignancies, autoimmune diseases, and infections. Because the differential diagnoses are manifold, no formal guidelines for the approach of patients with recurrent fever exist. The newly recognized group of autoinflammatory diseases is often accompanied by repetitive fever attacks. As these episodes are frequently associated with a variety of divergent presentations, differentiating other causes of febrile illnesses can be difficult.

In this article, we first review disease entities that frequently present with the symptom of recurrent fever. Next, we summarize their characteristic pattern of disease presentation. Finally, we analyze key features of autoinflammatory diseases, which are helpful in distinguishing this group of diseases from other causes of recurrent fever. Recognizing these symptom patterns can provide crucial clues and, thus, lead to the initiation of targeted specific diagnostic tests and therapies.

### An unusual presentation of Vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^111o8L1c]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

ENM was first described by Bafverstedt in 1954. Subsequently, Vilanova and Pinol Aguadé referred to the condition as subacute nodular migratory panniculitis, and it has now come to be known as Vilanova disease. The condition is characterized by deep-seated nodular lesions that often enlarge via confluence or peripheral extension to form large plaques. Classically, the lesions appear unilaterally as single, discrete erythematous plaques. The nodules do not ulcerate, and over weeks or months, the nodules may migrate and become crescentic in nature.

ENM is more common in women, and it is often compared with EN, which is the most common cause of panniculitis. Lesions in ENM are less tender than those in EN. The subcutaneous nodules or plaques in ENM persist for a longer period compared with EN nodules. Furthermore, ENM is typically unilateral, whereas EN is typically bilateral. Most cases of ENM are idiopathic in origin; however, a significant proportion of EN cases are preceded by infection, autoimmune disease, medication adverse effects, and cancer. Although an underlying etiology is not usually identified in ENM, streptococcal infection has been implicated in some cases. Generally, EN is self-limiting, whereas ENM lesions can last for months.

### Primary cutaneous cryptococcal infection with subsequent erythema nodosum in a 10-year-old immunocompetent girl [^1119iBpz]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

This patient's erythema nodosum (EN) began to improve during her short hospital stay, where she received supportive care. She was discharged before receiving a diagnosis for her ulcer and was given a 2-week course of clindamycin. After leaving the hospital, the patient was lost to follow-up and was not seen in the clinic until 6 months after her hospitalization. At that point, her primary lesion and the EN had resolved without systemic antifungal treatment.

### Late-stage nodular erythema elevatum diutinum [^112N9Yek]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare, chronic vasculitic process of unknown etiology that presents as bilateral, symmetrical, periarticular, red-brown papules and plaques, often found over the dorsa of joints. Early histologic changes are characterized by leukocytoclastic vasculitis. With chronicity, the lesions develop a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and fibrosis.

We describe an unusual case of late-stage nodular EED present for 35 years in a seronegative 75-year-old man. Asymptomatic papules and plaques, measuring from 0.7 to 9.0 cm, were observed over the interphalangeal joints, elbows, knees, and ankles. The histologic findings were characterized by predominant concentric fibrosis, forming well-circumscribed dermal and subcutaneous nodules. Awareness of this unusual presentation of EED helps avoid misdiagnosis as cutaneous neoplasms.

### Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of erythema nodosum: A case report [^112M9ACx]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common inflammation of the subcutaneous fat tissue, known as panniculitis. It requires an interdisciplinary approach and exclusion of all underlying causes. We present a case of an 18-year-old female with a history of recurrent streptococcal infections who developed pain and swelling in the left ankle. To evaluate the persistent ankle swelling, the physician ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity. The MRI appearance of EN has not been described in detail in the literature so far.

### Diffuse painful erythema on right thigh [^1167thV6]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 37-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented with a 1-month history of a diffuse, painful, and erythematous swelling on her right thigh (Fig 1), along with high fever (up to 41°C), arthralgia, headache, and night sweats. She was initially treated with multiple antibiotics for infection, but the treatment failed. Routine laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 2.40 × 10⁹/L (reference range: 4.00–10.00 × 10⁹/L), lactate dehydrogenase 2213 U/L (reference range: 114–240 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 260 U/L (reference range: 1–40 U/L), and aspartate aminotransferase 626 U/L (reference range: 1–37 U/L). Blood culture results were negative. Bone marrow biopsy was unremarkable. Subsequently, biopsies of the right thigh (Fig 2) as well as immunohistochemistry (Fig 3) were performed.

### Erythema nodosum masking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis as initial skin manifestation [^111QmusB]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a complication associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents used in imaging studies. It is typically characterized by hard, erythematous, and indurated skin plaques accompanied by surrounding subcutaneous edema. Distinct papules and subcutaneous nodules can also be observed. Fibrocytes in NSF are immunohistochemically positive for CD34.

- **Case presentation**: We present a case of NSF that occurred after gadolinium exposure in which the initial presentation mimicked an erythema nodosum (EN)-like picture. An initial skin biopsy showed EN. Subsequently, the patient developed progressive skin and joint contractures. A repeated skin biopsy done three months later confirmed the diagnosis of NSF. As far as we are aware, this is the second reported case of NSF that mimicked the presentation of EN in the early phase of the disease.

- **Conclusions**: The appearance of an EN-like disease can be one of the early manifestations of NSF. We hope that early recognition of this unusual presentation can alert physicians or nephrologists to the potential diagnosis of NSF.

### Annually recurring erythema annulare centrifugum: a distinct entity [^116SjaS5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Four patients presenting with a peculiar clinical variant of erythema annulare centrifugum are reported. The lesions were clinically and histopathologically indistinguishable from classic superficial erythema annulare centrifugum; however, constant annual and seasonal recurrences were observed for many years or decades. No clear precipitating factor could be identified, and no associated symptoms were present. The eruption regressed spontaneously following a variable period of days to months. Annually recurring erythema annulare centrifugum seems to represent a rare, distinct clinical entity that has received little attention in the literature. Clinicopathologic features of this peculiar clinical disorder and the differential diagnosis with other seasonal eruptions are reviewed.
