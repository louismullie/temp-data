## Question

Shingles management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about shingles management, preserving the step-by-step thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and assessing severity and risk factors. Then, I should verify indications and timing for antiviral therapy and select the regimen. Next, I will review acute pain management and when to escalate. After that, I need to consider special populations and complications, including ophthalmic and neurologic disease. Finally, I will address prevention with vaccination and summarize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements and correct them explicitly as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity framework. Shingles is typically a clinical diagnosis defined by a unilateral, dermatomal vesicular rash with neuropathic pain, often preceded by prodromal dysesthesia for 24–72 hours; atypical presentations or immunocompromised hosts warrant PCR confirmation from lesion swabs or blood if dissemination is suspected, and I should remember that in the absence of a rash, diagnosis can be challenging, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion in the right epidemiologic context [^113HfjAs] [^111upqMD]. I should also assess risk factors for complications: age ≥ 50 years, immunocompromise, severe prodrome, severe pain, hemorrhagic or necrotizing lesions, satellite lesions, mucosal involvement, and head/neck localization, especially ophthalmic or otic branches, because these factors change both treatment urgency and prognosis [^112XxT5d] [^113HfjAs].

> Now, I need to check the timing and indications for antiviral therapy. The therapeutic window is strongest when started within 72 hours of rash onset; beyond 72 hours, I should still treat if new lesions are appearing, if the patient is ≥ 50 years old, if there is head/neck involvement, if pain is moderate-to-severe, or if the patient is immunocompromised, because ongoing viral replication can still be mitigated in these scenarios [^1151tq3B] [^112XxT5d]. Wait, let me verify a potential inconsistency: one European statement suggests avoiding antivirals after 72 hours in uncomplicated thoracic/lumbar zoster in patients < 50 years; however, multiple guidelines endorse treatment beyond 72 hours when new lesions appear or risk factors for complications exist, so I should reconcile this by individualizing decisions rather than applying a blanket "do-not-treat" rule after 72 hours in low-risk patients without new lesions [^116FkpfQ] [^1151tq3B].

> Next, I should review first-line oral regimens and dosing. For immunocompetent adults with localized disease, preferred options are valacyclovir 1 g orally three times daily, famciclovir 500 mg orally three times daily, or acyclovir 800 mg orally five times daily, all for 7–10 days, with consideration of extending to 14 days if lesions are slow to resolve; I should confirm that famciclovir's efficacy wanes if started beyond 72 hours, reinforcing the timing imperative [^116RLLy2]. Hold on, I should verify the role of brivudin; where available, once-daily brivudin is an accepted alternative with favorable dosing convenience, but it is not universally available and should be selected via shared decision-making considering cost, access, and comorbidities [^113ZLx5c].

> For immunocompromised patients or complicated disease, I need to ensure I escalate appropriately. IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg every 8 hours is indicated for extensive cutaneous disease, visceral involvement, CNS disease, or high-risk immunocompromised hosts, with step-down to oral therapy after clinical improvement to complete a total of 10–14 days; dosing may be extended up to 21 days in severe cases, and I should monitor renal function closely given acyclovir's nephrotoxic potential [^112WVpEB] [^1113FvE1]. I should double-check that oral agents alone are insufficient in disseminated or visceral disease; yes, guidelines consistently recommend IV therapy as initial management in these scenarios [^112WVpEB].

> Let me consider acute pain management alongside antivirals. I should follow the WHO analgesic ladder, starting with acetaminophen or NSAIDs, then adding a weak opioid such as tramadol or codeine if needed, and escalating to a strong opioid for severe pain; for neuropathic components, I can add gabapentin or pregabalin, and consider a tricyclic antidepressant such as nortriptyline or amitriptyline, recognizing that these neuroactive agents may not be formally approved for acute zoster pain in some jurisdictions but are guideline-supported for moderate-to-severe pain or high PHN risk [^113NartA] [^11584R5d]. Wait, I should confirm topical therapies in the acute phase; European guidance advises against topical local anesthetics or capsaicin during acute zoster because of irritation, so I will reserve topical agents for PHN rather than acute pain [^116z5Q3F].

> I will now examine special populations and complications. In HIV, preferred therapy mirrors immunocompetent dosing for localized disease, but I should extend or use IV therapy for extensive or visceral involvement and coordinate with ART optimization; immune reconstitution after ART initiation can transiently increase zoster risk, so I need to anticipate timing and counsel patients accordingly [^111Fta1c] [^117Sh2mQ]. In pregnancy, I should confirm that oral acyclovir or valacyclovir are acceptable after the first trimester when benefits outweigh risks, and involve obstetric collaboration for management decisions [^notfound]. For ophthalmic zoster, I should urgently initiate systemic antivirals, arrange same-day ophthalmology co-management, and apply topical antivirals such as acyclovir 3% ointment five times daily; for stromal keratitis, disciform keratitis, endotheliitis, or anterior uveitis, topical corticosteroids under ophthalmology supervision are indicated to reduce inflammation, and for acute retinal necrosis, IV acyclovir induction followed by prolonged oral therapy is recommended [^114Vs6hZ] [^1154u1ro] [^113m9hWN]. But wait, what if there is motor involvement or autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury patients? I should treat the zoster promptly and manage autonomic dysreflexia acutely, as illustrated by case-based experience [^1164M9Ge].

> Next, I should review prevention to reduce recurrence and PHN. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, Shingrix) is preferred and recommended as a two-dose series for immunocompetent adults ≥ 50 years and for immunocompromised adults ≥ 19 years; I need to ensure completion of the series because efficacy exceeds 90% for preventing shingles and PHN, and I should use clinical nudges or pharmacy workflows to improve second-dose completion and timeliness [^111upqMD] [^1156aSVP]. Hold on, I should verify timing after an acute episode; consensus is to wait until the acute illness and symptoms have resolved before vaccinating, even though formal interval guidance is limited, so I will document resolution before scheduling vaccination [^113npfCb]. I also need to remember that live attenuated zoster vaccine is generally contraindicated in significant immunosuppression, reinforcing RZV as the vaccine of choice in that population [^113pzzmK].

> I need to ensure I address postherpetic neuralgia management if pain persists beyond 90 days. First-line pharmacotherapies include gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline or amitriptyline, and topical options including lidocaine 5% patches and capsaicin 8% patches applied for 30–90 minutes in clinic; tramadol or other opioids can be considered for refractory pain, and I should reassess pain scores, sleep, mood, and function to guide titration and combinations [^117CTL7m] [^113GFono]. Let me verify the role of topical capsaicin; yes, moderate-quality evidence supports capsaicin 8% patch use for PHN, and I should counsel on transient burning and the need for skilled application [^113GFono].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check for internal consistency. In all suspected cases, confirm diagnosis clinically and assess severity and risk; if within 72 hours of rash onset or if new lesions are appearing, initiate antiviral therapy tailored to patient factors and disease extent; for immunocompetent localized disease, use valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir orally for 7–10 days, extending if needed; for immunocompromised or complicated disease, start IV acyclovir and step down to oral therapy to complete 10–14 days; concurrently, implement WHO-step analgesia and add gabapentinoids or TCAs for neuropathic pain; arrange ophthalmology co-management for ocular involvement; and schedule RZV vaccination after recovery to prevent recurrence and PHN, documenting shared decision-making throughout [^113HfjAs] [^111upqMD] [^112XxT5d].

Shingles management centers on **early antiviral therapy** [^1151tq3B] with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir within 72 hours of rash onset [^113HfjAs] to reduce severity, accelerate healing, and lower the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) [^111SYEHF]. Pain control follows the **WHO ladder** [^113NartA], using acetaminophen or NSAIDs first, then adding gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^117CTL7m]; opioids are reserved for severe pain. Topical lidocaine or capsaicin are options for localized PHN [^113HfjAs]. Immunocompromised patients or those with disseminated disease require IV acyclovir [^1113FvE1] and specialist input [^notfound]. Prevention is key: **recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix)** is recommended for adults ≥ 50 years [^111upqMD] and immunocompromised patients ≥ 19 years [^111upqMD]. Patient education on contagion, complications, and follow-up is essential [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Shingles presents with a **unilateral, dermatomal rash** [^113HfjAs] of vesicles on an erythematous base, often preceded by prodromal pain, tingling, or itching [^114vCn8P]. Diagnosis is primarily clinical; PCR can confirm atypical cases or in immunocompromised patients [^111SYEHF].

---

## Antiviral therapy

Antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of shingles management [^115nJNKb]. Early initiation (within 72 hours of rash onset) significantly reduces viral replication, accelerates lesion healing, and decreases the risk of complications, including PHN [^113hudYL].

| **Antiviral agent** | **Dosage and administration** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Acyclovir | 800 mg orally five times daily for 7–10 days | - Immunocompetent patients <br/> - Alternative for immunocompromised patients if oral therapy is feasible [^112WVpEB] |
| Valacyclovir | 1,000 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days | - Immunocompetent patients <br/> - Preferred due to convenient dosing [^113ZLx5c] [^111Fta1c] |
| Famciclovir | 500 mg orally three times daily for 7–10 days | - Immunocompetent patients <br/> - Alternative to valacyclovir [^111Fta1c] [^113hudYL] |
| Acyclovir (IV) | 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days | - Immunocompromised patients <br/> - Disseminated disease <br/> - Severe complications [^1113FvE1] [^112WVpEB] |

---

Antiviral therapy beyond 72 hours is indicated if new lesions are appearing, the patient is immunocompromised, or complications are present [^1151tq3B].

---

## Pain management

Pain management is essential in shingles care [^113NartA]. The **WHO analgesic ladder** guides therapy:

- **Step 1**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs for mild pain.
- **Step 2**: Gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) for moderate neuropathic pain [^117CTL7m].
- **Step 3**: Tramadol or short-term opioids for severe pain unresponsive to prior steps.

Topical agents such as lidocaine patches or capsaicin cream may be used for localized PHN [^115iUfkY].

---

## Management of complications

### Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)

PHN is defined as persistent pain ≥ 90 days after rash onset [^113HfjAs]. Management includes:

- **Gabapentin or pregabalin**: First-line agents for neuropathic pain [^117CTL7m].
- **Tricyclic antidepressants**: Amitriptyline or nortriptyline for persistent pain [^117CTL7m].
- **Topical agents**: Lidocaine patches or capsaicin cream for localized pain [^115iUfkY].
- **Opioids**: Short-term use for severe pain refractory to other therapies.

---

### Ophthalmic involvement (herpes zoster ophthalmicus)

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus requires **urgent ophthalmology referral** and aggressive antiviral therapy. Systemic acyclovir or valacyclovir is standard, with topical corticosteroids under ophthalmologist supervision for ocular inflammation [^1154u1ro] [^111rcRQt].

---

### Neurological complications

Encephalitis or myelitis requires **IV acyclovir** and neurology consultation [^1113FvE1]. Long-term neurological sequelae may necessitate ongoing rehabilitation and pain management.

---

## Prevention strategies

### Vaccination

Vaccination is the most effective strategy to prevent shingles and its complications. The **recombinant zoster vaccine (Shingrix)** is recommended for adults ≥ 50 years [^111upqMD] and immunocompromised patients ≥ 19 years, with > 90% efficacy in preventing shingles and PHN [^115sZVnF].

---

### Infection control

Patients with active shingles are contagious to individuals without immunity to varicella-zoster virus. Isolation precautions include:

- **Covering lesions**: Until fully crusted.
- **Avoiding contact**: With pregnant women, infants, and immunocompromised individuals.
- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing to prevent transmission [^112iSdWu].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education is essential regarding **contagion, potential complications, and the importance of adherence** to therapy and follow-up. Regular follow-up ensures adequate pain control, monitors for complications, and reinforces vaccination recommendations [^1156aSVP].

---

## Special considerations

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients require **aggressive antiviral therapy**, often IV acyclovir, and close monitoring for complications [^1113FvE1]. Vaccination strategies should be individualized based on immune status and clinical context [^111upqMD].

---

### Pregnant patients

Shingles in pregnancy is rare but may require antiviral therapy if severe or complicated. Acyclovir is considered safe, but careful **risk–benefit assessment** is essential [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Early antiviral therapy**: Within 72 hours of rash onset [^113HfjAs].
- **Pain management**: WHO analgesic ladder, gabapentin, pregabalin, TCAs, opioids for severe pain [^113NartA].
- **Vaccination**: Shingrix for adults ≥ 50 years and immunocompromised patients ≥ 19 years [^111upqMD].
- **Complication management**: Specialist referral, aggressive antiviral therapy, and supportive care [^112WVpEB].

---

Effective shingles management requires **early antiviral therapy, appropriate pain control, and prevention strategies**, including vaccination. Individualized care, patient education, and close follow-up are essential to minimize complications and improve patient outcomes.

Herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) — a reactivation of the latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) — can cause significant morbidity. Its major complication is pain, particularly post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We will review the current management strategies available for the treatment of both acute HZ and PHN, including antiviral drugs, analgesic agents, anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants and topical therapies. New molecules in development that show improved activity against VZV are also covered, and new drug targets are outlined. The role of translational neuroscience in moving towards a goal of finding disease-modifying treatments will be examined.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^115iUfkY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) is diagnosed clinically by recognition of the distinctive, painful vesicular rash appearing in a unilateral, dermatomal distribution. An estimated 1 million cases occur in the United States each year, and increasing age is the primary risk factor. Laboratory testing, including polymerase chain reaction, can confirm atypical cases. Treatment with acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir decreases the duration of the rash. Adjunct medications, including opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, or corticosteroids, may relieve the pain associated with acute herpes zoster. There is conflicting evidence that antiviral therapy during the acute phase prevents postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia in the cutaneous nerve distribution may last from 30 days to more than six months after the lesions have healed. Evidence supports treating postherpetic neuralgia with tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, long-acting opioids, or tramadol; moderate evidence supports the use of capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch as a second-line agent. Immunization to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia is recommended for most adults 60 years and older.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^111qqGq1]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug–drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^1167GdV3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as social, economic, and psychological well-being. Notably, it has an even larger economic burden on society as a whole when one considers the financial cost of managing it in the chronic setting. Estimates of its prevalence in the general population vary from as little as 1% to as much as 7–8%; however, when taking into account conditions such as diabetes (26%), herpes zoster/shingles (19%), and postsurgical pain (10%), the incidence is much higher. There are a number of national and international guidelines/recommendations for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain, yet there remains to be a consensus or agreement on the positioning of pharmacologic management (specifically opioids), neurostimulation, or targeted drug delivery. The purpose of this publication is to create a comprehensive algorithm for the treatment and management of chronic, noncancer neuropathic pain by merging the aforementioned guidelines/recommendations and integrating the currently available data from systemic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and published case reports/series (Figure 1).

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^113HfjAs]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster, or shingles, is caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. There are an estimated 1 million cases in the Unites States annually, with an individual lifetime risk of 30%. Patients with conditions that decrease cell-mediated immunity are 20 to 100 times more likely to develop herpes zoster. Patients may present with malaise, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations for two to three days before the classic maculopapular rash appears. The rash is usually unilateral, confined to a single dermatome, and typically progresses to clear vesicles that become cloudy and crust over in seven to 10 days. Herpes zoster can be treated with acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, ideally within 72 hours of the development of the rash. Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication, occurring in about one in five patients. It is defined as pain in a dermatomal distribution sustained for at least 90 days after acute herpes zoster. Treatment is focused on symptom control and includes topical lidocaine or capsaicin and oral gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants. The varicella zoster virus vaccine decreases the incidence of herpes zoster and is approved for adults 50 years and older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends this vaccine for adults 60 years and older, except for certain immunosuppressed patients.

### Herpes zoster [^114Ay4vH]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) or 'shingles' is a painful vesicular rash resulting from reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that also causes chickenpox. The incidence of HZ infection (HZI) increases with age and the degree of immunosuppresssion. Post herpetic neuralgia, the most common complication of HZ, occurs after the zoster rash has resolved. Conventional therapies include antivirals, corticosteroids and analgesics, both oral and topical. Here we report a case of HZ in an 80-year-old woman involving maxillary nerve and the article also reviews various treatment modalities available for the management of HZI.

### Treatment of Cushing's syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113BdUDe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Cushing's syndrome — optimal adjunctive management — We recommend providing education to patients and their family/caretaker(s) about their disease, treatment options, and what to expect after remission (Ungraded best practice statement). We recommend that all patients receive monitoring and adjunctive treatment for cortisol-dependent comorbidities (Ungraded best practice statement), and we recommend that a multidisciplinary team, including an experienced endocrinologist, takes patient values and preferences into consideration and provides education about the treatment options to the patient (Ungraded best practice statement). We suggest evaluating CS patients for risk factors of venous thrombosis (2|⊕⊕◯◯) and, in patients with CS undergoing surgery, we suggest perioperative prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (2|⊕⊕◯◯). We recommend that clinicians discuss and offer age-appropriate vaccinations to CS patients — particularly influenza, Herpes zoster, and pneumococcal vaccinations — due to an increased risk of infection (Ungraded best practice statement). Evidence notes that severe hypercortisolism impairs immunity and predisposes to severe, systemic infection and/or sepsis due to bacterial, fungal, and opportunistic pathogens; hypercortisolism alters coagulation-factor profiles for up to 1 year after a surgical cure and carries an increased risk of venous thrombosis, especially in the 4 weeks after surgery; clinicians should consider anticoagulation treatments, and immunization against influenza, shingles, and pneumonia is suggested.

### Clinical nudge impact on herpes zoster vaccine series completion in pharmacies [^1156aSVP]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A new recombinant herpes zoster vaccine has advanced efforts to prevent shingles, but its multidose regimen introduces potential barriers to full protection that must be managed by community pharmacies. To address this potential patient management challenge, a pharmacy records clinical support tool was implemented to assist pharmacy staff in managing herpes zoster vaccine dose completion.

Methods

Beginning in November 2018, a large community pharmacy chain (operating in 36 states) implemented a provider nudge within its clinical decision support tool across all locations that fit seamlessly into the existing workflow, alerting the pharmacy staff of the need for a patient's second dose. Initial and second doses were followed over 2 overlapping, 10-month periods before and after system launch. Differences in vaccine completion rates before and after the system was operational were assessed by chi-square tests and predictors of completion, controlling for store- and patient-level characteristics, and were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression and generalized linear models throughout 2021.

Results

Across 2,271 pharmacies, 71,459 and 41,982 initial doses of the herpes zoster vaccine were given in the baseline and intervention period, respectively. The proportion of patients completing both doses increased slightly after system implementation (before: 71.9%, after: 75.2%; p<0.0001). However, dramatic improvements in time to dose completion were observed (before: 109.8 days, after: 93.3 days; p<0.001), and changes were significant in stores in all but 4 states.

Conclusions

Results suggest that the use of a clinical nudge improved the occurrence of and time to herpes zoster vaccine dose completion in adults across the U.S.

### Herpes zoster presentation, management, and prevention: a modern case-based review [^116f7459]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common cutaneous entity with protean clinical presentations, management options, complication rates, and prevention strategies, all of which are rife with dogma. During an inpatient consultation for HZ, have you ever been approached by a frantic staff or family member, worried that a pregnant, elderly, or infant contact will be 'infected' if they get too close? Have your patients ever asked you about their risk of having HZ twice, or claimed that they have frequent 'recurrences'? In what timeline should antiviral therapy be employed? Is there evidence for prednisone or gabapentin in acute HZ treatment? Who should be vaccinated against HZ and what are the benefits and risks? In case-based form, these and other complex but common scenarios will be examined using clinical and viral mechanistic clues, along with updated treatment and prevention guidelines, to provide a modern HZ case management compendium, comprehensive of the diverse age and health populations now presenting with this condition.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^112iSdWu]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Shingles

Allow individuals with an active case of shingles to enter the family-centered residential facility only if they have written medical clearance documenting that these criteria are met: The blisters are localized on one side of the body and can be completely covered by a dressing and/or clothing The person has a normal immune system The person is not taking medications that can weaken their immune system The person is capable of frequent hand hygiene and understands the importance of caring for the blisters and the dressings to contain them.
If the person with shingles cannot meet all criteria above (see a-d), restrict them from the facility.
If the person with shingles meets criteria to allow entry, restrict the individual to a private room until the blisters have completely crusted.
Educate guests and visitors of the importance of frequent hand hygiene and appropriate disposal of potentially contaminated items (e.g. dressings, clothing, and linens).
People who are not immune to varicella can get chickenpox if directly exposed to shingles blisters. Interview individuals recently exposed to a person with shingles about the level of exposure to the blisters. If the person's exposure was significant (see Supplementary Material, Table), then require written medical clearance prior to entry to the facility (see Supplementary Material, Table). The documentation should include the reason the exposed individual is not contagious by meeting 1 of 4 of these criteria (see Supplementary Material, Table) The person has a past history of having had chickenpox or shingles (diagnosed by a licensed clinician) The person has documentation of 2 doses of varicella-containing vaccine, separated by at least 3 months The person has documented varicella antibodies (also known as a positive varicella IgG blood test) It has been at least 21 days since the person's last contact with the blisters (if the exposed person received post-exposure prophylaxis [intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)] or varicella zoster immune globulin, it must be 28 days since last exposure).
Request that individuals suspected of having shingles leave the facility immediately and refer them for medical evaluation.
If medical evaluation rules out chickenpox and diagnoses the person with shingles, then refer to the above recommendations for managing a person with an active case of shingles.

### Management and prevention of herpes zoster in the immunocompromised inflammatory bowel disease patient: a clinical quandary [^113pzzmK]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 main clinical phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are diseases that result from a dysregulated immune response to gut microbiota in genetically susceptible hosts. This aberrant immune response may intrinsically predispose IBD patients to infectious complications. Moreover, immunosuppressive medications used to treat IBD including corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, calcineurin inhibitors, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents and other biologics, further increase patients' susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles, is an opportunistic viral reactivation often observed in IBD patients with several case reports demonstrating complicated or disseminated disease in those on immunosuppression. While HZ vaccination is recommended in all immunocompetent adults aged ≥ 60 years, as a live virus vaccine, it is currently contraindicated in IBD patients on anti-TNF therapy and in other significantly immunocompromised patient groups. While caution is still warranted in these circumstances, recent clinical data has emerged which has prompted us to review and examine the universal approach to HZ vaccination in the immunosuppressed IBD population. In the following narrative review, we will discuss and provide an overview of the clinical manifestations, incidence, management and prevention of HZ in the IBD patient.

### Severe perianal shingles during azathioprine and budesonide treatment for Crohn's disease-preventable with zoster vaccine? [^115e7xaa]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those on immunosuppressive medications, suffer a high incidence of, and worse clinical outcomes relating to, herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation. We report on the presentation and management of a patient with Crohn's disease who developed severe perianal HZ after starting azathioprine and oral budesonide treatment. The zoster vaccine may prevent such zoster reactivation in patients with IBD. The zoster vaccine is effective in decreasing the risk of HZ in older adults but its role in younger adults and those with IBD has not been tested prospectively. A review of the potential risks and benefits of this live vaccine in patients with IBD and an approach to further determining its role in this patient population is discussed.

### Shedding light on shingles: the power of prevention [^115bdL4c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Shingles, or herpes zoster (HZ), is a common secondary infection caused by a reactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV). More than 95% of immunocompetent individuals aged at least 50 years are seropositive for VZV and are therefore at risk for developing HZ. Age-related increased incidence of HZ and its complications are thought to be related to the decline in cell-mediated immunity. Complications of HZ, which create a significant patient and economic burden, may be neurological, ophthalmological, dermatological, or visceral. HZ vaccination is essential for the prevention of HZ and its consequences. This CME activity reviews the clinical presentations and complications of HZ as well as discusses strategies for prevention (Online access: http://courses.elseviercme.com/shingles/626).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112WVpEB]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes zoster (shingles) — preferred therapy for acute localized dermatomal disease is valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg three times a day (AII) for 7–10 days, with consideration of longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve. For extensive cutaneous lesion or visceral involvement, preferred therapy is acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours until clinical improvement is evident (AII), with a switch to PO therapy (valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir) after clinical improvement to complete a 10- to 14-day course (BIII). In patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus who have stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis, topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation may be necessary, and the role of ART has not been established in these cases.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?
A. Reassurance and supportive garments
B. Surgical referral
C. Antiviral therapy
D. Oral corticosteroids
E. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation

Answers:

A. Reassurance and supportive garments – Correct. The prognosis for postherpetic pseudohernia is good with a mean recovery time of 4.9 months with conservative management. Management should include supportive garments and analgesia if required.
B. Surgical referral – Incorrect. A pseudohernia lacks a fascial defect and results from muscle weakness due to nerve dysfunction. Therefore it does not require surgical intervention. Enhanced recognition of this rare complication amongst dermatologists can prevent unnecessary investigations and surgical referral.
C. Antiviral therapy – Incorrect. Antiviral therapy for herpes zoster is most effective if started within 72 hours after the onset of acute cutaneous eruption. In our case, the patient had already been promptly treated with famciclovir by his family physician at the onset of the shingles rash. If a patient were to present acutely with cutaneous herpes zoster accompanied by pseudohernia, then there would be a role for antiviral therapy.
D. Oral corticosteroids – Incorrect. There is no evidence that oral corticosteroids improve outcomes or reduce symptom duration in postherpetic pseudohernia.
E. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation – Incorrect. While there are case reports of electrical stimulation used in herpes zoster radiculopathy, it is most helpful in managing sensory disturbance, as seen in postherpetic neuralgia rather than the motor weakness itself.

### Herpes zoster in neuro-ophthalmology: a practical approach [^117K6bYa]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Herpes Zoster (HZ) or shingles is the reactivation of the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), usually along a single sensory nerve, but can affect both sensory and motor cranial nerves. Major risk factors for HZ include immunosuppressed status and age older than 60 years. In the United States, the lifetime risk of HZ is approximately 30%. Worldwide, the median incidence of HZ is 4–4.5 per 1000 person-years across the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. HZ ophthalmicus, occurring in 10–20% of patients, is an ophthalmic emergency characterized by VZV reactivation along the V 1 branch of the trigeminal nerve. Approximately half of this patient subgroup will go on to develop ocular manifestations, requiring prompt diagnosis and management. While anterior segment complications are more common, neuro-ophthalmic manifestations are rarer and can also occur outside the context of overt HZ ophthalmicus. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations include optic neuropathy, acute retinal necrosis or progressive outer retinal necrosis, cranial neuropathy (isolated or multiple), orbitopathy, and CNS manifestations. Although typically a clinical diagnosis, diagnosis may be aided by neuroimaging and laboratory (e.g. PCR and serology) studies. Early antiviral therapy is indicated as soon as a presumptive diagnosis of VZV is made and the role of corticosteroids remains debated. Generally, there is wide variation of prognosis with neuro-ophthalmic involvement. Vaccine-mediated prevention is recommended. In this review, we summarize neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of VZV.

### Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of herpes zoster [^112mzZLs]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2010). Low credibility.

The primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection results in chickenpox (varicella), which is transmitted via the airborne route. VZV is highly infectious, but in the United States the incidence of varicella has been reduced by 76–87% as a result of the varicella vaccine. The virus establishes latency in the dorsal root ganglia during varicella and, when reactivated, travels along the sensory nerve axons to cause shingles (herpes zoster [HZ]). There are over 1 million cases of HZ in the United States each year, with an estimated lifetime attack rate of 30%. The incidence of HZ, which causes significant morbidity, increases with age and reaches approximately 10 cases per 1,000 patient-years by age 80. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is known to decline with age as part of immunosenescence, and decreased CMI is associated with reactivation of VZV. This article provides an overview of our emerging understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of varicella and HZ, in addition to exploring the current theories on latency and reactivation. Understanding the risk factors for developing HZ and the complications associated with infection, particularly in older people, is important for prompt diagnosis and management of HZ in primary care, and they are therefore also reviewed.

### Recommendations for the management of herpes zoster [^115nJNKb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of patients with herpes zoster (HZ) that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on quality of life, and costs of treatment. Systematic literature reviews, published randomized clinical trials, existing guidelines, and the authors' clinical and research experience relevant to the management of patients with HZ were reviewed at a consensus meeting. The results of controlled trials and the clinical experience of the authors support the use of acyclovir, brivudin (where available), famciclovir, and valacyclovir as first-line antiviral therapy for the treatment of patients with HZ. Specific recommendations for the use of these medications are provided. In addition, suggestions are made for treatments that, when used in combination with antiviral therapy, may further reduce pain and other complications of HZ.

Regarding medical management for herpes zoster, more specifically with respect to systemic antiviral therapy, EADV/EDF 2017 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antiviral therapy as early as possible, within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, or at a later time in the following patients:

- at risk of a complicated course or with manifest complications as long as new vesicles appear

- with signs of cutaneous, visceral or neurological dissemination

- with HZ ophthalmicus or oticus.

### Herpes zoster guideline of the German dermatology society (DDG) [^111SYEHF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella (chickenpox), remains dormant in dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia and can be reactivated as a consequence of declining VZV-specific cellular immunity leading to herpes zoster (shingles). Patients older than 50 years of age affected by herpes zoster may suffer a significant decrease of quality of life. These patients and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risks for severe complications, involving the eye, the peripheral and the central nervous system (prolonged pain, postherpetic neuralgia). Such complications occur with and without cutaneous symptoms. The German Dermatology Society (DDG) has released guidelines in order to guarantee updated management to anyone affected by herpes zoster. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The gold standard of laboratory diagnosis comprises PCR and direct identification of VZV in cell cultures. Detection of IgM- and IgA-anti VZV antibodies may be helpful in immunocompromised patients. Therapy has become very effective in the last years. Systemic antiviral therapy is able to shorten the healing process of acute herpes zoster, to prevent or to alleviate pain and other acute and chronic complications, particularly, when given within 48 h to a maximum of 72 h after onset of the rash. Systemic antiviral therapy is urgently indicated in patients beyond the age of 50 years and in patients at any age with herpes zoster in the head and neck area, especially in patients with zoster ophthalmicus. Further urgent indications are severe herpes zoster on the trunk and on the extremities, herpes zoster in immunosuppressed patients and in patients with severe atopic dermatitis and severe ekzema. Only relative indications for antiviral therapy exist in patients younger than 50 years with zoster on the trunk and on the extremities. In Germany acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir and brivudin are approved for the systemic antiviral treatment of herpes zoster. These compounds are all well tolerated by the patients and do not differ with regard to efficacy and safety. Brivudin has a markedly higher anti-VZV potency than oral acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir and thus offers a simpler dosing regimen. It must be given only once daily during 7 days in comparison to three and five times dosing per day of valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir, respectively. Brivudin is an antiviral agent with no nephrotoxic properties, which is an advantage when compared to acyclovir. The most important aim of therapy of herpes zoster is to achieve painlessness. Appropriately dosed analgesics in combination with a neuroactive agent (i.e. amitriptylin) are very helpful when given together with antiviral therapy. The additive therapy with corticosteroids may shorten the degree and duration of acute zoster pain, but has no essential effect on the development of postherpetic neuralgia, which is a very difficult condition to treat. Thus early presentation to a pain therapist is recommended in specific cases.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^117AgzK9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Low credibility.

These recommendations represent the first statement by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on the use of a live attenuated vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster (zoster) (i.e., shingles) and its sequelae, which was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 25, 2006. This report summarizes the epidemiology of zoster and its sequelae, describes the zoster vaccine, and provides recommendations for its use among adults aged ≥ 60 years in the United States. Zoster is a localized, generally painful cutaneous eruption that occurs most frequently among older adults and immunocompromised persons. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) decades after initial VZV infection is established. Approximately one in three persons will develop zoster during their lifetime, resulting in an estimated 1 million episodes in the United States annually. A common complication of zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a chronic, often debilitating pain condition that can last months or even years. The risk for PHN in patients with zoster is 10%-18%. Another complication of zoster is eye involvement, which occurs in 10%-25% of zoster episodes and can result in prolonged or permanent pain, facial scarring, and loss of vision. Approximately 3% of patients with zoster are hospitalized; many of these episodes involved persons with one or more immunocompromising conditions. Deaths attributable to zoster are uncommon among persons who are not immunocompromised. Prompt treatment with the oral antiviral agents acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir decreases the severity and duration of acute pain from zoster. Additional pain control can be achieved in certain patients by supplementing antiviral agents with corticosteroids and with analgesics. Established PHN can be managed in certain patients with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents. Licensed zoster vaccine is a lyophilized preparation of a live, attenuated strain of VZV, the same strain used in the varicella vaccines. However, its minimum potency is at least 14-times the potency of single-antigen varicella vaccine. In a large clinical trial, zoster vaccine was partially efficacious at preventing zoster. It also was partially efficacious at reducing the severity and duration of pain and at preventing PHN among those developing zoster. Zoster vaccine is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 60 years who have no contraindications, including persons who report a previous episode of zoster or who have chronic medical conditions. The vaccine should be offered at the patient's first clinical encounter with his or her health-care provider. It is administered as a single 0.65 mL dose subcutaneously in the deltoid region of the arm. A booster dose is not licensed for the vaccine. Zoster vaccination is not indicated to treat acute zoster, to prevent persons with acute zoster from developing PHN, or to treat ongoing PHN. Before administration of zoster vaccine, patients do not need to be asked about their history of varicella (chickenpox) or to have serologic testing conducted to determine varicella immunity.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis in adults with phototherapy and systemic therapies [^112icpLd]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) JAK inhibitors — dosing, approvals, safety, vaccination, and laboratory monitoring are summarized as follows: Lower doses (upadacitinib 15 mg daily, abrocitinib 100 mg daily) are described as somewhat less efficacious but still showing excellent improvement, and because of potential safety concerns, it is recommended by the FDA and other regulatory bodies that these medications be started at their lower doses, particularly in older adults. Baricitinib, which preferentially inhibits both JAK 1 and -2, is reported as effective for AD but is approved in Europe for moderate to severe AD and available in the US for other immune-mediated conditions, while not approved by the FDA to treat AD; network meta-analysis suggests it is less efficacious than upadacitinib and abrocitinib. The FDA applied warnings of increased risk of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death for the JAK inhibitor class; in a noninferiority rheumatoid arthritis trial of patients aged 50 years and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, 1455 patients were randomized and followed for a median of 4 years, with major adverse cardiovascular events and malignancies higher among those randomized to tofacitinib. Because of infectious risks including herpes zoster, it is recommended to vaccinate for shingles before initiating a JAK inhibitor, particularly for older patients; in the US and Canada, the recombinant zoster vaccine is approved for immunocompetent adults ages 50 years and older and adults ages 19 years and older who are immunocompromised or will be taking medications that increase the risk of herpes zoster, and use of JAK inhibitors is included in the latter category; patients should also receive any other needed live vaccines before initiating treatment. For laboratory monitoring, it is recommended by the FDA to check complete blood count with differential and liver enzymes at baseline and after initiation or dose-escalation (4 weeks for abrocitinib and per routine management after baseline for upadacitinib), with lipids checked only after initiation (4 weeks for abrocitinib, 12 weeks for upadacitinib) and testing for viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and pregnancy at baseline; the optimal frequency of ongoing lab monitoring for continuous JAK inhibitor use is unclear.

### Progress in vaccine-preventable and respiratory infectious diseases-first 10 years of the CDC national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, 2006–2015 [^1132sS8r]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

NCIRD implemented changes that modernized the nation's immunization infrastructure and strengthened the program's efficiency. Establishment of a centralized vaccine distribution system in 2008 eliminated 99% of the 430 vaccine depots that states previously relied on to store vaccines, resulting in direct shipping to > 40,000 provider sites, with reduced inventory costs and waste. NCIRD replaced a DOS-based vaccine ordering and management system with the vaccine tracking system VtrkS, an SAP-enabled data management and analytic system, thereby improving the accountability of the CDC multibillion-dollar vaccine supply chain. Improvements in immunization information systems (i.e. registries) have been slowed by diversity of registries in states; barriers to interstate data sharing; and incomplete records, particularly for adult vaccinations. Investments focused on increasing their interoperability with electronic medical records, expanding physician use, developing clinical decision support tools (e.g. prompts for which vaccine doses are due or overdue), and improving efficiency and accuracy of data entry.

Provisions of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 regarding prevention services required updated insurance plans to include all vaccines routinely recommended by the ACIP without copayments when administered by an in-network provider. The Vaccines for Children Program, implemented in 1994, provides free vaccines for children who are either uninsured or Medicaid eligible, among others. By requiring first dollar coverage for ACIP recommended vaccines, the Affordable Care Act provision eliminated most out-of-pocket costs for persons with either public or private insurance. A notable exception occurs for vaccines covered under Medicare part D (e.g. shingles), for which senior citizens might still have large out-of-pocket expenditures. NCIRD helped health departments establish billing systems so that insurance companies paid for vaccines given to their covered members, saving limited public sector resources.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2020 KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^111zcYbm]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Kidney transplant candidate vaccination — KDIGO/KDOQI guidance specifies timing for inactivated and live vaccines: We recommend that the vaccination series be commenced using an accelerated schedule, if necessary, prior to kidney transplantation for any inactivated vaccines (1B), and we suggest not excluding candidates who do not complete an inactivated vaccine series prior to kidney transplantation (2D). We recommend that the vaccination series be completed prior to kidney transplantation for any live attenuated vaccines (1B) and we recommend a 4-week delay in kidney transplantation if a live vaccine is administered (eg, MMR, VZV, shingles, yellow fever, oral typhoid, oral polio vaccine) (1B). The guideline recommends completing all necessary live attenuated vaccines prior to transplantation and waiting at least 4 weeks prior to moving forward with transplantation; while inactivated vaccines can be administered posttransplant, it is preferable to administer these pretransplant since responses to immunization are suboptimal posttransplant, and the guideline recommends using an accelerated vaccination schedule for inactivated vaccines if necessary. KDIGO recommends not to delay transplantation just to complete the vaccination series, but exceptions could be considered in situations where patients have no demonstrable antibodies against varicella zoster virus. The KDOQI work group agrees with waiting a minimum of 4 weeks after any live vaccine and notes that asplenic kidney transplant candidates should receive pretransplant pneumococcal, Haemophilus, and meningococcal vaccination, and that patients who may need complement inhibitors in the peri- or posttransplant period should get meningococcal vaccination to reduce the risk of meningitis.

### Recent topics in the management of herpes zoster [^114E36pC]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is a disease caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that has been latently infecting the body and is more common among the elderly. In Japan, the incidence of herpes zoster has been increasing steadily and is expected to increase further in the future. In 2016, the varicella vaccine was expanded to include prevention of herpes zoster, and a new subunit vaccine was also launched in 2020. In recent years, anti-herpesvirus drugs with novel pharmacological effects have also been introduced, and the environment surrounding the treatment of herpes zoster is entering a new era.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^1128nMR2]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Addition of a second drug (usually azathioprine) allows reduction of the steroid dose and might further improve survival. Mycophenolate is a promising alternative to azathioprine but cannot be used in pregnancy. Patients taking AIH treatment need regular blood tests. They might also need interventions to maintain bone health.

Around the time of starting treatment patients need to be up to date with their vaccinations against infections such as influenza, pneumococcus and chickenpox/shingles.

Improvement in symptoms and in liver blood tests usually indicate a good response to treatment. A follow-up liver biopsy to confirm that AIH has gone into remission is no longer recommended routinely but might sometimes be helpful in guiding management.

Options for patients who do not improve on treatment include, reconsidering the diagnosis, and assessing adherence to treatment. This should be done in a respectful, non-confrontational and non-stigmatising manner. Other options include changing the steroid, checking that the azathioprine dose is adequate (by checking its blood levels) and changing to another drug, such as mycophenolate, tacrolimus or rituximab. Experience with these treatments is very limited, so expert advice is often helpful here.

When normal blood test — so called 'complete biochemical response' — has been achieved (and confirmed 2–4 weeks later), we recommend that steroid dose should be reduced gradually to zero.

If remission is maintained over 2–3 years, the second drug (usually azathioprine) can sometimes be stopped (under medical guidance and with regular continued monitoring). There is a risk of disease relapse but (if promptly treated and if the patient does not have cirrhosis) relapses are usually without symptoms and are rarely dangerous. Relapses can be retreated with steroids and then, a longer-term treatment to prevent further relapse (usually azathioprine) can be considered. However, patients with AIH have a slightly increased risk of cancer, which might be related to these drugs damping down the immune system. Thus, in all patients without cirrhosis, we recommend at least one attempt to stop medication.

### A rapidly-growing, heme-crusted lesion [^114gKnqv]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is true regarding the first-line treatment for this case?
A. The treatment of choice is surgical removal.
B. One possible side effect of the first-line drug of choice is hyperpigmentation on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
C. No treatment is required. The lesion will heal in 3–6 weeks.
D. The first-line drug of choice requires activation by a viral enzyme.
E. The first-line drug of choice inhibits phospholipase A2 and can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Answers:

A. The treatment of choice is surgical removal – Incorrect. Surgical removal would be the standard of care to treat a basal cell carcinoma. However, because the underlying cause is a viral infection, treatment with antiviral medication is recommended.
B. One possible side effect of the first-line drug of choice is hyperpigmentation on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet – Incorrect. This answer refers to the use of emtricitabine, a drug commonly used to treat HIV. While emtricitabine may appropriately be used to treat this patient's HIV, the first-line treatment should be focused on treating the HSV infection before treating the HIV infection.
C. No treatment is required. The lesion will heal in 3–6 weeks – Incorrect. While there is no cure for HSV, antiviral therapy is recommended for HSV infections, especially in patients who are immunocompromised.
D. The first-line drug of choice requires activation by a viral enzyme – Correct. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir each require phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase in order to be activated and can each be used to treat HSV infections. Any one of these three drugs can be considered appropriate first-line treatment for this patient.
E. The first-line drug of choice inhibits phospholipase A2 and can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency – Incorrect. This answer is describing prednisone, a drug commonly used to increase quality of life for shingles infections. Prednisone may also be used to treat HSV encephalitis, but because there are no signs of HSV encephalitis, prednisone is not indicated in this case.

### Herpes zoster-induced urologic and gastrointestinal dysfunction with residual neurogenic detrusor underactivity [^113npfCb]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

VZV is managed with antiviral agents such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. VZV-associated urinary retention can be managed with urethral catheterization in the acute setting and intermittent self-catheterization in the outpatient setting. An α-adrenergic blocker specific to α-1a in the smooth muscle of the genitourinary tract, bladder neck, and various regions of the pelvic floor may be trialed to shorten the duration. Urodynamic investigations are recommended, if symptoms fail to improve within 6–8 weeks from onset. Since antiviral therapy has no ability to prevent long-term sequelae, two doses of the recombinant zoster vaccine are recommended to prevent disease and related complications in adults' ≥ 50 years of age, whether or not a previous episode is reported. There is no formal recommendation on the wait period, though the consensus is to wait for the acute episode and symptoms to resolve. Fortunately, shingles vaccination among adults ≥ 60 years of age has increased from 6.7% in 2008 to 34.5% in 2018. Our elderly patient had not received the shingles vaccine due to lack of regular medical care prior to this presentation. Although dermatologists have not played a central role in the recommendation and administration of vaccines historically, a more active role has been encouraged to improve patient education and access to herpes zoster vaccination.

In conclusion, this case highlights rare and notable herpes zoster-related urologic and gastrointestinal complications. Sacral dermatome involvement should raise suspicion for these potential complications with a thorough assessment of gastrointestinal/genitourinary systems and prompt treatment to prevent long-term sequelae.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^115mpCVx]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

All IBD patients should be screened at diagnosis for infection risk, as there is both an increased risk of infection as a result of the disease and a high likelihood of requiring immunosuppressive drug therapy (box 4). Patients without a clear history of chickenpox, shingles or receipt of two doses of varicella vaccine should be tested for varicella zoster virus (VZV) IgG. All patients with IBD should be screened for hepatitis B and C, and HIV. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C viral infection in IBD was similar to the general population in 315 patients from France (hepatitis B virus 2.54%, hepatitis C virus 0.95%). A Dutch study showed that rates of screening for hepatitis B remain suboptimal at 36–49%. Opportunistic testing for HIV should be done at the same time, as the condition is treatable and has public health implications. A panel of viral screening at diagnosis makes it more likely that patients can receive appropriate vaccinations with less delay to receiving immunomodulator therapy, which is now used in at least half of patients at some stage in their disease course. For the same reason, checking thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) status early reduces delays in starting thiopurines.

Box 4
Infection and pretreatment checklist at diagnosis and prior to immunomodulator or biological therapy

History of specific infections: HSV (oral, genital), VZV (chicken pox, shingles), tuberculosis.
Immunisation status: BCG, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type B, polio, meningococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, HPV, rotavirus, influenza, VZV/shingles.
Prior exposure to TB: household contacts, prolonged stay or origin from endemic area.
TB screening: patients considered for anti-TNF therapy should be screened for tuberculosis using a combination of clinical risk stratification, chest x-ray and interferon-gamma release assays.
TPMT: check in all patients considered for thiopurine therapy.
Serology: HBV, HCV, HIV and VZV (in patients without clear history of prior infection or prior vaccine).

### Post-herpetic neuralgia case study: optimizing pain control [^115fcDkr]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a chronic pain syndrome associated with the reactivation of a primary infection with varicella zoster virus (chicken pox), which leads to a chronic infection of the dorsal root ganglia. Under various clinical circumstances, including immunosuppressive diseases or treatments and certain cancers, reactivation of the infection can occur in adults as shingles. Other factors such as psychological distress and stressful life events also appear to play a role in the onset of shingles and the development of PHN. The most common risk factor for shingles and its potential sequela, PHN, is advanced age. For a significant number of patients, the pain following healing of shingles can persist for months to years; this pain is classified as PHN if it persists longer than 3 months. PHN often leads to depression, disrupted sleep, decreased functioning and increased healthcare utilization. Prompt use of antiviral therapy appears to reduce the period of pain following an episode of shingles by about half and may possibly reduce the overall incidence of PHN. Damage to a variety of neurologic pathways as a result of herpes zoster reactivation suggests that intervention with multiple agents having divergent mechanisms of action is an appropriate treatment approach. Current treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms of PHN include antidepressants, opioids, anticonvulsants and topical analgesics. It is important for the clinician to establish a baseline pain intensity and character as well as quality of life measures against which to judge the effectiveness of any treatment. This review article features a case study of a patient with PHN to illustrate current diagnostic and treatment approaches.

### Patient's experiences with the care for juvenile idiopathic arthritis across Europe [^11588Z3H]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

To assess the views of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients and their parents on the care and treatment they receive in referral pediatric rheumatology centers throughout Europe.

Methods

In a collaboration between physicians and patient associations, a questionnaire was developed, covering various domains of JIA care, including demographics, diagnosis, referrals to various health care professionals, access to pain and fatigue management and support groups, information they received about the disease and awareness of and participation in research. The questionnaire was translated and distributed by parent associations and pediatric rheumatologists in 25 countries, 22 of which were European. After completion the replies were entered on the PRINTO website. Replies could either be entered directly by parents on the website or on paper. In these cases, the replies were scanned and emailed by local hospital staff to Utrecht where they were entered by I.R. in the database.

Results

The survey was completed by 622 parents in 23 countries. The majority (66.7%) of patients were female, with median age 10–11 years at the completion of the questionnaire. Frequencies of self-reported JIA categories corresponded to literature. Some patients had never been referred to the ophthalmologist (22.8%) or physiotherapist (31.7%). Low rates of referral or access to fatigue (3.5%) or pain management teams (10.0%), age appropriate disease education (11.3%), special rehabilitation (13.7%) and support groups (20.1%) were observed. Many patients indicated they did not have contact details for urgent advice (35.9%) and did not receive information about immunizations (43.2%), research (55.6%) existence of transition of care clinics (89,2%) or financial support (89.7%). While on immunosuppressive drugs, about one half of patients did not receive information about immunizations, travelling, possible infections or how to deal with chickenpox or shingles.

Conclusions

Low rates of referral to health care professionals may be due to children whose illness is well managed and who do not need additional support or information. Improvements are needed, especially in the areas of supportive care and information patients receive. It is also important to improve doctor patient communication between visits. Physicians can be instrumental in the setting up of support groups and increasing patients' awareness of existing support. Suggestions are given to convey crucial pieces of information structurally and repeatedly to ensure, among other things, compliance.

### Regarding "Enhancing predictive accuracy for acute herpetic neuralgia treatment: a fresh perspective on pulsed radiofrequency therapy research" [response to letter] [^115RzqjN]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

In response to a recently published article, I am representing all authors to address the constructive comments and suggestions provided by Hong et al.

Firstly, we acknowledge the variations in pain intensity and characteristics associated with shingles in different anatomical locations. Thus, it is more appropriate to categorize herpes zoster based on different sites. However, we have considered the significant differences in Current Perception Threshold (CPT) across sites, noting the prevalence of herpes zoster on the thoracic dorsal trunk. To mitigate heterogeneity, our initial exploration included only patients with thoracic dorsal herpes, as detailed in the methods section. Subsequently, we have factored in the site and nature of pain in our larger-scale studies, aligning with the recommendation by Hong et al.

Secondly, we recognize the validity of Hong et al's concerns regarding variable covariance. We also accounted for this when screening the variables. We applied stepwise regression to minimize the effect of multiple covariances between variables, as described in the Results section. Of course, the suggestion by Hong et al to employ the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for assessing covariance between variables significantly contributed to our results. Therefore, we supplemented the VIF of multivariate logistic regression variables and the results show that no covariance problems were found among them (VIF < 5). (Table 1)

Table 1
Variance Inflation Factor of Multivariate Logistic Regression Variables

Furthermore, we fully support Hong et al's perspective on the collaborative multidisciplinary approach to managing patients with herpes zoster. Managing herpetic neuralgia poses a complex challenge that has long perplexed healthcare professionals. Particularly, managing patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) presents unique difficulties. Therefore, the collaboration of pain physicians, dermatologists, neurologists, and psychologists is crucial to enhancing patient outcomes by leveraging their respective expertise. The proposal to establish a multidisciplinary management team is not only reasonable but also urgently required.

In conclusion, we express our gratitude to our readers for recognizing our research findings and offering valuable suggestions. We appreciate the opportunity to address and refine our study to ensure the accuracy of our results. By contributing to clinical decision-making for patients with herpes zoster neuralgia, we aim to facilitate more precise and personalized treatment approaches.

### Management of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^1159fuFc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with herpes zoster experience severe pain and potential lasting complications such as postherpetic neuralgia, ophthalmic disease/damage, and, rarely, skin complications (eg, infection of rash area). Treatment for acute zoster aims to accelerate healing, control pain, and, when possible, reduce the risk of complications. Early intervention with antivirals can accelerate rash healing, reduce rash severity, and reduce the risk of some complications. The addition of corticosteroids to antiviral medication may further alleviate short-term zoster pain, but is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse effects, especially among older adults. If a patient does develop postherpetic neuralgia, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine patch 5%, and capsaicin may all be considered as palliative treatments. For individuals with treatment-refractory postherpetic neuralgia, nonpharmacologic approaches may be considered and a pain-management specialist should be consulted. There is a need for more effective agents to treat herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia.

### Talquetamab in multiple myeloma [^114uVW6A]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Managing toxicities

First, and foremost, talquetamab should be initiated with close monitoring in a setting with direct access to tocilizumab, critical care facilities, and capacity of neurologic evaluation and treatment.

Adverse events related to the nails can be managed with ammonium lactate cream, Vaseline, and various topical steroid ointments. Skin changes like xerosis and pruritis can be managed similarly with topical steroids and oral antihistamines for itchiness. Grade 3 rashes in the original study resolved after oral or topical corticosteroid use and talquetamab was able to be restarted in most patients with this issue.

Taste and other oral adverse events can lead to significant malnourishment and weight loss and need extra vigilance. Artificial saliva, biotin sprays and anesthetic mouthwashes can improve dry mouth, mucositis, oral cavity pain. Close monitoring for candidiasis and early treatment is necessary. It can be helpful to encourage softer diets and nutritional supplements in the form of shakes.

Infections remain a significant challenge in the field of MM immunotherapies. At our institution, acyclovir/valacyclovir and Bactrim for prophylaxis is regularly employed. Patients are encouraged to get shingles, COVID, and influenza vaccination and any other vaccines that are indicated. We regularly check immunoglobulin levels and our institution recommends intravenous immunoglobulin repletion for recurrent infections or levels below 400 mg/dL.

Despite its limitations, this approach co2uld be applied not only to other vaccines like respiratory syncytial virus but also to nonrespiratory vaccines like the shingle vaccine. Furthermore, the insights from this research may be applied to long-term therapies such as incliciran, a small interfering ribonucleic acid therapy for lipid management, which likely face adherence challenges similar to those encountered with vaccines. The differing motivations between infectious and noninfectious diseases will continue to provide valuable insights. In conclusion, the authors meticulously analyzed and discussed their findings, contributing significant data from a behavioral economics perspective. Education on behavioral economics and decision-making should be integrated into the training of all clinicians. These outstanding studies and their results are likely to be critically examined in the future.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^113MLmok]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a human alpha herpes virus, which causes varicella (chicken pox) and herpes zoster (HZ). Approximately one out of three people in the United States aged 60 years or older will develop shingles. 1

Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of latent VZV and its spread from the ganglion to the corresponding cutaneous dermatome. 2, 3 The characteristic vesicular rash (shingles) of HZ pustulates and crusts within 7‐10 days but may take up to a month to heal; however, pain is an important feature of the disease that is often the most debilitating for patients.

Zoster‐associated pain is experienced by approximately 90% of patients. The chronic neuropathic pain phase of the disease, known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), is defined as pain that persists 90 days or more after rash onset. 4, 5

Postherpetic neuralgia causes the largest HZ‐related burden of illness. 6, 7, 8, 9 Risk factors for PHN include greater acute pain severity, presence of a prodrome, greater rash severity, and older patient age at onset. 10 Current interventions for PHN, such as lidocaine patches, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and anti‐epileptics, are palliative and fail to treat the underlying disease. A substantial proportion of patients fail to obtain satisfactory pain relief using the available medications. 8 This pain burden is associated with negative effects on their quality of life such as impaired physical functioning, higher levels of emotional stress, and decreases in social functioning. 11

Although the widespread use of the herpes zoster vaccine has reduced the incidence of HZ and PHN, 12 a large percentage (∼90% in the US) of the at‐risk population does not receive the vaccine. 13 About half of people, 60 years of age or older who have had the shingles vaccine, fail to respond (eg, primary failure meaning they failed to seroconvert after vaccination) and may go on to develop HZ. 12, 14 In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine has been shown to decline over time (eg, secondary vaccine failure). 15, 16

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114c36hM]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) disease — primary varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster therapy indicates that for uncomplicated primary varicella, initiate as soon as possible after symptom onset and continue for 5–7 days with valacyclovir 1 g PO three times a day (AII) or famciclovir 500 mg PO three times a day (AII); for severe or complicated cases, use acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7–10 days (AIII), with the option to switch to oral valacyclovir, famciclovir, or acyclovir after defervescence if no evidence of visceral involvement (BIII). Alternative therapy for uncomplicated chickenpox is acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII) for 5–7 days. For herpes zoster (shingles) acute localized dermatomal disease, treat for 7–10 days and consider longer duration if lesions are slow to resolve, with acyclovir 800 mg PO five times a day (BII). In managing ocular disease, consultation with an ophthalmologist experienced in VZV retinitis is strongly recommended; duration of therapy for VZV retinitis is not well defined and should be determined based on clinical, virologic, and immunologic responses and ophthalmologic responses; optimization of ART is recommended for severe and difficult-to-treat VZV infections (e.g., retinitis, encephalitis) (AIII).

5.2.1.3.2 Live vaccines

Following live vaccination, the UK Department of Health currently recommends allowing 4 weeks for the immune response to be established prior to commencing immunosuppressive or biologics therapy. Live vaccination should be avoided during biologics therapy and for a minimum of 3 months after stopping. The evidence base for the 3-month period is poor, and while drug blood levels will be minimal by this time, it is unclear whether alterations to white cell populations may have more persistent subtle effects on immunity. The USA Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states in their IDSA guidelines that zoster live vaccination can be considered for patients aged 60 or over while on treatment with low-level immunosuppression (defined as prednisolone doses < 20 mg, methotrexate weekly dose ≤ 0.4 mg/kg, azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine ≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day). In the UK the age recommendation for zoster vaccine is at age 70 or up to the age of 79 if not given at age 70, and the Green Book also advises that shingles vaccination may be administered to those on low-level immunosuppression (defined as ≤ 20 mg prednisolone/day for > 14 days, either alone or in combination with low-dose non-biological oral immunomodulators (methotrexate ≤ 25 mg/week, azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day or mercaptopurine ≤ 1.5 mg/kg/day)).

The UK Department of Health Green Book vaccination guide Chapter 6also suggests that all live vaccines can be considered for those on low-dose immunosuppression as defined above, including low-dose immunosuppressive drugs in combination with prednisolone up to 20 mg. There is evidence from a small controlled study that the use of zoster vaccine in IBD patients on low-level immunosuppression does not result in adverse effects, although antibody titres were somewhat lower than those in vaccinated IBD patients not taking immunosuppressive drugs. Live vaccination must not be given to those taking biologics, and should only be undertaken for those on low-level immunosuppression after careful consideration of the risks and benefits in conjunction with the patient.

The Green Book advises that live vaccination should be delayed until 6 months of age in children exposed in utero to biologics.

A 49-year-old consultant medical oncologist, with a medical history of complete T5 spinal cord injury (March 1992) and long-term paralysis from the chest down, presented with shingles affecting the T7 dermatome. He also had a dull frontal headache, a feeling of agitation and increased blood pressure of 135/90 on a home blood pressure machine (higher than his usual blood pressure of 90/70). Having been taught about autonomic dysreflexia at the time of his initial spinal cord injury, he self-diagnosed autonomic dysreflexia caused by the noxious stimulus of shingles below his level of spinal cord injury. He self-administered a nifedipine 5 mg sublingual capsule to decrease his blood pressure before urgently seeing his general practitioner. Treatment of the shingles with acyclovir and analgesia successfully managed the problem and avoided hospital admission. This case highlights key aspects in treating autonomic dysreflexia and the value of doctor-patient partnership in doing so.

### Degradable polymeric vehicles for postoperative pain management [^114AbCe2]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Transdermal controlled release methods

Transdermal delivery systems eliminate the invasive nature altogether and provide a route that sidesteps gastrointestinal drug degradation. Transdermal delivery systems have been implemented with lidocaine in the form of pain-alleviating patches for post herpetic neuralgiaand capsaicin for treatment of post-shingles nerve pain. These systems are intended to relieve soreness or pain at a specific area for up to 3 h and 3 months, respectively. In a similar product, Duragesic® (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Beerse, Belgium) is a fentanyl-containing reservoir transdermal delivery system that delivers the potent analgesic for 72 h. Fentanyl dosing is controlled by surface area of the patch that is applied. However, this device is only recommended to patients who have moderate to chronic pain that cannot be treated by other medications and who require continuous analgesia so as not to introduce the serious adverse effects associated with opioids. Although a promising administration method, most transdermal methods are limited by issues of drug solubility and the ability of the API to bypass the skin barrier. To bypass these pitfalls, the effectiveness of external stimuli (e.g. iontophoresis, ultra sound, or microneedles) to increase efficacy drug release, has been explored. Additionally, a lag time has been associated with transdermal mechanisms, which introduces inefficacious delivery of drug to the patient initially as well as the potential for adverse effects to persist after patch removal. Although transdermal delivery systems do deliver the drug to a localized area, this method has disadvantages, such as those associated with Lidoderm® (Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Malvern, PA)and Duragesic®, that make it a non-optimal route for postoperative pain management.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) — immune reconstitution effects: Initiation of ART appears to be associated with an increased frequency of VZV reactivation, peaking at about 3 months after ART initiation, with observational studies showing the risk of herpes zoster to increase two- to four-fold between 4 and 16 weeks after initiating ART. The clinical presentation and natural history of herpes zoster in the setting of immune reconstitution is similar to that observed in other patients with HIV, and episodes in either setting should be managed in the same manner.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^111FXY4F]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior HSV infection is a predisposing factor for HSV conjunctivitis, and reactivation may be triggered by stress, trauma, ultraviolet light exposure, or other viral illnesses.HSV conjunctivitis is usually unilateral and characterized by bulbar conjunctival injection, thin and watery discharge, and mild follicular reaction of conjunctiva. Distinctive signs are vesicular eyelid lesions and pleomorphic or dendritic epithelial keratitis on the cornea or conjunctiva. As these signs on the cornea or conjunctiva are often present in the absence of eyelid or dermal lesions, they are best seen by instillation of vital dyes such as sodium fluorescein, lissamine green, or rose Bengal to assess the ocular surface. HSV conjunctivitis usually subsides within 4–7 days unless complications occur. Topical and/or oral antivirals are recommended to shorten the duration of illness. Because topical corticosteroids can potentiate HSV, they should be avoided, particularly in the presence of corneal or conjunctival epithelial disease.HSV can also cause EKC, which is difficult to distinguish clinically from adenoviral conjunctivitis.

Active chicken pox and prior exposure to chicken pox or shingles are predisposing factors for VZV conjunctivitis. This condition is commonly unilateral in presentation. Distinctive signs of VZV conjunctivitis include inflammation of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, or uvea. Uveitis may present with increased intraocular pressure, which in some cases may rise to dangerous levels.VZV conjunctivitis usually abates in a few days. A combination of oral antivirals and topical corticosteroids can be used with caution to manage VZV conjunctivitis, as topical antivirals alone are not effective in treating VZV conjunctivitis.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^114AYamc]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a neuropathic pain syndrome resulting from damage to nerve fibers, is the most common complication of herpes zoster (HZ; shingles), and the cause of the greatest HZ-related burden of illness.–HZ is a viral disease caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) that had remained latent in sensory ganglia since the primary infection (chicken pox), and is characterized by a painful skin rash, usually limited to the area innervated by a single sensory ganglion (Figure 1).PHN is usually diagnosed in individuals who have recovered from the HZ skin rash but who have continued to experience pain for at least 3 months, although for some patients pain can persist for years.

PHN pain occurs in the same dermatomes as the HZ rash, and is likely the result of damage to the nervous system (which may include deafferentation, peripheral and/or central sensitization, myelin destruction, inflammation, and signaling errors in the brain) that occurred during the proliferation and spread of the virus during the acute HZ infection. The syndrome has consequences permeating multiple aspects of patients' lives, affecting their sleep, concentration, and mood, as well as impacting their physical functionality by interfering with activities of daily living.

As many as 20% of patients with HZ develop PHN. Major risk factors include advanced age and decreased immunity.–Approximately half of all PHN cases occur in persons older than 60 years. Therefore, the incidence of HZ and risk of PHN is likely to increase as the population ages. The declining cell-mediated VZV immunity from immune senescence also contributes to the observed increased prevalence of PHN in the elderly. Finally, the severity of the acute HZ infection and the presence of a notable prodrome have also been associated with increased likelihood of experiencing PHN.–

### Current management of herpes zoster: the European view [^116JN9sk]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The overall incidence of herpes zoster in Europe is approximately 3 per 1000 people per year and more than 10 per 1000 people per year in those aged > 80 years. Post herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common debilitating complication of herpes zoster, particularly in patients aged > 50 years, in persons with severe pain or rash at presentation, and in those with significant prodromal symptoms. Antiviral drugs can effectively control acute symptoms and, if used early enough in the course of the illness, can help prevent the development of PHN and other complications. However, despite this, many patients do not receive such treatment. The economic impact of zoster and PHN is largely underestimated in Europe. Furthermore, there is considerable variation throughout Europe in the management of herpes zoster. Use of antiviral therapy including the newer potent antiviral agents such as brivudin, which requires less frequent administration than acyclovir, is improving patient outcomes in some European countries. However, in many countries, patient awareness of herpes zoster and, as a result, overall antiviral use is low. Guidelines recommending the use of antiviral agents, particularly in patients at risk of developing PHN, are available but are not widely used. More needs to be done to educate the general public and increase awareness among primary healthcare providers of the benefits of timely and appropriate pharmacological therapy in patients with herpes zoster.

The most familiar etiology of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is that of menstruation and tampon use. Nonmenstrual TSS has been described in all types of wounds including postsurgical, respiratory infection, mucous membrane disruption, burns, and vesicular lesions caused by varicella and shingles. A case of TSS occurring in a diabetic male patient with foot blisters is presented. Early recognition by an infectious disease specialist and appropriate medical management led to complete recovery. There have been no reported cases of Staphylococcus aureus TSS originating in the foot to date.

Varicella‑zoster virus (VZV) in immunosuppressed patients — serostatus and risk of zoster or dissemination: VZV is one of the 2 most frequent herpesviruses to cause cutaneous infection in immunosuppressed patients, and between 65% and 70% of adult patients are seropositive for VZV. Herpes zoster occurs most frequently during the first year following chemotherapy treatment or following receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) or a solid organ transplant (SOT). Depending on the intensity of treatment or type of transplant, 25%–45% develop dermatomal zoster, with a 10%–20% risk of developing dissemination without prompt and effective antiviral therapy.

### Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management [^112TtTFx]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Eight of the more than 80 known herpesviruses are human pathogens. Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a contagious infection with a large reservoir in the general population. It has a potential for significant complications in the immunocompromised host. In addition, psychological distress caused by the negative stigma associated with genital herpes and visible facial lesions in those experiencing frequent outbreaks renders it a challenging clinical dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic features of HSV infections, providing the clinician with an up-to-date understanding of the available management strategies for mucocutaneous HSV-induced disease.

### Herpes zoster and vaccination strategies in inflammatory bowel diseases: a practical guide [^113atnzW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster is a painful dermatomal cutaneous eruption resulting from reactivation of the latent varicella-zoster virus. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have an increased risk of shingles compared with the general population and this risk can be increased with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. Live zoster vaccine and recombinant zoster vaccine have shown efficacy for the prevention of herpes zoster. The recombinant zoster vaccine seems to offer greater efficacy and long-term protection profile compared with the life zoster vaccine. However, their use in clinical practice still is unclear and updated vaccination recommendations are lacking. This review discusses the risk for shingles in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, available vaccines, and their efficacy and safety profiles. We also provide guidance on who, when, and how to vaccinate for herpes zoster in routine clinical practice among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

### Herpes zoster in pregnancy: clinical outcomes and treatment patterns from a multicenter retrospective cohort [^113rMckJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes zoster is a worldwide health concern, with an incidence rate of 3 to 5 cases per 1000 person-years in the United States. Over the past several decades, the incidence has been rising, although the underlying causes of this increase remain unidentified. The etiological agent responsible for herpes zoster is the varicella-zoster virus (VZV).VZV, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily, is classified under the Herpesviridae family and is formally designated as Human Herpesvirus Type 3 (HHV-3).VZV has only one serotype in nature, and humans are its sole reservoir. The virus can manifest as two distinct clinical conditions: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles). Primary infection with VZV results in varicella, after which the virus becomes latent in the cerebral and dorsal root ganglia. Upon a decline in cell-mediated immunity, VZV can reactivate within T lymphocytes residing in the ganglia, resulting in extensive viral replication and the manifestation of herpes zoster. Two to three days prior to the onset of the rash, patients typically exhibit prodromal symptoms, including fatigue, headache, low-grade fever, and abnormal skin sensations such as itching, burning, and prickling. During the active phase, herpes zoster manifests at the affected dermatome with the appearance of a rash accompanied by pain. This condition frequently results in a deterioration of the patient's quality of life. Approximately 20% of patients continue to experience pain during the chronic phase after the rash has resolved, a condition known as postherpetic neuralgia. In contrast to primary infection, herpes zoster can cause prolonged discomfort and chronic pain.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^111TCiCg]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Antiviral prophylaxis with tenofovir or entecavir is effective in preventing IST-related HBV relapse in patients at risk. Thus, in the few HBV sAg positive patients who have AIH, routine prophylaxis during IST is recommended. In the larger number with prior but resolved HBV (sAg and DNA negative, cAb positive), mostfavour HBV DNA monitoring at 1–3 monthly intervals while patients remain on > 10 mg prednisolone per day, with antiviral therapy if HBV DNA levels rise. Routine antiviral prophylaxis might be needed in patients receiving high-dose steroids (> 40 mg/day), receiving B cell-depleting therapies and those for whom regular HBV DNA monitoring is unfeasible. A similar strategy seems reasonable for budesonide therapy.

Severe varicella infection might occur in previously unexposed patients receiving steroidsThe prevalence of varicella antibodies (indicating prior infection) is over 80% even in those not reporting prior varicella infection. However, patients starting treatment for AIH should be advised to avoid people with chicken pox or with shingles on exposed regions. Those reporting recent exposure should (even if also reporting prior exposure) be tested for varicella antibodies, and if absent (or if results are unavailable within 7 days), should have oral antiviral prophylaxis from days 7 to 14 post exposure. For further details, see references.

Patients starting steroids should also (if not immunised) be offered the COVID-19, influenzavirus and pneumococcalvaccines. Also, if under 25 or if gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men (GBMSM) and under 45, human papilomavaccines and if over 50, the shingles (herpes zoster) recombinant vaccines.

Children with acute liver disease should have viral aetiologies excluded and children with AIH should receive their normal vaccinations, including HBV and HAV.

Once receiving steroid and/or thiopurine therapy, live vaccines are not recommended and so, whenever possible, (in both adults and children) routine immunisations should be up to date before starting IST.

### Progress in meeting today's demands in genital herpes: an overview of current management [^115yW1b7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of genital herpes requires accurate diagnosis, patient support, and effective treatment. Diagnosis is usually straightforward for classic presentations characterized by vesicular lesions but can be challenging for atypical presentations, which are more common. Diagnosis of asymptomatic infection requires access to molecular technology or type-specific serologic assays. Misconceptions about herpes simplex infection are common and patient education is essential. Patient concerns extend beyond disease frequency and severity-the psychological impact should not be underestimated. Antiviral therapy is relevant at all stages of infection. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are effective and well tolerated for genital herpes treatment. Continuous suppressive therapy controls all symptoms of recurrent disease and helps to relieve disease complications. The prodrugs valacyclovir and famciclovir offer easier, less-frequent dosing than required for acyclovir. Valacyclovir achieves effective suppression when taken once a day. Interventions to prevent genital herpes transmission and to control the global problem are urgently required.

### Exacerbation of human papillomavirus infection with initiation of upadacitinib for atopic dermatitis [^115kQc4J]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sustainable and effective treatment for moderate-to-severe AD has historically been recognized as challenging due to the limited treatment options available. The treatment of AD is further complicated by patients' increased propensity for systemic comorbidities, including bacterial and viral skin infections. Since 2017, the Food and Drug Administration has approved promising new treatments, including biologic agents, such as dupilumab and tralokinumab, and targeted therapies, such as upadacitinib and abrocitinib. Biologics, which target the Th2 cytokine pathway in AD by blocking specific IL signaling, are recognized for particularly mild side effect profiles and improved effectiveness compared with classical systemic treatments. More recently, approved targeted JAK-1 selective inhibitors are powerful agents that inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway to decrease the production of proinflammatory cytokines that contribute to the AD pathogenesis.JAK-1 inhibitors, when compared with biologics, have been shown to have greater effectiveness but a broader immunosuppressive profile. Literature has suggested that JAK-1 inhibitors contribute to impairments in interferon-mediated antiviral responses, which can increase susceptibility to viral infections. In phase III trials, upadacitinib was more commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections compared with dupilumab and a small percentage of patients developed eczema herpeticum or herpes zoster.

Our patient received shingles vaccines prior to starting upadacitinib, given his history of remote shingles infections, and, fortunately, has not developed shingles. However, he experienced an exacerbation of his HPV infection involving flat warts on his face. The clinical examination and patient's self report suggested that the distribution of warts was limited to his face and he endeavored to limit the spread by avoiding shaving. To our knowledge, HPV outbreaks have not been previously cited as a side effect associated with JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib, abrocitinib, or tofacitinib, nor have they been systematically studied. Although the warts were relatively resistant to several treatments, including sinecatechins 10% ointment, 0.025% tretinoin in an emollient cream base, and imiquimod 5% cream, they responded quickly and completely to tazarotene 0.045%. A greater understanding of the pathogenesis of the upadacitinib-induced HPV exacerbation may help inform more effective and prompt management of the resultant flat warts.

### Famciclovir [^113hudYL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)

Two randomized, double-blind trials, 1 placebo-controlled and 1 active-controlled, were conducted in 964 immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated herpes zoster. Treatment was initiated within 72 hours of first lesion appearance and was continued for 7 days.

In the placebo-controlled trial, 419 patients were treated with either famciclovir 500 mg three times daily (n = 138), famciclovir 750 mg three times daily (n = 135) or placebo (n = 146). The median time to full crusting was 5 days among famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients as compared to 7 days in placebo-treated patients. The times to full crusting, loss of vesicles, loss of ulcers, and loss of crusts were shorter for famciclovir 500 mg-treated patients than for placebo-treated patients in the overall study population. The effects of famciclovir were greater when therapy was initiated within 48 hours of rash onset; it was also more profound in patients 50 years of age or older. Among the 65.2% of patients with at least 1 positive viral culture, famciclovir treated patients had a shorter median duration of viral shedding than placebo-treated patients (1 day and 2 days, respectively).

There were no overall differences in the duration of pain before rash healing between famciclovir-and placebo-treated groups. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of pain after rash healing (postherpetic neuralgia) between the treatment groups. In the 186 patients (44.4% of total study population) who developed postherpetic neuralgia, the median duration of postherpetic neuralgia was shorter in patients treated with famciclovir 500 mg than in those treated with placebo (63 days and 119 days, respectively). No additional efficacy was demonstrated with higher dose of famciclovir.

In the active-controlled trial, 545 patients were treated with 1 of 3 doses of famciclovir three times daily or with acyclovir 800 mg five times daily. Times to full lesion crusting and times to loss of acute pain were comparable for all groups and there were no statistically significant differences in the time to loss of postherpetic neuralgia between famciclovir and acyclovir-treated groups.

### Shingrix: the new adjuvanted recombinant herpes zoster vaccine [^115sZVnF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine (HZ/su) for use in adult patients for the prevention of shingles.

Data Sources

A literature search through PubMed was conducted (June 2008 to October 2017) using the terms shingles vaccine and varicella zoster virus. References from retrieved articles and the prescribing information were also reviewed for any additional material.

Study Selection/Data Extraction

The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Randomized controlled, multicenter trials were reviewed and included to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HZ/su. Literature on the epidemiology and pathology of herpes zoster virus infections and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

HZ/su is a new adjuvanted recombinant vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of herpes zoster in adults 50 years of age and older. HZ/su significantly reduced the risk of developing herpes zoster by more than 90% as compared with placebo and displayed a comparable adverse effect profile. The most common local adverse events were injection site pain, redness, and swelling, and the most common systemic adverse events were myalgia, fatigue, and headache. The ACIP recommends the routine use of HZ/su as the preferred vaccine for the prevention of herpes zoster in immunocompetent adults 50 years of age and older.

Conclusions

Based on published immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety data, as well as the recent recommendations by the ACIP, HZ/su should be included on both hospital and community pharmacy formularies and recommended to all immunocompetent patients older than 50 years to prevent herpes zoster.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^113qEk27]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Practical considerations for management of PHN

For primary care providers, PHN may not present as a distinct entity but rather an extension of the original HZ infection, and monitoring for a global condition affecting multiple aspects of patients' lives rather than for a localized post-HZ pain is paramount. Thus, practical management of PHN can be divided into prevention and treatment of HZ, and the more challenging task of managing the neuropathic pain syndrome and its consequences once PHN has developed (Figure 2).

To date, no cure for PHN exists, only treatments that are palliative and that may shorten the duration and severity of the pain. Therefore, vaccinations to prevent initial chicken pox and thus VZV from ever gaining a foothold in the body in the first place, or vaccinations to prevent reactivation of VZV already present in the body remain a priority; however, there are uncertainties about the vaccines' duration of protection and/or how frequently booster can be given.–For patients who were exposed to VZV and who contracted acute HZ, the primary care provider may use antivirals, analgesics, or corticosteroids to decrease acute pain and possibly decrease the risk of developing PHN.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114vCn8P]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunocompromised hosts — Herpes zoster dermatomal pain often precedes the eruption by 24–72 hours; in otherwise healthy hosts, lesions continue to erupt for at least 4–6 days with the entire disease duration being approximately 2 weeks, whereas in immunocompromised hosts lesions may continue to develop over a longer period (7–14 days) and heal more slowly. High-dose IV acyclovir remains the treatment of choice for VZV infections in compromised hosts, and oral acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are beneficial but oral therapy should be reserved for mild cases with transient immune suppression or to complete therapy after a clinical response to IV acyclovir. Recipients of allogeneic blood and bone marrow transplants routinely take acyclovir (800 mg bid) or valacyclovir (500 mg bid) during the first year following transplant for prevention of VZV and HSV reactivation. For HSV, suppression of reactivation or continued treatment until ulcerated lesions have totally healed may decrease the incidence of acyclovir-resistant infections; acyclovir-resistant HSV isolates require a prolonged course of intravenous foscarnet, although continuous infusion of high-doses of acyclovir has been reported to be successful in HSCT patients, and surgery should be avoided unless a documented bacterial or fungal abscess is identified.

### Management of pain associated with selected conditions in dermatology [^1148afCq]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Dermatologists face a wide range of pain control challenges in daily practice, from the transient pain of dermatologic surgery to the persistent pain that plagues some chronic dermatologic conditions. Although the pathophysiology of pain is well described and the profound impact of dermatological pain on patients' quality of life is well appreciated, there is an identified need for clear therapeutic plans for providing symptomatic pain relief of common painful dermatoses. In this paper, we will review and clearly outline approaches to pain management of a number of common painful dermatoses such as herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia, ulcers, oral dermatoses, dysesthesias, and many others.

### Varicella-zoster virus infections in patients treated with fingolimod: risk assessment and consensus recommendations for management [^111WzMkH]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections increasingly are reported in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and constitute an area of significant concern, especially with the advent of more disease-modifying treatments in MS that affect T-cell-mediated immunity.

Objective

To assess the incidence, risk factors, and clinical characteristics of VZV infections in fingolimod-treated patients and provide recommendations for prevention and management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Rates of VZV infections in fingolimod clinical trials are based on pooled data from the completed controlled phases 2 and 3 studies (3916 participants) and ongoing uncontrolled extension phases (3553 participants). Male and female patients aged 18 through 55 years (18–60 years for the phase 2 studies) and diagnosed as having relapsing-remitting MS were eligible to participate in these studies. In the postmarketing setting, reporting rates since 2010 were evaluated.

Interventions

In clinical trials, patients received fingolimod at a dosage of 0.5 or 1.25 mg/d, interferon beta-1a, or placebo. In the postmarketing setting, all patients received fingolimod, 0.5 mg/d (total exposure of 54,000 patient-years at the time of analysis).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Calculation of the incidence rate of VZV infection per 1000 patient-years was based on the reporting of adverse events in the trials and the postmarketing setting.

Results

Overall, in clinical trials, VZV rates of infection were low but higher with fingolimod compared with placebo (11 vs 6 per 1000 patient-years). A similar rate was confirmed in the ongoing extension studies. Rates reported in the postmarketing settings were comparable (7 per 1000 patient-years) and remained stable over time. Disproportionality in reporting herpes zoster infection was higher for patients receiving fingolimod compared with those receiving other disease-modifying treatments (empirical Bayes geometric mean, 2.57 [90% CI, 2.26–2.91]); the proportion of serious herpes zoster infections was not higher than the proportion for other treatments (empirical Bayes geometric mean, 1.88 [90% CI, 0.87–3.70]). Corticosteroid treatment for relapses might be a risk factor for VZV reactivation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Rates of VZV infections in clinical trials were low with fingolimod, 0.5 mg/d, but higher than in placebo recipients. Rates reported in the postmarketing setting are comparable. We found no sign of risk accumulation with longer exposure. Serious or complicated cases of herpes zoster were uncommon. We recommend establishing the patient's VZV immune status before initiating fingolimod therapy and immunization for patients susceptible to primary VZV infection. Routine antiviral prophylaxis is not needed, but using concomitant pulsed corticosteroid therapy beyond 3 to 5 days requires an individual risk-benefit assessment. Vigilance to identify early VZV symptoms is important to allow timely antiviral treatment.

### Fixed-site high-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for treatment of chronic low back and lower extremity pain [^117B1K2x]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants

Study participants were recruited from a cohort of 300 chronic pain sufferers who participated in an online research project to evaluate attitudes about alternative approaches to pain management. Inclusion criteria for the original cohort were primary residence in the US, age 40 years or more, minimum household income of US $50,000, pain for most days during the past 3 months or longer, pain distribution that included one or more sites in the low back, legs or feet, and at least one painful health condition among diabetes, sciatica, fibromyalgia, neuropathy, shingles, and restless leg syndrome. The last condition was included because the sensory symptoms are often described as painful, and because of its high association with neuropathies, fibromyalgia, and multi-site chronic pain. Exclusion criteria were any contraindication to use of the FS-TENS device, which included having a cardiac pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, or other implanted metallic or electronic device. Participants received US $50 compensation and the option to keep the FS-TENS device upon completing the study.

Procedures and outcome variables

Recruitment and data collection was managed by an independent research firm. Enrolled participants completed an online baseline questionnaire and were then sent a commercially available, over-the-counter (OTC), FS-TENS device. They had access to the same instructional resources as commercial users. The device instructions encourage daily use to manage pain. Participants did not receive special instructions or training. Participants self-administered the device for 60 days. At 30 and 60 days following delivery of the device, follow-up data were obtained through an online questionnaire that took about 10 minutes to complete. Participants had 1 week to complete the questionnaires, and up to two reminder emails were sent. If the questionnaire was not completed within the 1-week period then the participant was deemed lost to follow-up. De-referenced data files were provided to the study author. All participants signed digital informed consent. Institutional review board approval was not sought because the study was conducted using a commercially available OTC device consistent with its US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared instructions and participant involvement was limited to voluntarily completing three online surveys. The principles outlined in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, were followed.

### Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia: prevention and management [^111GEksi]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The recognizable appearance and the dermatomal distribution of herpes zoster lesions usually enable a clinical diagnosis to be made easily. Herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia occur mainly in older patients. The role of the varicella vaccine in preventing herpes zoster is uncertain, but is being studied. There is evidence to support using antiviral therapy and possibly low-dose tricyclic antidepressants to prevent postherpetic neuralgia. There is good evidence that treating herpes zoster with antiviral medication is beneficial, particularly in patients older than 50 years with severe outbreaks. The use of steroids has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio. In patients who develop postherpetic neuralgia, there is good evidence to support treatment with gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants. More evidence for treatment with capsaicin cream, lidocaine patch, and opioids is needed. Intrathecal methylprednisolone is an option for patients with persistent pain.

### Herpes zoster in the older adult [^112kBsHT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster (HZ) is the result of reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) and occurs most frequently in older adults. Classically, HZ presents as a unilateral, selflimited, dermatomal rash. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common sequela, presenting as severe pain that persists after the rash has resolved. In the elderly, PHN can be debilitating and requires a prompt diagnosis, treatment with antivirals, and adequate pain control. A longer-term pain management strategy is required if PHN occurs. A modestly effective vaccine exists and is recommended for older individuals.

### Vaccination strategies for the prevention of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia [^113KRPZV]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Herpes zoster disease and its most common complication, postherpetic neuralgia, are associated with significant morbidity in the elderly. The zoster vaccine boosts cell-mediated immunity to varicella-zoster virus, the virus that causes both varicella and herpes zoster. This vaccine has demonstrated the ability to reduce the zoster-related burden of illness and the incidence of both zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in a randomized, controlled trial conducted in individuals aged 60 years and older, an age group at increased risk of herpes zoster. Widespread use of this vaccine could prevent as many as a quarter of a million cases of zoster disease each year. The design and outcomes of the Shingles Prevention Study, which examined the efficacy and safety of the vaccine, and the rationale for widespread immunization against varicella-zoster virus, are presented here.

### Consequences and management of pain in herpes zoster [^117L5ZnG]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a common complication of herpes zoster, particularly in the elderly and in persons with severe symptoms at presentation. Unless varicella vaccination reduces the incidence of herpes zoster and attenuates the risk and/or severity of complications, PHN will continue to result in significant suffering and remain a consumer of health care and related social support resources. Although there have been useful advances in the management of PHN (e.g., the use of the anticonvulsant gabapentin), some cases remain intractable. Prevention remains the preferred strategy, and antiviral drugs are the most well established means of preventing the development of pain. Other interventions require further evaluation (nerve blocks, acute-phase tricyclic antidepressant or anticonvulsant use). Because prevention of PHN requires early recognition and prompt management of patients presenting with herpes zoster, public education and dissemination of information to all health care personnel involved with the disease are essential.

### Key points… [^111upqMD]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of varicella-zoster virus and can be prevented with Shingrix vaccine.
- Herpes zoster is hard to diagnose in children and younger adults, especially if the clinical presentation is mild.
- Older adults and people who are immunocompromised are at high risk for shingles complications. Shingles complications include postherpetic neuralgia, hearing or vision loss, encephalitis, and pneumonia. The signs and symptoms of herpes zoster are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical diagnosis once the rash appears. However, clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster might not be possible in the absence of a rash. Prevention CDC recommends 2 doses of recombinant zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and related complications in adults 50 years and older.

Varicella vaccines contain live attenuated VZV, which results in latent infection. Although herpes zoster has always been uncommon among children, the rate in U.

There are three preferred antiviral drugs available for the initial treatment of shingles:
