## Question

JNC8 hypertension guideline.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the JNC 8 hypertension guideline, including its key recommendations, evidence base, controversies, and how it compares with JNC 7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline's scope and methodology. Then, I should verify the treatment thresholds and blood pressure targets by age and comorbidity. Next, I will examine first-line drug choices and titration strategies. After that, I need to review the evidence base and limitations. Then, I should quantify population impact and real-world adoption. Finally, I will compare JNC 8 with JNC 7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and synthesize a practical, clinically balanced take-home message.

> Let me first confirm the scope and methodological stance of JNC 8. The panel focused on three questions: whether initiating therapy at specific BP thresholds improves outcomes, whether treating to specific BP goals improves outcomes, and whether particular drug classes differ in benefit or harm, and it explicitly prioritized randomized controlled trials as the highest-quality evidence, which shaped its more conservative, RCT-aligned recommendations compared with prior consensus-driven approaches [^115CjvEw] [^114eZ6aq].

> Now, I should verify the treatment thresholds and BP targets by age. For adults aged 60 years or older, JNC 8 recommends initiating pharmacologic therapy at SBP ≥ 150 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treating to a goal of SBP < 150 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg, with a corollary that if treatment achieves SBP < 140 mm Hg without adverse effects, no adjustment is needed, which operationalizes a pragmatic lower bound while maintaining the formal target of < 150/90 mm Hg [^114ZcC5v] [^115izHe7]. For adults younger than 60 years, the panel recommends initiating therapy at SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treating to a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg, noting that the SBP goal for those younger than 60 is based on expert opinion due to insufficient RCT evidence for a specific systolic target in that group [^115z4TP1] [^115izHe7].

> Hold on, I should verify the recommendations for diabetes and CKD, because this is where confusion often arises. JNC 8 aligned treatment thresholds and goals for adults with diabetes or nondiabetic CKD with the general population younger than 60 years, recommending initiation at ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and a target of < 140/90 mm Hg, and it specifically advises initiating or adding an ACE inhibitor or ARB in CKD to improve kidney outcomes, regardless of race or diabetes status [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5] [^116VhNKh]. Wait, let me verify the rationale for not pushing lower targets in diabetes or CKD; the panel concluded that available RCTs did not demonstrate additional benefit from more intensive BP lowering in these populations, which explains the departure from the lower targets advocated by some prior guidelines [^115izHe7].

> Next, I should review first-line drug choices and race-specific considerations. For the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, JNC 8 lists thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs as acceptable initial options, while for the general black population, including those with diabetes, a thiazide-type diuretic or a calcium channel blocker is recommended as initial therapy, reflecting differential response patterns observed in trials such as ALLHAT and related analyses [^115CjvEw] [^111DCbKx] [^115aJoE7]. I need to ensure I note the de-emphasis of beta-blockers as first-line in the absence of compelling indications, a shift that has influenced subsequent U.S. guidance and prescribing patterns [^114HskhJ].

> I will now examine the treatment algorithm and titration strategy. The panel recommends three practical approaches: maximize the dose of the initial agent, add a second agent before reaching maximal dose of the first, or start with two agents from different classes, with reassessment and escalation monthly until goal BP is achieved; if three agents fail or there is a contraindication, consider other classes or refer to a hypertension specialist, which operationalizes a stepwise but time-efficient pathway to control [^112pVBce] [^114yMY2E]. Let me double-check that this monthly cadence is explicitly recommended; yes, the guideline advises monthly titration until control, which is a key operational detail for implementation [^114yMY2E].

> Next, I should review the evidence base and acknowledge limitations. Several recommendations, including the SBP target for adults younger than 60 and the uniform < 140/90 mm Hg target in diabetes and CKD, were graded as expert opinion because of insufficient RCT data, and the panel's strict RCT-only filter excluded many observational and meta-analytic sources, prompting criticism that some conclusions were underpowered or overly conservative [^115izHe7] [^116xjPrG]. But wait, what if more recent trials contradict these thresholds? Indeed, SPRINT, published after JNC 8, demonstrated mortality and cardiovascular benefits with intensive SBP lowering to < 120 mm Hg in high-risk adults without diabetes, a finding that later informed the 2017 ACC/AHA shift toward lower targets, highlighting how JNC 8's RCT-centric approach missed emerging high-quality evidence [^114fmH37].

> I should quantify the population impact to contextualize clinical implications. Under JNC 8, approximately 27.6% of adults aged 60 years or older who were previously above JNC 7 goals became "at goal", and overall, about 13.5 million U.S. adults — many with diabetes, CKD, or CVD — were no longer considered above goal, reflecting a substantial liberalization of targets and potential de-intensification of therapy in older adults [^1154Abaf] [^114ZYgAP]. Hold on, I should verify whether this translated into fewer people eligible for treatment; yes, treatment eligibility declined modestly overall, with larger declines in older adults, consistent with the higher SBP threshold in that group [^1154Abaf].

> Let me consider real-world adoption and prescriber behavior, because guidelines often diverge from practice. Surveys and observational data show that many clinicians did not fully adopt the higher SBP target for older adults, and national analyses indicate that beta-blocker use declined only modestly despite de-emphasis, while thiazide use did not increase as expected, particularly among Black patients, suggesting persistent inertia and equity gaps in implementation [^117QEfHc] [^116AyEQJ] [^112tp8FM]. I should double-check whether fixed-dose combinations increased after 2017; contrary to recommendations, FDC use declined, underscoring implementation challenges even when guidelines evolve [^116AyEQJ].

> Now, I will compare JNC 8 with JNC 7 to clarify the major shifts. JNC 7 used a universal treatment target of < 140/90 mm Hg and advocated lower targets of < 130/80 mm Hg for diabetes or CKD, whereas JNC 8 raised the SBP target to < 150 mm Hg for adults aged 60 years or older and aligned diabetes and CKD targets with the general population younger than 60 years at < 140/90 mm Hg, marking a clear move away from lower targets in high-risk comorbidity groups absent supportive RCTs [^116vimuc] [^115CjvEw]. Hold on, I should verify the drug-class changes too; JNC 8 de-emphasized beta-blockers as first-line in the absence of compelling indications, a departure from their broader first-line role in earlier guidance, reflecting evolving outcome data [^114HskhJ].

> Next, I should review how JNC 8 compares with the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, because this is where practice often diverges. The 2017 ACC/AHA guideline redefined hypertension to ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, recommended initiating pharmacotherapy at ≥ 130/80 mm Hg for those with high ASCVD risk, and set a universal treatment goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for most adults, positions largely influenced by SPRINT and other contemporary trials, which directly conflict with JNC 8's more conservative thresholds and goals [^114fmH37] [^113vsxev]. I need to ensure I note the consequence: millions more adults became eligible for diagnosis and treatment under ACC/AHA, and control rates dropped relative to the more lenient JNC 8 targets, reshaping quality metrics and clinical workflows [^116ZsipS] [^111CReQa].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications and controversies. JNC 8's RCT-first approach yielded conservative, population-level recommendations that reduced overtreatment in older adults but risked undertreatment in some high-risk groups, especially given the later emergence of SPRINT and related data supporting more intensive BP lowering; this tension between internal validity and external applicability remains a key legacy of JNC 8 [^114eZ6aq] [^114fmH37]. I should confirm that guideline concordance across societies remains low; indeed, cross-guideline analyses show substantial inconsistency in direction and strength of recommendations, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment in practice [^1176YRHu].

> Finally, I need to translate this into a practical, clinically balanced approach. For adults aged 60 years or older, it is reasonable to start at ≥ 150/90 mm Hg and target < 150/90 mm Hg, while recognizing that many patients tolerate and benefit from lower SBP levels, and that SPRINT-era evidence supports more intensive targets in appropriate high-risk older adults after careful assessment of frailty, falls risk, and comorbidity burden; for adults younger than 60 years, initiating therapy at ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and targeting < 140/90 mm Hg remains a defensible, evidence-aligned baseline, with consideration of lower targets in selected high-risk patients using shared decision-making and close monitoring for adverse effects [^115CjvEw] [^114fmH37]. Hold on, I should verify that this synthesis preserves JNC 8's operational guidance; yes, it retains the monthly titration cadence, preference for thiazides, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs as first-line, and the emphasis on ACE inhibitor or ARB use in CKD, while integrating newer evidence where appropriate and documenting rationale for deviations from JNC 8 targets when clinically justified [^114yMY2E] [^116VhNKh].

---

The JNC 8 guideline recommends initiating pharmacologic therapy at **≥ 150/90 mm Hg for adults ≥ 60 years** [^114ZcC5v] and **≥ 140/90 mm Hg for adults < 60 years** [^116BWX61], with treatment goals of < 150/90 mm Hg and < 140/90 mm Hg, respectively. For adults ≥ 18 years with diabetes or CKD, initiate therapy at **≥ 140/90 mm Hg** [^112inVHR] [^1118rZC5] and treat to < 140/90 mm Hg [^1118rZC5]. First-line therapy: thiazide-type diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs for nonblack patients; thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs for black patients [^111DCbKx]; and ACE inhibitors or ARBs for CKD [^116VhNKh]. Reassess monthly and titrate or add agents until goal BP is reached [^114yMY2E]; refer to a hypertension specialist if the goal is not achieved [^114KKMtZ].

## Blood pressure thresholds for initiation of pharmacologic therapy

| **Population** | **Threshold for initiation of pharmacologic therapy** |
|-|-|
| General population ≥ 60 years | SBP ≥ 150 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg [^114ZcC5v] |
| General population < 60 years | SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg [^115z4TP1] |
| Adults ≥ 18 years with diabetes or CKD | SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg [^115z4TP1] |

## Blood pressure treatment goals

| **Population** | **Treatment goal** |
|-|-|
| General population ≥ 60 years | SBP < 150 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg [^114ZcC5v] |
| General population < 60 years | SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg [^116BWX61] |
| Adults ≥ 18 years with diabetes or CKD | SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg [^115CjvEw] |

---

## Recommended pharmacologic therapy

- **General nonblack population**: thiazide-type diuretics, CCBs, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs [^115CjvEw].
- **General black population**: thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs [^111DCbKx].
- **CKD (with or without diabetes)**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^116VhNKh].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess blood pressure **monthly** [^114yMY2E] and titrate or add antihypertensive agents until the goal BP is achieved. If the goal BP is not achieved, **refer to a hypertension specialist** [^114KKMtZ].

---

## Special considerations

Lifestyle modifications are **recommended for all patients** with hypertension, regardless of pharmacologic therapy. Clinical judgment should guide therapy, especially in older adults, those with multiple comorbidities, or those experiencing adverse effects [^112pVBce] [^115CjvEw].

---

## Controversies and criticisms

Controversies and criticisms include **higher BP targets for older adults** [^116xjPrG], which some argue may increase cardiovascular risk, and **limited evidence**, with some recommendations based on expert opinion rather than robust RCT data [^116xjPrG]. There are also **conflicting guidelines**, as differences from other societies have created confusion and inconsistent clinical practice [^115UxSsE].

---

The JNC 8 guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for hypertension management, emphasizing individualized treatment goals and pharmacologic therapy based on age, race, and comorbidities. Regular monitoring and clinical judgment are essential for effective blood pressure control.

The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines on hypertension have generated great interest among physicians. These guidelines differ from those published in 2003 (the JNC 7) - in the document format, blood-pressure cut-off values, and recommendations for antihypertensive drug use. The JNC 8 have some limitations that could affect clinical practice.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116xjPrG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### Reconciling multiple hypertension guidelines to promote effective clinical practice [^1177QiTj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

The new Joint National Committee 8 (JNC-8) blood pressure guidelines were recently published, and there are some major changes from JNC-7. There are also differences between JNC-8 and hypertension guidelines created by major organizations in North America and around the world published from 2013 to the present. In the face of conflicting evidence, it is difficult for practicing clinicians to reconcile these differences and to incorporate new guidance into their practice. This commentary will identify similarities and differences between guidelines, provide some literature context in the areas of differing recommendations, and then provide advice to enhance patient care.

### Proportion of US adults potentially affected by the 2014 hypertension guideline [^1154Abaf]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The new 2014 blood pressure (BP) guideline released by the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8; 2014 BP guideline) proposed less restrictive BP targets for adults aged 60 years or older and for those with diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Objective

To estimate the proportion of US adults potentially affected by recent changes in recommendations for management of hypertension.

Design

Cross-sectional, nationally representative survey.

Participants

Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2005 and 2010 (n = 16,372), we evaluated hypertension control and treatment recommendations for US adults.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Proportion of adults estimated to meet guideline-based BP targets under the 2014 BP guideline and under the previous seventh Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guideline.

Results

The proportion of younger adults (18–59 years) with treatment-eligible hypertension under the JNC 7 guideline was 20.3% (95% CI, 19.1%-21.4%) and decreased to 19.2% (95% CI, 18.1%-20.4%) under the 2014 BP guideline. Larger declines were observed among older adults (≥ 60 years), decreasing from 68.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-70.8%) under JNC 7 to 61.2% (95% CI, 59.3%-63.0%) under the 2014 BP guideline. The proportion of adults with treatment-eligible hypertension who met BP goals increased slightly for younger adults, from 41.2% (95% CI, 38.1%-44.3%) under JNC 7 to 47.5% (95% CI, 44.4%-50.6%) under the 2014 BP guideline, and more substantially for older adults, from 40.0% (95% CI, 37.8%-42.3%) under JNC 7 to 65.8% (95% CI, 63.7%-67.9%) under the 2014 BP guideline. Overall, 1.6% (95% CI, 1.3%-1.9%) of US adults aged 18–59 years and 27.6% (95% CI, 25.9%-29.3%) of adults aged 60 years or older were receiving BP-lowering medication and meeting more stringent JNC 7 targets. These patients may be eligible for less stringent or no BP therapy with the 2014 BP guideline.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with the JNC 7 guideline, the 2014 BP guideline from the panel members appointed to the JNC 8 was associated with a reduction in the proportion of US adults recommended for hypertension treatment and a substantial increase in the proportion of adults considered to have achieved goal BP, primarily in older adults.

### Developing hypertension guidelines: an evolving process [^114X8KMZ]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines provide up-to-date information and recommendations for hypertension management to healthcare providers, and they facilitate translation of new knowledge into clinical practice. Guidelines represent consensus statements by expert panels, and the process of guideline development has inherent vulnerabilities. Between 1977 and 2003, under the direction of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) issued 7 reports. The evolution of the JNC recommendations reflects the acquisition of observational and clinical trial data and the availability of newer antihypertensive drugs. Despite 5 years in preparation, NIH did not release a JNC 8 report and recently made the decision to withdraw from issuing guidelines. The responsibility for issuing hypertension-related guidelines was transferred to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology. Without the endorsement of the NIH or the AHA, JNC 8 committee members recently published their guideline report. Notably, there have been discrepancies of JNC recommendations over time as well as discrepancies with recommendations of other professional organizations. The Institute of Medicine recently recommended criteria for "trustworthy" guidelines. Criticisms of the guideline process, and of the guidelines themselves, should not obscure their likely contribution to improved hypertension control and to decreases of mortality rates of stroke and cardiovascular disease over the past several decades. Nevertheless, translation of guidelines into clinical practice remains a challenge.

Other Limitations

There are several limitations to consider in the JNC 8 committee's approach to BP treatment (Table 2). Unlike the other professional societies' guidelines, the JNC 8 panel did not address topics outside of their chosen critical questions, specifically given the paucity of randomized trial evidence addressing such questions. While they endorsed the AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, 50 the JNC 8 does not address lifestyle modifications or a timeline for attempting them. Another limitation is that ambulatory BP monitoring, including cut‐off values for diagnosing hypertension based on home BP readings, is not addressed.

Table 2
Recommendations for the AHA/ACC Committee

One suggestion is to confirm elevated BP with ambulatory BP monitoring, such as that recently recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force. 51 There is in general a lack of guidance on the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation for secondary causes. Although the JNC 8 committee offers a titration schedule for treating hypertension, the recommendations are somewhat vague, and there is no guidance for resistant hypertension beyond referral to a hypertension specialist.

We also recommend that the AHA/ACC guideline committee focus on the benefits of the various drug classes and the situations that call for monodrug versus multidrug therapy. Another important area of focus will be the benefit of more‐intensive BP treatment, especially in the elderly and those with diabetes, and the addition of a risk‐based approach to initiating treatment (described earlier). These are all areas that can be targeted by the new AHA/ACC guideline committee.

Conclusion

While JNC 8 offers improvements over JNC 7 with a laudable dedication to high‐quality randomized evidence‐based recommendations, it leaves open some areas of improvement for the new ACC/AHA committee. By focusing solely on RCTs, we are left with areas of uncertainty where high‐quality observational studies could help elucidate effective recommendations to ultimately achieve the goal of improving hypertension control and the health of our patients. By creating a higher SBP treatment threshold for people > 60 years old, the very group who are at the highest CVD risk, implementation of JNC 8 recommendations could mean that > 6 million people in this category may not be started on treatment and an additional 13.5 million may have their treatment target liberalized, with potential detrimental consequences. 29

While the previous BP target of < 140/90 mm Hg could be liberalized for patients who are frail or > 80 years old, adopting these new guidelines in persons aged 60 to 80 years may lead to a resurgence of stroke rates. More research is needed, particularly on the use of estimated ASCVD risk cut‐points to inform therapeutic antihypertensive targets, but the new ACC/AHA hypertension guideline committee should consider a risk‐based treatment approach for adults > 60 years of age by; for example, initiating BP treatment for those with SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg based on a ≥ 7.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk score. Finally, the results from SPRINT will further undermine the JNC 8 recommendations and will likely result in a paradigm shift in how we treat hypertension.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

JNC 8 Recommendations 2 to 5

In all persons < 60 years or in persons > 18 years (and either those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

There is broader agreement between the professional societies on how to treat younger patients with hypertension. While most studies examined adults > 30 years, JNC 8 extends the same target to those aged 18 to 30 years. More support can be found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, especially in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. 34 This trial randomized 18 790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into 3 groups based on target DBP ≤ 90, ≤ 85, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

The main goal of this study was to assess the association between these 3 target DBPs and major CVD events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death). There was little difference in event rates between the 3 groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the 2 lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the 3 groups. 34

While all 3 groups in HOT achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was seen at 85.6 mm Hg and the lowest rate of CVD events was seen at 82.6 mm Hg. Based on this trial, everyone with hypertension under the JNC 8 guidelines has a DBP goal of < 90 mm Hg. There is less evidence supporting an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg in this group of patients. However, in trials like HOT, even though DBP was being targeted, SBP also fell at least 25 mm Hg in all 3 groups. 34 Indeed, given SPRINT suggests clinical benefit for an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among higher risk persons < 60 years, it is likely that forthcoming guidelines may even reduce this SBP target to a threshold lower than 140. However, the DBP values in the intensive therapy arm of SPRINT are not currently known.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^117H73sr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendation 1

In the general population aged ≥ 60 years, initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP at systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal SBP < 150 mm Hg and goal DBP < 90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

This first recommendation is based on several RCTs evaluating treatment of SBP to < 140 mm Hg versus a more liberal target (140–160 mm Hg) in patients > 65 years of age. 9, 10 In the Japanese Trial to Assess Optimal Systolic Blood Pressure in Elderly Hypertensive Patients (JATOS), 4418 patients between the ages of 65 and 85 were randomized to SBP treatment goal < 140 mm Hg versus 140 to < 160 mm Hg. Despite the fact that the intensive treatment group achieved a significantly lower BP (136/75 mm Hg versus 146/78 mm Hg), the primary end point of combined CVD and renal failure did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

One limitation of this trial, however, is that it was only powered to detect a 40% relative risk reduction (or an absolute risk reduction from 5% to 3%) in the primary end point. While a 10/3–mm Hg reduction in BP is substantial, it may not be sufficient to achieve a 40% reduction in CVD or renal failure. Also, these patients were followed for only 2 years and the main treatment drug was a long‐acting calcium channel blocker (CCB). Diuretics, widely considered first line along with CCBs in most professional society guidelines, were used in only 12% of the patients. 7, 11, 12, 13 While not reaching statistical significance, subgroup analysis suggested that intensive treatment goals may be beneficial in patients < 75 years old while adopting a more liberal strategy may be safer in those ≥ 75 years old. 10

### Cardiovascular guidelines: separate career may help attenuate controversy [^1136g9nL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

THE JNC8 hypertension guidelines

Only about half of patients with hypertension in the United States actually have an systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mm Hg or less. The Joint National Committee (JNC7) Guidelines, released more than a decade ago, concluded that all adult patients with hypertension (regardless of their age) should have their BP reduced to a SBP of lower than 140 mm Hg, with even tighter control in patients with diabetes or renal disease (SBP < 130 mmHg). In contrast, the current recommendation raises target SBP goals to 150 mm Hg or lower in those aged 60 years or older, while eliminating the tighter control recommendations in patients with diabetes and renal disease. A minority of the panel disagreed with the recommendation to increase the target SBP from 140 to 150 mmHg in persons aged 60 years or older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Intuitively, an estimated 13 million U.S. hypertensive treated people aged 60 years or older would reduce pill intake as the SBP goal increase from 140 to 150 mmHg. Antihypertensive medication use may be associated with injurious falls in the elderly, a 30% to 40% increased risk compared with no antihypertensive medication use. Moreover, the results of the ACCORD MIND show that intensive management to a target SBP of less than 120 mm Hg and fibrate therapy in the context of LDL cholesterol level control are not effective in reducing cognitive decline in persons with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^114use8x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

HYPERTENSION GUIDELINE AND TREATMENT CONTROVERSIES

Hypertension care is complex. Multiple guidelines with different treatment thresholds, diagnostic criteria, and target goals introduce potential program, communication, and management complexity may have contributed to the decline in controlled BP. The 2017 AHA/ACC BP guidelineand the report from members initially appointed to the Joint National Committee (JNC-8)have been the subject of debate and inconsistent implementation by some professional organizations and clinicians. For example, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommended that patients with hypertension who are 60 years and older should be treated to a systolic BP target of < 150 mm Hg, aligning with the JNC-8 writing group recommendation, but conflicting with JNC-7 and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. It is unclear whether these inconsistencies contribute to reduced BP control. Of note, hypertension control to < 140/ < 90 mm Hg declined more in adults 40–59 years than in those 60 years and older. This finding suggests that factors other than the JNC-8 report and ACP/AAFP recommendations for a higher systolic BP target may contribute to the broad-based decline in hypertension control.

JNC-8 versus the 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis

Recently, JNC-8 has recommended that the goal BP for all Americans should remain at < 140/90 mm Hg. The exception is those who are 60 and older, where the goal BP has been raised to < 150/90 mm Hg (unless the patient has diabetes or non-diabetic chronic kidney disease). However, one of the authors of a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis has called for retraction of the JNC-8 guidelines, as they do not seem to match the current evidence in the literature. Indeed, the 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis found four randomised trials and looked at only healthy individuals with mild hypertension (SBP 140–159 mm Hg and diastolic BP 90–99 mm Hg). The meta-analysis found no reduction in CV events or mortality with antihypertensive therapy. Moreover, there was an almost fivefold significant increase in withdrawal due to adverse events. These data call into question the JNC-8 recommended BP goals of < 140/90 and < 150/90 mm Hg in these individuals.

Making things even more confusing, five authors of JNC-8 published a 'minority view', believe that JNC-8's recommendation for a BP goal of < 150/90 mm Hg in those 60 and older should remain at < 140/90 mm Hg. These authors inappropriately cite SHEP and HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial), as support for the more stringent goals, as these trials showed benefit of treating hypertension to an SBP goal between 140 and 145 mm Hg. However, these trials were in patients with a starting SBP of 160 mm Hg or higher, with the average SBP being much higher than 160 mm Hg. Thus, these do not apply to patients with mild hypertension (and thus should not support a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg in these older individuals). Additionally, only three antihypertensive medications have evidence in this population, that being chlorthalidone (SHEP) and indapamide/perindoipril (HYVET). Thus, the use of any other antihypertensive medication(s) in this setting would strictly be considered non-evidence based; yet the JNC-8 guidelines have no preferential recommendation for these EBM s. In order to reduce CV risk, EBM needs to be integrated into HTN guidelines, and in all guidelines for that matter.

### Hypertension: Joint National Committee on detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure guidelines [^112uxPcn]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension has been recognized for decades as a major factor for stroke, with observational epidemiologic studies clearly identifying the increased stroke risks with blood pressure (BP) levels and randomized controlled clinical trials providing evidence of stroke risk reduction with lower BPs. Hypertension treatment and management guidelines, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) reports, have recognized the high impact of elevated BPs and influenced lower BPs with subsequent stroke risk reduction. In particular, the previous seven JNC reports included an evolution of SBP levels for treatment. This review addresses the influences of the JNC reports on stroke outcomes and describes the potential efforts of the upcoming guidelines.

Recent Findings

The recommendations of lower SBPs from the earlier reports were consistent with lower population BP shifts during the time period. The next JNC report will have a major focus on graded evidence from randomized clinical trials with detailed strategies and subsequent impact on stroke risks.

Summary

The impact of the evidence-based guidelines will be expected to have enhanced effects on stroke rates by providing clinicians with current treatment and management recommendations.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115NCPz5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Although the JNC 8 BP target of < 150/90 mm Hg is recommended for those older than 60 years, evidence for this target is strongest for those > 80 years. HYVET (Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial) showed a benefit to treating patients > 80 years old to an average SBP of 144 mm Hg (N = 3845). These patients initially had SBP > 160 mm Hg at baseline and were treated with indapamide plus perindopril as needed to achieve a goal BP of < 150/80 mm Hg. This trial was stopped early for mortality benefit, with outcomes including 39% reduction in fatal strokes, 21% reduction in death from any cause, and 64% reduction in HF rates in the treatment group. 20 In HYVET, frail adults > 80 years old were excluded from the trial, but this suggests that otherwise robust adults > 80 years old have a significant reduction in mortality and CVD outcomes targeting SBP < 150 mm Hg. What is not clear from HYVET is whether further reductions in BP to lower thresholds would have been beneficial in this sample. In the prespecified subgroup analysis of the SPRINT trial, the reduction in CVD events and death in the intensive treatment arm (targeting SBP < 120 mm Hg) was seen across age groups, including in people aged 75 years or older. 18 Similar to HYVET, SPRINT avoided possibly frail older adults, by excluding residents of nursing homes or assisted living facilities. These results will also impact the new guideline committee.

The American Society of Hypertension (ASH)/International Society of Hypertension (ISH) along with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines use a higher age cutoff of > 80 years for a treatment goal of BP < 150/90 mm Hg (Table 1). 11, 14, 21, 22, 23 Unlike the JNC 8 panel's recommendations, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) add another variable of frailty, likely due to the fact that trials such as HYVET attempted to exclude frail patients such as those with dementia or requiring nursing home care. 12 They recommend a tailored approach for the fragile elderly patient < 80 years of age by using individualized targets.

### Clinical application and potential effects of 2014 hypertension guidelines on incident cardiovascular events [^1131Zunk]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The applicability to real-world hypertensive patients and the potential effects on future cardiovascular events of the 2014 hypertension guidelines of the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8) remain to be determined.

Methods

Using the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 2008 to 2012 (n = 30,697), we estimated the proportion of Korean adults eligible for hypertension therapy under the 2014 JNC-8 and previous JNC-7 guidelines and the changes affected by the 2014 guidelines. Using the validation cohort (n = 116,767) from the 2003 National Health Examination with 7 years of follow-up, we determined the clinical effects of recent recommendations changes on incident cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke).

Results

Compared with the JNC-7 guidelines, the 2014 guidelines would decrease the number of adults eligible for hypertension therapy from 10.1 million (28.2%) to 9.3 million (25.9%). In the validation cohort, compared with nonhypertensive adults, those eligible for hypertension therapy under the JNC-7 or JNC-8 guidelines had significantly higher risks of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 5.05; 95% confidence interval, 4.58–5.57, P < 0.001; and HR, 5.11; 95% CI, 4.63–5.64, P < 0.001, respectively). In addition, adults newly ineligible for treatment under the 2014 guidelines had an increased risk of cardiovascular events relative to nonhypertensive adults (HR, 4.36; 95% CI, 3.65–5.20; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The 2014 hypertension guidelines would modestly decrease the proportion of Korean adults eligible for hypertension therapy. Adults newly ineligible for hypertension therapy by the 2014 guidelines have a higher risk of cardiovascular events compared to nonhypertensive adults. Our observations should be confirmed or refuted through large, randomized clinical trials.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^1122kn3C]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

High blood pressure (HBP) or hypertension (HTN) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Despite this fact, there is widespread agreement that the treatment of HBP, over the last half century, has been a great achievement. However, after the release of the new Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-8 (JNC-8) guidelines, there have been heated debates with regard to what are the most evidence-based blood pressure goals. While JNC-8 claims that the goal blood pressure for otherwise healthy patients with mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140–159 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90–99 mm Hg) should be < 140/90 mm Hg; a recent Cochrane meta-analysis is in direct conflict with these recommendations. Indeed, a 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis indicated that there is no evidence that treating otherwise healthy mild hypertension patients with antihypertensive therapy will reduce CV events or mortality. Additionally, the Cochrane meta-analysis showed that antihypertensive therapy was associated with a significant increase in withdrawal due to adverse events. Thus, the current evidence in the literature does not support the goals set by the JNC-8 guidelines. In this review we discussed the strengths and limitations of both lines of evidence and why it takes an evidence-based medication to reduce CV events/mortality (eg, how a goal blood pressure is achieved is more important than getting to the goal). As medications inherently cause side effects and come at a cost to the patient, the practice of evidence-based medicine becomes exceedingly important. Although the majority of HTN studies claim great advantages by lowering HBP, this review finds severe conflicts in the findings among the various HTN studies, as well as serious epistemological, methodological and statistical problems that cast doubt to such claims.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^111bTQCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable. There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014, and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines). Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations. This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom. To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations. Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

### European guidelines for hypertension in 2024: a comparison of key recommendations for clinical practice [^113vwMGX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adultsprovides blood pressure (BP) thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension, initiation of antihypertensive treatment, and targets for BP control. Compared with recommendations from the 2014 report from the expert panel, composed of members appointed to the intended Eighth Joint National Committeeand the 2003 Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), notable differences in definitions exist (Table 1).

Table 1
BP Levels to Define Hypertension, Recommend Antihypertensive Therapy, and Provide Treatment Goals, According to the ACC/AHA Guideline, 2014 Expert Panel Report, and JNC7

First, the ACC/AHA guideline uses a lower systolic and diastolic BP threshold of 130/80 mm Hg to define hypertension, compared with 140/90 mm Hg used by the previous 2014 expert panel report and JNC7. Although all 3 documents recommend the use of antihypertensive therapy in those with a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, the most recent guideline also recommends therapy for individuals with a BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg and either a 10‐year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk ≥ 10% or high‐risk comorbidities (ischemic heart disease, heart failure [HF], diabetes, or chronic kidney disease). Based in part on data from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline recommends a more aggressive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in all adults. In contrast, the 2014 expert panel report recommends a goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for all except those aged > 60 years, for whom a target of < 150/90 mm Hg is recommended. Similarly, the JNC7 set a BP goal of < 140/90 mm Hg for the general population, reserving a more intensive goal of < 130/80 mm Hg for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^114xPe9j]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Blood Pressure

High blood pressure (BP) is an important risk factor for CHD and an even stronger risk factor for stroke. It also is associated with the development of AF, heart failure (HF), left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, and dementia. – Results from meta‐analyses with > 61 million adults show that each 20‐mm Hg increase in SBP or 10‐mm Hg increase in diastolic BP doubles the risk of a fatal coronary event.

New BP recommendations (not sponsored by any national organization) were recently published from the group appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).

The new recommendations (Figure) are largely similar to the JNC 7 guidelines with 2 important changes. First, they liberalize the systolic treatment goal from < 140 to < 150 mm Hg for patients aged ≥ 60 years; however, the panel did not recommend reducing pharmacological treatment to allow for increased BP in older patients that are tolerant of a SBP < 150 mm Hg. Considerable controversy has followed this change, and a group of committee members on the JNC 8 panel published a dissenting review of the age‐specific SBP treatment goal, citing substantial CV benefit from SBP < 140 mm Hg based on observational data and no new evidence since publication of the JNC 7 guidelines to suggest significant harm from treating to SBP < 140 mm Hg. In addition, BP treatment guidelines from other major international organizations have recommended either a universal treatment goal of < 140 over < 90 mm Hg or a change in the target SBP target to < 150 mm Hg for patients aged ≥ 80 years. – These treatment goals represent reasonable alternatives to the JNC 8 guideline committee recommendations. Currently, a large randomized controlled trial is ongoing and is randomizing > 9000 patients to either standard or intensive BP control and assessing the first occurrence of MI, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, HF, or CVD death.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^115h53Kg]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Current target recommendations

NICE reviewed three systematic reviews and 27 prognostic studies to develop their current treatment threshold recommendations. The cut-off points for ABPM were set lower than those for clinic BP. Evidence for these thresholds came largely from work comparing clinic BP and ABPM to cardiovascular outcomes. The Pressioni Arteriose Monitorate e Loro Associazioni (PAMELA) trial was a landmark study in this area and the authors predicted that a clinic BP of 140/90 mmHg was equivalent to a 24-hour ABPM of 125/80 mmHg or a daytime ABPM of 130/85 mmHg. However, this work was based on prognostic thresholds and there is very little evidence for comparable treatment targets between ABPM and clinic BP. As discussed above, Head et al. analysed clinic BP and ABPM measurements from patients referred to hypertension clinics across Australia. The treatment target recommendations for ABPM and SMBP (Table 1) from the NICE guidelines are largely based on this work.

Table 1
Comparison of recommendations for diagnostic and treatment thresholds between NICE, ESH, JNC and CHEP guidelines

Abbreviations: OBPM office blood pressure measurement, ABPM ambulatory blood pressure measurement, HBPM home blood pressure measurement, CKD chronic kidney disease

NICE suggests an ABPM treatment target of < 135/85 mmHg for patients below 80 years of age and an ABPM target of < 145/85 mmHg for those patients over 80 years. Currently, they are the only guidelines to specify a common treatment and management threshold for ABPM with the same thresholds assumed for home BP monitoring.

The ESH 2013 guidelines suggest a target of < 140 mmHg for all patients under 80 years of age and a diagnostic target of < 90 mmHg. Diabetic patients should be treated to a diastolic target of < 85 mmHg. Patients over 80 years with a systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg should be treated to a target between 140 and 150 mmHg according to the evidence.

The recent JNC 8 guideline recommended treating those between 18 and 60 years old to a target of 140/90 mmHg. However, for those patients above 60 years, they recommended a systolic treatment target of < 150 mmHg. This caused some controversy, but the committee argued that evidence from the trials they had considered found little benefit of tighter control leading to better outcomes. However, many countered that these recommendations were based on a very small number of trials which passed the rigorous screening process, excluding evidence from meta-analysis, and meaning that this recommendation was almost entirely based on expert opinion.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^1176YRHu]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Hypertension is very common, but guideline recommendations for hypertension have been controversial, are of increasing interest, and have profound implications.

Objective

To systematically assess the consistency of recommendations regarding hypertension management across clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study of hypertension management recommendations included CPGs that had been published as of April 2018. Two point-of-care resources that provided graded recommendations were included for secondary analyses. Discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states were used to define a series of reference recommendations. Three raters reached consensus on coding the direction and strength of each recommendation made by each CPG. Three independent raters reached consensus on the importance of each reference recommendation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes were rates of consistency for direction and strength among CPGs. Sensitivity analyses testing the robustness were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence, excluding single recommendation sources, and stratifying by importance of recommendations.

Results

The analysis included 8 CPGs with a total of 71 reference recommendations, 68 of which had clear recommendations from 2 or more CPGs. Across CPGs, 22 recommendations (32%) were consistent in direction and strength, 18 recommendations (27%) were consistent in direction but inconsistent in strength, and 28 recommendations (41%) were inconsistent in direction. The rate of consistency was lower in secondary analyses. When insufficient evidence ratings were excluded, there was still substantial inconsistency, and a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested the inconsistency could not be attributed to any single recommendation source. Inconsistency in direction was more common for recommendations deemed to be of lower importance (11 of 20 recommendations [55%]), but 17 of 48 high-importance recommendations (35%) had inconsistency in direction.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hypertension is a common chronic condition with widespread expectations surrounding guideline-based care, yet CPGs have a high rate of inconsistency. Further investigations should determine the reasons for inconsistency, the implications for recommendation development, and the role of synthesis across recommendations for optimal guidance of clinical care.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension guideline scope — These guidelines 'are designed for adults with hypertension, i.e. aged ≥ 18 years'. The update's purpose 'was to evaluate and incorporate new evidence into the Guideline recommendations', and fundamental principles include 'to base recommendations on properly conducted studies, identified from an extensive review of the literature' and 'to give the highest priority to data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs)'.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114ZYgAP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

A recent cost‐effectiveness model of treating stage I hypertension showed a reduction in both CVD events and deaths along with significant cost savings, especially in those > 60 years old. 28 This study used the JNC 8 panel's recommended treatment targets, but did not model the cost savings or mortality benefit of treating adults > 60 years with SBP 140 to 150 mm Hg. However, there was significant cost‐savings gained for treating men and women between the ages of 45 and 60 with BP > 140/90 mm Hg. Given the projected increase in CVD events with those > 60 years of age, we believe that there is likely to be a benefit to treating mild hypertension in this group as well.

The impact of adopting the JNC 8 guidelines on a population level will lead to a significant change in those eligible for BP treatment. While an estimated 41.5 million people are above their BP goal under JNC 7, only 28 million are above goal according to the JNC 8 recommendations, based on estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative population sample. 29 This corresponds to 13.5 million adults, with the majority ≥ 60 years old, who were previously considered above goal and now no longer eligible for further treatment. An important consideration is that these 13.5 million include 37% with diabetes, 39% with CKD, and 19% with CVD. 29

The National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry confirmed that the population of patients for whom the BP goals changed in JNC 8 is also the population who are at highest risk for CVD events, with an average Framingham risk score of 8.5 ± 3.2% and 10‐year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk score of 28 ± 19%. 30 In this high‐risk group in particular, a more effective approach than the traditional target‐based BP treatment could be a risk‐based treatment model, incorporating global CVD risk scores. Support for this approach was established by the BPLTTC. 31 In their meta‐analysis of nearly 52 000 individuals, the BPLTTC showed that while BP treatment led to the same relative risk reduction across all 4 risk categories, the greatest absolute benefit by number of CVD events prevented occurred in the highest baseline CVD risk category. 31

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^116jsWmG]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Despite the fact that the 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis is the most up-to-date evidence in the literature (and seemingly does not support the JNC-8 BP goals), it is important to note certain limitations with both lines of evidence. The Cochrane meta-analysis only contained four trials (and only 2 of them had a moderate amount of CV events/mortality). Additionally, none of the included trials used EBM s such as ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) or amlodipine, both of which have been shown to reduce CV events (and mortality eg, ACE-Is) in other settings. Lastly, the Cochrane meta-analysis included trials that used antihypertensive medications that are rarely prescribed today (eg, pindolol, propranolol, reserpine, hydralazine, clonidine and chlorothiazide), limiting its generalisability.

The JNC-8 guidelines did not look at systematic reviews or meta-analyses when making their BP goal decisions, nor did they perform their own systematic review and meta-analysis. Thus, the JNC-8 guidelines are not completely comprehensive, partly explaining why their recommendations do no match the 2012 Cochrane meta-analysis.

### The impact of JNC-VI guidelines on treatment recommendations in the US population [^115XhywC]. Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Using epidemiological and clinical trial evidence, the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) updated previous guidelines to suggest that in addition to blood pressure, decisions on initial treatment should emphasize absolute cardiovascular disease risk. We estimated the impact of using cardiovascular disease risk on treatment recommendations for the US population using data from 16 527 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In the US population ≥ 20 years of age, 36% (62 million) had high-normal blood pressure or greater (systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg/ ≥ 85 mm Hg) or were taking antihypertensive medication. Of this population, 5.1% (3.2 million) were stratified into risk group A (no cardiovascular disease risk factors or prevalent cardiovascular disease), 66.3% (41.4 million) into risk group B (≥ 1 major risk factor), and 28.6% (17.9 million) into risk group C (diabetes mellitus, clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage). Also, 26% of this group (16.2 million) had high-normal blood pressure and were in risk groups A or B, a context in which vigorous lifestyle modification is recommended in the JNC-VI guidelines. Additionally, 11% (7.0 million) had high-normal blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, 130 to 139 mm Hg/85 to 89 mm Hg, respectively) or stage-1 hypertension (140 to 159 mm Hg/90 to 99 mm Hg), and at least 1 factor, placing them in risk group C, but they were not currently on antihypertensive medication. JNC-VI, but not previous JNC guidelines, specifically recommends drug therapy as initial treatment for these patients. We conclude that JNC-VI refines cardiovascular risk and enfranchises more Americans to undertake more aggressive risk reduction maneuvers.

### Potential US population impact of the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure guideline [^116ZsipS]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults provides recommendations for the definition of hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) thresholds for initiation of antihypertensive medication, and BP target goals.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prevalence of hypertension, implications of recommendations for antihypertensive medication, and prevalence of BP above the treatment goal among US adults using criteria from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline and the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).

Methods

The authors analyzed data from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 9 623). BP was measured 3 times following a standardized protocol and averaged. Results were weighted to produce US population estimates.

Results

According to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, the crude prevalence of hypertension among US adults was 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 43.6% to 47.6%) and 31.9% (95% CI: 30.1% to 33.7%), respectively, and antihypertensive medication was recommended for 36.2% (95% CI: 34.2% to 38.2%) and 34.3% (95% CI: 32.5% to 36.2%) of US adults, respectively. Nonpharmacological intervention is advised for the 9.4% of US adults with hypertension who are not recommended for antihypertensive medication according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Among US adults taking antihypertensive medication, 53.4% (95% CI: 49.9% to 56.8%) and 39.0% (95% CI: 36.4% to 41.6%) had BP above the treatment goal according to the 2017 ACC/AHA and JNC7 guidelines, respectively.

Conclusions

Compared with the JNC7 guideline, the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline results in a substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension, a small increase in the percentage of US adults recommended for antihypertensive medication, and more intensive BP lowering for many adults taking antihypertensive medication.

### Hypertension: empirical evidence and implications in 2014 [^114sh8PS]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

There are significant conflicts in the conclusions of hypertension studies that cannot be explained statistically as these studies are based on large sample sizes. The reasons for the conflicts are due to the methodological, epistemological and statistical deficiencies of the hypertension studies. These reasons must be accepted and remedied in order to improve the scientific standing of medicine.
It is uncertain if treating otherwise healthy mild hypertensive patients with antihypertensive therapy will reduce morbidity and mortality.
The current evidence in the literature does not support the blood pressure goals set by the JNC-8 guidelines.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^114fmH37]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background and evidence informing BP targets — trial data and guideline development: Clinical trials indicate that lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events among high–cardiovascular-risk adults and may reduce mortality. When the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) work group report was released in 2014, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) was not yet completed and evaluated adults with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in the absence of diabetes mellitus (DM). SPRINT was stopped early for efficacy in 2015 after an interim analysis showed a significantly lower risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality with intensive SBP lowering. In 2017, ACC/AHA issued a new clinical practice guideline incorporating data from trials such as SPRINT and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) 3 trial and describing best practices for BP measurement along with algorithms for hypertension goals based on comorbid conditions and age.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^112M6EZD]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The health policy implications of guideline recommendations for the diagnosis and management of hypertension have been frequently assessed using nationally representative data in the US. These include studies focusing on the impact of the JNC-7 guidelines, JNC-8, and the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. However, these analyses do not assess the international impact of such guideline recommendations, which is critical given their wide adoption. One such analysis from the US assessed the population impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines using NHANES data for the years 2011–14 and primarily compared them with the JNC-7 guidelines as the current standard. In our study, we used more contemporary US data (NHANES 2013–16). To allow for a direct comparison of the population impact of these guidelines in the US and China, we restricted this study to the assessment of adults aged 45 to 75 years, the age group captured in data from China. In addition, to ensure comparability of estimates, we defined the study populations for both the US and China in a similar manner. Finally, in contrast to the other study from NHANES, we used the JNC-8 guidelines as the current standard. This is because although the JNC-8 guidelines represented a period of transition from the administrative process used in previous guideline iterations and were not released by the National Institutes of Health directly, they have been published and are widely cited. Furthermore, whereas modest differences exist in national estimates between the two studies, these differences are due to our focus on adults in the 45–75 year age group compared with estimates that represent all US adults (> 18 years of age) in the other study. Finally, since the publication of the preprint of this study, the impact of the prevalence of hypertension based on these guidelines has been assessed in several countries. However, ours is the first assessment of nationally representative data from China and is the only head-to-head assessment of the impact of these guidelines in comparable data from two vastly different health systems.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^1128ELua]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

Firstly, we calculated the average systolic and diastolic blood pressures based on all available readings for each patient. Secondly, we assessed the prevalence of hypertension, defined as the number of people who would have a diagnosis of hypertension on the basis of current guidelines for both study populations. We use the 2014 evidence based guidelines for the management of high blood pressure in adults developed by the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8). We used JNC-8 as the current standard for both the US and China to allow for a comparative assessment of the impact of the new guidelines in both countries. The most recent Chinese hypertension guidelines from 2010 are substantively similar to the recommendations from JNC-8, so the population assessments in this study likely capture current clinical practice in China. These guidelines defined hypertension as an average systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, and/or treatment with an antihypertensive agent. We then identified people with hypertension on the basis of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. This included all adults who met a definition based on the previous JNC-8 guidelines, but additionally included all adults with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg.

Figure 1.
Eighth Joint National Committee evidence‐based algorithm for the treatment of hypertension. Reproduced with permission from: James et al. ACEI indicates angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; SBP, systolic blood pressure.

The second change is a target of < 140 over 90 mm Hg (instead of < 130 over 80 mm Hg) in patients with DM or chronic kidney disease. This change was based on multiple studies, including the ACtion to COntrol Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) BP trial, which demonstrated no significant benefit in the primary composite end point among patients treated to a SBP goal < 120 mm Hg compared with < 140 mm Hg, despite significant reductions in stroke. –

Patients diagnosed with hypertension should be encouraged to implement lifestyle changes including regular exercise, dietary sodium restriction, moderation of alcohol consumption, and weight loss, regardless of whether pharmacotherapy is needed. When initiating medical therapy, patients without chronic kidney disease can be started on an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker, a thiazide diuretic, or a calcium channel blocker. Alternatives for nonblack patients and those with chronic kidney disease include an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker; however, the combined use of an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin receptor blocker should be avoided.

Most patients will require at least 2 medications to adequately control their BP. The JNC 8 committee recommends 3 strategies to help achieve BP goals: (1) maximize the dose of the initial medication, (2) add a second medication before reaching the maximal dose of the initial medication, or (3) simultaneously start 2 antihypertensive medications from different classes. Because it is important to achieve and maintain the BP goal, patients should be evaluated regularly, with adjustment and addition of medications as needed. If patients remain hypertensive despite adequate treatment with 3 medications or if there is a contraindication to treatment with any of the recommended first‐line antihypertensive agents, then medications from other classes can be used (eg, beta blocker or aldosterone antagonist) or the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist.

Because the JNC 8 recommendations do not address prehypertension, resistant hypertension, or secondary hypertension, it is reasonable to follow the prior JNC 7 guidelines or those from other international organizations.–

### Clinical diagnosis and management of hypertension compared with the Joint National Committee 8 panelists' recommendations [^117QEfHc]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The panelists of the Joint National Committee recently published new recommendations for the management of hypertension. Our study aims to evaluate how current practice compares.

Hypothesis

Current practice likely deviates from the recent JNC 8 panelists' recommendations.

Methods

A survey was sent to cardiology providers at 3 academic medical centers: Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona; and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. Providers were asked to select which blood-pressure goal would be deemed appropriate in various cases based on individual practice in both the maintenance of patients already on therapy as well as threshold of when to initiate therapy. Comparisons with current recommendations were made, as well as geographic location and level of experience.

Results

A total of 251 survey requests were sent (May 2014), and 77 responses (30.7%) were received. Cardiologists tended not to practice according to the new guidelines, with most variation seen in patients age > 60 years without comorbidities on active treatment. Providers' selection of initial pharmacologic agents in non-African American patients, African American patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus reflected congruency with guidelines.

Conclusions

Our study found that clinical practice does not correlate well with the new blood-pressure goal recommendations published by the Joint National Committee 8 panelists, particularly in patients age > 60 years. Practitioners are likely to follow the recommendations in regard to pharmacologic management.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance for hypertension management has recently been updated. This review article summaries the main recommendations in NICE guidelines, and compares them with the American and European guidelines. NICE and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommend diagnosing hypertension at a higher level than the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). NICE treats to less stringent targets than both the ACC/AHA and the ESC, while using similar, although non-combination pill based, treatment regimens.

### Hypertension: are current guidelines inclusive of sex and gender? [^116bRWR5]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Background: Hypertension (HTN) accounts for one in five deaths of American women. Major societies worldwide aim to make evidence-based recommendations for HTN management. Sex- or gender-based differences exist in epidemiology and management of HTN; in this study, we aimed to assess sex- and gender-based language in major society guidelines. Materials and Methods: We reviewed HTN guidelines from four societies: the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8). We quantified the sex- and gender-based medicine (SGBM) content by word count in each guideline as well as identified the gender of guideline authors. Results: Two of the four HTN guidelines (ACC, ESC) included SGBM content. Of these two guidelines, there were variations in the quantity and depth of content coverage. Pregnancy had the highest word count found in both guidelines (422 words in ACC and 1,523 words in ESC), which represented 2.45% and 3.04% of the total words in each guideline, respectively. There was minimal coverage, if any, of any other life periods. The number of women authors did not impact the SGBM content within a given guideline. Conclusions: Current HTN management guidelines do not provide optimal guidance on sex- and gender-based differences. Inclusion of sex, gender identity, hormone therapy, pregnancy and lactation status, menopause, and advanced age in future research will be critical to bridge the current evidence gap. Guideline writing committees should include diverse perspectives, including cisgender and transgender persons from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds.

### Is 2015 the primetime year for prehypertension? Prehypertension: a cardiovascular risk factor or simply a risk marker? [^114MgVqe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

So, What are the Clinical Implications of This Recent Meta‐Analysis?

Should a prehypertensive subject be monitored more closely? The answer is yes. It is reasonable to monitor BP more closely in prehypertensive subjects since a significant proportion of them will later develop hypertension,–

Should a prehypertensive subject start any specific treatment? The answer is yes: lifestyle changes generally recommended in the overall populationshould be further emphasized in these subjects, in our opinion. The JNC 7 guideline recommendation for lifestyle changes in prehypertension is supported by the recent meta‐analysis since prehypertension is a marker for an increased CHD risk, especially among Westerners. However, no pharmacological treatment is currently recommended by any medical society in the general population with prehypertension,– a recommendation that is supported by our conclusion that prehypertension — albeit a CHD risk marker — has not been proven to be a causal CHD risk factor requiring specific treatment per se. Tempting as it might be to initiate pharmacologic therapy in prehypertensive subjects, the published clinical trials have cast doubt to any long‐term benefit from a short‐term pharmacologic intervention. – Overall, the risk‐benefit ratio and the value of such treatment in this subpopulation remain controversial.

Should we wait for BP to exceed the arbitrary cutoff of 140/90 mm Hg to start pharmacologic treatment to reduce CV risk? The answer is yes. The JNC 8 panelrecommends starting antihypertensive drug therapy if BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg in patients ≤ 60 years and if BP is ≥ 150/90 mm Hg in patients > 60 years.

So, is 2015 the primetime year for prehypertension? The answer is yes. We are READY and SET but we do not have the evidence to GO with no proven therapy in sight for prehypertension. We should await considerably more research, particularly randomized controlled interventional clinical trials in prehypertensive subjects before recommending anything beyond BP monitoring and therapeutic lifestyle change as was initially recommended in JNC 7 over 12 years ago.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^113Lycfb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^111KZ8Ny]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Eligibility for antihypertensive treatment: United States

In the US, of the 55.3 million people with hypertension according to JNC-8 criteria, 82.7% (80.1% to 85.1%) were receiving one or more antihypertensive drugs, whereas 14.6% (12.7% to 16.3%), or 8.1 (6.5 to 9.7) million people, were eligible for treatment but not receiving it. Furthermore, 1.5 (1.2 to 2.1) million people would be classified as hypertensive and would qualify for lifestyle modifications alone according to JNC-8. Of the 70.1 million classified as having hypertension according to the ACC/AHA guidelines, only 65.3% (62.6% to 67.9%) were receiving antihypertensive treatment, suggesting a recommendation to start treatment in 22.3% (20.9% to 23.5%) or 15.6 (13.6 to 17.7) million people with hypertension (an additional 7.5 (6.5 to 8.5) million people). Notably, under the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, the remaining 12.4% (8.6% to 16.5%) or 8.7 (6.0 to 11.5) million US adults in the 45–75 year age group would have hypertension but not be candidates for antihypertensive treatment because they had a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg and did not have any of the high risk conditions, such as age 65 years or over, known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a 10 year predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease of 10% or more, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes (table 1). Moreover, of those receiving antihypertensive treatment, 24.0% (21.5% to 26.6%) were above the treatment targets for JNC-8 and 54.4% (50.7% to 58.1%) were above the treatment targets based on the ACC/AHA criteria. Therefore, an additional 13.9 (12.2 to 15.6) million people would be candidates for intensification of treatment (table 1). The rates of non-treatment and under-treatment of hypertension among subgroups of age and sex are shown in supplementary figures B and C.

Eligibility for antihypertensive treatment: China

In China, on the basis of JNC-8 blood pressure targets, 46.8% (43.4% to 50.3%) of the 184.2 (171.6 to 196.8) million people with hypertension were receiving one or more antihypertensive drugs. Among the 266.9 (252.9 to 280.8) million classified as having hypertension according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, 32.3% (30.0% to 34.7%) were receiving antihypertensive treatment. The use of JNC-8 and 2017 ACC/AHA criteria to define people eligible for treatment would recommend that treatment be started in 74.5 (64.1 to 84.8) million and 129.8 (118.7 to 140.9) million patients (an additional 55.3 million), respectively. Those recommended for treatment on the basis of the new guidelines more frequently were women and had a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (table 2). Furthermore, 23.4 (12.1 to 35.1) million people according to JNC-8 and 51.0 (40.3 to 61.60) million people according to the ACC/AHA guidelines would be classified as having hypertension and would qualify for lifestyle modifications alone. This group includes people with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg, without any of the high risk conditions, such as age 65 years or over, known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a 10 year predicted risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease of at least 10%, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes.

Finally, of those receiving antihypertensive treatment in China in from 2011 to 2012, 41.4% (37.7% to 45.1%) were above the treatment targets for JNC-8 and 76.2% (73.3% to 79.0%) were above the treatment targets based on the ACC/AHA criteria. Therefore, an additional 30 (24.3 to 35.7) million people would be candidates for intensification of treatment, on the basis of the change in the guidelines. Table 2 shows the characteristics of people who were candidates for treatment intensification according to both guidelines. The rates of non-treatment and under-treatment of hypertension among subgroups of age and sex are shown in supplementary figures B and C.

### Recommendations on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension: a report from the European association of cardiovascular imaging (EACVI) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [^116LsTGF]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Pre-hypertension — guideline recommendations and potential role for echocardiography: In the category of pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressure 130–140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 80–90 mmHg), JNC 7 recommends intense lifestyle modification in such patients, and clinicians may obtain echocardiography to evaluate the presence of LV hypertrophy in such patients with pre-hypertension, particularly where there is a strong family history of hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Current guidance emphasizes blood pressure control rather than imaging-based risk stratification, as JNC 7 recommendations do not risk stratify patients for treatment on the basis of target organ damage and current guidelines recommend the use of combination treatment to get blood pressure to goal, thus blood pressure remains the primary target of therapy. Evidence gaps remain: no studies have examined whether a patient's knowledge of echocardiography demonstrating LVH will improve adherence to lifestyle modifications or pharmacological treatment, and NICE notes uncertainty about how to assess the impact of blood pressure treatment in people aged < 40 years with grade 1 hypertension and no overt target organ damage or CVD.

Additional Insights: CKD

BP targets in CKD patients were also increased from < 130/80 to < 140/90 mm Hg between the JNC 7 and JNC 8 guidelines. While the JNC 8 panel did not incorporate proteinuria as an outcome of interest, the ASH/ISH, the ESH/ESC, and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group all make a distinction between CKD patients based on proteinuria status, with a lower BP goal of < 130/80 to 90 mm Hg for those with proteinuria detectable on urinanalysis. 12, 14, 22

The International Society on Hypertension in Blacks also recommends a target of < 130/80 mm Hg for black adults with CKD. The evidence for these recommendations is based on 3 trials — the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, and the Blood‐pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non‐diabetic Chronic Renal Disease (REIN‐2) study. None of these trials showed a difference in kidney or CVD outcomes between those with lower versus higher BP goals. 40, 41, 42

AASK (N = 1094) evaluated mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals, targeting 102 to 107 mm Hg in the usual‐BP group versus ≤ 92 mm Hg in the lower‐BP group. While the lower‐BP group achieved an average BP of 128/78 mm Hg, compared with 141/85 mm Hg in the other group, there was no significant change in the rate of glomerular filtration rate decline, end‐stage renal disease, or death. There was, however, a decrease in proteinuria in the strict treatment group at 6 months (17% decrease versus 7% increase), and this effect persisted throughout the length of the study. 41 MDRD (N = 1585) used the same MAP targets, and in participants with at least 1 g/d of proteinuria, the lower BP target group had a slower rate of glomerular filtration rate decline. 42

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^114HskhJ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Guideline recommendations regarding β-blocker use for first-line treatment of high blood pressure (BP) have changed significantly over the past 3 decades. In the 1980s and 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials demonstrated their efficacy to prevent adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, leading to first-line endorsement alongside thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics (hereafter, thiazides) in the Sixth and Seventh Reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC6 and JNC7, respectively). This changed in 2014 with the Eighth JNC Report (JNC8) recommending β-blockers as first-line only for patients with "compelling indications" supported by strong evidence of benefit. In the absence of such compelling indications, β-blockers were relegated to second-line therapy after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARB), thiazides, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). This shift was based on trials and meta-analyses suggesting inferior stroke and mortality as well as higher discontinuation rates from adverse effects. Similar recommendations appeared in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) BP guidelines and were reinforced in the 2024 AHA/American Stroke Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke. In contrast, the 2018 and 2023 updates of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines supported first-line β-blocker use for uncomplicated hypertension, citing their efficacy compared with placebo in lowering BP and preventing CVD.

The quality of hypertension care for US veterans has been a major focus of the Veterans Health Administration (VA), the largest integrated health care system in the US. The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in 2004, 2014, and 2020 conformed with the recommendations outlined in the JNC7, JNC8, and 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. However, in our recent analyses, we identified that β-blockers are prescribed as first-line hypertension treatment in approximately 20% of veterans who do not have a compelling indication, although this trend decreased over the 20-year study. To improve evidence-based prescribing of β-blockers for treatment of high BP, we sought to investigate the clinical factors associated with β-blocker use in a cohort of veterans initiating treatment for high BP over 23 years.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115aJoE7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

One trial that supports the first‐line status of thiazides, CCBs, and ACEIs is the Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT). This trial randomized 33 357 people aged ≥ 55 years with hypertension and ≥ 1 other CVD risk factor to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril. 47 All‐cause mortality was not different between the groups, and while SBP was higher in the amlodipine and lisinopril groups compared with chlorthalidone, the difference was statistically but not clinically significant at 0.8 to 2 mm Hg (P < 0.05). However, there were some notable differences in secondary outcomes, like higher rates of HF in the amlodipine (10.2%) versus chlorthalidone group (7.7%). However, because the primary outcome and other secondary outcomes were comparable, this was not considered by JNC 8 as a strong enough reason to recommend thiazide diuretics as the sole initial antihypertensive class.

ASH/ISH and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence make a distinction for those aged < 55 to 60 years to favor an ACEI or ARB, while those aged ≥ 55 to 60 years should start with a thiazide or CCB. 14, 23 β‐Blockers are included as first line for adults aged < 60 years in the Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines and for adults aged < 80 years in ESH/ESC. 11, 12 While combination therapy with β‐blockers can be very effective, the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrated a lower rate of death, MI, or stroke in their losartan group compared with the atenolol group, a difference mainly driven by stroke reduction. 48 Given this finding and otherwise insufficient evidence to support β‐blockers as first‐line agents, we agree with the JNC 8 committee.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^112Ri7wn]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

a If measured using a nonautomated office blood pressure device; if using an automated office blood pressure device, systolic blood pressure greater than 135 mm Hg is considered high.

b The panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee focused on management, not reaffirming or redefining thresholds; therefore, thresholds from JNC7 were used.

c Not shown is isolated systolic hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg.

Primary Analysis

Three reference recommendations were addressed clearly by only 1 CPG, so 68 reference recommendations were evaluated for our primary analysis. Considering all 8 CPGs, we found consistency in both direction and strength for 22 reference recommendations (32%) (Table 3; eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement). Recommendation sources consistently provided strong recommendations concerning some of the methods of measuring blood pressure (eg, the use of appropriate cuff size, patient position, and arm at heart level), having more than 1 measurement prior to diagnosing hypertension, some lifestyle changes for cardiovascular risk reduction, the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers in patients with heart failure, and the use of β-blockers in patients with recent myocardial infarction.

Table 3.
Consistency in Direction and Direction and Strength Across Clinical Practice Guidelines

We found another 18 reference recommendations (26%) to be consistent in direction but inconsistent in strength (Table 3; eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement). For example, sources varied in the strength of recommendation regarding the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for diagnosis of hypertension, inclusion of serum uric acid test results in the initial evaluation of hypertension, and the use of specific medications as options for first-line pharmacotherapy in patients without comorbidities and in patients with specific comorbidities.

We found consistency in direction regardless of strength for 40 reference recommendations (59%) (Table 3; eTable 4 and eTable 5 in the Supplement). This gives a 41% (28/68) rate of inconsistency in direction. These included such recommendations as specific cutoffs for the diagnosis of hypertension, blood pressure treatment goals, and the use of specific medications as options or preferred options for first-line pharmacotherapy in patients without comorbidities and in patients with specific comorbidities.

### Cardiovascular guidelines: separate career may help attenuate controversy [^111RjqpW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

"Patients and the public benefit when physicians and researchers collaborate with pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotechnology companies to develop products that benefit individual and public health. At the same time, concerns are growing that wide-ranging financial ties to industry may unduly influence professional judgments involving the primary interests and goals of medicine. Such conflicts of interest threaten the integrity of scientific investigations, the objectivity of professional education, the quality of patient care, and the public's trust in medicine".

On 13 November 2013, from the columns of the New York Times, Abramson and Redberg exhorted healthy Americans to focus on the real factors that undeniably reduce the risk of heart disease (healthy diets, exercise, avoiding smoking) and not on statin prevention, as suggested by the new cholesterol guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA). The new, long-awaited and much anticipated, hypertension guidelines from the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) are even criticized by members of the very panel that developed them. The validity of the 2013-American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) algorithm and consensus statement on diabetes has fiercely been questioned. Are all these concerns intellectually and scientifically justified, or are they related to the evidence that guidelines per se generate controversy, given the complexity of the task and the limitations of available evidence?

### Nationwide impact of the 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association blood pressure guidelines on stroke survivors [^113jrYnA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is strongly associated with stroke. 1, 2 It also carries a high mortality among patients with stroke and arguably has a stronger association with stroke than any other symptomatic vascular disease entity. 2, 3 It is fortunately amenable to interventions including pharmacological treatments. Antihypertensive drugs are among the most prescribed medications in the United States. 4 It is purported that greater blood pressure (BP) awareness and treatment has significantly contributed to the decline in stroke mortality in the United States over the past decades. 2 Indeed, a meta‐analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials has shown a nearly 30% reduction in the risk of stroke recurrence with BP treatment. 5 In the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) guidelines, hypertension was defined for systolic BP (SBP) ≥ 140 or diastolic BP (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and pharmacological treatment in stroke survivors was recommended for SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg. 6 However, epidemiological data have demonstrated that the risk of stroke begins with levels of BP lower than these values. 7 In light of these data, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 8 guidelines for prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of hypertension have lowered the cutoff for BP definition of hypertension in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events, including patients experiencing stroke. In the new guidelines, a SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg defines hypertension in stroke survivors. The new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines also recommend initiating antihypertensive treatments and targeting SBP/DBP to < 130/80 mm Hg for stroke survivors. It is anticipated that these changes will affect BP distribution among stroke survivors, with significant policy and economic implications. In this analysis, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2014, we estimated the percentage and number of US adult stroke survivors according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines and the JNC7 guidelines. Moreover, we estimated the percentage and number of stroke survivors with hypertension recommended for pharmacological treatment on the basis of the 2017 ACC/AHA versus the JNC7 guidelines. We also estimated the percentage and number of US adult stroke survivors taking antihypertensive medication with BP above target, according to 2017 ACC/AHA and the JNC7 guidelines. Finally, we extrapolated the potential impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines on mortality among stroke survivors.

### National trends in antihypertensive treatment among older adults by race and presence of comorbidity, 2008 to 2017 [^112tp8FM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2014, hypertension guidelines for older adults endorsed increased use of fixed-dose combinations, prioritized thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for Black patients, and no longer recommend beta-blockers as first-line therapy.

Objective

To evaluate older adults' antihypertensive use following guideline changes.

Design

Time series analysis.

Patients

Twenty percent national sample of Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged 66 years and older with hypertension.

Intervention

Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) guidelines MAIN MEASURES: Quarterly trends in prevalent and initial antihypertensive use were examined before (2008 to 2013) and after (2014 to 2017) JNC8. Analyses were conducted among all beneficiaries with hypertension, beneficiaries without chronic conditions that might influence antihypertensive selection (hypertension-only cohort), and among Black patients, given race-based guideline recommendations.

Key Results

The number of beneficiaries with hypertension increased from 1,978,494 in 2008 to 2,809,680 in 2017, the proportions using antihypertensives increased from 80.3 to 81.2%, and the proportion using multiple classes and fixed-dose combinations declined (60.8 to 58.1% and 20.7 to 15.1%, respectively, all P < .01). Prior to JNC8, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and CCBs was increasing. Use of CCBs as initial therapy increased more rapidly following JNC8 (relative change in quarterly trend 0.15% [95% CI, 0.13–0.18%), especially among Black beneficiaries (relative change 0.44% [95% CI, 0.21–0.68%]). Contrary to guidelines, the use of thiazides and combinations as initial therapy consistently decreased in the hypertension-only cohort (13.8 to 8.3% and 25.1 to 15.7% respectively). By 2017, 65.9% of Black patients in the hypertension-only cohort were initiated on recommended first-line or combination therapy compared to 80.3% of non-Black patients.

Conclusions

Many older adults, particularly Black patients, continue to be initiated on antihypertensive classes not recommended as first-line, indicating opportunities to improve the effectiveness and equity of hypertension care and potentially reduce antihypertensive regimen complexity.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^113zPRK6]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results

Prevalence of hypertension: United States

In NHANES, a nationally representative dataset from the US, we found 2973 participants, representing 55.3 (95% confidence interval 51.1 to 59.5) million people nationally, or 49.7% (47.5% to 52.0%) of the population, who were labeled with the diagnosis of hypertension on the basis of the JNC-8 guidelines. An additional 685 people, representing 14.8 (12.9 to 16.7) million, or 13.3% (11.8% to 14.8%) of the population, would be classified as having hypertension with the use of blood pressure thresholds suggested in the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. Therefore, 70.1 (64.9 to 75.3) million adults aged between 45 and 75 years would be classified as having hypertension on the basis of the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, representing a 26.8% (23.2% to 30.9%) relative increase. The proportion of the US adult population aged between 45 and 75 years classified as hypertensive would increase from 49.7% (47.5% to 52.0%) based on the JNC-8 guidelines to 63.0% (60.6% to 65.4%) based on the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. The adoption of the new guidelines would be associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension across subgroups of sex and age (supplementary figure A). Compared with people labeled with a diagnosis of hypertension according to JNC-8 criteria, those newly labeled as hypertensive according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines were younger (mean age 60 v 56 years) and less frequently were of black ethnicity (14.1% v 9.9%) or had diabetes (26.7% v 9.6%), chronic kidney disease (11.3% v 4.3%), or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (15.9% v 3.7%) (P < 0.01 for all). They also had a lower 10 year predicted risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease among those without pre-existing disease (P < 0.01) (table 1).

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^116AyEQJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the use of antihypertensives changed in 2014 and 2017. To understand the effect of these guidelines, we examined trends in antihypertensive prescriptions in the United States from 2010 to 2019 using a repeated cross‐sectional design.

Methods and Results

Using electronic health records from 15 health care institutions for adults (20–85 years old) who had ≥ 1 antihypertensive prescription, we assessed whether (1) prescriptions of beta blockers decreased after the 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) report discouraged use for first‐line treatment, (2) prescriptions for calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics increased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report encouraged use as first‐line therapy, and (3) prescriptions for dual therapy and fixed‐dose combination among patients with blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg increased after recommendations in the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study included 1 074 314 patients with 2 133 158 prescription episodes. After publication of the JNC 8 report, prescriptions for beta blockers decreased (3% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014), and calcium channel blockers increased among Black patients (20% higher in 2015–2017 and 41% higher in 2018–2019, compared to 2010–2014), in accordance with guideline recommendations. However, contrary to guidelines, dual therapy and fixed‐dose combination decreased after publication of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines (9% and 11% decrease in 2018–2019 for dual therapy and fixed‐dose combination, respectively, compared to 2015–2017), and thiazide diuretics decreased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report (6% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014).

Conclusions

Adherence to guidelines on prescribing antihypertensive medication was inconsistent, presenting an opportunity for interventions to achieve better blood pressure control in the US population.

Using electronic health records from 15 health care institutions for adults (20–85years old) who had ≥ 1 antihypertensive prescription, we assessed whether (1) prescriptions of beta blockers decreased after the 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) report discouraged use for first-line treatment, (2) prescriptions for calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics increased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report encouraged use as first-line therapy, and (3) prescriptions for dual therapy and fixed-dose combination among patients with blood pressure ≥ 140/90mmHg increased after recommendations in the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study included 1074314 patients with 2133158 prescription episodes. After publication of the JNC 8 report, prescriptions for beta blockers decreased (3% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014), and calcium channel blockers increased among Black patients (20% higher in 2015–2017 and 41% higher in 2018–2019, compared to 2010–2014), in accordance with guideline recommendations. However, contrary to guidelines, dual therapy and fixed-dose combination decreased after publication of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines (9% and 11% decrease in 2018–2019 for dual therapy and fixed-dose combination, respectively, compared to 2015–2017), and thiazide diuretics decreased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report (6% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014).

Conclusions

Adherence to guidelines on prescribing antihypertensive medication was inconsistent, presenting an opportunity for interventions to achieve better blood pressure control in the US population.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^1116LAct]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — hypertension definitions and risk: Because the studies cited were published before JNC 7, hypertension generally was defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg, whereas the JNC 7 defines hypertension in those with diabetes or CKD as blood pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg. A large number of epidemiological studies and controlled trials have defined hypertension as a risk factor for progression of DKD, and antihypertensive treatment reduces this risk.

Supine hypertension

Defining supine hypertension in patients with nOH

According to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) hypertension guidelines, essential hypertension is a blood pressure consistently ≥ 140/90 mmHg. Supine hypertension in nOH patients is arbitrarily defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg while in the supine position. General treatment guidelines recommend intervention for hypertension, but supine hypertension associated with nOH requires additional considerations. In patients with autonomic failure causing nOH, supine hypertension is common and part of the underlying disease process since these patients lack the normal blood pressure buffering mechanisms that offset hypertension. In addition, frequent periods of OH may lead to chronic activation of the renin–angiotensin system.

A supine systolic blood pressure of up to 160 mmHg should be monitored but does not generally warrant treatment, especially if the symptoms of nOH have improved. The long-term risks associated with supine hypertension need to be balanced with the short-term risks of OH. Expert recommendations for the management of supine hypertension in the setting of nOH suggest that supine hypertension requires intervention if systolic blood pressure exceeds the range of 160–180 mmHg. However, it should be noted that individuals with the largest drops in blood pressure upon standing (> 80 mmHg drop) will require significantly higher supine blood pressures in order to achieve a standing position, and therefore permissive supine hypertension may need to be tolerated.

Measuring supine hypertension in patients with nOH

The first step in evaluating supine hypertension in the patient with nOH is obtaining a series of blood pressure measurements. Home supine and standing blood pressures should be obtained. The supine assessment should be in the morning (before arising) and at bedtime with the patient in their normal sleeping position and with the head of the bed raised. If necessary, 24-h blood pressure monitoring may be warranted in some patients. Blood pressure should be monitored for a week or more to establish a pattern of typical blood pressure. Once a baseline has been established and treatment initiated for nOH, regular blood pressure monitoring for a period of 2 weeks following treatment initiation is crucial to gauge the impact of treatment on supine hypertension.

### Potential impact of 2017 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association hypertension guideline on contemporary practice: a cross-sectional analysis from NCDR PINNACLE registry [^111CReQa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background Clinical implications of change in the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline on the diagnosis and management of hypertension, compared with recommendations by 2014 expert panel and Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), are not known. Methods and Results Using data from the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) Registry (January 2013-Decemver 2016), we compared the proportion and clinical characteristics of patients seen in cardiology practices diagnosed with hypertension, recommended antihypertensive treatment, and achieving blood pressure (BP) goals per each guideline document. In addition, we evaluated the proportion of patients at the level of practices meeting BP targets defined by each guideline. Of 6 042 630 patients evaluated, 5 027 961 (83.2%) were diagnosed with hypertension per the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, compared with 4 521 272 (74.8%) per the 2014 panel and 4 545 976 (75.2%) per JNC7. The largest increase in hypertension prevalence was seen in younger ages, women, and those with lower cardiovascular risk. Antihypertensive medication was recommended to 70.6% of patients per the ACC/AHA guideline compared with 61.8% and 65.9% per the 2014 panel and JNC7, respectively. Among those on antihypertensive agents, 41.2% achieved BP targets per the ACC/AHA guideline, compared with 79.4% per the 2014 panel and 64.3% per JNC7. Lower proportions of women, non-White (Black and "other") races, and those at higher cardiovascular risk achieved BP goals. Median practice-level proportion of patients meeting BP targets per the 2014 panel but not the ACC/AHA guideline was 37.8% (interquartile range, 34.8%-40.7%) and per JNC7 but not the ACC/AHA guideline was 22.9% (interquartile range, 19.8%-25.9%). Conclusions Following publication of the 2017 guideline, significantly more people, particularly younger people and those with lower cardiovascular risk, will be diagnosed with hypertension and need antihypertensive treatment compared with previous recommendations. Significant practice-level variation in BP control also exists. Efforts are needed to improve guideline-concordant hypertension management in an effort to improve outcomes.

### Impact of 2017 ACC / AHA guidelines on prevalence of hypertension and eligibility for antihypertensive treatment in United States and China: nationally representative cross sectional study [^114HvBeK]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Next, we assessed the adults who qualified for treatment with one or more antihypertensive agents on the basis of the current guidelines and the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines but were not receiving treatment ("non-treatment"). This included all patients with a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher in both guidelines. In addition, in the ACA/AHA guidelines, those with a systolic blood pressure of 130–139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80–89 mm Hg were also candidates for treatment if they were in one or more high risk group: age 65 years or above, a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (defined as history of myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, or reported coronary heart disease), chronic kidney disease (based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate of < 60 mL/kg/h calculated using serum creatinine and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation), diabetes (defined as hemoglobin A 1c > 6.5% or self reported history of diabetes), or an expected 10 year risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease of 10% or greater (defined using the pooled cohort equations). Finally, we assessed the number of patients who would be considered "under-treated", on the basis of being above the treatment targets defined in the older JNC-8 guidelines and the recent guidelines. In JNC-8, treatment thresholds for hypertension were set at below 150/90 mm Hg for adults aged 60 years or above without diabetes or chronic kidney disease and below 140/90 mm Hg for all others. In the ACC/AHA guidelines, treatment targets were set at 130/80 mm Hg for all patients. We used survey analyses with patient level weights to obtain national estimates for both the US and China.

All statistical tests were two sided, and the level of significance was set at an α of 0.05. The study was reported in accordance with the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations, and the corresponding checklist is included in the online supplement.

Patient involvement

No patients were involved in the development of the research question or the outcome measures, or in developing plans for the design and implementation of the study. The data are de-identified and, therefore, cannot be shared with the study participants directly.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^111FQ8Fb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The VALISH (Valsartan in Elderly Isolated Systolic Hypertension) trial examined a slightly older hypertensive patient population (N = 3260), with mean age of 76 years, to a strict (< 140 mm Hg) or moderate (140 to < 150 mm Hg) SBP control strategy with valsartan as the first‐line drug. There was a nonsignificant trend toward reduction of the primary outcome of composite CVD and renal disease with the intensive treatment strategy (10.6 versus 12.0 per 1000 patient‐y; P = 0.38) at 3 years of follow‐up.

An important consideration is that VALISH was significantly underpowered, with substantially fewer primary end point events than predicted. While VALISH was conducted in Japan, most guidelines for the elderly, African Americans, or Europeans would suggest that angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs) are second line to a diuretic or CCB for controlling BP. 12, 14, 15 In both of these trials, the treatment strategies were well tolerated with few adverse events.

One trial not included in the JNC 8 analysis was FEVER (Felodipine Event Reduction), which enrolled 9800 Chinese patients aged 50 to 79 years with hypertension and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor for a comparison of diuretic monotherapy versus diuretic plus CCB. Of note, this patient population had a higher rate of prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), suggesting higher baseline risk for CVD; that is despite the fact that other baseline characteristics such as diabetes, previous MI, and incidence of cardiovascular events were in a similar range to those of other large studies. 16 Unlike JATOS, FEVER did not meet the JNC 8 committee's criteria for inclusion in their deliberations. 1

While the trials included in JNC 8 evaluated different BP goals, FEVER did not have specific BP targets but used 2 different treatment strategies that were clearly designed to have more intensive BP control (treatment arm) versus less‐intensive BP control (placebo arm). The exclusion of high‐quality randomized evidence evaluating different BP treatment strategies and the limited focus solely on trials with prespecified BP targets are significant limitations of JNC 8 that likely will be remedied by the next AHA/ACC committee.

Background

Clinical implications of change in the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline on the diagnosis and management of hypertension, compared with recommendations by 2014 expert panel and Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), are not known.

Conclusions

Following publication of the 2017 guideline, significantly more people, particularly younger people and those with lower cardiovascular risk, will be diagnosed with hypertension and need antihypertensive treatment compared with previous recommendations.

### A practical approach to hypertension management in diabetes [^1126uR3g]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Summary of the various targets given by different societies for the management of hypertension in diabetes

ACEI angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ARB angiotensin receptor blocker

a Begin treatment if BP > 140/90 mmHg

b < 140/90 mmHg in patients 70–80 years old, < 150/90 mmHg in patients over 80 years old

c Systolic BP (SBP) < 130 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) < 80 mmHg may be appropriate for certain individuals with diabetes, such as younger patients, those with albuminuria, and/or those with hypertension and one or more additional atherosclerotic CV disease risk factors if they can be achieved without undue treatment burden

Treatment of hypertension, whether uncomplicated or complicated, with presence of albuminuria and advancing age must be tailored to real-world requirements. For albuminuria patients, targets may be stricter. Masked hypertension is also quite common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Resistant hypertension may also be present in diabetes. The achievement of the individualized BP goal should guide the antihypertensive medication titration, as stopping medications after the goal is reached may lead to combined micro- and macrovascular complications.

Tight targets of systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 120 mmHg in 9361 patients aged at least 50 years old with high risk for CV events but without diabetes and with an SBP of at least 130 mmHg have shown benefits in SPRINT. On the other hand, in the ACCORD BP trial, 4733 patients with type 2 diabetes, average age 62 years, randomly assigned to intensive therapy, targeting an SBP less than 120 mmHg, or standard therapy, targeting an SBP less than 140 mmHg, significantly reduced only stroke but not mortality or CV outcomes. The fact that treatment of hypertension helps patients with diabetes more than those who do not have diabetes in various trials, tempts us to use SPRINT data in patients with diabetes. One recent (2016) systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that reducing SBP to less than 140 mmHg may be harmful in patients with diabetes. Relying on the ACCORD-BP trial, the JNC-8 gave recommendations for less than 140/90, which was also accepted by others like ASH, AHA, and ADA.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^115ZRxpK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend the use of dual therapy, either with 2 different subclasses of antihypertensive agents, given as separate medications, or as an FDC medication for patients with stage 2 hypertension (JNC 8 report defines as ≥ 160/100 mm Hg; 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines define as ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) or whose baseline BP was > 20/10 mm Hg above the BP target. However, our analysis revealed a declining trend in the use of FDC, which is not consistent with the guidelines. FDC have been advocated as a beneficial choice for BP treatment, as they can reduce the pill burden, enhance patient uptake and adherence, achieve adequate BP control, and lower rates of adverse events. However, contrary to the recommendation, and in accordance with our findings, FDC use has consistently declined over time in our study, NHANES, Medicare, and national prescription sales data from 2009 to 2014. The low uptake of FDC may be due to limited options for combinations of subclasses in FDC compared with individual medications and a restricted ability to flexibly titrate medications. Cost is unlikely to be a major factor, as 90% of FDC medications are available in generic form. Since 2017, other guidelines such as the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertensionand the World Health Organization 2021 guideline on the pharmacological treatment of hypertension in adultshave also emphasized the use of combination therapy, preferably with FDC, as an initial treatment for those requiring pharmacological treatment. Although FDCs continue to have a role in hypertension management, clinical guidelines could promote specific FDCs that should be used as first‐line therapy, with clear guidance on how to best combine antihypertensive subclasses to promote necessary polytherapy and more aggressive BP management. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for this decline and its implications for patient outcomes.

### Efficacy of patient activation interventions with or without financial incentives to promote prescribing of thiazides and hypertension control: a randomized clinical trial [^112WLY7F]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is the most common treatable cardiovascular risk factor in the United States, affecting almost 1 in 3 individuals. Despite improvements in the detection and management of hypertension, its prevalence persists, and the percentage of patients whose hypertension is controlled remains unacceptably low. National estimates suggest that at least half of patients with hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP); studies by the Department of Veterans Affairs have shown similarly poor control of BP. New guidelines published in 2017 suggest a goal BP of less than 130/80 mm Hg for most patients. If these lower target guidelines are adopted by health systems, BP will be uncontrolled in far higher numbers of patients with hypertension.

In addition to suboptimal BP control, rates of guideline-concordant therapy also remain low despite evidence-based guidelines from the Joint National Committee (JNC) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (formerly JNC 8, renamed the 2014 Guidelines). Based on these and other guidelines as well as the large clinical trial Anti-Hypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Therapy to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), thiazide diuretics are recommended as a first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension and frequently should be added to treatment regimens to improve BP control. At the time of this study, the Seventh Report of the JNC on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressurecomprised the prevailing guidelines and advocated thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy for uncomplicated hypertension, whereas the 2014 Guidelines recommend selection of treatment from among 4 classes, including thiazides.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with stage 1 HTN, AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate nonpharmacological therapy in adult patients with elevated BP or stage 1 HTN with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk < 10%.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^116woGb8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 1 074 314 patients in 15 academic health care institutions across the United States, we observed a higher proportion of uncontrolled hypertension among Black patients compared with patients of other races and an increasing trend of monotherapy and decreasing trends of FDC and polytherapy. The probability of receiving monotherapy was 35% (95% CI, 32%–38%) higher comparing 2019 with 2010, and the probability of receiving FDC and polytherapy was 42% (95% CI: 40%–44%) and 3% (95% CI: 1%–4%) lower, respectively. Consistent with the recommendations from the 2014 JNC 8 report, the use of beta blockers decreased, though the magnitude was small, and CCB prescriptions increased among Black patients. However, the use of thiazide diuretics among Black patients did not increase after the JNC 8 report, and the use of dual therapy and FDC among patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg also did not increase after recommendations by the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Threshold for Initiation of Antihypertensive Drug Therapy

The addition of antihypertensive drug therapy to nonpharmacological lifestyle counseling is recommended for all adults with an SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, irrespective of CVD/ASCVD risk, in the ACC/AHA guideline (Tables 6–8). For the same BP cut points, the ESC/ESH guideline recommends the immediate initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy in high-risk or very-high-risk patients with CVD, renal disease, or HMOD, and if BP is not controlled after 3 months of lifestyle intervention in patients at low or moderate risk for CVD. An exception is that adults > 80 years of age who have untreated hypertension should only be considered for BP lowering when their office SBP is ≥ 160 mm Hg. In the ACC/AHA guideline, drug therapy is also recommended for the ≈30% of adults with an SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 80 to 89 mm Hg who are identified as being at higher risk for CVD/ASCVD. This has a particular effect on increased drug treatment for older patients, because age is such a strong and nonmodifiable determinant of risk. In the ESC/ESH, drug therapy may only be considered for adults with an SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP 85 to 89 mm Hg in patients with CVD, especially those with coronary artery disease. Figure 2 provides 2 algorithms that highlight the recommended approaches to the management of adults with different categories of BP and CVD/ASCVD risk with nonpharmacological therapy/lifestyle advise and antihypertensive drug therapy. It is challenging to derive a precise quantitative estimate for the resulting difference in treatment rates with antihypertensive medication. Based on the previously mentioned National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey analysis, the difference between the prevalence of antihypertensive drug therapy recommendations using the 2017 ACC/AHA and Joint National Committee 7 BP guidelines was estimated to be 1.9%. Whatever the absolute difference between the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines, the ACC/AHA CPG recommends antihypertensive drug therapy in addition to lifestyle counseling in a higher percentage of adults with an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^113f1nZY]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are many local, national and international guidelines produced by different organisations that give recommendations for the management of hypertension. Studies comparing these guidelines have shown variation in recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and treatment targets for patients with hypertension. However, these studies compared a small number of guidelines, mainly from HICs and offered only a brief insight into their similarities and differences. Hence, scope exists to compare hypertension guidelines on a far larger scale and, importantly, across income settings.

As a condition for which the affected population predominantly live in LMICs, knowledge of variation in recommendations made to clinicians treating patients with hypertension in these settings remains poorly understood. This study aims to address this deficiency by examining the extent of variation across clinical practice guidelines for the management of hypertension internationally. The primary aim is to determine whether variation exists between CPGs for the management of hypertension through analysis of national and international guidelines from different income settings. Specifically, this study aims to compare the following:
Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension and staging of hypertension
Recommended treatment strategies for uncomplicated primary hypertension (in the absence of comorbidities)
Target BP for patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension
Whether different targets are recommended for the elderly and other at-risk subpopulations

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^115dAEVK]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

### Association of isolated diastolic hypertension as defined by the 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure guideline with incident cardiovascular outcomes [^112QMvsV]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guideline, the definition of hypertension was lowered from a blood pressure (BP) of greater than or equal to 140/90 to greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg. The new diastolic BP threshold of 80 mm Hg was recommended based on expert opinion and changes the definition of isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH).

Objective

To compare the prevalence of IDH in the United States, by 2017 ACC/AHA and 2003 Joint National Committee (JNC7) definitions, and to characterize cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of IDH with outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Cross-sectional analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2013–2016) and longitudinal analyses of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (baseline 1990–1992, with follow-up through December 31, 2017). Longitudinal results were validated in 2 external cohorts: (1) the NHANES III (1988–1994) and NHANES 1999–2014 and (2) the Give Us a Clue to Cancer and Heart Disease (CLUE) II cohort (baseline 1989).

Exposures

IDH, by 2017 ACC/AHA (systolic BP < 130 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 80 mm Hg) and by JNC7 (systolic BP < 140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) definitions.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Weighted estimates for prevalence of IDH in US adults and prevalence of US adults recommended BP pharmacotherapy by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline based solely on the presence of IDH. Risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the ARIC Study.

Results

The study population included 9590 adults from the NHANES (mean [SD] baseline age, 49.6 [17.6] years; 5016 women [52.3%]) and 8703 adults from the ARIC Study (mean [SD] baseline age, 56.0 [5.6] years; 4977 women [57.2%]). The estimated prevalence of IDH in the NHANES was 6.5% by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition and 1.3% by the JNC7 definition (absolute difference, 5.2% [95% CI, 4.7%-5.7%]). Among those newly classified as having IDH, an estimated 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.6%) also met the guideline threshold for antihypertensive therapy. Compared with normotensive ARIC participants, IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition was not significantly associated with incident ASCVD (n = 1386 events; median follow-up, 25.2 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.06 [95% CI, 0.89–1.26]), HF (n = 1396 events; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.76–1.09]), or CKD (n = 2433 events; HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.65–1.11]). Results were also null for cardiovascular mortality in the 2 external cohorts (eg, HRs of IDH by the 2017 ACC/AHA definition were 1.17 [95% CI, 0.87–1.56] in the NHANES [n = 1012 events] and 1.02 [95% CI, 0.92–1.14] in CLUE II [n = 1497 events]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this analysis of US adults, the estimated prevalence of IDH was more common when defined by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline compared with the JNC7 guideline. However, IDH was not significantly associated with increased risk for cardiovascular outcomes.

- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age. From the AFP Editors Hypertension is one of the most important preventable contributors to disease and death in the United States, leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure when it is not detected early and treated appropriately. The Eighth Joint National Committee recently released evidence-based recommendations on treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. Hypertension in Patients with CKD or Diabetes For persons 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, the treatment threshold and target blood pressures are the same as those for the general population younger than 60 years.

There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension. Adults with CKD and hypertension should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB as initial or add-on therapy, based on moderate evidence that these medications improve kidney-related outcomes in these patients.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of… [^115izHe7]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee used rigorous evidence-based methods, developing Evidence Statements and recommendations for blood pressure treatment based on a systematic review of the literature to meet user needs, especially the needs of the primary care clinician. This report is an executive summary of the evidence and is designed to provide clear recommendations for all clinicians. Major differences from the previous JNC report are summarized in Table 1.

The complete evidence summary and detailed description of the evidence review and methods are provided online. Therefore, the panel included a corollary recommendation based on expert opinion that treatment for hypertension does not need to be adjusted if treatment results in SBP lower than 140 mm Hg and is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. Recommendation 5 is based on evidence statements 18–21 from question 2, which address BP goals in adults with both diabetes and hypertension. In the absence of such evidence, the panel recommends an SBP goal of lower than 140 mm Hg and a DBP goal lower than 90 mm Hg in this population based on expert opinion, consistent with the BP goals in recommendation 3 for the general population younger than 60 years with hypertension. Use of a consistent BP goal in the general population younger than 60 years and in adults with diabetes of any age may facilitate guideline implementation.

The panel also recognizes that an SBP goal of lower than 130 mm Hg is commonly recommended for adults with diabetes and hypertension. However, this lower SBP goal is not supported by any RCT that randomized participants into 2 or more groups in which treatment was initiated at a lower SBP threshold than 140 mm Hg or into treatment groups in which the SBP goal was lower than 140 mm Hg and that assessed the effects of a lower SBP threshold or goal on important health outcomes.

### JNC 8 report on prevention, evaluation, and treatment of hypertension… [^1122KxhT]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the best methods to prevent, detect, evaluate, and treat hypertension. Bottom Line See the Synopsis section for a summary of the updated hypertension treatment recommendations from the Eighth Joint National Committee. Synopsis Recommendations for target goals: For the general population, 60 years or older, the goal is to treat to a systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. For the general population, younger than 60 years, the goal is to treat to a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. In adults 18 years or older with chronic kidney disease — defined as an estimated or measured glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m² in individuals younger than 70 years — and in patients at any age with albuminuria, treat to a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. In adults 18 years or older with diabetes mellitus, treat to a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Recommendations for drug choice: In the general nonblack population, including patients with diabetes, the appropriate initial choice is a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker.

### AAFP publishes practice guideline with blood pressure targets for… [^112SCE84]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the ACC/AHA released its clinical practice guideline, which most notably redefined hypertension as sustained blood pressure over 130/80 mm Hg and recommending, based largely on the controversial SPRINT trial, that treatment should aim to reduce blood pressure below this new threshold. The AAFP decided against endorsing the guideline and advised its members to continue following the JNC8 report and its own 2017 practice guideline, co-authored with the American College of Physicians, that largely reiterated JNC8's treatment thresholds for adults 60 years and older. Earlier this month, American Family Physician published the updated AAFP hypertension guideline, written by a panel of family physicians, which focuses on updated evidence for optimal blood pressure targets in adults.

Based on a Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared higher and lower blood pressure targets for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the AAFP strongly recommends treating to a standard blood pressure target of less than 140/90 mm Hg to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. A lower blood pressure target of less than 135/85 mm Hg further reduces the risk of myocardial infarction but not mortality, and the AAFP recommends that clinicians consider treating to this lower target with shared decision-making. Notably, although the lower target did not increase serious adverse events compared with the standard target, it required patients to take one more antihypertensive medication on average and increased nonserious adverse events.

The AAFP guideline also applies to adults with hypertension and existing CVD, as another recent Cochrane review comparing standard to lower blood pressure targets in this population found no differences in total or cardiovascular mortality, conclusions that were unchanged from an earlier version discussed in Cochrane for Clinicians. The AAFP guideline is mostly consistent with guidelines from the International Society of Hypertension that recommend a treatment threshold of 140/90 in office settings and lower thresholds for blood pressures obtained with home monitoring or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.
