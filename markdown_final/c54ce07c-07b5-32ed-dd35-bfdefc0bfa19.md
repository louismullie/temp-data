## Question

Pediatric malaria treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pediatric malaria treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying disease severity and identifying red flags. Then, I should verify species-specific treatment choices for uncomplicated disease. Next, I will review dosing nuances for infants and young children, including pharmacokinetic considerations. After that, I need to check severe malaria management and parenteral therapy sequencing. I will then examine pediatric formulation preferences and practical administration. Finally, I should consider special populations, prevention strategies, and a concise decision algorithm, while continuously validating claims against WHO and CDC guidance and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundational step of classifying severity, because treatment hinges on this distinction. Severe malaria includes impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, repeated convulsions, shock, acidosis, inability to retain oral therapy, hyperparasitemia, and severe anemia, and it is most often due to Plasmodium falciparum, though P. vivax can also cause severe disease, so I need to keep a broad differential and not anchor prematurely on species alone [^6255b271].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line therapy for uncomplicated P. falciparum. WHO recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy for 3 days, with options including artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, artesunate-mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, or artesunate-pyronaridine, and the choice should be guided by local resistance patterns and availability, which I should confirm case-by-case rather than assume uniformity across regions [^50f3ed84].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing for infants and very young children, especially those under 5 kg, because labels often restrict ACT use in this group. WHO explicitly recommends that infants weighing less than 5 kg with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria should receive the same mg/kg target dose of ACT as children weighing 5 kg or more, which resolves the common concern about underdosing in this vulnerable group [^93e74aac].

> I need to check pharmacokinetic nuances that affect pediatric dosing and outcomes. Children, particularly those under 25 kg, often have lower day-7 lumefantrine exposure after artemether-lumefantrine, which correlates with higher recurrence risk; modeling supports extending artemether-lumefantrine to 5 days in some contexts to improve exposure, though I should confirm local policy and individual risk before deviating from standard 3-day regimens [^39f33c4e]. For dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, WHO specifies a minimum of 2.5 mg/kg/day of dihydroartemisinin and 20 mg/kg/day of piperaquine for 3 days in children under 25 kg, which I should adhere to strictly to avoid underexposure [^a172aad1].

> Let me consider non-falciparum species, and I should double-check chloroquine susceptibility before committing to a regimen. In chloroquine-susceptible regions, chloroquine remains appropriate for P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, or P. knowlesi, whereas in chloroquine-resistant regions, ACTs are preferred; for P. vivax and P. ovale, I must add primaquine to eradicate hypnozoites, typically 0.5 mg/kg base daily for 14 days, after confirming normal G6PD status to avoid hemolysis, and I should not forget this step because relapse risk is substantial otherwise [^d4bbe3b2] [^550f478a] [^8652b271].

> Next, I should review severe malaria management, and I need to ensure I sequence parenteral and oral therapy correctly. WHO recommends IV or IM artesunate for at least 24 hours until the patient can tolerate oral medication, followed by a complete 3-day ACT course to finish therapy; if artesunate is unavailable, IM artemether is preferred over quinine, and if neither artesunate nor artemether is available, IM quinine can be used as a last resort, though I should acknowledge that artesunate has the strongest mortality benefit signal in children [^97932ab4] [^46121180] [^774407c6].

> But wait, what if pre-referral care is needed in a resource-limited setting. For children under 6 years when IM artesunate is not available, a single rectal dose of artesunate at 10 mg/kg can be administered as a bridge while arranging urgent transfer, and I should explicitly avoid using rectal artesunate in older children or adults because WHO advises against it in those groups [^8acc7b09] [^9c375381].

> I will now examine pediatric formulation choices, because adherence and tolerability materially affect outcomes. WHO and Cochrane analyses suggest pediatric dispersible or suspension ACT formulations have comparable efficacy to crushed tablets but may reduce drug-related adverse events and vomiting, and WHO recommends preferring fixed-dose combinations and solid pediatric formulations, such as dispersible tablets, over liquids when available to improve dosing accuracy and acceptability [^73a43654] [^d5fdb06d] [^fad1de84].

> Let me think about practical administration details that reduce treatment failure. Artemether-lumefantrine should be given with fat-containing food or milk to optimize lumefantrine absorption, and if a child vomits within 30 minutes, I should repeat the full dose; if vomiting occurs between 30 and 60 minutes, a half-dose can be considered, with close monitoring and alternative therapy if vomiting persists or improvement is not seen within 48 to 72 hours [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations and drug–drug interactions. In children with HIV, antimalarial choices are the same as in HIV-uninfected children, but I must screen for antiretroviral interactions, particularly with ritonavir-boosted regimens and quinidine, and adjust accordingly; for refugees and adoptees from sub-Saharan Africa, presumptive treatment on arrival and primaquine for prior P. vivax or P. ovale exposure are recommended to mitigate delayed presentations and relapses [^38fd81ba] [^379225bb].

> I should confirm prevention strategies that intersect with treatment planning. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention and intermittent preventive treatment in infants reduce malaria burden in high-transmission settings, and WHO also recommends RTS, S/AS01 vaccination in children in moderate-to-high transmission regions; these measures can reduce future episodes and should be integrated with case management and counseling [^7a6a3116] [^a52f8294] [^8e294022].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision algorithm to ensure internal consistency. First, classify severity and stabilize; second, identify species and local resistance; third, select an appropriate ACT for uncomplicated disease or initiate parenteral artesunate for severe disease; fourth, dose by weight with attention to infant and pharmacokinetic nuances; fifth, add primaquine for P. vivax or P. ovale after G6PD testing; sixth, prefer pediatric-friendly formulations and ensure proper administration; seventh, monitor for clinical response and recrudescence, and if treatment fails, switch to a different effective regimen rather than repeating the same drug [^50f3ed84] [^97932ab4] [^550f478a] [^f2d1d616].

> Finally, I should double-check a potential pitfall I almost made regarding primaquine in P. falciparum. Initially, I thought primaquine was routinely indicated for all P. falciparum cases, but wait, I should correct that: WHO recommends a single 0.25 mg/kg dose of primaquine with ACT for P. falciparum only to reduce transmission in low-transmission settings, and explicitly advises not to obtain G6PD testing for this single-dose strategy, which differs from the 14-day radical cure regimen used for P. vivax and P. ovale [^15a6e843].

---

Pediatric malaria treatment is **ACTs for 3 days** for uncomplicated cases [^50f3ed84], with **IV artesunate for severe disease** [^97932ab4] until oral intake is possible, followed by a 3-day ACT course. Dosing is **weight-based** [^6eb1bc91], and pediatric formulations (dispersible tablets) improve adherence and reduce vomiting [^d5fdb06d] [^73a43654]. For P. vivax/ovale, add **primaquine for 14 days** [^550f478a] after confirming normal G6PD status [^8652b271]. Monitor for clinical response and adverse effects, and adjust therapy if treatment fails or resistance is suspected [^f2d1d616].

## Classification of pediatric malaria

Pediatric malaria is classified as **uncomplicated** or **severe** based on clinical features and disease severity [^6255b271]:

| **Category** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated malaria | - Fever <br/> - Chills <br/> - Headache <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Mild anemia <br/> - No signs of severe disease |
| Severe malaria | - Impaired consciousness <br/> - Respiratory distress (acidotic breathing) <br/> - Multiple convulsions <br/> - Shock <br/> - Severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL) <br/> - Hyperparasitemia (> 5% parasitemia) <br/> - Jaundice <br/> - Renal impairment <br/> - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Prostration |

---

## First-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria

The WHO recommends **artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)** as first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children [^50f3ed84]. ACTs combine a rapid-acting artemisinin derivative with a longer-acting partner drug, thereby achieving rapid parasite clearance and reducing the risk of recurrence [^8750dbda]. Commonly used ACT regimens include:

- **Artemether-lumefantrine**: Preferred due to efficacy, safety, and availability of pediatric formulations [^e2b6938c].
- **Artesunate-amodiaquine**: Alternative ACT, particularly useful in regions with high lumefantrine resistance.
- **Artesunate-mefloquine**: Used in areas with high resistance to other partner drugs.
- **Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine**: Effective and well-tolerated, with a long post-treatment prophylactic effect [^8750dbda].
- **Artesunate-pyronaridine**: Alternative ACT with good efficacy and safety profiles.

---

## Dosing considerations

Pediatric dosing is **weight-based** [^6eb1bc91], and formulations — especially dispersible tablets — improve adherence and reduce vomiting [^d5fdb06d] [^73a43654]. For example, artemether-lumefantrine is dosed at 1 tablet per dose for 5– < 15 kg, 2 tablets for 15– < 25 kg, 3 tablets for 25– < 35 kg, and 4 tablets for > 35 kg, administered twice daily for 3 days [^12b7027a].

---

## Management of severe malaria

Severe malaria is a **medical emergency** requiring prompt parenteral therapy [^02a01a0b]. The WHO recommends **intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) artesunate** as the first-line treatment for severe malaria in children, including infants and pregnant women [^97932ab4]. Artesunate is preferred over quinine due to its superior efficacy in reducing mortality and faster parasite clearance [^c5747b49]. If artesunate is unavailable, **artemether** or **quinine** may be used as alternatives [^46121180]. Treatment should continue for at least 24 hours until the child can tolerate oral medication, followed by a complete 3-day course of ACT [^97932ab4].

---

## Adjunctive therapies and supportive care

Supportive care is essential in managing pediatric malaria, particularly in severe cases. This includes:

- **Fluid management**: Careful fluid resuscitation to prevent both dehydration and fluid overload, which can exacerbate respiratory distress.
- **Blood transfusion**: Indicated for severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL) or signs of circulatory collapse.
- **Glucose monitoring**: Regular monitoring to detect and manage hypoglycemia, a common complication in severe malaria.
- **Anticonvulsants**: Diazepam or lorazepam for seizures, with magnesium sulfate considered for refractory cases.

---

## Prevention of relapse in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale infections

P. vivax and P. ovale infections require **radical cure** to prevent relapse from dormant liver-stage hypnozoites. Primaquine is administered for 14 days [^550f478a] at 0.5 mg/kg base (maximum 30 mg) daily after confirming normal G6PD status to avoid hemolytic anemia [^8652b271]. In children under 6 months, primaquine is not recommended due to limited safety data.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring of clinical status, temperature, and parasitemia is essential to ensure **treatment response** [^f2d1d616]. Treatment failure may result from drug resistance, poor adherence, or inadequate dosing; in such cases, alternative ACTs or non-ACT regimens may be considered based on local resistance patterns and expert consultation [^f2d1d616].

---

## Special considerations

- **Infants and young children**: ACTs are safe and effective in infants, including those weighing less than 5 kg, with dosing adjusted accordingly [^93e74aac].
- **HIV-infected children**: Treatment principles are similar, but clinicians should consider potential drug interactions between antiretroviral therapy and antimalarials [^38fd81ba].
- **Malnutrition**: Malnourished children may require careful dosing adjustments and close monitoring due to altered drug metabolism and increased susceptibility to complications.

---

## Recent advances and ongoing research

Recent research focuses on optimizing pediatric dosing strategies, developing new pediatric formulations, and evaluating novel antimalarial compounds. Pharmacokinetic studies highlight the need for **weight-based dosing adjustments** and longer treatment courses in young children to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations and reduce recurrence [^39f33c4e] [^5b4ce12e].

---

Pediatric malaria treatment centers on **ACTs for uncomplicated disease** [^50f3ed84] and **IV artesunate for severe cases** [^97932ab4], with weight-based dosing and pediatric formulations to optimize adherence and outcomes. Primaquine is added for P. vivax/ovale to prevent relapse [^550f478a], and supportive care is essential in severe disease.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ Chloroquine (CHQ) is proposed for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) treatment. CHQ for malaria treatment in children is safe, but pediatric dose requirements for COVID‐19 are lacking.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ What is the best‐evidence, model‐informed CHQ dose to recommend when pediatric clinical trial data is absent?
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Pediatric CHQ dose recommendations for COVID‐19 were determined. Children 6 months to 12 years of age are in need of 30% higher mg/kg doses, whereas younger children need 20% lower doses than older children and adults.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ A knowledge driven, model‐informed approach can be used to support off‐label dose recommendations, in the absence of clinical data, in case of a high medical need.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^38fd81ba]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Malaria prevention and treatment in children with or exposed to HIV — CDC recommends presumptive treatment for malaria for all refugees and adoptees resettling to the United States from sub-Saharan Africa, and children with past or current P. vivax or P. ovale infection should receive treatment with primaquine to eradicate the dormant liver stage if the drug was not previously administered. These patients remain at risk of developing malaria after arrival in the United States and should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion for malaria. Treatment of malaria is based on the disease severity, patient age at onset, parasite species, pregnancy status, and known resistance patterns in the area where the malaria infection was acquired (AI); drug dosing for pediatric patients must be adjusted for weight and dosing should never exceed the recommended adult dose, and HIV infection status does not affect choice or dosing of antimalarial therapy though clinicians are urged to evaluate for drug interactions between antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs before initiating antimalarial therapy.

Discussion

This review summarizes the evidence on possible benefits of paediatric versus non‐paediatric ACTs. Inclusion criteria applied in this review were very strict, only allowing inclusion of randomized controlled trials that compared paediatric versus non‐paediatric ACTs of the same substances; hence only three studies (1306 participants) were suitable for inclusion.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Malaria in HIV-infected children — managing treatment failure — Failure of treatment for P. falciparum is uncommon in children who receive a full course of appropriate antimalarial therapy, and patients should be monitored for clinical and laboratory response (thick and thin smear) and for signs of recrudescence after therapy completion. Relapse of P. vivax and P. ovale can occur from the dormant (hypnozoite) liver form but is less common following primaquine treatment. When treatment failure occurs, malaria speciation should be confirmed, as should the geography of where the malaria was acquired, and retreatment with an appropriate first-line regimen (but not the same regimen as initially used) should be given. Discussion with a Pediatric Infectious Disease specialist or consultation through the CDC malaria hotline is appropriate when complex situations arise.

Malaria — epidemiology relevant to pediatric patients: Malaria is caused by the obligate, intracellular protozoa of the genus Plasmodium, and is transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles mosquito. Worldwide, malaria is a leading killer of children and pregnant women. In the United States, most malaria cases occur in patients who have returned from travels to areas of endemic malaria transmission. Rarely, cases occur as a result of exposure to infected blood products, local mosquito-borne transmission (i.e., autochthonous transmission), or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (congenital malaria). Prompt recognition and treatment are essential, and failure to act quickly and appropriately can have grave consequences.

Malaria Treatment in Pediatric Patients

Treatment of mild to moderate malaria in pediatric patients caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum: Dosage: 20 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Splitting the total therapeutic dose into 2 doses taken 6 to 8 hours apart may reduce the occurrence or severity of adverse effects. The pediatric dose should not exceed the adult dose.

Experience with mefloquine in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg is limited.

The drug should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with ample water. The tablets may be crushed and suspended in a small amount of water, milk or other beverage for administration to small children and other persons unable to swallow them whole.

If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with mefloquine has failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment.

In pediatric patients, the administration of mefloquine for the treatment of malaria has been associated with early vomiting. In some cases, early vomiting has been cited as a possible cause of treatment failure (see PRECAUTIONS). If a significant loss of drug product is observed or suspected because of vomiting, a second full dose of mefloquine should be administered to patients who vomit less than 30 minutes after receiving the drug. If vomiting occurs 30 to 60 minutes after a dose, an additional half-dose should be given. If vomiting recurs, the patient should be monitored closely and alternative malaria treatment considered if improvement is not observed within a reasonable period of time.

The safety and effectiveness of mefloquine to treat malaria in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.

Malaria Prophylaxis in Pediatric Patients

The recommended prophylactic dose of mefloquine is approximately 5 mg/kg body weight once weekly. One 250 mg mefloquine hydrochloride tablet should be taken once weekly in pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg. In pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg, the weekly dose decreases in proportion to body weight:

30 to 45 kg: 3/4 tablet

20 to 30 kg: 1/2 tablet

Experience with mefloquine in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg is limited.

### Paediatric formulations of artemisinin-based combination therapies for treating uncomplicated malaria in children [^73a43654]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In endemic malarial areas, young children have high levels of malaria morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization recommends oral artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treating uncomplicated malaria. Paediatric formulations of ACT have been developed to make it easier to treat children.

Objectives

To evaluate evidence from trials on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and acceptability of paediatric ACT formulations compared to tablet ACT formulations for uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in children up to 14 years old.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; Embase; the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS); ISI Web of Science; Google Scholar; Scopus; and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) to 11 December 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of paediatric versus non-paediatric formulated ACT in children aged 14 years or younger with acute uncomplicated malaria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias, and carried out data extraction. We analyzed the primary outcomes of efficacy, safety and tolerability of paediatric versus non-paediatric ACT using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary outcomes were: treatment failure on the last day of observation (day 42), fever clearance time, parasite clearance time, pharmacokinetics, and acceptability.

Main Results

Three trials met the inclusion criteria. Two compared a paediatric dispersible tablet formulation against crushed tablets of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ), and one trial assessed artemether-lumefantrine formulated as powder for suspension compared with crushed tablets. The trials were carried out between 2006 and 2015 in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Mali, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burkina Faso, and The Gambia). In all three trials, the paediatric and control ACT achieved polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-adjusted treatment failure rates of < 10% on day 28 in the per-protocol (PP) population. For the comparison of dispersible versus crushed tablets, the two trials did not detect a difference for treatment failure by day 28 (PCR-adjusted PP population: RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.72; 1061 participants, 2 studies, low-certainty evidence). Similarly, for the comparison of suspension versus crushed tablet ACT, we did not detect any difference in treatment failure at day 28 (PCR-adjusted PP population: RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.87; 245 participants, 1 study). We did not detect any difference in serious adverse events for the comparison of dispersible versus crushed tablets (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.88; 1197 participants, 2 studies, low-certainty evidence), or for the comparison of suspension versus crushed tablet ACT (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.17 to 3.26; 267 participants, 1 study). In the dispersible ACT arms, drug-related adverse events occurred in 9% of children in the AL study and 34% of children in the DHA-PQ study. In the control arms, drug-related adverse events occurred in 12% of children in the AL study and in 42% of children in the DHA-PQ study. Drug-related adverse events were lower in the dispersible ACT arms (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.99; 1197 participants, 2 studies, moderate-certainty evidence). There was no detected difference in the rate of drug-related adverse events for suspension ACT versus crushed tablet ACT (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.32; 267 participants, 1 study). Drug-related vomiting appeared to be less common in the dispersible ACT arms (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.01; 1197 participants, 2 studies, low-certainty evidence) and in the suspension ACT arm (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.32; 267 participants, 1 study), but both analyses were underpowered. No study assessed acceptability.

Authors' Conclusions

Trials did not demonstrate a difference in efficacy between paediatric dispersible or suspension ACT when compared with the respective crushed tablet ACT for treating uncomplicated P falciparum malaria in children. However, the evidence is of low to moderate certainty due to limited power. There appeared to be fewer drug-related adverse events with dispersible ACT compared to crushed tablet ACT. None of the included studies assessed acceptability of paediatric ACT formulation.

Abstract

Background

In endemic malarial areas, young children have high levels of malaria morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization recommends oral artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) for treating uncomplicated malaria. Paediatric formulations of ACT have been developed to make it easier to treat children.

### Do paediatric drug formulations of artemisinin combination therapies improve the treatment of children with malaria? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^d5fdb06d]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2010). Medium credibility.

Paediatric formulations of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) have recently been developed for the treatment of children with falciparum malaria. Compared with conventional tablet formulations, the new non-tablet preparations have shown equivalent efficacy, safety, and tolerability in individual trials. We aimed to investigate whether objective evidence supports the development and use of paediatric ACTs. A systematic review identified seven studies involving 2515 children that were eligible for meta-analysis. Similar efficacy and safety were seen in pooled analyses of paediatric and conventional formulations. 23 (2.0%) of 1154 patients in the paediatric formulation groups and 19 (1.7%) of 1137 in the tablet formulation groups were not cured (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.66–2.44). Despite similar overall tolerability, the tolerability of drug administration was improved for paediatric formulations as shown by significantly fewer patients with drug-induced vomiting (93 of 1018 and 114 of 837 patients; risk ratio [RR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.61–0.99), and drug-related gastrointestinal disorders (8 of 545 and 15 of 358 patients; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15–0.85). These data provide, for the first time, evidence for improved management of children by use of paediatric formulations, and support the further development and use of paediatric ACTs.

Pediatric HIV malaria — managing treatment failure: "Failure of treatment for P. falciparum is uncommon in children who receive a full course of appropriate antimalarial therapy". Patients should be monitored for clinical and laboratory response with "thick and thin smear" and for signs of recrudescence after therapy completion. If failure occurs, "malaria speciation should be confirmed", along with where the infection was acquired, and "Retreatment with an appropriate first-line regimen (but not the same regimen as initially used) should be given". "Discussion with a Pediatric Infectious Disease specialist or consultation through the CDC malaria hotline is appropriate when complex situations arise".

PEDIATRIC MALARIA TREATMENT WITH ARTEMETHER LUMEFANTRINE

Lumefantrine concentrations and other measures of drug exposure are quite variable. Similar to PQ, lumefantrine exposure is predictive of treatment outcomes. Multiple studies have documented lower lumefantrine exposure in children and pregnant women compared with adults and, in some cases, these lower lumefantrine exposures have been linked to higher risks of recurrent infection after treatment with AL (Table 1). The most comprehensive study on this topic, an individual patient data meta‐analysis conducted by WWARN, which included PK data from 4,122 participants including pregnant women, children, and nonpregnant adults from across multiple continents, reported that pregnant women and children < 25 kg had lower day 7 lumefantrine levels compared with nonpregnant adults. After allometrically scaling clearance and volume for weight, children < 15 kg had 24% lower day 7 lumefantrine levels compared with adults, and children 15–24 kg had 13% lower day 7 levels. As the investigators considered optimized AL regimens to improve lumefantrine exposure in children, it was noted that lumefantrine was associated with dose limited absorption, such that longer treatment courses rather than increased daily doses were predicted to improve lumefantrine exposure. This robust PK meta‐analysis led to recommendations to extend twice daily dosing for 5 days, which was predicted to better match the distribution of adult and pediatric day 7 concentrations. It also predicted that 75% of children would maintain lumefantrine concentrations over the 200 ng/mL previously recommended threshold.

### Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for treating uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria [^8750dbda]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) for treating uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This review aims to assist the decision-making of malaria control programmes by providing an overview of the relative effects of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) versus other recommended ACTs.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DHA-P compared to other ACTs for treating uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS, and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) up to July 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing a three-day course of DHA-P to a three-day course of an alternative WHO recommended ACT in uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed primary outcomes in line with the WHO 'Protocol for assessing and monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy' and compared drugs using risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Secondary outcomes were effects on gametocytes, haemoglobin, and adverse events. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 27 trials, enrolling 16,382 adults and children, and conducted between 2002 and 2010. Most trials excluded infants aged less than six months and pregnant women. DHA-P versus artemether-lumefantrineIn Africa, over 28 days follow-up, DHA-P is superior to artemether-lumefantrine at preventing further parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.39, nine trials, 6200 participants, high quality evidence), and although PCR-adjusted treatment failure was below 5% for both ACTs, it was consistently lower with DHA-P (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.62, nine trials, 5417 participants, high quality evidence). DHA-P has a longer prophylactic effect on new infections which may last for up to 63 days (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78, two trials, 3200 participants, high quality evidence). In Asia and Oceania, no differences have been shown at day 28 (four trials, 1143 participants, moderate quality evidence), or day 63 (one trial, 323 participants, low quality evidence). Compared to artemether-lumefantrine, no difference was seen in prolonged QTc (low quality evidence), and no cardiac arrhythmias were reported. The frequency of other adverse events is probably similar with both combinations (moderate quality evidence). DHA-P versus artesunate plus mefloquineIn Asia, over 28 days follow-up, DHA-P is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine at preventing further parasitaemia (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: eight trials, 3487 participants, high quality evidence). Once adjusted by PCR to exclude new infections, treatment failure at day 28 was below 5% for both ACTs in all eight trials, but lower with DHA-P in two trials (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: RR 0.41 95% CI 0.21 to 0.80, eight trials, 3482 participants, high quality evidence). Both combinations contain partner drugs with very long half-lives and no consistent benefit in preventing new infections has been seen over 63 days follow-up (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: five trials, 2715 participants, moderate quality evidence). In the only trial from South America, there were fewer recurrent parastaemias over 63 days with artesunate plus mefloquine (PCR-unadjusted treatment failure: RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.40 to 27.35, one trial, 445 participants, low quality evidence), but no differences were seen once adjusted for new infections (PCR-adjusted treatment failure: one trial, 435 participants, low quality evidence).DHA-P is associated with less nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleeplessness, and palpitations compared to artesunate plus mefloquine (moderate quality evidence). DHA-P was associated with more frequent prolongation of the QTc interval (low quality evidence), but no cardiac arrhythmias were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

In Africa, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine reduces overall treatment failure compared to artemether-lumefantrine, although both drugs have PCR-adjusted failure rates of less than 5%. In Asia, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is as effective as artesunate plus mefloquine, and is better tolerated.

Selection of studies

Two review authors independently reviewed the results of the literature search for potentially relevant studies (RCT, paediatric formulation, acute uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, and children aged up to 14 years), for which they then obtained full‐text copies. The two review authors then independently assessed the identified studies for inclusion in this review, using the inclusion criteria specified in the protocol (Bélard 2012). The two review authors discussed any discrepancies between themselves, and resolved them with a third review author. They took particular care to ensure that they only included trials with multiple publications once. The ' Characteristics of excluded studies ' table lists the excluded studies with paediatric ACT formulations, with reasons for their exclusion. Review authors did not consider the results of a study when deciding on its eligibility for inclusion.

### Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants [^a52f8294]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Intermittent preventive treatment could help prevent malaria in infants (IPTi) living in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission in sub‐Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) policy recommended IPTi in 2010, but its adoption in countries has been limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria in infants living in malaria‐endemic areas.

Search methods

We searched the following sources up to 3 December 2018: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (OVID), LILACS (Bireme), and reference lists of articles. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal for ongoing trials up to 3 December 2018.

Selection criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IPT to placebo or no intervention in infants (defined as young children aged between 1 to 12 months) in malaria‐endemic areas.

Data collection and analysis

The primary outcome was clinical malaria (fever plus asexual parasitaemia). Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted data. We summarized dichotomous outcomes and count data using risk ratios (RR) and rate ratios respectively, and presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We extracted protective efficacy values and their 95% CIs; when an included trial did not report this data, we calculated these values from the RR or rate ratio with its 95% CI. Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main results

We included 12 trials that enrolled 19,098 infants; all were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa. Three trials were cluster‐RCTs. IPTi with sulfadoxine‐pyrimethamine (SP) was evaluated in 10 trials from 1999 to 2013 (n = 15,256). Trials evaluating ACTs included dihydroartemisinin‐piperaquine (1 trial, 147 participants; year 2013), amodiaquine‐artesunate (1 study, 684 participants; year 2008), and SP‐artesunate (1 trial, 676 participants; year 2008). The earlier studies evaluated IPTi with SP, and were conducted in Tanzania (in 1999 and 2006), Mozambique (2004), Ghana (2004 to 2005), Gabon (2005), Kenya (2008), and Mali (2009). One trial evaluated IPTi with amodiaquine in Tanzania (2000). Later studies included three conducted in Kenya (2008), Tanzania (2008), and Uganda (2013), evaluating IPTi in multiple trial arms that included artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT).

Although the effect size varied over time and between drugs, overall IPTi impacts on the incidence of clinical malaria overall, with a 30% reduction (rate ratio 0.70, 0.62 to 0.80; 10 studies, 10,602 participants). The effect of SP appeared to attenuate over time, with trials conducted after 2009 showing little or no effect of the intervention. IPTi with SP probably resulted in fewer episodes of clinical malaria (rate ratio 0.78, 0.69 to 0.88; 8 trials, 8774 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence), anaemia (rate ratio 0.82, 0.68 to 0.98; 6 trials, 7438 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence), parasitaemia (rate ratio 0.66, 0.56 to 0.79; 1 trial, 1200 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence), and fewer hospital admissions (rate ratio 0.85, 0.78 to 0.93; 7 trials, 7486 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). IPTi with SP probably made little or no difference to all‐cause mortality (risk ratio 0.93, 0.74 to 1.15; 9 trials, 14,588 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).

Since 2009, IPTi trials have evaluated ACTs and indicate impact on clinical malaria and parasitaemia. A small trial of DHAP in 2013 shows substantive effects on clinical malaria (RR 0.42, 0.33 to 0.54; 1 trial, 147 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence) and parasitaemia (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

In areas of sub‐Saharan Africa, giving antimalarial drugs known to be effective against the malaria parasite at the time to infants as IPT probably reduces the risk of clinical malaria, anaemia, and hospital admission. Evidence from SP studies over a 19‐year period shows declining efficacy, which may be due to increasing drug resistance. Combinations with ACTs appear promising as suitable alternatives for IPTi.

### Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants [^0ce66230]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intermittent preventive treatment could help prevent malaria in infants (IPTi) living in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization (WHO) policy recommended IPTi in 2010, but its adoption in countries has been limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria in infants living in malaria-endemic areas.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources up to 3 December 2018: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (OVID), LILACS (Bireme), and reference lists of articles. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) portal for ongoing trials up to 3 December 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IPT to placebo or no intervention in infants (defined as young children aged between 1 to 12 months) in malaria-endemic areas.

### Artemether for severe malaria [^774407c6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

In 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended parenteral artesunate in preference to quinine as first‐line treatment for people with severe malaria. Prior to this recommendation many countries, particularly in Africa, had begun to use artemether, an alternative artemisinin derivative. This Cochrane Review evaluates intramuscular artemether compared with both quinine and artesunate.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of intramuscular artemether versus any other parenteral medication in the treatment of severe malaria in adults and children.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS, ISI Web of Science, conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for ongoing trials up to 7 September 2018. We checked the reference lists of all studies identified by the search. We examined references listed in review articles and previously compiled bibliographies to look for eligible studies.

Selection criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intramuscular artemether with intravenous/intramuscular quinine or artesunate for treating severe malaria.

Data collection and analysis

The primary outcome was all‐cause death. Two review authors independently screened each article by title and abstract, and examined potentially relevant studies for inclusion using an eligibility form. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included studies. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs), and have presented both measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta‐analyses and used the GRADE approach to summarize the certainty of the evidence.

Main results

We included 19 RCTs, enrolling 2874 adults and children with severe malaria, carried out in Africa (12 trials) and in Asia (7 trials).

Artemether versus quinine

For children, there is probably little or no difference in the risk of death between intramuscular artemether and quinine (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.21; 13 trials, 1659 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence). Coma resolution time may be about five hours shorter with artemether (MD −5.45, 95% CI −7.90 to −3.00; six trials, 358 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Artemether may make little difference to neurological sequelae (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07; seven trials, 968 participants, low‐certainty evidence). Compared to quinine, artemether probably shortens the parasite clearance time by about nine hours (MD −9.03, 95% CI −11.43 to −6.63; seven trials, 420 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence), and may shorten the fever clearance time by about three hours (MD −3.73, 95% CI −6.55 to −0.92; eight trials, 457 participants, low‐certainty evidence).

For adults, treatment with intramuscular artemether probably results in fewer deaths than treatment with quinine (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83; four trials, 716 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).

Artemether versus artesunate

Artemether and artesunate have not been directly compared in randomized trials in children.

For adults, mortality is probably higher with intramuscular artemether (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.97; two trials, 494 participants, moderate‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

Artemether appears to be more effective than quinine in children and adults. Artemether compared to artesunate has not been extensively studied, but in adults it appears inferior. These findings are consistent with the WHO recommendations that artesunate is the drug of choice, but artemether is acceptable when artesunate is not available.

Uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum or unknown malaria species from chloroquine-resistant areas or unknown region — atovaquone-proguanil (pediatric tablets 62.5 mg/25 mg; adult tablets 250 mg/100 mg) is dosed once daily as follows: 5–8 kg: 2 pediatric tablets for 3 days; 9–10 kg: 3 pediatric tablets for 3 days; 11–20 kg: 1 adult tablet or 4 pediatric tablets for 3 days; 21–30 kg: 2 adult tablets for 3 days; 31–40 kg: 3 adult tablets for 3 days; > 40 kg: 4 adult tablets for 3 days. For quinine-based regimens, doxycycline or tetracycline should be used only in children aged ≥ 8 years; an alternative for children aged ≥ 8 years is clindamycin 7 mg/kg body weight per dose by mouth given every 8 hours, and clindamycin should be used for children aged < 8 years.

Malaria — high-risk groups and prophylaxis for travelers: United States-born children visiting family in malaria-endemic regions are at highest risk of malaria infection, and children of foreign citizenship, children of unknown resident status, and adopted children from countries of endemic malaria transmission are also at high risk; families should be prepared with malaria chemoprophylaxis and educated with travel advice before returning to endemic areas (AII). Naturally acquired immunity develops after age 5 years in people who reside in areas of stable malaria transmission, is partial, wanes quickly after leaving endemic areas, and may not be present in HIV-infected populations with advanced immunodeficiency; therefore, both adults and children living in the United States who were born in malaria-endemic areas should be prescribed the same prophylaxis as any other patients traveling to malaria-endemic areas.

### Malaria PK / PD and the role pharmacometrics can play in the global health arena: malaria treatment regimens for vulnerable populations [^5c0a180e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Clear translation of findings from PK/PD analyses into predicted improvements in treatment outcomes has led to policy changes in antimalarial dosing guidelines

PK/PD model‐informed dosing of antimalarials has become a valued tool for antimalarial research and policy. Pharmacometricians have presented the results of their PK/PD modeling work in terms of clinical impact and have identified dosing regimens that consider safety, efficacy, and implementation. Some of these changes have been enacted directly (e.g. DP dosing in pediatric populations) whereas others are already in clinical trials (AL in young children and pregnancy, triple ACT regimens in South East Asia). Although we note that PK/PD studies for antimalarials could be improved by diversifying population specific outcomes to include those that are highest priority for regulators, such as birth outcomes among pregnancy, pharmacometricians in antimalarial research have made significant progress in translating scientific findings into action. As the value of PK/PD modeling has been demonstrated, it has opened the door to more advanced applications, and a more rapid translation of scientific discovery to policy.

PEDIATRIC MALARIA TREATMENT WITH DIHYDROARTEMISININ PIPERAQUINE

As previously described, PK/PD models are well‐suited to determine the correct dose of a medication. Because young children (< 5 years) are one of the most vulnerable groups for contracting malaria and also for worse treatment outcomes, this population has been the focus of many recent PK/PD studies. Children are known to have a higher body weight adjusted clearance compared with adults and receive a higher mg/kg dose to counteract these developmental changes. In addition, the PK of infants is particularly difficult to scale due to age‐based maturation of metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4.DP combines an artemisinin derivative with PQ, a long acting aminoquinoline derivative with the longest half‐life (~ 3 weeks) of approved partner drugs. In sub‐Saharan Africa, DP provides excellent treatment efficacy > 95% and provides a 1 month post‐treatment prophylactic effect. DP, like many ACTs, is dosed according to weight‐bands, and day 7 PQ concentrations of 57 ng/mL (capillary) in children < 5 years of age has been associated with a decreased risk of recurrent infection after treatment. In one study, day 7 PQ concentration was the only significant predictor associated with the risk of recurrent malaria. A 5.9% increase risk of new infection for every 1 ng/mL decrease in day 7 PQ concentration was reported. As PQ concentrations have been a key predictor of outcomes, obtaining optimal PQ concentrations in young children has been a major focus of PK/PD modeling efforts.

### The treatment of imported malaria in children: an update [^d43f2a09]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Since the 2010 publication in this journal of a review of the management of imported malaria for U.K. children, new evidence for the treatment of both severe and uncomplicated malaria has been published. This review discusses these new data and expands the scope of the previous review to include non-endemic countries outside of the U.K. The results of the AQUAMAT trial in late 2010 and other studies have prompted the WHO to recommend that intravenous artesunate be used preferentially over quinine for the treatment of severe malaria caused by any Plasmodium species in both adults and children. Oral artemisinin-based combination therapies have also shown equivalent (if not better) efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by all Plasmodium species (including chloroquine-resistant P vivax) in both adults and children, though there are issues regarding the availability of artemisinin-based combination therapies in many non-endemic countries. In these instances, conventional therapeutic regimens continue to be efficacious. Lastly, the use of primaquine for hypnozoite and gametocyte eradication is discussed.

### Management of severe paediatric malaria in resource-limited settings [^1b4397b0]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Adjunctive therapies in severe malaria

The outcome of severe malaria is largely determined by the complications and number of vital organ dysfunction and quality of care available. For most African children this will not include an admission to an intensive care or high-dependency care unit, instead management will be more usually on a busy paediatric ward. It is important to emphasize that the most important factor for management is the implementation of specific antimalarial drug treatment and that this is given as early as possible to reduce the risk of adverse outcome. As is the case in management of severe sepsis, supportive therapies aimed at correcting deranged physiology are also fundamental to improving outcome; however, of the adjunctive agents tested in clinical trials in both adults and children all have failed to show benefit, with the exception of renal replacement therapy in adults. With respect to the high risk group of cerebral malaria, of the 33 clinical trials summarised in Table 2 investigating a range of specific or supportive therapies, 15 have been targeted to the sub-group with cerebral malaria and most have shown harm in those receiving the interventional therapy. These will be reviewed, initially in chronological order, but are largely clustered within a treatment-specific paradigm.

Severe malaria — definition and clinical features — is defined as acute malaria "with signs of severity and/or evidence of vital organ dysfunction", most often caused by P. falciparum but also caused by P. vivax or mixed infections, and may include hyperparasitemia (> 5%) and severe anemia (hemoglobin < 7 g/dL) among other abnormalities.

Key points
- Patients with any manifestations of severe malaria should be treated promptly and aggressively with intravenous antimalarial therapy.
- IV artesunate is the only IV antimalarial medication currently available in the United States.
- Initiate treatment for severe malaria immediately as it can progress to a fatal outcome rapidly.
- If your facility does not have IV artesunate in stock, obtain the medication as soon as possible and treat with oral antimalarials until the medication arrives.
- Use the Malaria Treatment Tables for specific drug and dosing recommendations for severe malaria. IV artesunate Severe malaria can progress to a fatal outcome rapidly, so its treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Patients with severe malaria, regardless of infecting species, should be treated with intravenous artesunate. Reminder.

®) is the preferred follow-on treatment but adequate alternatives are atovaquone-proguanil, quinine plus doxycycline or clindamycin, or mefloquine. If the patient received oral treatment prior to receiving IV artesunate, the same medication can be used as follow-on treatment, but a full regimen is required. As for any malaria treatment, the regimen selection should not include the medication used for chemoprophylaxis. If, after the third IV artesunate dose, the patient's parasite density is > 1%, IV artesunate treatment should be continued with the recommended dose once a day for a maximum of seven days until parasite density is ≤ 1%. Doses given at 0, 12, and 24 hours count as one day, which means up to six additional days. Clinicians should proceed with full course of oral follow-on treatment as above as soon as parasite density ≤ 1% and the patient is able to tolerate oral medications.

Clinicians can consider placement of nasogastric tube or use of antiemetics to facilitate administration of oral treatment. For those patients with parasite density ≤ 1% but who still cannot tolerate oral medications after completing IV artesunate treatment, clinicians can continue IV artesunate, one dose daily not to exceed a total course of seven days. Infants, children, and pregnant women IV artesunate can be used in infants, children, and pregnant women. Given that severe malaria is especially life threatening for pregnant women and their fetuses, and the lack of other treatment options for severe malaria in the United States, the benefits of treatment with IV artesunate outweigh the risks and IV artesunate should not be withheld.

Potential biases in the review process

All trials included in this review are published, and we were unable to obtain further unpublished data.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

The current review is in line with a systematic review and meta‐analysis that the authors published in 2010 (Kurth 2010). The Kurth 2010 review used a protocol that was less strict with regard to inclusion criteria, and meta‐analysis included non‐randomized studies as well as studies that compared paediatric versus non‐paediatric ACT using different drug combinations. Both reviews conclude that tolerability of paediatric ACTs is superior to non‐paediatric ACTs, with equal efficacy and safety.

### Malaria prevalence among young infants in different transmission settings, Africa [^1c4dbafb]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

We have shown that malaria in young infants is not rare, can be symptomatic, and has major health consequences, most notably anemia. Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend the use of ACTs in infants, but they specify that for young infants weighing < 5 kg, the available evidence is insufficient to confidently recommend this treatment. Thus, many of the ACTs carry label restrictions saying they should not be used for infants weighing < 5 kg. This restriction is problematic because a substantial proportion (40%) of the infants in these surveys weighed < 5 kg and would therefore not meet standard criteria for treatment with ACTs. In addition, there are few pediatric ACT formulations, and the dosing is often difficult. Therefore, data on the efficacy and safety of ACTs in young infants is urgently needed to inform optimal treatment.

The tools used in our study provided comparable estimates of the prevalence of malaria in young infants, with the exception of RDTs, which greatly underestimated the prevalence of malaria in The Gambia, possibly because of the low parasite densities. Prevalence estimates determined by microscopy and PCR were surprisingly similar, which may be due to the high sensitivity of microscopy readings conducted in a research institution with strict quality-control procedures. Using microscopy, we were able to detect parasite densities as low as 2 parasites/µL of blood; it is estimated, however, that in an average health care facility with standard microscopy, the detection threshold would be 50–100 parasites/µL of blood. In some sites, the lower prevalence by PCR, compared with RDT, may be due to persistent antigenemia from past infections in the absence of current parasitemia.

Malaria — pre-travel counseling, prophylaxis, and antiretroviral interaction considerations in children: Families traveling to malaria-endemic countries should receive pre-travel counseling, including information on insecticide-treated bed nets, N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide, and country-specific antimalarial prophylaxis (AIII), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is not recommended for antimalarial prophylaxis (AIII). Treatment of malaria is based on disease severity, patient age, parasite species, pregnancy status, and local resistance patterns where the malaria infection was acquired (AII). The choice of malaria therapy is not affected by HIV status but can be modified based on potential interactions between antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs (AIII); quinidine is not recommended for patients who are taking ritonavir (AIII) (ritonavir may be replaced if quinidine is needed for severe malaria) and should be administered with caution with atazanavir, darunavir and fosamprenavir (AIII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report updates and combines into one document earlier versions of guidelines for preventing and treating opportunistic infections (OIs) among HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children, last published in 2002 and 2004, respectively. These guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and other health-care workers providing medical care for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children in the United States. The guidelines discuss opportunistic pathogens that occur in the United States and one that might be acquired during international travel (i.e., malaria). Topic areas covered for each OI include a brief description of the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of the OI in children; prevention of exposure; prevention of disease by chemoprophylaxis and/or vaccination; discontinuation of primary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution; treatment of disease; monitoring for adverse effects during treatment; management of treatment failure; prevention of disease recurrence; and discontinuation of secondary prophylaxis after immune reconstitution. A separate document about preventing and treating of OIs among HIV-infected adults and postpubertal adolescents (Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents) was prepared by a working group of adult HIV and infectious disease specialists. The guidelines were developed by a panel of specialists in pediatric HIV infection and infectious diseases (the Pediatric Opportunistic Infections Working Group) from the U.S. government and academic institutions. For each OI, a pediatric specialist with content-matter expertise reviewed the literature for new information since the last guidelines were published; they then proposed revised recommendations at a meeting at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in June 2007. After these presentations and discussions, the guidelines underwent further revision, with review and approval by the Working Group, and final endorsement by NIH, CDC, the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA) of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society (PIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The recommendations are rated by a letter that indicates the strength of the recommendation and a Roman numeral that indicates the quality of the evidence supporting the recommendation so readers can ascertain how best to apply the recommendations in their practice environments. An important mode of acquisition of OIs, as well as HIV infection among children, is from their infected mother; HIV-infected women coinfected with opportunistic pathogens might be more likely than women without HIV infection to transmit these infections to their infants. In addition, HIV-infected women or HIV-infected family members coinfected with certain opportunistic pathogens might be more likely to transmit these infections horizontally to their children, resulting in increased likelihood of primary acquisition of such infections in the young child. Therefore, infections with opportunistic pathogens might affect not just HIV-infected infants but also HIV-exposed but uninfected infants who become infected by the pathogen because of transmission from HIV-infected mothers or family members with coinfections. These guidelines for treating OIs in children therefore consider treatment of infections among all children, both HIV-infected and uninfected, born to HIV-infected women. Additionally, HIV infection is increasingly seen among adolescents with perinatal infection now surviving into their teens and among youth with behaviorally acquired HIV infection. Although guidelines for postpubertal adolescents can be found in the adult OI guidelines, drug pharmacokinetics and response to treatment may differ for younger prepubertal or pubertal adolescents. Therefore, these guidelines also apply to treatment of HIV-infected youth who have not yet completed pubertal development. Major changes in the guidelines include 1) greater emphasis on the importance of antiretroviral therapy for preventing and treating OIs, especially those OIs for which no specific therapy exists; 2) information about the diagnosis and management of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes; 3) information about managing antiretroviral therapy in children with OIs, including potential drug — drug interactions; 4) new guidance on diagnosing of HIV infection and presumptively excluding HIV infection in infants that affect the need for initiation of prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in neonates; 5) updated immunization recommendations for HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children, including hepatitis A, human papillomavirus, meningococcal, and rotavirus vaccines; 6) addition of sections on aspergillosis; bartonella; human herpes virus-6, -7, and -8; malaria; and progressive multifocal leukodystrophy (PML); and 7) new recommendations on discontinuation of OI prophylaxis after immune reconstitution in children. The report includes six tables pertinent to preventing and treating OIs in children and two figures describing immunization recommendations for children aged 0–6 years and 7–18 years. Because treatment of OIs is an evolving science, and availability of new agents or clinical data on existing agents might change therapeutic options and preferences, these recommendations will be periodically updated and will be available at http://AIDSInfo.nih.gov.

### Chloroquine dosing recommendations for pediatric COVID-19 supported by modeling and simulation [^32aff9b2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study presents age‐adjusted CHQ doses for treatment of COVID‐19 in children across the pediatric age range. These doses support previous pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in pediatric patients with malaria showing a need for higher mg/kg doses, as compared with adults, to reach similar plasma exposures in children 6 months to 12 years. In addition, these doses account for immature drug metabolism and renal function, as reflected by the need of lower doses in children < 6 months of age, compared with older children.

We verified our model by comparing simulated and observed concentrations from published PK studies in adults and children. Mean concentration‐time profiles seemed to reasonably reflect the observed CHQ concentrations. The simulated variability tended to be smaller than that observed in children. This may be explained by rounding of the dose in the original studies, as the oral tablet formulation did not allow precise weight‐based dosing. In one study, tablets were cut into quarters and halves, in the other study, two strength tablets were used. As simulations were in the same range as the published data and generally captured central tendency of these data, the model is considered adequate for the purpose of pediatric dose extrapolation based on exposure‐matching.

As the dosing schedule proposes higher mg/kg doses than the currently licensed pediatric dose for malaria treatment, safety questions may arise. Especially as lethal toxicity in children has been reported. The children in these toxicity reports received unintentional overdoses of ~ 35–100 mg/kg CHQ (base) in a single dose. These doses are much higher than proposed here. In studies in children > 6 months with malaria, doses of 50 and 70 mg/kg (in a 3‐day schedule) were well‐tolerated, with no severe cardiac adverse event. For the youngest age groups, exposure matching should result in similar concentrations as in older children. From literature search and consultancy with malaria experts, no special safety issues for neonates emerged, only after significant overdoses. In general, children with QT prolongation had very low mortality. Nevertheless, we recommend daily monitoring of potential adverse events, including corrected QT interval prolongation by echocardiogram monitoring, before treatment and daily afterward.

### What causes severe malaria and its complications in children? Lessons learned over the past 15 years [^35bb6551]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the past 15 years, malaria mortality has reduced by approximately 50%. However, malaria still causes more than 400,000 deaths annually, most of which occur in African children under 5 years of age. Significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease provide a basis for future work to prevent severe malaria and its complications. Herein, we provide an overview of advances in our understanding of severe malaria in African children over the past 15 years, highlighting key complications and identifying priorities to further reduce malaria-associated mortality.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Malaria in HIV-infected children — antimalarial adverse effects and monitoring — Following antimalarial therapy, HIV-infected children should be monitored closely for hematologic complications (especially anemia and neutropenia), which are more frequent because of both the direct hematologic effects of HIV infection and of HIV treatment with other bone-marrow-suppressive drugs such as TMP-SMX and zidovudine. Tinnitus alone, a common (50%–75%) adverse reaction to both oral and IV quinine, usually resolves after treatment, and use of mefloquine at treatment doses may be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Many of the adverse events associated with quinine are dose-related, and because of age-related differences in the rate at which quinine is eliminated from the body, the frequency and severity of adverse effects associated with quinine drug products may be lower in children. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome caused by malaria has not been reported.

### Artemether for severe malaria [^baad40c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 2011 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended parenteral artesunate in preference to quinine as first-line treatment for people with severe malaria. Prior to this recommendation, many countries, particularly in Africa, had begun to use artemether, an alternative artemisinin derivative. This review evaluates intramuscular artemether compared with both quinine and artesunate.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of intramuscular artemether versus any other parenteral medication in treating severe malaria in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS, ISI Web of Science, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. We also searched the WHO clinical trial registry platform, ClinicalTrials.gov and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for ongoing trials up to 9 April 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intramuscular artemether with intravenous or intramuscular antimalarial for treating severe malaria.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome was all-cause death. Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data. We summarized dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD), and presented both measures with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 18 RCTs, enrolling 2662 adults and children with severe malaria, carried out in Africa (11) and in Asia (7). Artemether versus quinine For children in Africa, there is probably little or no difference in the risk of death between intramuscular artemether and quinine (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.20; 12 trials, 1447 participants, moderate quality evidence). Coma recovery may be about five hours shorter with artemether (MD -5.45, 95% CI -7.90 to -3.00; six trials, 358 participants, low quality evidence), and artemether may result in fewer neurological sequelae, but larger trials would be needed to confirm this (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.07; seven trials, 968 participants, low quality evidence). Artemether probably shortens the parasite clearance time by about nine hours (MD -9.03, 95% CI -11.43 to -6.63; seven trials, 420 participants, moderate quality evidence), and may shorten the fever clearance time by about three hours (MD -3.73, 95% CI -6.55 to -0.92; eight trials, 457 participants, low quality evidence). For adults in Asia, treatment with intramuscular artemether probably results in fewer deaths than treatment with quinine (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83; four trials, 716 participants, moderate quality evidence). Artemether versus artesunate Artemether and artesunate have not been directly compared in randomized trials in African children. For adults in Asia, mortality is probably higher with intramuscular artemether (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.97, two trials,494 participants, moderate quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is a lack of direct evidence comparing artemether with artesunate, artemether is probably less effective than artesunate at preventing deaths from severe malaria. In circumstances where artesunate is not available, artemether is an alternative to quinine.

### Evidence based optimal dosing of intravenous artesunate in children with severe falciparum malaria [^6cea007d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

The majority of deaths from malaria are in young African children. Parenteral artesunate (ARS) is the first-line treatment for severe falciparum malaria. Since 2015, the World Health Organization has recommended individual doses of 3mg/kg for children weighing < 20kg. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has challenged this recommendation, based on a simulated pediatric population, and argued for a lower dose in younger children (2.4mg/kg). In this study, we performed population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of plasma concentration data from 80 children with severe falciparum malaria in the Democratic Republic of Congo who were given 2.4mg/kg of ARS intravenously. Bayesian hierarchical modeling and a two-compartment parent drug-metabolite PK model for ARS were used to describe the population PKs of ARS and its main biologically active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. We then generated a virtual population representative of the target population in which the drug is used and simulated the total first-dose exposures. Our study shows that the majority of younger children given the lower 2.4mg/kg dose of intravenous ARS do not reach the same drug exposures as older children above 20kg. This finding supports withdrawal of the FDA's recent lower ARS dose recommendation as parenteral ARS is an extremely safe and well-tolerated drug and there is potential for harm from underdosing in this rapidly lethal infection.

### Treatment of uncomplicated malaria… [^e2b6938c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

P. falciparum infections acquired in areas with chloroquine resistance, four treatment options are available. These include artemether-lumefantrine, which is the preferred option if readily available, and atovaquone-proguanil. These are fixed-dose combination therapies that can be used for pediatric patients ≥ 5 kg. For pediatric patients, the treatment options are the same as for adults except the drug dose is adjusted by patient weight, and artemether-lumefantrine and atovaquone-proguanil can only be used in children ≥ 5 kg. The pediatric dose should never exceed the recommended adult dose. Pediatric dosing with quinine may be difficult due to unavailability of non-capsule forms of this antimalarial. If using a quinine-based regimen for children less than eight years old, doxycycline and tetracycline are generally not recommended; therefore, quinine can be given in combination with clindamycin as recommended above.

In rare instances, doxycycline or tetracycline can be used in combination with quinine in children less than eight years old if other treatment options are not available or are not tolerated, and the benefit of adding doxycycline or tetracycline is judged to outweigh the risk. For infections attributed to "species not identified" from areas with chloroquine resistance that are subsequently diagnosed as being due to. For persons with intermediate G6PD deficiency, clinicians may consider giving primaquine at 45 mg po once per week for eight weeks with close monitoring for hemolysis. Consultation with an expert in infectious disease and/or tropical medicine is advised if this alternative regimen is considered in intermediate G6PD-deficient individuals. For pediatric patients ≥ 5 kg, the treatment options for the acute phase are the same as for adults except the drug dose is adjusted by patient weight. The pediatric dose should never exceed the recommended adult dose.

In addition, for children < 8 years of age, doxycycline and tetracycline are generally not recommended; therefore, the other treatment options should be used. For pediatric patients < 5 kg, either mefloquine or quinine plus clindamycin are the only options. If those are not available or tolerated and if the treatment benefits outweigh the risks, atovaquone-proguanil or artemether-lumefantrine could be used in those instances.

Pediatric malaria treatment — first-choice dosing for children with or exposed to HIV includes Primaquine 0.5 mg base/kg body weight (max 30 mg base) by mouth once daily for 14 days. For Uncomplicated P. falciparum or Unknown Malaria Species from Chloroquine-Resistant Areas (All Malaria Areas Except Those Listed as Chloroquine Sensitive) or Unknown Region, options include Mefloquine (250-mg tablets only): 15 mg/kg body weight (maximum 750 mg) by mouth once, then 10 mg/kg body weight (maximum 500 mg) by mouth given 12 hours later. Options also include Quinine sulfate 10 mg/kg body weight (maximum 650 mg) per dose by mouth every 8 hours for 3 to 7 days, plus Clindamycin 7 mg/kg body weight per dose by mouth every 8 hours for 7 days, or doxycycline: 2.2 mg/kg body weight per dose (maximum 100 mg) given by mouth every 12 hours, or tetracycline 6–12.5 mg/kg body weight per dose by mouth given every 6 hours (maximum dose: 500 mg per dose given 4 times daily) for 7 days. Artemether-lumefantrine: 1 tablet = 20 mg Artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, a 3-day treatment schedule for a total of 6 doses; the second dose follows the initial dose 8 hours later, then 1 dose twice daily for the next 2 days, with weight-based dosing of 5 to < 15 kg; 1 tablet per dose, 15 to < 25 kg; 2 tablets per dose, 25 to < 35 kg; 3 tablets per dose, and > 35 kg; 4 tablets per dose.

### Management of severe paediatric malaria in resource-limited settings [^c5747b49]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Over 90% of the world's severe and fatal Plasmodium falciparum malaria is estimated to affect young children in sub-Sahara Africa, where it remains a common cause of hospital admission and inpatient mortality. Few children will ever be managed on high dependency or intensive care units and, therefore, rely on simple supportive treatments and parenteral anti-malarials. There has been some progress on defining best practice for antimalarial treatment with the publication of the AQUAMAT trial in 2010, involving 5,425 children at 11 centres across 9 African countries, showing that in artesunate-treated children, the relative risk of death was 22.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.1 to 36.9) lower than in those receiving quinine. Human trials of supportive therapies carried out on the basis of pathophysiology studies, have so far made little progress on reducing mortality; despite appearing to reduce morbidity endpoints, more often than not they have led to an excess of adverse outcomes. This review highlights the spectrum of complications in African children with severe malaria, the therapeutic challenges of managing these in resource-poor settings and examines in-depth the results from clinical trials with a view to identifying the treatment priorities and a future research agenda.

### WHO guidelines for malaria [^f692963c]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for malaria infection, more specifically with respect to management of severe malaria (antimalarial treatment), WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to administer a single IM dose of artesunate in adult patients if complete treatment of severe malaria is not possible but injections are available, and refer them to an appropriate facility for further care. Administer IM artemether if IM artesunate is not available. Administer IM quinine if IM artemether is not available.
