## Question

Which of the following is an example of a long-run adjustment for the owners of a small café?

Answer Choices:
A. The owners switch from whole wheat to sourdough bread.
B. The owners hire several part-time workers to cover the dinner shifts.
C. The owners work overtime on a busy weekend.
D. The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option represents a long-run adjustment for a small café. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the economic definition of long-run versus short-run decisions. Then, I should verify which choices involve changing fixed inputs versus only variable inputs. Next, I will examine each option against that framework. Finally, I will confirm the single best answer and explain why the others do not qualify as long-run adjustments.

> Let me first confirm the economic distinction. In the short run, at least one input is fixed, so firms adjust variable inputs like labor hours or materials. In the long run, all inputs are variable, allowing changes to fixed inputs such as capital and capacity, which typically require planning, financing, and time to implement.

> Now, I will examine Option A, switching bread types. Wait, let me verify whether this changes a fixed input. Changing the bread recipe is a menu or ingredient substitution; it alters a variable input (materials) and can be done quickly without changing the café's physical capacity, so this is a short-run adjustment, not a long-run one.

> Next, Option B, hiring part-time workers for dinner shifts. Hold on, I should verify the input category. Labor is a variable input in the short run; adding part-time staff adjusts capacity utilization within the existing space and equipment, so this remains a short-run decision rather than a long-run structural change.

> Option C, owners working overtime on a busy weekend. I need to ensure I'm not conflating effort with capital. Increasing owner labor hours is a short-run, variable-input response to temporary demand, not a change in fixed capacity, so this is not a long-run adjustment.

> Option D, buying the adjacent office to double seating. Let me think about this carefully. Acquiring additional real estate and expanding the physical footprint changes a fixed input (capital/capacity) and typically involves significant time, financing, and planning; this fits the definition of a long-run adjustment because all inputs become variable in the long run, enabling scale changes.

> Conclusion: Only Option D represents a long-run adjustment because it entails changing a fixed input (facility size/capacity), whereas Options A, B, and C are short-run adjustments involving variable inputs or temporary changes in labor effort.

---

The correct answer is **D. The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating**. This is a long-run adjustment because it involves changing a **fixed input** (the size of the café) and permanently increases capacity, requiring planning, investment, and time. In contrast, options A, B, and C are short-run adjustments that change variable inputs (menu, labor, or owner hours) without altering the café's fixed capacity.

---

## Definitions and distinctions

In economics, the **short run** is a period in which at least one input is fixed, while the **long run** is a period in which all inputs are variable. For a café, fixed inputs typically include the size of the premises, kitchen equipment, and seating capacity, whereas variable inputs include labor, raw materials, and utilities. Long-run adjustments involve changing fixed inputs, whereas short-run adjustments involve changing variable inputs.

---

## Analysis of each option

### Option A: Switching from whole wheat to sourdough bread

This change involves altering the type of bread used, which is a **variable input**. It does not require changing the café's fixed assets, such as the size of the premises or equipment. Therefore, this is a **short-run adjustment**.

---

### Option B: Hiring several part-time workers to cover dinner shifts

Hiring additional staff is a change in **labor**, which is a variable input. This adjustment allows the café to meet increased demand without altering its fixed capacity. Thus, this is a **short-run adjustment**.

---

### Option C: Owners working overtime on a busy weekend

Owners working overtime is a temporary increase in **labor input** without changing fixed assets. This is a **short-run adjustment** to accommodate temporary increases in demand.

---

### Option D: Buying the office next door and doubling customer seating

This option involves purchasing additional property and expanding the café's seating capacity, which is a change in a **fixed input**. This requires significant investment, planning, and time, and it permanently increases the café's capacity. Therefore, this is a **long-run adjustment**.

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **D. The owners buy the office next door, and this doubles the customer seating**. This is the only option that involves changing a fixed input, which is characteristic of a long-run adjustment. Options A, B, and C are short-run adjustments because they involve changing variable inputs without altering the café's fixed capacity.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^8247842f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society vitamin D guideline — scope and methods: The objective is to develop clinical guidelines for the use of vitamin D (cholecalciferol [vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]) to lower disease risk in individuals without established indications for vitamin D treatment or 25(OH)D testing. Background notes associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations and multiple conditions, while acknowledging that the optimal vitamin D intake and the role of testing for 25(OH)D for disease prevention remain uncertain. Methods state that the panel defined "empiric supplementation" as vitamin D intake that exceeds Dietary Reference Intakes and is implemented without 25(OH)D testing, used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and guide recommendations, and clarify that the process was not designed to replace current Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D.

### Consensus and controversial aspects of vitamin D and COVID-19 [^340ac2a4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This work aims to review and discuss controversial topics in the field of vitamin D, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and COVID-19.

Methods

The International Conferences "Controversies in Vitamin D" are a series of workshops that started in 2017 featuring international experts and leaders in vitamin D research and clinical practice. The fifth annual conference was held in Stresa, Italy, September 15 to 18, 2021.

Evidence

Before the event, participants reviewed available studies on their assigned topic, drafted a related abstract, and presented their findings at the time of the conference. Relevant literature that became available since was also discussed within the panel and updated accordingly.

Consensus

Before the event, the drafted abstracts had been merged to prepare a preliminary document. After the conference presentations, in-depth discussions in open sessions led to consensus. The document was subsequently modified according to discussions and up-to-date literature inclusion.

Conclusions

There is quite consistent evidence for an association between low 25 OH vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and poor COVID-19 outcomes, despite heterogeneous publications of variable quality. However, the low vitamin D status in COVID-19 patients might also reflect reverse causality. Vitamin D supplementation might have a positive role in COVID-19 prevention. The evidence supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D treatment in decreasing the risk of COVID-19 complications is conflicting. Conclusive statements regarding the beneficial effect of vitamin D in this context await high-quality, randomized controlled trials.

### Vitamin D and child health: part 2 (extraskeletal and other aspects) [^f52ddd92]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

The first part of this review focused on the skeletal aspects of vitamin D. This second part reviews some of the available evidence that vitamin D may have a physiological extraskeletal role beyond its traditional effect on the skeleton. This aspect has influenced the definition of vitamin D deficiency and what level of vitamin D should be regarded as optimal. The recognition of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency has led to debate as to whether and how we should be treating asymptomatic individuals. This review discusses the potential extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, the definition of vitamin D deficiency and our thoughts on indications for measurement and treatment.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### 'Vitamin D and cognition in older adults': updated international recommendations [^cfbf8017]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D, a condition that is highly prevalent in older adults aged 65 years and above, is associated with brain changes and dementia. Given the rapidly accumulating and complex contribution of the literature in the field of vitamin D and cognition, clear guidance is needed for researchers and clinicians.

Methods

International experts met at an invitational summit on 'Vitamin D and Cognition in Older Adults'. Based on previous reports and expert opinion, the task force focused on key questions relating to the role of vitamin D in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Each question was discussed and voted using a Delphi-like approach.

Results

The experts reached an agreement that hypovitaminosis D increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults and may alter the clinical presentation as a consequence of related comorbidities; however, at present, vitamin D level should not be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of Alzheimer's disease due to lack of specificity and insufficient evidence. This population should be screened for hypovitaminosis D because of its high prevalence and should receive supplementation, if necessary; but this advice was not specific to cognition. During the debate, the possibility of 'critical periods' during which vitamin D may have its greatest impact on the brain was addressed; whether hypovitaminosis D influences cognition actively through deleterious effects and/or passively by loss of neuroprotection was also considered.

Conclusions

The international task force agreed on five overarching principles related to vitamin D and cognition in older adults. Several areas of uncertainty remain, and it will be necessary to revise the proposed recommendations as new findings become available.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes trial.

The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes (D2d) study was a 22-site trial that took place from October 2013 through December 2018 in the United States. The study randomly assigned 2423 adults (mean age 60 years, mean BMI 32 kg/m²) who met at least 2 of 3 glycemic criteria for prediabetes (FG 100–125 mg/dL; 2hG 140–199 mg/dL; HbA1c 5.7–6.4%) to treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D 3 daily or placebo. The primary outcome was time-to-incident diabetes based on annual glycemic testing through FG, HbA1c and 2hG, and semiannually with FG and HbA1c. The trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508. Mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 28 ng/mL (69 nmol/L) and 78% of participants had a level ≥ 20 ng/mL (49 nmol/L) (Table 3). During follow-up, mean serum 25(OH)D level in the vitamin D group rose to 54 ng/mL compared with 29 ng/mL in the placebo group. After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, 616 diabetes events had occurred: 293 in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.4 events vs 10.7 events per 100 person-years, respectively). In the ITT analysis, the risk of diabetes was not significantly lower in the vitamin D group (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI: 0.75–1.04).

In each of these 3 studies, protocol-specified adverse events of interest (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis) were rare, and there were no significant differences between vitamin D and placebo.

### High-dose vitamin D in clinically isolated syndrome typical of multiple sclerosis: the D-lay MS randomized clinical trial [^a539a6eb]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS) and is associated with the risk of disease activity, but data on the benefits of supplementation are conflicting.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose cholecalciferol as monotherapy in reducing disease activity in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) typical for MS.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The D-Lay MS trial was a parallel, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 MS centers in France. Patients were enrolled from July 2013 to December 2020 (final follow-up on January 18, 2023). Untreated patients with CIS aged 18 to 55 years with CIS duration less than 90 days, serum vitamin D concentration less than 100 nmol/L, and diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) meeting 2010 criteria for dissemination in space or 2 or more lesions and presence of oligoclonal bands were recruited.

Intervention

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU (n = 163) or placebo (n = 153) every 2 weeks for 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was disease activity, defined as occurrence of a relapse and/or MRI activity (new and/or contrast-enhancing lesions) over 24 months of follow-up, also analyzed as separate secondary outcomes.

Results

Of the 316 participants enrolled and randomized (median [IQR] age, 34 [28–42] years; 70% women), the primary analysis included 303 patients (95.9%) who took at least 1 dose of the study drug and 288 (91.1%) ultimately completed the 24-month trial. Disease activity was observed in 94 patients (60.3%) in the vitamin D group and 109 patients (74.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.50–0.87]; P = 0.004), and median time to disease activity was longer in the vitamin D group (432 vs 224 days; log-rank P = 0.003). All 3 secondary MRI outcomes reported significant differences favoring the vitamin D group vs the placebo group: MRI activity (89 patients [57.1%] vs 96 patients [65.3%]; HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.53–0.95]; P = 0.02), new lesions (72 patients [46.2%] vs 87 patients [59.2%]; HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.44–0.84]; P = 0.003), and contrast-enhancing lesions (29 patients [18.6%] vs 50 patients [34.0%]; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30–0.75]; P = 0.001). All 10 secondary clinical outcomes showed no significant difference, including relapse, which occurred in 28 patients (17.9%) in the vitamin D group vs 32 (21.8%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.42–1.16]; P = 0.16). Results were similar in a subset of 247 patients meeting updated 2017 diagnostic criteria for relapsing-remitting MS at treatment initiation. Severe adverse events occurred in 17 patients in the vitamin D group and 13 in the placebo group, none of which were related to cholecalciferol.

Conclusions and Relevance

Oral cholecalciferol 100 000 IU every 2 weeks significantly reduced disease activity in CIS and early relapsing-remitting MS. These results warrant further investigation, including the potential role of pulse high-dose vitamin D as add-on therapy.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^64721196]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D intake targets and testing policy note that "The panel assumed that all should follow the Recommended Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)", specifying "The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) in the DRI is 600 IU (15 μg) for persons aged 1–70 years and 800 IU (20 μg) for persons older than 70 years", and in pregnancy "600 IU (15 μg)". For people "older than 50 years" with an indication for treatment, "the panel suggests supplementation via daily administration of vitamin D, rather than intermittent high doses". The panel also "suggests against routine 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing for generally healthy individuals who do not otherwise have established indications", citing feasibility concerns that "access to accurate 25(OH)D testing is variable across the globe, and an approach requiring such testing may not be feasible in some settings". The scope further notes, "this guideline does not address individuals with underlying conditions that substantially alter vitamin D physiology".

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^352eb3b6]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (health system-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of health system-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (688 female, 472 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 health system-based care (care provided by an advanced practice dementia care specialist) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.8 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.33, 95% CI -1.32 to 0.67). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.7 points vs. 10.6 points; MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.7 to 0.99) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.7 points vs. 4.69 points; MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.55) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.1 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.7, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14). In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (health system-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, health system-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### Differential effects of vitamin D2 and D3 supplements on 25-hydroxyvitamin D level are dose, sex, and time dependent: a randomized controlled trial [^90ea54aa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D (D) supplements are indispensable for its world-wide deficiency. Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.

Methods

We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000 IU over/140 days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules' content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2 + 25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.

Results

Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC 140) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (p < 0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC 140 was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, p = 0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, p = 0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC 140 was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, p = 0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, p = 0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4 nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (p < 0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (r = 0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (r = 0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn't increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC 7) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118–243% higher and 31–39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC 7 of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC 7 of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (p < 0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.

Conclusions

Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^6b87d302]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy. This review: 1) describes how D-dimer is generated; 2) reviews the assays used for its detection; and 3) discusses the role of D-dimer determination in these various conditions.

### Association of vitamin D status and other clinical characteristics with COVID-19 test results [^11cfb558]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is vitamin D status, reflecting vitamin D levels and treatment, associated with test results for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 489 patients who had a vitamin D level measured in the year before COVID-19 testing, the relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times greater for patients with likely deficient vitamin D status compared with patients with likely sufficient vitamin D status, a difference that was statistically significant.

Meaning

These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.

### Vitamin D supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus: to D or not to D? [^08be1b6f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Answers to clinically important questions are rarely dichotomous ("positive" or "negative"), and a recommendation of whether "to D or not to D" should be made based on the best available data from both observational studies and clinical trials. Results from trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. We are awaiting the full publication of the DPVD study and results from individual participant data meta-analyses. Even if the risk reduction with vitamin D supplementation may appear relatively small, when applied in the expanding prediabetes population, it can have important public health implications.

Vitamin D — adults aged 50 to 74 years (supplementation): In the general population aged 50 to 74 years, we suggest against routine vitamin D supplementation beyond the recommended Dietary Reference Intake for this population. This recommendation relates to empiric vitamin D supplementation that exceeds the DRIs established by the IOM, and adults in this age group should follow the Recommended Daily Allowance established by the IOM (600 IU [15 μg] daily for those aged 50 to 70 years; 800 IU [20 μg] daily for those older than 70 years).

### Avoidance of vitamin D deficiency to slow the COVID-19 pandemic [^0b7242c7]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

How much vitamin D should people get?

A very important first step would be to ensure that all people get at least as much vitamin D with a dietary supplement as recommended for the various countries. The recommended daily amount is 400 IU in the UK. US recommendations are 600 IU for adults up to 70 years of age, and 800 IU for people over the age of 70. Individuals with known risk factors need more, but current recommendations are silent on their specific needs. Higher intakes are likely safe as long as the amounts are well under 4000 IU per day.

### Vitamin D supplementation and major cardiovascular events: D-health randomised controlled trial [^07040a2b]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study D-Health was published by Bridie Thompson and colleagues in 2023 in the journal BMJ. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Acute ischemic stroke. In the D-Health study, the trial question was: what is the role of vitamin D supplementation in older adults? In the D-Health study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the D-Health study, the population was: 21302 patients (9777 female, 11525 male). The inclusion criteria were adult participants aged 60–84 years. The key exclusion criteria were self-reported hypercalcemia; hyperparathyroidism; kidney stones; osteomalacia; sarcoidosis; receipt of > 500 IU/day supplemental vitamin D; or unable to give consent because of language or cognitive impairment. In the D-Health study, the interventions were: n = 10658 vitamin D (oral dose of 60,000 IU/month for 5 years) n = 10644 placebo (matching oral placebo for 5 years). In the D-Health study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in major cardiovascular event (6% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.01). In the D-Health study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in myocardial infarction (1.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.98) No significant difference in coronary revascularization (3.9% vs. 4.3%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01) No significant difference in stroke (1.6% vs. 1.6%; HR 0.99, 99% CI 0.8 to 1.23). In the D-Health study, the conclusion was: in adult participants aged 60–84 years, vitamin D was not superior to placebo with respect to major cardiovascular event.

### Vitamin D supplementation and prevention of type 2 diabetes [^2f3dcb14]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Observational studies support an association between a low blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, whether vitamin D supplementation lowers the risk of diabetes is unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned adults who met at least two of three glycemic criteria for prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose level, 100 to 125 mg per deciliter; plasma glucose level 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, 140 to 199 mg per deciliter; and glycated hemoglobin level, 5.7 to 6.4%) and no diagnostic criteria for diabetes to receive 4000 IU per day of vitamin D 3 or placebo, regardless of the baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. The primary outcome in this time-to-event analysis was new-onset diabetes, and the trial design was event-driven, with a target number of diabetes events of 508.

Results

A total of 2423 participants underwent randomization (1211 to the vitamin D group and 1212 to the placebo group). By month 24, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in the vitamin D group was 54.3 ng per milliliter (from 27.7 ng per milliliter at baseline), as compared with 28.8 ng per milliliter in the placebo group (from 28.2 ng per milliliter at baseline). After a median follow-up of 2.5 years, the primary outcome of diabetes occurred in 293 participants in the vitamin D group and 323 in the placebo group (9.39 and 10.66 events per 100 person-years, respectively). The hazard ratio for vitamin D as compared with placebo was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.04; P = 0.12). The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among persons at high risk for type 2 diabetes not selected for vitamin D insufficiency, vitamin D 3 supplementation at a dose of 4000 IU per day did not result in a significantly lower risk of diabetes than placebo.

### Vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 virus / COVID-19 disease [^bf533f9a]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, we recommend appropriate vitamin D RCTs to evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 infections. Until there is more robust scientific evidence for vitamin D, we strongly caution against the use of high vitamin D supplementation (greater than the upper limit of 4000 IU/day (100 µg/day)). Rather, we strongly endorse avoidance of vitamin D deficiencyin the population (as per the six points above) and complete adherence to government's advice worldwide on the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^77a6fed7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^6e822497]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Because the numerous epidemiological and experimental data indicate the beneficial role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of several types of cancers, clinical use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs has been investigated. However, hypercalcemia, the major toxic effect of vitamin D, has strongly limited its clinical applications. Moreover, accumulating data suggest that cancer cells employ several mechanisms that reduce cellular calcitriol levels, as well as diminish its function to protect themselves from the antitumorigenic effects of vitamin D. Thus, understanding how vitamin D metabolism and signaling are dysregulated in cancer will help develop efficient therapeutic strategies to overcome such limitations of using vitamin D or its analogs for clinical purpose.

In this review, we provide an overview of vitamin D metabolic pathways and summarize antitumorigenic functions and mechanisms of vitamin D. In addition, we discuss how vitamin D metabolism and function are dysregulated in cancer to promote resistance to the antitumorigenic effect of vitamin D. Finally, we discuss future directions to overcome the limitations of and improve vitamin D-based cancer therapy.

### Early high-dose vitamin dfor critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients [^7defd525]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is a common, potentially reversible contributor to morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. The potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in acute critical illness require further study.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of early vitamin D 3 supplementation in critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients who were at high risk for death. Randomization occurred within 12 hours after the decision to admit the patient to an intensive care unit. Eligible patients received a single enteral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D 3 or matched placebo. The primary end point was 90-day all-cause, all-location mortality.

Results

A total of 1360 patients were found to be vitamin D-deficient during point-of-care screening and underwent randomization. Of these patients, 1078 had baseline vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level, < 20 ng per milliliter [50 nmol per liter]) confirmed by subsequent testing and were included in the primary analysis population. The mean day 3 level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 46.9 ± 23.2 ng per milliliter (117 ± 58 nmol per liter) in the vitamin D group and 11.4 ± 5.6 ng per milliliter (28 ± 14 nmol per liter) in the placebo group (difference, 35.5 ng per milliliter; 95% confidence interval [CI] 31.5 to 39.6). The 90-day mortality was 23.5% in the vitamin D group (125 of 531 patients) and 20.6% in the placebo group (109 of 528 patients) (difference, 2.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.1 to 7.9; P = 0.26). There were no clinically important differences between the groups with respect to secondary clinical, physiological, or safety end points. The severity of vitamin D deficiency at baseline did not affect the association between the treatment assignment and mortality.

Conclusions

Early administration of high-dose enteral vitamin D 3 did not provide an advantage over placebo with respect to 90-day mortality or other, nonfatal outcomes among critically ill, vitamin D-deficient patients.

### Health system, community-based, or usual dementia care for persons with dementia and caregivers: the D-CARE randomized clinical trial [^4bbdb1a9]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study D-CARE (community-based care) was published by David B Reuben and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Dementia. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the trial question was: what is the role of community-based care in community-dwelling persons living with dementia? In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the population was: 1160 patients (660 female, 500 male). The inclusion criteria were community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers. The key exclusion criteria were nursing home resident; hospice care; paid caregiver not a relative or close friend; cognitively impaired caregiver; unwilling or unable to provide self-reported outcome measures for 18 months. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the interventions were: n = 1016 community-based care (care provided by a social worker, nurse, or licensed therapist care consultant) n = 144 usual care (care corresponding to traditional care). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score (9.5 points vs. 10.1 points; MD -0.62, 95% CI -1.61 to 0.37). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in least squares means for Modified Caregiver Strain Index (10.5 points vs. 10.6 points; MD -0.1, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.74) No significant difference in PHQ-8 score (4.42 points vs. 4.69 points; MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.81 to 0.27) Significant increase in Caregiver Self-Efficacy score (15.2 points vs. 14.4 points; MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.29). In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death and hospitalizations. In the D-CARE (community-based care) study, the conclusion was: in community-dwelling persons living with dementia and their caregivers, community-based care was not superior to usual care with respect to least squares means for Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire severity score.

### Maternal vitamin D ₃ supplementation at 50 μ g / D protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation [^844f0282]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants. Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration after birth is unknown.

Objectives

We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (> 30, > 40, > 50, and > 75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age.

Design

Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 μg vitamin D₃/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum.

Results

At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)] infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-μg/d [75 (67, 83)] than in the 25-μg/d [52 (45, 58)] or 10-μg/d [45 (38, 52)] vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration < 30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-μg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-μg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-μg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (∼98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-μg/d [88 (84, 91)] than in the 25-μg/d [78 (74, 81)] or 10-μg/d [69 (66, 73)] groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 μg vitamin D₃/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 μg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^00932b9a]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Context

Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 have been hypothesized to exert differential effects on vitamin D metabolism.

Objective

To compare the influence of administering vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D3.

Methods

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [24R,25(OH)2D3], 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], and 4β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [4β,25(OH)2D3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D2 (n = 28) or vitamin D3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D3 to D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Vitamin D3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D3, 24R,25(OH)2D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, and 4β,25(OH)2D3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3. Participants receiving vitamin D2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D3 to vitamin D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 than those receiving vitamin D3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 and 4β,25(OH)2D3 to 25(OH)D3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 and 1-α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3.

### A conservative dialysis strategy and kidney function recovery in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury: the liberation from acute dialysis (LIBERATE-D) randomized clinical trial [^5c1885b1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

For patients with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury, persistent need for dialysis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, high health care use, and poor quality of life.

Objective

To test the effect of a conservative dialysis strategy on recovery of kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, unblinded, randomized superiority trial enrolled participants with dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury who had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m², had already initiated kidney replacement therapy, and were hemodynamically stable, with planned intermittent hemodialysis between January 23, 2020, and March 10, 2025, at 4 clinical sites in the United States. Of 909 patients assessed for eligibility, 221 were randomized and 220 received the allocated intervention. The date of last follow-up was June 10, 2025.

Intervention

With the conservative dialysis strategy, participants received dialysis only when specific metabolic or clinical indications were met. Participants in the conventional dialysis group received dialysis 3 times per week until urine output or creatinine clearance criteria were met.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary study end point was unadjusted kidney function recovery at hospital discharge, defined as being alive and not receiving dialysis, with at least 14 consecutive days without dialysis (including after discharge). Two prespecified key secondary end points were the number of dialysis sessions per week and the number of dialysis-free days to day 28.

Results

The mean age of participants was 56 years (SD, 16 years). A total of 148 of 220 participants (67%) were male, 28 (13%) were Black, and 133 (60%) were White. Mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 64.8 mL/min/1.73 m² (SD, 30.9 mL/min/1.73 m²). Participants had started kidney replacement therapy a median of 9 days (IQR, 5–18.5 days) before randomization. In the conservative dialysis intervention group, 70 of 109 participants (64%) achieved kidney function recovery at hospital discharge vs 55 of 109 participants (50%) in the conventional dialysis control group (difference, 13.8% [95% CI, 0.8%-26.8%; P = 0.04]; unadjusted odds ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.02–3.03; P = 0.04]; after prespecified adjustment: odds ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.86–2.84; P = 0.15]). Participants in the conservative dialysis group received fewer dialysis sessions per week (median, 1.8 [IQR, 0–2.6] vs 3.1 [IQR, 2.6–3.5]; difference, -1.4 [95% CI, -1.8 to -1.0]) and recovered earlier (21 [IQR, 0–28] vs 5 [IQR, 0–21] consecutive dialysis-free days to day 28; difference, 16 days [95% CI, 5–27]). Dialysis-associated hypotension occurred less frequently in the conservative dialysis group (69 vs 97 events).

Conclusions and Relevance

A conservative dialysis strategy in dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury resulted in a shorter time to and higher rates of recovery of kidney function in the unadjusted analysis. Given uncertainty regarding the estimated effect size, this approach should be tested in a larger study population.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^182f23e4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — evidence for diabetes prevention in adults with prediabetes: The commissioned systematic review included 11 RCTs on new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes (total of 5316 participants), conducted in India (n = 4), Iran (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Norway (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and the United States (n = 3). In pooled analyses, vitamin D reduced the risk of developing diabetes (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–1.00]), and including the DPVD trial produced similar results (RR 0.90 [95% CI, 0.81–0.99]). An individual participant data meta-analysis of the 3 vitamin D trials (total of 4190 participants) showed a 15% reduction in new-onset diabetes in adults with prediabetes randomized to vitamin D compared to placebo (HR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75–0.96]). The beneficial effect of vitamin D on diabetes risk was described as consistent across subgroups by risk of bias or vitamin D dosage.

We measured baseline and 4-month serum concentrations of vitamin D 3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 [25(OH)D 3], 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2, 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [24R,25(OH) 2 D 3], 1 α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3], and 4 β,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3] in 52 adults randomized to receive a total of four oral bolus doses of 2.5 mg vitamin D 2 (n = 28) or vitamin D 3 (n = 24) over four months. Metabolite-to-parent compound ratios were calculated to estimate hydroxylase activity. Pairwise before vs after comparisons were made to evaluate effects of vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 on metabolism of vitamin D. Mean postsupplementation metabolite-to-parent ratios were then compared between groups.

Results

Vitamin D 2 was less effective than vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Vitamin D 2 suppressed mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3, while increasing the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Vitamin D 3 increased mean four-month serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 3, 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3, 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3, and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 and the mean ratio of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3. Participants receiving vitamin D 2 had lower mean postsupplementation ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to vitamin D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 than those receiving vitamin D 3. Mean postsupplementation ratios of 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 and 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

Bolus-dose vitamin D 2 is less effective than bolus-dose vitamin D 3 in elevating total serum 25(OH)D concentration. Administration of vitamin D 2 reduces 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D 3 and 1- α hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3, while increasing 24R-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D 3.

### Daprodustat for the treatment of anemia in patients undergoing dialysis [^6ac48db1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study ASCEND-D was published by Ajay K Singh and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Anemia of chronic kidney disease and Chronic kidney disease. In the ASCEND-D study, the trial question was: is daprodustat noninferior to ESAs for anemia in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis? In the ASCEND-D study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ASCEND-D study, the population was: 2964 patients (1266 female, 1698 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD undergoing dialysis and who had a hemoglobin level of 8.0–11.5 g/dL. The key exclusion criteria were anemia unrelated to CKD; recent cardiovascular event; current or recent cancer; kidney transplant; transferrin saturation; gastrointestinal bleeding; myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome; stroke or TIA ≤ 4 weeks prior to screening through to randomization. In the ASCEND-D study, the interventions were: n = 1487 daprodustat (starting dose of 4–12 mg/day with stepped dose adjustment from 1–24 mg) n = 1477 ESAs (epoetin alfa if receipt of hemodialysis or darbepoetin alfa if receipt of peritoneal dialysis). In the ASCEND-D study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in mean improvement in hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 (0.28 g/dL vs. 0.1 g/dL; MD 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.24). In the ASCEND-D study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular event (25.2% vs. 26.7%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07) Significant decrease in major adverse cardiovascular event or thromboembolic event (33.4% vs. 36.8%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1) No significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular event or hospitalization for HF (28.6% vs. 29.3%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11). In the ASCEND-D study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major adverse cardiovascular event, serious adverse events. In the ASCEND-D study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis and who had a hemoglobin level of 8.0–11.5 g/dL, daprodustat was noninferior to ESAs with respect to mean improvement in hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52.

### Vitamin D deficiency is associated with COVID-19 positivity and severity of the disease [^d63feb1f]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

The present study examined the relationship between polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positivity and clinical outcomes of vitamin D levels measured within the 6 months before the PCR test in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 (227) and non-COVID-19 patients (260) were divided into four groups according to their vitamin D levels: Group I (0-10ng/ml), Group II (10-20ng/ml), Group III (20-30ng/ml), and Group IV (vitamin D > 30ng/ml). Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019-November 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID-19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements. This search yielded 260 patients with tested vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels were below 30ng/ml in 94.27% of 227 COVID-19-positive patients (average age, 46.32 ± 1.24 years [range, 20–80 years] and 56.54% women) while 93.07% of 260 non-COVID-19 patients (average age, 44.63 ± 1.30 years [range, 18–75 years] and 59.50% women) had vitamin D levels below 30ng/ml. Nevertheless, very severe vitamin D deficiency (< 10ng/ml) was considerably more common in COVID-19 patients (44%) (average age, 44.15 ± 1.89 years [range, 23–80 years] and 57.57% women) than in non-COVID-19 ones (31%) (average age, 46.50 ± 2.21 years [range, 20–75 years] and 62.5% women). Among COVID-19-positive patients, the group with vitamin D levels of > 30ng/ml had significantly lower D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, number levels, number of affected lung segments and shorter hospital stays. No difference was found among the groups in terms of age and gender distribution. Elevated vitamin D levels could decrease COVID-19 PCR positivity, D-dime and CRP levels and the number of affected lung segments in COVID-19-positive patients, thereby shortening the duration of hospital stays and alleviating the intensity of COVID-19.

### Differential effects of oral boluses of vitamin D2 vs vitamin D3 on vitamin D metabolism: a randomized controlled trial [^a79b1616]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to evaluate the influence of vitamin D 2 on circulating concentrations of parent vitamin D 3 and its dihydroxylated metabolite 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 in addition to serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 2 and 25(OH)D 3. We found that administration of vitamin D 2 exerted a greater inhibitory effect than administration of vitamin D 3 on mean ratios of 25(OH)D 3 to D 3 and 1 α,25(OH) 2 D 3 to 25(OH)D 3 in the circulation. We also observed that vitamin D 2 and vitamin D 3 increased the mean 24R,25(OH) 2 D 3 -to-25(OH)D 3 ratio to a similar extent, and that neither form of vitamin D had a statistically significant effect on the mean serum 4 β,25(OH) 2 D 3 -to-25(OH)D 3 ratio. By contrast with findings of a recently published study, we found that administration of vitamin D 3 did not suppress serum concentrations of 25(OH)D 2, nor did it influence mean serum 25(OH)D 2 -to-vitamin D 2 ratio. Administration of vitamin D 2 resulted in an increase in the mean 25(OH)D 2 -to-D 2 ratio.

### Evidences for a protective role of vitamin D in COVID-19 [^871324c7]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 should have baseline serum 25(OH)D concentrations measured and must be supplemented at least to a level ≥ 30 ng/mL (optimal 40–60), especially when the baseline level is < 10 ng/mL and such deficiency is significantly more present in male patients.

In conclusion, we might suggest in COVID-19 patients with 25(OH)D serum levels under 20 ng/mL that the usual recommended dose for correction of deficiency should be 6000–7000 oral IU/day for the first 6–8 weeks. For maintenance, the dose should varies from 2000 to 3000 oral IU/day depending on the age and clinical condition of the patient up to achieve the suggested concentrations.

### D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [^511e057a]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Abnormal coagulation function has been demonstrated to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19. However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study was aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed, and coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis.

Results

In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function, and a significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 μg/ml [interquartile range 0.9–4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3–1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones, on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the current study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.31, p < 0.001) μg/ml compared to those with non-severe disease, and odds of severe infection was associated with D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16–15.44, p < 0.001) on admission.

Conclusions

Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher level of D-dimer than those with non-severe disease, and D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml is associated with severe infection in patients with COVID-19.

### A neural circuit encoding the experience of copulation in female drosophila [^410ac18a]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Female behavior changes profoundly after mating. In Drosophila, the mechanisms underlying the long-term changes led by seminal products have been extensively studied. However, the effect of the sensory component of copulation on the female's internal state and behavior remains elusive. We pursued this question by dissociating the effect of coital sensory inputs from those of male ejaculate. We found that the sensory inputs of copulation cause a reduction of post-coital receptivity in females, referred to as the "copulation effect". We identified three layers of a neural circuit underlying this phenomenon. Abdominal neurons expressing the mechanosensory channel Piezo convey the signal of copulation to female-specific ascending neurons, LSANs, in the ventral nerve cord. LSANs relay this information to neurons expressing myoinhibitory peptides in the brain. We hereby provide a neural mechanism by which the experience of copulation facilitates females encoding their mating status, thus adjusting behavior to optimize reproduction.

Regression models for well-being (annual changes)

First, we consider the year-by-year changes, captured in an FE model by including an indicator (constant offset) d i for each country (this is equivalent to subtracting the mean value for each country):

Alternatively, we may model the 1-year changes in an FD equation, as follows:

With finite samples, (3) and (4) do not give identical estimates. Moreover, because our panel is not perfectly balanced, some observations are dropped when estimating (4). Because of this, and the inherent higher efficiency of the FE estimator, we favor (3) but show estimates of both.

As described in the Methods section, we wish to be able to compare the estimated effects of one predictor variable to another — that is, to ascribe relative importance to changes in different predictor variables. For the FD estimator, this is straightforward, as we can construct normalized versions of observed 1-year changes, in analogy to (3):

The term β j in (5) explains the distribution of 1-year changes in S, such that β j is the number of standard deviations of change in Δ S associated with 1 s.d. change in Δ x j, where these variances are calculated across observed 1-year changes.

In order to express the relative importance of estimates from the FE estimator, (3), we use the same standard deviations of FD to transform thein (3) to

Estimatinghas the advantages overmentioned above (efficiency, more inclusion) for FE.

Regression models for well-being (2P changes)

The third method constructs an equation with only two observations per country, the early period and the later period (2005–2007 and 2014–2016), in order to model longer-run changes δx j and δS. In this context, the FE and FD estimators are identical; thus, we write simply

Analogously to the methods above, we define the standardized coefficientsusing the standard deviation of longer-run changes across countries. This estimate has fewer observations than those modeling annual changes, and the confidence intervals are slightly looser.

As mentioned in the Discussion, we also consider moderation effects between variables in the 2P model by testing pairwise interaction terms, detailed in Supplementary Note 3. We find a significant moderation effect only between GDP and freedom of choice.

### Impacts of climate change on global agriculture accounting for adaptation [^bc3f062f]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Because our data span climatic zones around the world, we are able to empirically measure how adaptive practices in different climates mediate the influence of environmental conditions (Fig. 1d, f and Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). This 'reduced-form' approach does not provide the granular detail contained in process-based models but it does account for the net consequence of nearly all climate-associated adaptive actions available to producers, without requiring that each is explicitly modelled or observed. For example, our approach accounts for adaptive actions such as selecting a varietal with an earlier harvest date to avoid late-season heat exposure, adjusting typical fertilizer use conditional on socioeconomic conditions and adjusting typical irrigation water use conditional on access to irrigation, along with many other available adaptive measures. Notably, our approach does not account for altering the area planted to a given crop (that is, crop switching, although we do account for this in our valuation of climate impacts) and shifting the planting date outside present growing season windows (although we do account for varietal selections with earlier harvest dates).

Our final global model for each crop is high dimensional, nonlinear and dependent on the underlying economic and climatic characteristics of each location — but nonetheless fully interpretable. Each crop model includes several measures of weather that are all interacted with several measures of climate, as well as income and possibly irrigation (Extended Data Fig. 1c). This approach allows yields in a given year and location to be computed by (1) weather in that location–year, which is an argument to (2) a location–year function determined by crop-specific measures of climate, income and irrigation. The resulting models are relatively parsimonious compared with global process-based models, because the influence of many other factors not explicitly included in the model (for example, soil type and quality) is captured non-parametrically (Methods and Supplementary Information, section B). However, these parsimonious models are skilful. Our model outperforms process-based model benchmarks globally across crops and regionally over 81% of crop–country pairs (Supplementary Information, section F and Extended Data Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, in a ground-truth exercise, our model reproduces variation in local yields (R² values from 0.63 (cassava) to 0.88 (rice); Extended Data Fig. 5), including over localized regions in our data representing both high and low values of average yields and cropping intensity (Extended Data Fig. 6).

Cross-validation step two: selection of variables that capture adaptation

In our second cross-validation step, we select a set of covariate interactions for which covariates reflect the factors that mediate producer adaptation actions, (equation (B.7)). We take as given the set of weather parameters selected from the first step, allowing for interactions between weather variables and income, irrigation, and/or. Further, we allow for the nonlinear precipitation response to vary over phases of the growing season or to be constant over the growing season, with 'phases' of the growing season defined by a systematic model search (Supplementary Table 4). Finally, we also allow for interaction terms between degree day responses and monthly precipitation.

Accounting for mediating effects of income and irrigation is important because access to resources alters producer actions through several channels — such as access to technology –, insurance and credit markets, inputs such as fertilizer, or labour markets, or information. Notably, this minimizes confounding in our estimates, as resources and climate tend to be correlated (for example, poorer nations tend to be located in the tropics) and it allows our model to capture that climate and income jointly determine yields. Further, this allows us to project future changes associated with economic development.

In this step, we use cross-validation with ten folds over random blocks of data grouped by state/province. Here the test of model performance is the ability to model yields for a set of states or provinces that are held out of the data. This matches one of the intended uses of our interaction surface, which is to model the heterogeneous response of yields to weather for locations with no yield data available.

In our climate projections, long-run average precipitation values range more than 17 standard deviations outside the mean in our historical data. To prevent extrapolating adaptation behaviour tovalues far outside our data, we imposed a single-knot linear spline infor each weather measure (, andbelow). These knots were chosen using a within- R² search over knot locations (Supplementary Information, section D). See Supplementary Information, sections B– D for further estimation details.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^38cfaf49]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of modifiable risk factors, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to address potentially modifiable risk factors to reduce exacerbations exacerbations and minimize oral corticosteroid use in patients with asthma:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Any patient with ≥ 1 risk factors for exacerbations, including poor symptom control|- Ensure an ICS-containing treatment is prescribed < br > -; switch to a regimen with an anti-inflammatory reliever with ICS-formoterol or ICS-formoterol-short-acting β-agonist, if available, to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared with short-acting β-agonist reliever < br > -; provide a written action plan appropriate for the patient's health literacy < br > -; obtain more frequent monitoring than in low-risk patients < br > -; check inhaler technique and adherence frequently, correct as needed < br > -; identify and manage any modifiable risk factors|
| ≥ 1 severe exacerbation in last year|- Switch to a regimen with an anti-inflammatory reliever with as-needed ICS-formoterol or ICS-short-acting β-agonist, if available, to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared with short-acting β-agonist reliever < br > -, and refer for specialist opinion and consideration of biologic therapy. < br > -; identify and manage any avoidable triggers for exacerbations|
|Exposure to tobacco smoke or e-cigarettes|- Encourage smoking cessation by patient/family < br > -; provide counseling and resources < br > -; consider offering higher-dose of ICSs if asthma is poorly controlled|
|Low FEV1, especially if < 60% of predicted|- Address problems with adherence and inhaler technique < br > -; consider offering a trial of high-dose ICSs for 3 months < br > -; exclude other lung diseases, such as COPD < br > -; refer for expert advice if there is no improvement|
|Obesity|- Offer weight reduction strategies < br > -; distinguish asthma symptoms from symptoms due to deconditioning, mechanical restriction, and/or sleep apnea|
|Major psychological problems|- Refer for mental health assessment < br > - Help the patient to distinguish between symptoms of anxiety and asthma < br > - Counsel about the management of panic attacks|
|Major socioeconomic problems|- Identify the most cost-effective ICS-based regimen < br > -; optimize inhaler technique to maximize benefit from available medications|
|Confirmed food allergy|- Advise appropriate food avoidance < br > - Provide anaphylaxis action plan < br > - Prescribe injectable epinephrine < br > - Refer for expert advice|
|Occupational or domestic exposure to irritants|- Remove the patient from exposure as soon as possible < br > -; refer for expert advice as soon as possible|
|Allergen exposure if sensitized|- Advise a trial of simple avoidance strategies, taking the cost into account < br > -; consider stepping up asthma treatment if exposure is unavoidable < br > -; consider adding subcutaneous immunotherapy in symptomatic house dust mite-sensitive adult and adolescent patients with partially-controlled asthma despite ICSs, provided FEV1 is > 70% of predicted|
|High fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide in patients taking medium- or high-dose ICS|- Check and improve adherence|
|Sputum eosinophilia despite medium-/high-dose ICSs|- Consider increasing ICS dose independent of the level of symptom control|

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^380f4748]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Finalizing recommendations — recommendations are formulated by content experts informed by the evidence; cost considerations may be included only if published formal cost-benefit analyses are available, with resource consultants or health economists conducting analyses as needed, and when cost constraints exist implementers are encouraged to use ADAPTE strategies; patient values and preferences are reflected in recommendations or remarks and are especially pertinent in weaker recommendations when wide variability in choices is anticipated; recommendations must be specific and actionable with as much detail as evidence allows, and measure developers are cautioned not to convert lower-evidence recommendations into performance measures.

### Occupational disease and injury | Field epi manual | CDC… [^bc4ebe8f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

- Management controls access to workplaces and on-site worker populations. Even with regulatory or statutory access for public health concerns, field epidemiologists benefit by developing trust with sensitivity to management concerns and clarity about public health procedures.
- Economic concerns may derive from workers' compensation claims or insurance rates. If a field investigation demonstrates product hazards, employers may encounter third-party lawsuits from workers in companies downstream that purchase a product. Even consumers of downstream company products may bring suit against the upstream manufacturer of a hazardous ingredient, as occurred in the manufacture of microwave popcorn with the butter flavoring diacetyl, which causes obliterative bronchiolitis. The use of contract labor has been growing for years.

Employment arrangements, such as those involving both a contracting agency employer and a worksite employer, can complicate field investigations by introducing ambiguity about responsibility for workplace health and safety and workplace access. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has had experience with contracting agencies not allowing their employees to participate in public health investigations of the worksite employer. On the other hand, the California Department of Public Health required flavor manufacturers to include contract employees in monitoring for possible flavoring-related pulmonary function abnormalities. The field epidemiologist should explore the complexities of employment because contract employees may be at the highest risk for workplace injury and illness.

The likelihood of success in an occupational investigation might increase if the public health investigator anticipates participation anxieties by labor stakeholders who might perceive their employment as increasingly precarious and fear plant closure or loss of a contingent labor contract. For many occupational diseases, physicians can treat patients without considering an occupational cause. For example, occupational asthma, which accounts for at least 15% of adult-onset asthma, could respond to pharmacologic treatment even though removal from the inciting workplace exposure early in the clinical course can result in permanent cure. Patients with carpal tunnel neuropathy may undergo surgery, when eliminating occupational repetitive motion of the wrist in nonneutral positions can relieve symptoms and progression. Ultimately, these collective investigative efforts underlie the proposal of regulations to protect employees in diverse settings. Challenges and Opportunities.

This "healthy worker survivor effect" can result in underestimation of work-related disease when only the current workforce is studied, or it might obscure the exposures associated with disease onset when only current job is considered and miss persons who have transferred to another area to diminish work-related symptoms. Management resistance. Management resistance to worker requests for public health assistance and access to workplaces for investigation can present additional challenges.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Regional trade agreement burdens global carbon emissions mitigation [^ad27bd92]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Table 2
GVC participation and emission intensity.

Note: ✱ p < 0.01.

 P < 0.05.

✱ p < 0.1.

Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

The variables "forward" and "backward" refer to as "forward participation" and "backward participation", respectively (Supplementary Note 2). Variables of GVC participation and emission intensity are in natural logarithms. The adjusted R² for all regressions is larger than 0.65. The sample covers 36 sectors for 64 economies over 11 years (2005–2015). d r denotes the development stage. Developed countries (d r = 1) refer to as high-income economies and developing countries (d r = 0) refer to as middle- and low-income economies, which are classified according to World Bank's income classification in 2005. The notations (-1), (-3), and the rest denote a lag of 1-year, 3-year, etc.

Backward GVC participation has no significant effects until an extended time period (about 3–5 years). The effects do not materialize in the short run. Deeper backward participation indicates that a country increases its imports of intermediate inputs to process into products for domestic consumption and/or export. It does not suggest that the country will necessarily substitute its domestic production with imports. This explains that we do not observe a significant negative effect on emission intensity contemporaneously. In the medium and long run, we observe that increased backward participation reduces emission intensity for both developed and developing countries, and it reduces more of the emission intensity for developing countries than for developed countries. It increases a country's foreign market access to cleaner intermediate inputs, creating knowledge spillovers, stimulating upgrading, and thus reducing the emission intensity. However, such upgrading-by-doing effects materialize in the long run rather than contemporaneously. The results also suggest that backward participation provides more upgrading opportunities for a developing country. This finding is consistent with the convergence theory that learning-by-doing enables lagging countries to catch up with the leaders of emission efficiency in the longer run.

### Insulin detemir (Levemir) [^74fb6568]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.3 Clinical Studies in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 24-week, open-label, randomized, clinical trial (Study E, n = 476), LEVEMIR administered twice-daily (before breakfast and evening) was compared to NPH insulin administered twice-daily (before breakfast and evening) as part of a regimen of stable combination therapy with one or two of the following oral antidiabetic medications: metformin, an insulin secretagogue, or an alpha–glucosidase inhibitor. All patients were insulin-naïve at the time of randomization. LEVEMIR and NPH insulin similarly lowered HbA1cfrom baseline (Table 9).

In a 22-week, open-label, randomized, clinical trial (Study F, n = 395) in adults with type 2 diabetes, LEVEMIR and NPH insulin were given once- or twice-daily as part of a basal-bolus regimen with insulin aspart. As measured by HbA1cor FPG, LEVEMIR had efficacy similar to that of NPH insulin.

Combination Therapy with Metformin and Liraglutide

This 26-week open-label trial enrolled 988 patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c7-10%) on metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day) alone or inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c7-8.5%) on metformin (≥ 1500 mg/day) and a sulfonylurea. Patients who were on metformin and a sulfonylurea discontinued the sulfonylurea then all patients entered a 12-week run-in period during which they received add-on therapy with liraglutide titrated to 1.8 mg once-daily. At the end of the run-in period, 498 patients (50%) achieved HbA1c < 7% with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and continued treatment in a non-randomized, observational arm. Another 167 patients (17%) withdrew from the trial during the run-in period with approximately one-half of these patients doing so because of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. The remaining 323 patients with HbA1c ≥ 7% (33% of those who entered the run-in period) were randomized to 26 weeks of once-daily LEVEMIR administered in the evening as add-on therapy (n = 162) or to continued, unchanged treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin (n = 161). The starting dose of LEVEMIR was 10 units/day and the mean dose at the end of the 26-week randomized period was 39 units/day. During the 26-week randomized treatment period, the percentage of patients who discontinued due to ineffective therapy was 11.2% in the group randomized to continued treatment with liraglutide 1.8 mg and metformin and 1.2% in the group randomized to add-on therapy with LEVEMIR.

### A summary of the methods that the national clinical guideline centre uses to produce clinical guidelines for the national institute for health and clinical excellence [^e6498189]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline formats, recommendation wording, and implementation — Each guideline is produced in 4 formats, including a full version detailing methods, evidence, and the link between evidence and recommendations; a NICE version that lists the recommendations; a quick reference guide summarizing recommendations for health care professionals; and an "understanding NICE guidance" version for patients, carers, and the general public. The wording of each recommendation is considered carefully to ensure that it is clear and concise, and recommendations are action-based and attempt to be specific about the intervention and the population to which the recommendation applies; justifications are not normally included because they are available in the full version's section describing the link between evidence and recommendations. The guideline development group selects 5 to 10 recommendations as key priorities for implementation; these are not necessarily all "strong" and are chosen as being likely to do at least 1 of the following: result in significant benefits for patients, reduce variation in care and outcomes, lead to more efficient use of National Health Service resources, promote patient choice, or promote more equitable access to health care. The guideline development group also identifies recommendations likely to benefit from implementation support, with criteria including not being part of routine care, requiring changes in service delivery or retraining, needing implementation across several agencies or settings, being potentially contentious, or being difficult to implement. While assessing the evidence and making recommendations for best practice, the group also considers how the recommendations will be implemented, and NICE has set up a team to assist with implementation that helps disseminate guidelines and provides tools to put them into practice.

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^d2495685]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic experiments with energy balance model

To evaluate whether precipitation, temperature or another climate variable caused the glacier advance phase between 1980 and 2005, we carry out a series of diagnostic experiments. First, we create synthetic data sets for each climate variable where the value for each day has an offset added so that the mean for each year is constant across the simulation at the long-term mean value. Second, we carry out experiments where only one climate variable is allowed to vary as observed, while our synthetic climate series are used for the other model inputs. The glacier volume change resulting from each run is then taken as the contribution of that variable to the overall volume change (Fig. 6c, d).

The experimental set-up involves three different types of model run. The standard run (Figs 4 and 6) is used to assess how glacier mass balance has changed overall, and is a simple, unadjusted model simulation from 1972 to 2011. The second is called the 'control run'; in this case, the model is run with all climate variables adjusted so that, for each year, the annual mean is the same as the long-term mean and daily variations are retained. In the third run type, the variable of interest is allowed to vary without modification, while the other variables are held at their long-term climatological means (again at an annual resolution, with daily variations retained). The results are presented for each variable as anomalies from the control run (each named 'temperature run', 'precipitation run' and so on). The output of this third type of run is taken as the contribution of that variable to the cumulative glacier volume change (Fig. 6d). Such an interpretation is reasonable because the main climate variables affecting the model (temperature and precipitation) are uncorrelated (r = 0.12, P > 0.1; Supplementary Fig. 3). Furthermore, the individual model runs described below sum almost exactly to the standard run, which includes all forcings, suggesting very little interaction between these climate variables.
