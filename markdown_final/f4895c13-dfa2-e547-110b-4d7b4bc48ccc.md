## Question

This question refers to the following information.
That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
…
He looked to the West and prayed, "I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal." When he had prayed he bowed again.
From Wu Chengen, Journey to the West, ca. 1590s
In which of the following ways does the excerpt above most complicate historians' understanding of the career of the Chinese monk and traveler Xuanzang?

Answer Choices:
A. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments.
B. It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived.
C. It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang.
D. It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains how this excerpt from Journey to the West complicates historians' understanding of the historical monk Xuanzang. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical Xuanzang and the basic facts of his life. Then, I should verify what the excerpt actually contains and whether it aligns with those facts. Next, I will evaluate each answer choice against the evidence. Finally, I will choose the option that most directly and significantly complicates historical reconstruction and explain why the alternatives are weaker or incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the historical baseline. Xuanzang was a real 7th-century Chinese Buddhist monk who undertook a famous pilgrimage to India to obtain Sanskrit scriptures and later translated them, with his journey and translations documented in contemporary and near-contemporary sources; this establishes his existence and core accomplishments as historically attested, so I should not jump to conclusions that this text undermines his existence itself [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check the content of the excerpt. The passage introduces Xuanzang as a monk chosen for a scripture-seeking mission, gives him a high-ranking bureaucratic lineage, and then has him pray to release the divine Monkey King to accompany him to Vulture Peak; wait, let me verify the anachronism here — the Monkey King and the entire mythic framework are fictional elements of Wu Cheng'en's 16th-century novel, not part of 7th-century historical records, which immediately signals literary fabrication rather than historical documentation [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronology alone. I should confirm the temporal gap and its significance. Wu Cheng'en wrote Journey to the West in the late 16th century, roughly 900 years after Xuanzang's lifetime; that long interval matters because it allows legendary accretion to obscure the historical figure, but the most direct complication for historians is the blending of fact with fantasy, not merely the date of composition itself [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option A, "It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments". Let me think about this carefully: the text invents a noble lineage, adds supernatural companions like the Monkey King, and frames the journey in mythic terms, all of which overlays and potentially eclipses the authentic historical achievements of the real monk; this fictionalization is precisely what forces historians to disentangle legend from documentary evidence when reconstructing Xuanzang's actual career and impact [^notfound].

> Next, Option B, "It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived". I should double-check whether the time lag alone is the primary complication. While the 900-year gap enables myth-making, the mere passage of time is not as specific a historiographic problem as the active fictionalization; many historical sources are written later, yet remain reliable, whereas here the content itself is fantastical, so the stronger claim is the fictionalization rather than just lateness [^notfound].

> Option C claims it casts doubt on Xuanzang's actual existence. Wait, let me verify — this is too strong. The existence of the historical Xuanzang is independently attested in 7th-century and later records, so the novel does not undermine his historicity; rather, it complicates how we interpret stories about him, which is a different issue entirely, making this option incorrect [^notfound].

> Option D asserts the text is widely considered a forgery. Hold on, I should verify the terminology. A forgery implies deceptive intent to pass something off as genuine; Journey to the West is a recognized work of fiction and folklore, not a forged document, so calling it a forgery mischaracterizes its genre and scholarly reception, and thus this option is inaccurate [^notfound].

> Putting this together, the most accurate and specific answer is A, because the excerpt's heavy fictionalization — adding mythic elements like the Monkey King and reshaping Xuanzang's persona and mission — directly complicates historians' task of separating legendary accretion from the verifiable facts of the historical monk's life and accomplishments, whereas the other options either overstate the implication or miss the core historiographic problem [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **A. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments**. The excerpt from *Journey to the West* introduces mythical elements — such as the divine Monkey King and imperial orders to fetch scriptures — that are not supported by historical records, thereby **obscuring the factual account** of Xuanzang's journey. This fictionalization complicates historians' efforts to distinguish the real monk's achievements from later literary embellishments [^notfound].

---

## Analysis of the excerpt

The excerpt presents Xuanzang as a monk chosen by imperial decree to retrieve Buddhist scriptures from the West, accompanied by the mythical Monkey King. This narrative includes several elements that **deviate from historical accounts**:

- **Imperial decree**: The excerpt suggests Xuanzang was sent on his journey by imperial order, whereas historical records indicate he undertook the pilgrimage without official sanction, even defying a travel ban at the time [^notfound].

- **Divine companion**: The Monkey King is a fictional character from Chinese mythology, not mentioned in historical records of Xuanzang's journey.

- **Supernatural elements**: The story includes prayers and divine interventions, which are characteristic of fictional narratives rather than historical documentation.

---

## Historical context of Xuanzang

Xuanzang (602–664 CE) was a renowned Buddhist monk, scholar, and translator who traveled to India during the Tang dynasty to obtain Buddhist scriptures. His journey is well-documented in historical texts, including his own autobiography, *Great Tang Records on the Western Regions*, and biographies written by his contemporaries. These records provide a factual account of his travels, the challenges he faced, and his contributions to Buddhist scholarship in China [^notfound].

---

## Impact of fictionalization on historical understanding

The fictionalization of Xuanzang's story in *Journey to the West* significantly complicates historians' understanding of his career in the following ways:

- **Blurring of fact and fiction**: The novel's popularity has led to widespread acceptance of its narrative, making it difficult for historians to separate factual events from fictional embellishments.

- **Misrepresentation of motivations**: The fictional account portrays Xuanzang as motivated by imperial orders and divine missions, whereas historical records indicate his journey was driven by personal religious devotion and scholarly pursuits.

- **Overshadowing of historical achievements**: The mythical elements of the novel often overshadow Xuanzang's real contributions to Buddhist scholarship, translation, and cultural exchange between China and India.

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Analysis** | **Conclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| A. It highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments. | Accurately identifies the introduction of mythical elements and deviations from historical records. | Correct |
| B. It was written long after the time period in which Xuanzang lived. | While true, this alone does not explain the specific complication of fictionalization. | Incorrect |
| C. It casts doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang. | Incorrect, as Xuanzang's existence is well-documented in historical records. | Incorrect |
| D. It is widely considered by scholars to be a forgery. | Incorrect, as the novel is recognized as a work of fiction, not a forgery. | Incorrect |

---

## Conclusion

The excerpt from *Journey to the West* most complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career by **highly fictionalizing his accomplishments**, introducing mythical elements and deviations from historical records. This fictionalization blurs the line between fact and fiction, making it challenging for historians to accurately portray Xuanzang's true achievements and motivations.

### Changing travel patterns in China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic [^eca76794]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and came to prominence in January 2020, and quickly spread within the country. January is also a major holiday period in China, and the 40-day period around Lunar New Year (LNY), or Chunyun, marks the largest annual human movement in the world, with major travel flows out of large cities. The purpose of this holiday travel is often to visit family members. The temporary displacement from residential addresses as a result of this holiday travel could last one to two weeks, up to a month. In 2019, nearly 3 billion individual journeys were made during Chunyun. In 2020, Chunyun lasted from 10th January to 18th February, with the first day of the LNY holidays on 24th January, followed by the first day of LNY on 25th January. This period coincided with the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there has been speculation that holiday travel may have accelerated the propagation of COVID-19 both within China and internationally.

As part of initial efforts to contain the outbreak, the Chinese government announced a cordon sanitaire for the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, starting on 23rd January 2020, one day before LNY holidays. This intervention restricted all non-essential movement into and out of the city. Services at airports, train stations, long-distance bus stations, and commercial ports were all suspended. Several studies have focused on assessing the effectiveness of the cordon sanitaire in Wuhan and other domestic travel restrictions in China in the context of COVID-19 control –. As other affected regions worldwide begin implementing similar travel restrictions, it is critical to understand human mobility patterns during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and their potential implications for other countries.

Figure 1 
Dr. Joseph Wu arrived at Stanford University in 2004.

His academic journey has led him to cutting‐edge research on induced pluripotent stem cells—blood or skin cells that have been reprogrammed so they can become any type of human cell. Reproduced with permission from American Heart Association.

“Sam had a tremendous influence on me,” Dr Wu said. “He was an innovative thinker and a true visionary. My PhD training in his lab, as well as his guidance when I was a junior investigator, provided me with a solid foundation as a physician scientist. Because of that, I've been able to work on areas that are quite cutting‐edge and translational.”

Dr Wu's dreams came full circle in 2016 when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) selected him to work on a project to make space travel safer for humans, with a special focus on cardiac health.

“People will be traveling in space in the future,” he said. “It's not science fiction anymore.”

Dr Wu predicts space travel will become accessible in his grandchildren's lifetime. But first, scientists must work out a few key problems. They include the harmful effects of reduced gravity on the body, exposure to cosmic radiation, and learning how to induce chronic hibernation to allow people to sleep through their long journeys. Dr Wu's project focuses on understanding and preventing the effects of reduced gravity on human cells.

“When you are on earth, gravity helps strengthen your bones and muscles,” he explained.

He and his team sent 2‐dimensional iPSC‐derived cardiomyocytes to space, kept some on Earth, and worked with astronauts to compare them. They discovered that the cardiomyocytes in space had altered metabolism and contractability.In 2020, they sent 3‐dimensional (3D) iPSC‐derived engineered heart tissues into space and saw the same changes. This year, they sent 3800 iPSC‐derived cardiac organoids into space. Half of the 3D organoids were treated with medication to mitigate the metabolic and contractile changes; half were not. They are hoping to learn if the treatment strategy is effective.

### How to organise travel restrictions in the new future: lessons from the COVID-19 response in Hong Kong and Singapore [^a040d0ab]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, there is an ongoing struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the COVID-19 vaccine brings hope for ending this pandemic, some unsolved problems indicate that it may not be the silver bullet.Furthermore, experience from history suggests that vaccination alone is not sufficient to control a pandemic single-handedly and promptly.The global pandemic response should be supported by a combination of powerful non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Travel restrictions have been one of the most commonly used NPIs during the outbreak, proving their effectiveness in containing the disease in 2020 without acute economic fallout.A study in Nordic regions showed that closing the international border not only defended the local community from the COVID-19 but also supported the economic growth in 2020.Nonetheless, many well-known travel restrictions, such as complete border closure, were initially designed to buy time for understanding the epidemiological characteristics of this novel disease.These restrictions are often extreme and bring severe socioeconomic costs, making them unsustainable in the long term. For example, after the local epidemic situations had been controlled, many Asian-Pacific regions continued to suspend international travel to prevent the importation of SARS-CoV-2. Although these radical restrictions were the safest response at the time to the enormous uncertainties surrounding this novel disease, they deeply affected emergency and humanitarian actions, the movement of essential workers and the transportation of necessary goods. It will be beneficial for policy makers who have implemented these travel restrictions as part of a long-term response plan to consider easing the restrictions.

At the same time, many governments have already eased their original travel-related measures and have allowed non-essential international travel to resume. Amid the reasonable desire of returning to normalcy, however, it has become clear that easing travel restrictions increases the risk of virus importation and complexifies the disease transmission chain. Because many countries are not sufficiently protected by the vaccine-induced or infection-induced immunity and lack an abundant health system capacity, the importation of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 will still present a high public health risk. We argue that although some of the current travel restrictions should be eased, such adjustments can be enforced in a tailored fashion based on defined guidelines. These efforts can include conducting risk assessment systematically and regularly, improving quarantine arrangements, adopting extensive contact tracing, increasing COVID-19 testing frequency, tightening quarantine exemption arrangements and imposing punishments that enforce policy compliance.

### The parenthood journey in radiology: challenges and opportunities [^60d4ac4f]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The journey to parenthood is often delayed or prolonged for physicians, which disproportionately negatively impact women physicians. Women radiologists may delay childbearing for many reasons, which may lead to higher rates of regret and greater risks of infertility and pregnancy and postpartum complications. A better understanding of the resources and realities to achieve parenthood allows for more timely family planning while pursuing career advancements in radiology, particularly for medical students and our radiology trainees and early-career colleagues. Moreover, parents today are experiencing higher levels of stress and higher rates of isolation in the post-pandemic world, amounting to a public health crisis. Unreliable childcare is the top reason for women colleagues to exit the workforce. This article highlights many shared struggles of family planning and parenting, helps inform, prepare, and support our colleagues and trainees to make these significant personal choices, and aims to build communities and nurture connections among radiologist-parents and "villages."

### Estimating internationally imported cases during the early COVID-19 pandemic [^a03903a3]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

As of 31 August 2020, >1 million confirmed cases have been reported in all 54 African locations as defined by the United Nations. Coverage of COVID-19 diagnostic and control interventions in many of those locations is expanding yet still limited, and many of these nations will continue to struggle to meet increased demand –. Furthermore, in the absence of reliable estimates of prevalence, it is extremely difficult to assess the current and future burden of COVID-19 in many of these locations. In light of these challenges, accurately estimating the timing and number of initial importations is crucial to inform models of outbreak dynamics for those locations.

Previous work has combined travel data with incidence estimates to estimate the risk of importation from all Chinese provinces, excluding Hubei, to all African countries. That analysis, however, used historical flight data from January 2019, which is unlikely to reflect 2020 travel trends, given that the Lunar New Year occurred comparatively early (in January) in 2020 and unprecedented travel restrictions were in place starting late January. In addition, the analysis did not take into account the uncertainty in reporting rates, the delay between infection and case report, and the time-varying prevalence of infected individuals in China.

### Key takeaways from China's success in eliminating malaria: leveraging existing evidence for a malaria-free world [^55e134c7]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Although the total number of malaria cases and fatalities have declined globally since 2010, there were still 241 million malaria cases identified across 85 countries and territories in 2020. As the global malaria eradication process accelerates, more countries have launched their own initiatives of elimination. Notably, China achieved this goal by 2021, ending thousands of years of endemic. Undoubtedly, tremendous experience and vital lessons have been accrued en route to the malaria-free goal in malaria-eliminated countries including China. To enhance prospects of a malaria-free world by bridging the key evidence from a malaria-eliminated country to the contexts of affected, this personal view highlights concerted commitments and universal investment in healthcare, improved surveillance and response system, constant capacity building, demand-oriented scientific research, and multiway cooperation, which have helped China to eliminate this ancient scourge. We discuss how these key takeaways could be leveraged to different contexts. We also argue the long-term challenges and barriers on the pathway to malaria elimination and underline the needs for consistent efforts to maintain zero indigenous cases and prevent re-introduction of malaria. Through concerted efforts from global collaboration, a malaria-free world can become a reality.

### US-China health exchange and collaboration following COVID-19 [^1af99e37]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Strong US-China collaboration on health and medicine is a crucial element of the global effort against COVID-19. We review the history of health collaboration and exchanges between the public and private sectors in the USA and China, including the long-lasting collaboration between governmental public health agencies of the two countries. Academic and scientific exchanges should be reinvigorated and the increasing valuable role of non-profit foundations acknowledged. The shared interests of the two countries and the magnitude of the pandemic necessitate both countries to collaborate and cooperate. We provide recommendations to the two governments and the global health community to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future threats.

### Learning for the next pandemic: the wuhan experience of managing critically ill people [^357f7028]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Research efforts

Research efforts increased over time and enabled early reports published in major international journals to inform on the magnitude of the outbreak and early insights into pathophysiology and management. Initially, there were many observational studies, performed at the discretion of treating physicians, that investigated risk factors as well as specific treatments such as anticoagulation and tocilizumab.From the haphazard nature of studies at the beginning, a more formalised structure was subsequently established. Some medical rescue teams included fully dedicated researchers with fast-track funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology. Clinical research organisations sent scores of people to facilitate multicentre clinical studies on lopinavir-ritonavir,remdesivir,and convalescent plasma.However, coordination and performance of these studies remained a challenge.

### Population decline is linked to migration route in the common cuckoo [^06a439b4]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Estimated apparent survival rates across both routes were 0.799 (95% confidence limits 0.615–0.908) up to completion of the Sahara crossing, 0.776 (95% confidence limits 0.604–0.807) during remainder of autumn migration and 0.675 (95% confidence limits 0.448–0.841) from completion of autumn migration up to return to the United Kingdom. Up to completion of the Sahara crossing, the survival of birds taking the West route was lower than that of bird taking the East route (binomial generalised linear mixed model (GLMM); df 1, 10, F=7.96, P =0.018; estimates: East: 0.976, 95% confidence limits 0.673–0.999; West: 0.562, 95% confidence limits 0.106–0.928) based on 33 migrations by 22 individuals taking the East route and 23 migrations by 20 individuals taking the West route. When including only the first journey from each individual, the result was very similar (binomial GLMM; df 1, 30, F=6.66, P =0.015; East: 0.956, 95% confidence limits 0.677–0.996; West 0.538, 95% confidence limits 0.163–0.875). There was no difference in survival during the remainder of autumn migration (binomial GLMM; df 1, 9, F=0.02, P =0.904) (East: 31 migrations by 20 birds, West: 14 migrations by 13 birds) or from completion of autumn migration up to return to the United Kingdom (binomial GLMM; df 1, 6, F=1.52, P =0.263), but sample size was small for the latter (East: 24 migrations by 16 birds, West: 11 migrations by 10 birds). Excluding cases most likely to be tag failure (see Methods) resulted in the removal of one bird from both East and West routes for autumn migration up to completion of the Sahara crossing and the survival of birds taking the West route was still lower than for those taking the East route (binomial GLMM; df 1, 10, F=7.72, P =0.019; estimates: East 0.985, 95% confidence limits 0.730–0.999; West 0.596, 95% confidence limits 0.144–0.928). After the removal of one bird from the East route for the remainder of autumn migration, there was still no difference in apparent survival between the routes (binomial GLMM; df 1, 9, F=0.01, P =0.938; estimates: East 0.797, 95% confidence limits 0.573–0.920; West 0.786, 95% confidence limits 0.447–0.944). No cases were removed for the period from arrival at the midwinter location up to return to the United Kingdom.

Methods

Estimating number of airplane passengers from 18 Chinese cities to international destinations

We used data on the number of passengers and flight departures from 1 December 2019 to 29 February 2020 from 18 Chinese origin cities to 43 international destinations, as described below. Historical air-travel volume data are likely not representative of the pandemic time period for two reasons: (1) Lunar New Year was earlier than in preceding years (25 January 2020), and (2) large-scale travel bans and flight cancellations took place in late January 2020.

We defined three main categories of locations as international destinations in our analyses (1) ten international locations with high-surveillance capacity and high air-travel connectivity to Wuhan used for model calibration; (2) 26 African countries as destinations used for model prediction; and (3) 16 locations that represent the top three destinations (two for Oceania and North America) from each inhabited continent (Oceania, Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America) in terms of travel volume from China during our focal time period. Those 16 locations include locations from (1) and (2) and an additional seven locations. We used these locations to estimate the ratio of cases imported internationally from other Chinese origin cities compared to cases imported internationally from Wuhan. For all flight data, in addition to Wuhan, we included as origin locations (N 0 = 17) the 17 Chinese cities that were previously identified by Lai et al.as high-risk cities for importation of COVID-19 from Wuhan and, therefore, likely sources of imported cases internationally: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Nanjing, Nanchang, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, Xi’an, and Donngguan.

### Distinct journeys and unique stories: how individuals from multiple professions cultivate careers in healthcare leadership [^326995e6]. BMJ Leader (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Strong hospital leadership is critical to navigating the challenges of the Canadian healthcare system. Currently, physicians and nurses tend to be selected to fulfil hospital executive roles. To date, we found only limited research exploring who else could or should be in these roles, or how more diverse groups of professionals navigate the journey into these roles. We sought to interview leaders from multiple professional backgrounds to understand how their career journey led them to their executive role.

Methods

We purposively sampled Canadian hospital executives with diverse professional and educational backgrounds. Through semistructured interviews, we explored their individual leadership journeys, and their experiences working with others along the way. Our team worked together to analyse data using a phenomenographic approach.

Results

Fourteen executive-level leaders from diverse professional backgrounds were interviewed. Overall, we noted three main trajectories for people to become hospital leaders: the achievement journey, the unexpected journey and the practical journey. These journeys corresponded to three main identities the champion leader, the discovered leader and the pragmatic leader, respectively. We found that some individuals had multiple trajectories and identities.

Conclusions

Improved diversity in executive hospital leadership may support transformational change in healthcare; however, this promise may not be automatically realised.

### Using immunisation caregiver journey interviews to understand and optimise vaccination uptake: lessons from Sierra Leone [^5abbb2ae]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Reflexivity and making sense of the data

Reflexivity is an important attribute of qualitative inquiry.In analysing the ICJI data from Sierra Leone, the two primary analysts (one woman and one man) brought their own lifeworld experiences and perspectives to the inductive analysis and interpretation. Both analysts and their contributors had experience working in global immunisation with diverse experiences conducting social and behavioural assessments to understand childhood vaccination experiences and behaviours in numerous countries in West Africa. On the one hand, having had prior experience in childhood immunisation work within West Africa, including Sierra Leone, allowed the team to draw from these experiences in interpreting the data. On the other hand, such experience had the potential to create blind spots. During the early stage of the inductive coding and analysis of transcripts, the analysts shared three of the initial coded transcripts with a third analyst that did not have any experience working in Sierra Leone or sub-Saharan Africa to ‘blindly’ code the transcripts so that we get an ‘outsider’ perspective. For instance, the ‘outside’ analyst more pronouncedly identified the complex role of gender dynamics on the caregiver journey, which the two analyst also identified but may have been more inclined to take for granted given their preconceived sociocultural knowledge of gender roles and cultural norms in Sierra Leone.

### Roads diverge: mapping the journey towards diagnostic health equity [^ab6284d2]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Reflexivity statement

The authors acknowledge their positionality as researchers with diverse backgrounds and the potential influence of their backgrounds on the development of this framework. Through reflexive discussions, we sought to critically examine assumptions and incorporate varied perspectives, confronting the impact of diagnostic inequities not as abstract concepts but as experiences that shape the lives and trajectories of people and communities. These discussions included our own encounters with healthcare systems, as well as those of our patients, families and communities, which informed our understanding and selection of the lived experiences presented in this paper. The framework was developed primarily within a US context, but we recognise that diagnostic environments and inequities may manifest differently across different health systems. The framework aims to have broad applicability, but the authors recognise its conceptual nature and geographic limitations and welcome future empirical validation and refinement.

### Roads diverge: mapping the journey towards diagnostic health equity [^0df0ca7f]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Sustainability

Completing the diagnostic journey requires a number of factors to align, including access and effective coproduction throughout. The sustainability constellation takes the form of a map, metaphorically directing attention toward the broader context and challenges to achieving diagnostic excellence and equity. There are additional difficulties in diagnostic care coordination, including diagnostic follow-up, after a clinical encounter. Obstacles here can reset the diagnostic journey (ie, lack of anticipatory guidance and scheduling follow-ups, ineffective counselling and education about when and how to activate care in the future). Missed and delayed diagnoses after abnormal test results occur with process breakdowns between results reporting, communications and referrals.Enriched support for patients in these situations has been the exception.Individuals using safety-net healthcare services encounter significant obstacles in patient monitoring, including limited access to transportation, health literacy challenges and constraints on time for medical appointments. Additionally, these healthcare systems often lack the necessary health information technology infrastructure and resources, which are vital for ensuring effective patient monitoring and preventing adverse events.This constellation shines currently out of reach for many patients, care partners and clinicians as well. The essential challenge is a lack of a diagnostic map for the innumerable permutations and combinations of pathways that a patient has never travelled before. The absence of comprehensive diagnostic mapping is perpetuated by current healthcare financing structures and incentive systems, which prioritise discrete billable encounters over longitudinal care coordination. Creation of and investment in robust diagnostic navigation tools would enable us to better understand these complex journeys and develop targeted interventions that support diverse patient populations at critical points along their diagnostic paths.

### Changing travel patterns in China during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic [^35fec7bd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The timing of LNY and the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to untangle regular holiday travel from travel in response to the outbreak or to impending travel restrictions. The increased outflow from Wuhan that we observed was not unique to the city, as similar patterns of outflow were observed in a large number of other prefectures, and so likely represents increased holiday travel. We therefore did not find evidence of an association between the announcement of the cordon sanitaire and the number of outbound travellers leaving Wuhan. Data from other countries not confounded by holiday travel (e.g. France) may yield insights on public responses to travel restrictions. In addition, although the overall number of travellers leaving Wuhan was not exceptionally high before LNY, the composition of travellers may have changed, such as a shift from business to family travel, which could contribute to the spread of COVID-19 and could have implications for healthcare demand in destination locations. Finer resolution mobility data, including traveller characteristics such as age and occupation, could improve our understanding of the potential outbreak risk and the likely impacts of different interventions in the future.

Human mobility during Chunyun was marked by the general trend of people leaving large population centres for less populated locations. This is a move by the population away from locations with high healthcare capacity. During the peak of the epidemics in mainland China, areas with low healthcare capacity experienced significantly higher healthcare pressure related to COVID-19 compared to elsewhere. Temporarily mobilising resources such as medical personnel and equipment could aid epidemic control in places receiving a higher-than-normal number of travellers from places with potentially high COVID-19 prevalence, and thus could be evaluated as a potential public health intervention under similar circumstances.

The structure of the overall transportation network in China did not demonstrate compensatory responses to the cordon sanitaire. There was a brief alteration of the network structure immediately following the restrictions, before the network settled quickly back into the same relatively stable communities that existed before the restrictions, albeit at markedly lower flow. This implies that the overall transportation network did not undergo structural reorganisation as a result of Wuhan’s cordon sanitaire and other regional travel restrictions. Short-term travel restrictions may therefore not incur lasting impacts on the mobility network, but assessing long-term impacts will require longer time-series analyses.

International travel goes hand in hand with medical delivery to underserved communities. The global health care worker can be exposed to a wide range of infectious diseases during their global experiences. A pretravel risk assessment visit and all appropriate vaccinations and education must be performed. Universal practices of water safety, food safety, and insect avoidance will prevent most travel-related infections and complications. Region-specific vaccinations will further reduce illness risk. An understanding of common travel-related illness signs and symptoms is helpful. Emerging pathogens that can cause a pandemic should be understood to avoid health care worker infection and spread.

Medical tourism—pre-travel consultation—Medical tourists should take steps before they travel to reduce risk of an adverse health outcome. At a minimum, those considering medical tourism should have a discussion with their primary healthcare professional in the United States well in advance of travel, and medical tourists also could consult a travel medicine specialist for travel advice tailored to their specific health needs and destination 4–6 weeks before travel. Medical tourists should be up to date on all routine vaccinations, especially hepatitis B virus immunization. If consulted, the travel medicine specialist should discuss current medical conditions and ensure that the medical tourist will have a sufficient supply of all regular medications to last the duration of their trip. Medical tourists should discuss the plan for addressing complications related to the treatment or procedure with both their US healthcare professional and the healthcare professional performing the treatment or procedure outside the United States, and in addition, medical tourists should check their domestic health insurance plan carefully to understand what services, if any, are covered outside the United States. Travelers might need to purchase supplemental medical insurance coverage, including medical evacuation insurance, and medical tourists also should be aware that if complications develop, they might not have the same legal recourse as they would if they received their care in the United States. Remind medical tourists to request copies of their overseas medical records in English and to provide this information to any healthcare professionals they see subsequently for follow-up, and encourage medical tourists to disclose their entire travel history, medical history, and information about all surgeries or medical treatments received during their trip.

### Global health 2050: the path to halving premature death by mid-century [^e8ff42b7]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic

On May 5, 2023, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared an end to the emergency phase of COVID-19; “I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern,” he said.He made it clear, however, that his declaration by no means was an end to the damage caused by the virus whose effects had first been observed in Wuhan at the end of December, 2019, and where its first known death had occurred a week or two later. Rather, May 5, 2023 marked a transition from the emergency phase to a phase of enduring endemicity. Additionally, he noted that morbidity from Long COVID would continue long after the emergency phase ended.

Just as there were “post-mortems” after the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in west Africa,, there have been multiple examinations of and reports on interim lessons from COVID-19. These include the Lancet commission on lessons learned for the future from the COVID-19 pandemic;a WHO-convened independent panel chaired by Helen Clark and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf;and Richard Horton’s book “The COVID-19 Catastrophe: What’s Gone Wrong and How to Stop it Happening Again.”Such retrospective analyses have laid out a broad range of valuable conclusions that we summarize in panel 10. The context for thinking about pandemic preparedness remains, however, an unhopeful one. In a June 2024 update to their Independent Panel report, Clark and Johnson Sirleaf point to the failure of recent negotiations for a pandemic treaty and an atmosphere of ill will and mistrust among countries and conclude that “too many gaps and vulnerabilities remain, and pathogens have an ample opportunity to spill over, slip though and spread fast.”

### A methodological review of patient healthcare-seeking journeys from symptom onset to receipt of care [^5df82ee1]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Limitations

This methodology review has some important limitations. First, as noted in our results, the framework presents stages of patient journeys to care in a linear format, which can oversimplify the complex and often non-linear nature of healthcare-seeking behaviour. We hope this framework serves as a foundational guide to facilitate measurement and understanding of patient pathways amidst the messiness of real-world experiences.

Second, the research team was composed of public health and global health researchers and practitioners and lacked background knowledge on other fields that may have insights to contribute to this work. Our reviewers noted that patient journeys in the field of anthropology are sometimes denoted by the term ‘therapeutic itineraries’,which was not included in our search criteria.

Conclusions

Our findings underscore the critical need for better approaches to compare patient journeys and develop interventions, emphasising the importance of clear guidelines and accessible tools to facilitate this analysis. This work lays the groundwork for future efforts to enhance access, quality and equity in healthcare service provision.

### Key takeaways from China's success in eliminating malaria: leveraging existing evidence for a malaria-free world [^34060a64]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

As a large country with a vast territory and a large population, China has experienced the entire process including variable settings from a serious epidemic to elimination of malaria over seven decades. Many lessons and successful experience and challenges in China are worth summarising for reference, especially to assist other affected countries that desire to eliminate malaria. Both in the field and within academic and government institutions in China, malaria control and scientific research professionals have summarised the experience and best practices to create a batch of operational programmes or procedures. One of them, for example, called the 1–3–7 approach,has been acknowledged and written in technical manuals by the WHO. However, there is still a lack of in-depth analysis and comprehensive summary of experience and lessons learnt during malaria elimination in China. In this personal view, we summarise the key takeaways from China’s success in eliminating malaria and discussed existing evidence that could be leveraged to countries with different malaria contexts.

Issue constellations: where diagnostic disparities cluster

Diagnostic disparities cluster around ‘issue constellations’, groupings with common characteristics which project down either favourably or deleteriously on the multilevel diagnostic environment and affect the diagnostic journey at different stages: (1) access (starting the journey and facing difficulties in engaging with health systems), (2) coproduction (continuing the journey and surmounting challenges) and (3) sustainability (completing the journey without a clear map throughout). Constellations highlight specific clusters of issues that impact the diagnostic journey from start to finish, complementing the socioecological model’s focus on process, social phenomena and levels of influence. They guide navigation and offer areas for intervention (figure 3 and table 2).

### Epilogue: lessons from the CONVERGE study of major depressive disorder in China [^b50b2ade]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

In its relatively brief existence, CONVERGE has developed a bilingual (Mandarin–English) computerized interview, trained more than 100 doctors to conduct detailed research interviews, and recruited a smaller team to edit and review the data including audiotapes of all interviews. Key to CONVERGE's success has been effective communication and an ethos of scientific commitment in which all partners are equal contributors, all involved in the analysis and publication of results. This was achieved in three ways. First, the UK and US principal investigators travel to China to hold week long training sessions in the use of a computerized assessment system, designed in collaboration with Chinese psychiatrists. So far, three such meetings have taken place, in the cities of Shanghai, Hangzhou and Dalian, together with one refresher and problem-solving meeting in Shanghai. Second, the UK and Chinese principal investigators regularly visit participating hospitals, to identify and solve problems in ascertaining and assessing patients and controls, as well as to smooth out any unexpected difficulties that arise subsequent to the training sessions. Finally, the UK and US principal investigators have run one workshop in the analysis and presentation of results.

The workshop was held in the seaside city of Qingdao in the summer of 2010 with the ambitious aim of analyzing and writing up results from the first 2000 patients and 2000 controls that CONVERGE had by that date amassed. 60 doctors attended for three days. The results of their labors can be seen in the six articles in this issue of JAD, and the five published elsewhere. The first authors on these papers are young Chinese psychiatrists trained within the auspices of CONVERGE as interviewers, editors and now researchers. The emergence of this cohort of clinician–scientists is a major achievement of the international collaboration.

The story the articles tell is one of similarities and dissimilarities between MDD in China and the rest of the world. So far, our results suggest that the former far outweigh the latter. We see this as an important observation, and one that needs to put in the context of the difficulties associated with researching MDD in China. Kleinman has pointed out that “culturally coded symptoms may confound diagnosis” and has written extensively about the difference in the ways mood is conceptualized and expressed in the middle kingdom. However, to date, no one had examined in depth the full range of clinical features and risk factors of MDD in a large Chinese sample.

### Roads diverge: mapping the journey towards diagnostic health equity [^04b96b2a]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Diagnostic disparities significantly impact health outcomes, with various factors influencing differential access and treatment across communities. This paper explores the complex landscape of diagnosis and of variable diagnostic journeys, focusing on the multifaceted nature of diagnostic inequities and proposing a socioecological model to understand and address these disparities.

Methods

The authors employed an interdisciplinary approach, synthesising insights from their respective knowledge domains. Through iterative discussions, visual diagramming and narrative development, a new framework was constructed to address the complexity of diagnostic inequities.

Results

The 'diagnostic environment' model was developed, conceptualising diagnosis beyond the biomedical process to include three levels of influence: atmospheric (broad, pervasive societal factors), surface (direct healthcare interactions) and subterranean (underlying, often invisible societal norms and biases). This model integrates process, social phenomena and multilevel influences to more comprehensively address diagnostic disparities. Two additional frameworks: diagnostic journeys within this environment and issue constellations guiding navigation and intervention were developed.

Conclusions

Diagnostic processes are influenced by a range of factors from individual to systemic levels, often leading to significant disparities in health outcomes. The proposed model offers a framework for understanding these disparities and suggests targeted interventions to address them. By integrating diverse perspectives and focusing on multilevel influences, the framework aims to improve diagnostic equity.

Implications

This study highlights the need for a more holistic approach to diagnosis, acknowledging the complex interplay of factors that contribute to diagnostic disparities. The socioecological model provides a basis for future research and policy interventions aimed at reducing these disparities and improving overall diagnostic accuracy and equity.

### Neural mechanisms of hierarchical planning in a virtual subway network [^8a77ac0d]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Procedure

The main task is depicted in Figure 1 C. Each journey began with the presentation of a cue screen for 3 s that indicated the starting point and the destination (stations and lines). After a period of 2–5 s (jittered) of blank screen, on each of the successive trials a navigation screen was displayed for 3 s. This screen provided multiple pieces of information: the names of the current and destination stations; the line color of the destination station; the reward at stake for the current journey; the cumulative reward so far; and the cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) available from the current station. Critically, no information about the current line or about the line associated with each action was shown. At each step, participants had to choose the direction they wanted to take by pressing one out of four buttons. If no key was pressed, the same station was shown again in the next step. Each navigation screen was followed by a blank screen of 1–3 s (jittered); no feedback was provided during navigation.

The journey ended either when the participant reached the destination or when the journey was cancelled. After the journey was finished or cancelled, a feedback screen informed whether the destination had been reached or not and the reward that had been obtained. This screen was displayed for 2 s and was followed by a blank screen of 2–5 s (jittered) before the next cue screen occurred. Participants completed as many journeys as possible in four successive runs buttressed by lead-in and lead-out durations of 10 s and 5 s, respectively. The total scanning time, including anatomical and localizer scans, was around 75 min per participant.

### Neural mechanisms of hierarchical planning in a virtual subway network [^12256cf6]. Neuron (2016). Low credibility.

Results

Task Summary

The task is depicted in Figure 1 C. Each journey began at a pseudo-randomly chosen station (see Experimental Procedures). On each trial, the names of the destination and current stations were shown, and participants pressed one of four buttons (north, south, east, or west) to move to an adjacent station, which was then shown on the next trial. Their goal was to navigate through the subway map from the start station to the destination station (these successive trials comprising a “journey”). During an initial training session, lines were associated with colors (red, green, yellow, and blue), but at scanning, all color information was removed. Successful journeys were rewarded with financial incentives, but there was a small, but constant, probability that journeys were “cancelled” on each trial and the reward was unavailable, motivating participants to make journeys in the shortest possible number of trials. Participants carried out 88.8 ± 2 journeys in total, each consisting of an average of 5.5 ± 0.06 trials. Of these, 78.3% were performed “optimally” (i.e. when all responses decreased the distance to goal in number of stations). Of the remainder, 15.2% contained at least one action that led participants further away from the goal; these responses were made more slowly (t 19 = 7.56, p < 0.000001). Additionally, 9.0% of journeys included at least one missing response (when subjects failed to respond on time and remained in the same station as in the previous trial).

### Rectal cancer in west China: younger onset, poor survival, and poor compliance [^4409ca7d]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1. 
Compliance with adjuvant therapy and follow-up for patients with stage III rectal cancer

FIGURE 1. 
Kaplan-Meier plots illustrating the association between compliance with postoperative adjuvant therapy (A) and postoperative follow-up schedule and the rates of 5-year overall survival after curative rectal cancer surgery for patients with stage III rectal cancer (B). Green lines refer to full compliance, red lines refer to lack of compliance (defined as no more than one follow-up within 2 years of surgery and no annual follow-up after 2 years), and blue lines refer to partial compliance. In the case of adjuvant therapy, this refers to use of oral agents only and failure to follow recommendations for chemoradiation.

In Chinese communities, traditional and cultural factors have a significant effect on the treatment and survivorship of patients with cancer: factors such as fatalism, which is common in China, especially in comparatively undeveloped western areas.Here, a great proportion of patients choose to give up once the diagnosis of a malignant tumor is confirmed. Another group of patients choose to receive only surgery, because they believe the treatment of chemotherapy and radiation will only bring harm to their body while not controlling the disease. In this belief, treatment of cancer is hampered by widespread perceptions that death is inevitable after cancer diagnosis and that the outcome is predestined, irrespective of medical intervention.At the same time, a considerable number of patients with cancer often believe that traditional Chinese medicine can help to improve general well-being, relieve symptoms, and cure diseases. High-level evidence for the clinical efficacy of traditional medicine is still lacking. Understanding cancer fatalism and its role in China is important in understanding the choice of patients and in following clinical outcomes.

Some limitations of this study should be addressed. Selection bias exists because the “easier” cancers were more likely to receive treatment locally, whereas those patients with critical disease or those with complications were prone to travel to our center. Because the national cancer registry is in the process of gradual improvement, data concerning patients receiving adjuvant therapy and follow-up at local hospitals was partially lost, especially data of those who changed contacts after discharge. In conclusion, there is much work needed to improve the oncological outcome for RCs in western China.

### Dr1iff_l-cdc (...) [^23388ce3]. wwwn.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

The examination protocol and data collection methods are fully documented in the NHANES dietary interviewer procedures manuals. Interviews were conducted with a proxy for participants less than six years of age. Interviews of children aged 6 to 8 were conducted with a proxy and the child was present to assist in reporting intake information. Interviews of children aged 9-11, were conducted with the child and the assistance of a proxy familiar with the child’s intake. Participants 12 years or older answered for themselves. Dietary interviewers conducted telephone interviews in English and Spanish. All dietary interviewers were required to complete an intensive one-week training course and to conduct supervised practice interviews before working independently in the field. Retraining sessions were conducted annually to reinforce the proper protocols and technique.

Interviewers were monitored throughout the data collection period. Monitoring consisted of the following: Interview data files were sent electronically from the field and were imported into Survey Net, a computer-assisted food coding and data management system developed by USDA. All NHANES participants responding to the 24-hour dietary recall interview are eligible for the dietary supplement and non-prescription antacid use questions. Information is obtained on all vitamins, minerals, herbals, and other dietary supplements as well as non-prescription antacids that were consumed during a 30-day period, including the name and the amount of supplement or antacid taken. For the NHANES August 2021-August 2023 sample, there were 22, 660 persons selected; of these 8, 860 were considered participants to the MEC examination and data collection.

A total of 6, 754 MEC participants provided complete dietary intakes for Day 1, and of those providing the Day 1 data, 5, 879 provided complete dietary intakes for Day 2. Day 1 weights were constructed by taking the MEC sample weights and further adjusting for: the additional non-response; and the differential allocation by weekdays and weekends for the dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more variable than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated standard errors using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights might be larger than standard errors for similar estimates based on MEC weights.

### A trans-oceanic flight of over 4, 200 km by painted lady butterflies [^df5f75a8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The extent of aerial flows of insects circulating around the planet and their impact on ecosystems and biogeography remain enigmatic because of methodological challenges. Here we report a transatlantic crossing by Vanessa cardui butterflies spanning at least 4200km, from West Africa to South America (French Guiana) and lasting between 5 and 8 days. Even more, we infer a likely natal origin for these individuals in Western Europe, and the journey Europe-Africa-South America could expand to 7000km or more. This discovery was possible through an integrative approach, including coastal field surveys, wind trajectory modelling, genomics, pollen metabarcoding, ecological niche modelling, and multi-isotope geolocation of natal origins. The overall journey, which was energetically feasible only if assisted by winds, is among the longest documented for individual insects, and potentially the first verified transatlantic crossing. Our findings suggest that we may be underestimating transoceanic dispersal in insects and highlight the importance of aerial highways connecting continents by trade winds.

### A methodological review of patient healthcare-seeking journeys from symptom onset to receipt of care [^e0cd284b]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Our analysis also revealed a lack of consistency in how patient journeys to care are represented and a notable complexity in generating insightful depictions of journeys to care, indicating the challenges in using data to guide healthcare interventions effectively. The scarcity of tools and clear guidelines for analysing and presenting such complex data further complicates this task, highlighting an urgent need for simple, open-access tools and standardised analytical methods to improve our understanding of patient healthcare-seeking journeys.

We posit that our proposed conceptual framework, identified data points and indicators address this knowledge gap, offering some guidance to improve consistency in the analysis of patient journey or healthcare-seeking experiences.

The reviewed papers typically addressed an average of four identified key data points, with patient delays and the type or sector of facility where the patient was diagnosed or treated being the most often examined. We also noted that the number of provider visits needed for diagnosis or treatment was only reported in 24% and 12%, respectively. In our view, the number of visits to diagnosis and treatment is among the most important data points for understanding patient care barriers, as both give us an insight into delays as well as the direct and indirect costs of care. Overall, as none of these factors alone fully characterise patient experiences, or highlight missed diagnostic and treatment opportunities, reporting all data points relevant to the outcome under review (diagnosis or treatment) is crucial for a comprehensive view of patient care journeys. Thus, our methodological review highlighted the key features of patient trajectories (table 1) that offer insights into the missed opportunities. Additionally, we recommend additional statistical analyses to identify risk factors for having more provider visits or longer delays in the patient care continuum using patients’ sociodemographic characteristics and health status (table 4). We propose the need for an open-source analysis package for Patient Journey Analyses.

### Improving preeclampsia risk prediction by modeling pregnancy trajectories from routinely collected electronic medical record data [^2558d339]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Experimental design

To train predictive models for PE along the pregnancy journey, we divided the journey into 19 time points including 17 time points for antepartum (5 monthly visits spanning weeks 4–20, 7 biweekly visits spanning weeks 22–34, and 5 weekly visits spanning weeks 35–39), and intrapartum and postpartum periods as two independent time points with respect to the pathophysiology of PE. We outlined our entire workflow in Fig. 1. We collected the clinical features between 8 months before pregnancy and the time point (the protocol visit) to build a model that could predict PE risk after the time point. We generated the PE ground-truth labels based on our digital phenotyping algorithm which only used the clinical information after the time point. Therefore, there was no information leakage between the training data and the data generating ground-truth labels. We also excluded the PE cases which already happened before each time point when we built the time series model. We listed the PE prevalence, sample size, number of available features, and percentage of missing values for the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) training set, the Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) test set, and the Mount Sinai West (MSW) test set in Supplementary Table 21, respectively.

A host of reasons may underpin the parent’s request. Is their concern that the wheezy episodes are harmful? Are they unable to sleep because the child is disturbed at night? Is it the lack of a clear diagnosis and uncertainty about the boy’s long-term prognosis that is causing the worry? Do the parents want advice on avoiding triggers or information on what to do when the wheezing recurs, or is the main focus of this consultation the (perceived) additional value of a referral to a specialist? Or all of these?

### A methodological review of patient healthcare-seeking journeys from symptom onset to receipt of care [^13ab2820]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Background

For many diseases, early diagnosis and treatment are more cost-effective, reduce community spread of infectious diseases and result in better patient outcomes. However, healthcare-seeking and diagnoses for several diseases are unnecessarily delayed. For example, in 2022, 3million and 5.6million people living with tuberculosis (TB) and HIV, respectively, were undiagnosed. Many patients never access appropriate testing, remain undiagnosed after testing or drop out shortly after treatment initiation. This underscores challenges in accessing healthcare for many individuals. Understanding healthcare-seeking obstacles can expose bottlenecks in healthcare delivery and promote equity of access. We aimed to synthesise methodologies used to portray healthcare-seeking trajectories and provide a conceptual framework for patient journey analyses.

Design/Methods

We conducted a literature search using keywords related to "patient/care healthcare-seeking/journey/pathway analysis" AND "TB" OR "infectious/pulmonary diseases" in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and Global Health (OVID). From a preliminary scoping search and expert consultation, we developed a conceptual framework and honed the key data points necessary to understand patients' healthcare-seeking journeys, which then served as our inclusion criteria for the subsequent expanded review. Retained papers included at least three of these data points.

Results

Our conceptual framework included five data points and seven related indicators that contribute to understanding patients' experiences during healthcare-seeking. We retained 66 studies that met our eligibility criteria. Most studies (56.3%) were in Central and Southeast Asia, explored TB healthcare-seeking experiences (76.6%), were quantitative (67.2%), used in-depth, semistructured or structured questionnaires for data collection (73.4%). Healthcare-seeking journeys were explored, measured and portrayed in different ways, with no consistency in included information.

Conclusions

We synthesised various methodologies in exploring patient healthcare-seeking journeys and found crucial data points necessary to understand challenges patients encounter when interacting with health systems and offer insights to researchers and healthcare practitioners. Our framework proposes a standardised approach to patient journey research.
