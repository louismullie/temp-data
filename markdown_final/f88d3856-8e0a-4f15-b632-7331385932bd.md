## Question

What questions should be asked during a telehealth visit when a patient requests removal of skin lesions?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which questions to ask during a telehealth visit when a patient requests skin lesion removal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pre-visit technical readiness and image quality standards. Then, I should clarify identification and chief complaint, including intent for removal. Next, I will gather a targeted oncologic risk history and lesion-specific evolution. After that, I need to define the visual assessment elements and when dermoscopy is required, and guide image acquisition. Then, I will risk stratify and map triage pathways, including direct-to-biopsy versus in-person visits. Finally, I should document follow-up and summarize an algorithm while stating limitations and safety-netting steps.

> Let me first confirm the technical prerequisites because poor images derail decision-making; I need to ensure the patient can submit high-quality images via a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform and that standardized intake templates are available, since only about 55% of patient-submitted images are useful and nearly 9% depict no skin condition at all, and about 8% of cases can suffer technical failure in mHealth workflows, so setting expectations and providing instructions up front is essential [^113jtMfs] [^1163Cm4Y] [^117695Dq] [^112EFrc9].

> Wait, let me verify the basics before clinical triage; I should confirm patient identity and clarify the chief complaint precisely: which lesion(s), the number of lesions of concern, and whether the request is cosmetic, symptomatic, or due to malignancy worry, because teledermatology programs show that more than half of patients can be managed in primary care, a minority require direct biopsy, and pathway clarity reduces wait times dramatically, while eConsult models increase access and identify malignancies even in underserved settings [^114agByU] [^113F13H6].

> Next, I should review cancer risk factors systematically; I need to check age, skin type, personal and family history of melanoma or keratinocyte cancers, cumulative UV exposure or tanning bed use, total nevus count and presence of atypical nevi, and immunosuppression, because these features shift pre-test probability and guide urgency consistent with oncologic workups in guideline-based care and observed teledermatology risk gradients in screening cohorts [^113BsEmM].

> I will now examine lesion-specific history; I should confirm time of onset, rate of change in size/shape/color, new symptoms such as bleeding, ulceration, pruritus, pain, or crusting, any attempted treatments, and multiplicity or new lesions elsewhere, since evolution is one of the strongest melanoma signals and helps triage to in-person exam or biopsy per oncologic pathways and historic teledermatology accuracy data [^1157Qc1U] [^111dk5uh].

> Hold on, I should verify the visual assessment framework before requesting more images; for each lesion I need precise anatomic location, size with scale, morphology (macule, papule, nodule), surface character, color variegation, border definition, and whether there are similar lesions nearby, because these details determine whether dermoscopy is needed and whether tele-evaluation is safe to proceed, and teledermoscopy has higher sensitivity and specificity than clinical images alone in randomized trials and mobile workflows with strong concordance to gold standards [^113P5nCb] [^116kXkxq] [^114fGjFz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "diagnostic performance drops for pigmented versus non-pigmented lesions with sensitivity 88% vs 71%", but I should double-check; that 88% versus 71% sensitivity difference actually comes from algorithm-based smartphone apps, not clinician teledermatology, so I must not conflate AI app data with clinician-led telederm performance and should treat app outputs cautiously in triage decisions [^115ym1Fn].

> Let me first confirm image acquisition guidance to maximize diagnostic yield; I should ask for one contextual photo to show location and one close-up with a ruler or coin for scale, optimize lighting and focus, avoid shadows, capture multiple angles, part hair if present, and use dermoscopy attachments when available, because standardized imaging improves clinical utility, brief parent or patient instruction improves diagnostic concordance, and dermoscopy meaningfully improves both sensitivity and specificity over clinical images alone [^1163Cm4Y] [^115vcNo6] [^113P5nCb] [^113jtMfs].

> Now, I need to risk stratify and set expectations; I should confirm with the patient that a suspicious lesion may require in-person examination or biopsy prior to removal, because teledermoscopy triage has approximated near-100% sensitivity for melanoma and high specificity with small under-report rates, whereas broader teledermatology shows generally good but inferior performance to in-clinic care for malignant lesions, so I must keep a low threshold for escalation when images or history are equivocal [^112FAVXY] [^111KjNca] [^11731o2L].

> Let me consider management pathways carefully; if the lesion appears benign and the indication is cosmetic or mechanical irritation, removal can be planned in primary care when scopes and training permit, but for lesions with any ABCDE warning signs, rapid change, bleeding, or atypia, I should recommend urgent in-person dermatology or direct-to-biopsy when feasible, and I need to verify logistics and access constraints since teledermatology can reduce wait times by over 70% and supports ED and urgent pathways with improved diagnostic performance in real time [^114agByU] [^1137nYfW].

> I should confirm documentation and follow-up rigor; I need to record contact details, clarify patient preferences for timing, and explicitly ask about any other skin concerns to mitigate under-reporting, because complete examination often uncovers additional lesions, teledermatology programs highlight incidental melanomas found on full-skin exams, and aligning follow-up with patient preferences can improve satisfaction in oncologic surveillance pathways [^111LFBVs] [^116NteXi] [^116TGXk1] [^1144TfiN].

> But wait, what if the patient asks about using a smartphone app instead of sending images; I should explain that while AI and app-based risk tools are emerging, diagnostic accuracy is variable with risk of both false reassurance and over-calling, studies have high bias and often do not reflect real-life image capture, and clinician-led teledermatology with dermoscopy remains the safer standard for triage decisions [^115ym1Fn] [^111RDgUs] [^113xyM3w] [^113cbqZb].

> Let me summarize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the data: if any melanoma warning sign or rapid evolution is present, I will recommend urgent in-person dermatology within two weeks and request dermoscopic images if possible; if the lesion is clearly benign-appearing and stable, I will clarify indication for removal and consider primary care removal with clear return precautions; if uncertain, I will request high-quality clinical plus dermoscopic images or escalate to store-and-forward specialist review, defaulting to in-person examination if imaging is inadequate; throughout, I will complete a full skin history, document thoroughly, and arrange follow-up, aligning with dermoscopy's diagnostic gains and triage performance in trials and guideline-driven workups [^113P5nCb] [^112FAVXY].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations and safety nets explicitly; telehealth cannot replace palpation or a complete skin examination, image quality is frequently suboptimal with a meaningful proportion inadequate or even off-target, and historical store-and-forward studies show limited accuracy in a subset, so when in doubt I must pivot to in-person care and provide explicit red flags and timelines for escalation [^113jtMfs] [^111dk5uh] [^111KjNca].

For telemedicine requests to remove a skin lesion, ask about **lesion history** (onset, duration, changes, symptoms), **patient risk factors** (prior skin cancer, immunosuppression, sun exposure) [^116fzSdn], and **image quality** (clear, well-lit, close-up and overview, dermoscopy if possible) [^113P5nCb] [^113jtMfs]. Confirm the patient's **removal goals** (cosmetic vs. medical), review **medications/allergies**, and assess for **red flags** (rapid growth, bleeding, ulceration, irregular borders, color variegation, diameter > 6 mm, evolution). Ensure the patient understands the **limitations of telemedicine** [^111KjNca] and that an **in-person evaluation** may be needed for suspicious lesions or poor-quality images [^113jtMfs] [^112FAVXY].

---

## Patient history and lesion characteristics

- **When did you first notice the lesion?** Has it changed in size, shape, color, or texture [^116fzSdn]?
- **Have you experienced any symptoms** such as pain, itching, bleeding, or ulceration? [^11731o2L]
- **Have you had any previous skin cancers** or suspicious lesions removed [^111KjNca] [^116fzSdn]?
- **Do you have a family history of skin cancer** or melanoma [^116fzSdn]?
- **Have you had significant sun exposure** or use tanning beds frequently [^116fzSdn]?
- **Do you have any immunosuppressive conditions** or take immunosuppressive medications [^116fzSdn]?

---

## Patient's reason for removal

Clarify the reason for removal — determine whether the goal is **cosmetic or medical** and whether concerns center on appearance or potential malignancy. Ask about any **prior self-treatment** or home remedies that could affect evaluation or management [^111KjNca].

---

## Image quality and documentation

- **Have you provided clear, well-lit images** of the lesion from multiple angles [^1163Cm4Y]?
- **Did you include a close-up image** and an overview image showing the lesion's location on your body?
- **Have you included a dermoscopic image** if possible, as dermoscopy significantly improves diagnostic accuracy [^113P5nCb]?
- **Are the images of sufficient quality** for medical decision-making, as poor-quality images can delay diagnosis and treatment [^113jtMfs]?

---

## Medical history and medications

Review **chronic medical conditions** — such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and bleeding disorders — that could affect procedural risk or healing. Document **current medications** (e.g. blood thinners, anticoagulants, immunosuppressants) and note any **allergies** to medications or anesthetics [^116fzSdn].

---

## Red flags and indications for in-person evaluation

- **Has the lesion changed rapidly** in size, shape, or color recently?
- **Is there any bleeding, ulceration, or crusting** present [^116fzSdn]?
- **Does the lesion have irregular borders**, multiple colors, or a diameter greater than 6 mm?
- **Are there multiple lesions or lesions in difficult-to-assess locations** (e.g. scalp, mucous membranes, periocular area)?
- **Are there any signs of systemic illness** such as fever, weight loss, or lymphadenopathy?

---

## Patient understanding and expectations

Confirm that the patient understands the **limitations of telemedicine** in diagnosing and managing skin lesions [^111KjNca] and that an **in-person evaluation** may be necessary if the lesion appears suspicious or if image quality is insufficient [^113jtMfs] [^114agByU]. Ensure the patient has **realistic expectations** regarding cosmetic outcomes and the possibility of scarring from lesion removal.

---

## Follow-up and post-procedure care

Confirm the patient is prepared to follow **post-procedure care instructions**, attend follow-up appointments if necessary, and has **access to local healthcare facilities** in case of complications or recurrence [^113F13H6].

---

## Legal and ethical considerations

Confirm the patient has provided **informed consent** for the telemedicine consultation and potential lesion removal and understands the **privacy and confidentiality policies** governing their medical information and images [^113m2bj2].

### Quality and perceived usefulness of patient-submitted store-and-forward teledermatology images [^113jtMfs]. JAMA Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Patient-submitted images vary considerably in quality and usefulness. Studies that characterize these images in real-life settings are lacking. This research aims to evaluate the quality and perceived usefulness of patient-submitted images as determined by dermatologists, and to characterize the agreement among their responses.

This survey study included patient images submitted to the Department of Dermatology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, from August 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. From a total pool of 1,200 images, 10 dermatologists evaluated either 200 or 400 images each, with every image being assessed by three dermatologists. Data analysis was conducted during the year leading up to the article's writing.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcomes were responses to two questions, analyzed using frequency counts and interrater agreement (Fleiss κ) to assess image quality and perceived usefulness. A random-effects logistic regression model was used to investigate factors associated with evaluators' decision-making comfort. It was hypothesized that most images would be of low quality and perceived usefulness, with poor interrater agreement.

A total of 259 out of 2,915 patient-submitted images (8.9%) did not depict a skin condition at all. The final analysis comprised 3,600 unique image evaluations. Dermatologist evaluators indicated that 1,985 images (55.1%) were useful for medical decision-making and 2,239 (62.2%) were of sufficient quality. Interrater agreement for a given image's diagnostic…

### Internet-based skin cancer screening using clinical images alone or in conjunction with dermoscopic images: A randomized teledermoscopy trial [^113P5nCb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). High credibility.

Teledermoscopy involves the use of dermoscopic images for remote consultation and decision-making in skin cancer screening. We sought to analyze the potential benefits gained from the addition of dermoscopic images to an internet-based skin cancer screening system.

- **Methods**: A randomized clinical trial assessed the diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of clinical teleconsultations (CTC) and clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations.

- **Results**: A total of 454 patients were enrolled in the trial (n CTC = 226, n clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultation = 228). Teledermoscopy improved sensitivity and specificity (92.86% and 96.24%, respectively) compared with CTC (86.57% and 72.33%, respectively). Correct decisions were made in 94.30% of patients through clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations and in 79.20% in CTC (P < .001). The only variable associated with an increased likelihood of correct diagnosis was management using teledermoscopy (odds ratio 4.04; 95% confidence interval 2.02–8.09; P < .0001). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed teledermoscopy as the dominant strategy, with a lower cost-effectiveness ratio (65.13 vs. 80.84).

- **Limitations**: Potentially, a limitation is the establishment of an experienced dermatologist as the gold standard for the in-person evaluation.

- **Conclusions**: The addition of dermoscopic images significantly improves the results of an internet-based skin cancer screening system compared with screening systems based on clinical images alone.

### Teledermatology for diagnosis and management of skin conditions: A systematic review [^111KjNca]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011).

- **Objective**: We performed a systematic review of the literature addressing teledermatology: (1) diagnostic accuracy/concordance; (2) management accuracy/concordance; (3) clinical outcomes; and (4) costs.

- **Methods**: Peer-reviewed controlled trials published in English between 1990 and 2009 were identified through MEDLINE and PubMed searches.

- **Results**: Of 78 included studies, approximately two-thirds comparing teledermatology and clinic dermatology found better diagnostic accuracy with clinic dermatology. Diagnostic concordance of store and forward with clinic dermatology was good; concordance rates for live interactive and clinic dermatology were higher, but based on fewer patients. Overall rates of management accuracy were equivalent, but teledermatology and teledermatoscopy were inferior to clinic dermatology for malignant lesions. Management concordance was fair to excellent. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate clinical course outcomes. Patient satisfaction and preferences were comparable. Teledermatology reduced time to treatment and clinic visits and was cost-effective if certain assumptions were met.

- **Limitations**: Heterogeneity in studies (design, skin conditions, outcomes) limited the ability to pool data.

- **Conclusion**: The benefits of teledermatology need to be evaluated in the context of potential limitations.

### Inpatient teledermatology in the era of COVID-19 and the importance of the complete skin examination [^111LFBVs]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A woman in her 70s was admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation hospital following a 10-day acute hospitalization for an ischemic stroke. The inpatient dermatology team was consulted for a vesicular eruption on the buttocks. The primary physical medicine and rehabilitation team had taken a photograph and requested teleconsultation to determine whether the eruption appeared consistent with shingles. On review of the image and clinical history, the differential diagnosis included cutaneous herpes simplex and herpes zoster viral infections. Our inpatient teledermatology workflow was reviewed, and because the patient was located in a low-risk site without concerning symptoms and did not require use of limited personal protective equipment, the resident–attending physician team elected to treat the patient in person. Careful clinical examination revealed bilateral vesicular lesions on the buttocks, suggestive of cutaneous herpes simplex, which was confirmed via polymerase chain reaction testing. On full skin examination, however, an atypical pigmented lesion on her left lower leg was also identified, which had not previously been noted. An incisional biopsy was performed at the bedside, confirming the diagnosis of malignant melanoma measuring 1.1 mm deep.

- **Figure 1**: Teledermatology image provided to dermatology consultants of a vesicular rash on the buttock.

- **Figure 2**: Incidentally noted melanocytic lesion on the left shin, measuring 4 × 5.5 cm in maximal dimensions, with areas of regression and a central brown-black patch measuring 6 × 15 mm.

### Accuracy of mobile digital teledermoscopy for skin self-examinations in adults at high risk of skin cancer: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^115epHVG]. The Lancet Digital Health (2020). High credibility.

Skin self-examinations supplemented with mobile teledermoscopy might improve early detection of skin cancers compared with naked-eye skin self-examinations. We aimed to assess whether mobile teledermoscopy-enhanced skin self-examination can improve the sensitivity and specificity of self-detection of skin cancers when compared with naked-eye skin self-examination.

- **Methods**: This randomised controlled trial was conducted in Brisbane (QLD, Australia). Eligible participants (aged ≥ 18 years) had at least two self-reported skin cancer risk factors and owned or had access to an iPhone compatible with a dermatoscope attachment (iPhone versions 5–8). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation procedure, to the intervention group (mobile dermoscopy-enhanced self-skin examination) or the control group (naked-eye skin self-examination). Both groups received web-based instructions on how to complete a whole body skin self-examination. All participants completed skin examinations at baseline, 1 month, and 2 months.

	- Intervention group participants submitted photographs of suspicious lesions to a dermatologist for telediagnosis after each skin examination.
	- Control group participants noted lesions on a body chart that was sent to the research team after each skin examination.

All participants had an in-person whole-body clinical skin examination within 3 months of their last skin self-examination. The primary outcomes were sensitivity and specificity of skin self-examination.

### Teledermatology: a review [^1157Qc1U]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Teledermatology holds great potential for revolutionizing the delivery of dermatology services, providing equitable service to remote areas and allowing primary care physicians to refer patients to dermatology centers of excellence at a distance. However, before its routine application as a service tool, its reliability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness need to be verified by rigorous evaluation.

Teledermatology can be applied in one of two ways: it may be conducted in real-time, utilizing videoconferencing equipment, or by store-and-forward methods, where transmitted digital images or photographs are submitted with a clinical history. While there is a considerable range of reported accuracy and reliability, evidence suggests that teledermatology will become increasingly utilized and incorporated into more conventional dermatology service delivery systems.

Studies at the time of writing have generally found that real-time dermatology is likely to allow greater clinical information to be obtained from the patient, which may result in fewer patients requiring conventional consultations. However, it is generally more time-consuming and costly to the health service provider. It is often favored by the patient because of the instantaneous nature of the diagnosis and management regimen for the condition, and it has educational value for the primary care physician.

Store-and-forward systems of teledermatology often give high levels of diagnostic accuracy, and are cheaper and more convenient for the health care provider, but lack the immediacy of patient contact with the dermatologist and involve a delay.

### Teledermatology reduces dermatology referrals and improves access to specialists [^114agByU]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Teledermatology may be used for triage in primary care to address skin conditions, improving access and reducing time to treat the most severe or surgical cases. We aimed to evaluate the proportion of individuals who could be assessed in primary care using teledermatology, and how this affected the waiting time for an in-person dermatologist appointment.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional retrospective study, involving 30,976 individuals and 55,624 skin lesions, was performed from July 2017 to July 2018. We assessed the frequency of diagnoses and referrals to biopsy, to in-person dermatologists, or to primary care, and compared the waiting time for an in-person dermatologist appointment before and after the teledermatology implementation.

- **Findings**: 53% of the patients were managed with the primary care physician, 43% were referred to in-person dermatologists and 4% directly to biopsy, leading to a reduction of 78% in the waiting time for in-person appointments when compared to the previous period. The most frequent diseases were melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, acne, benign neoplasms, onychomycosis, atopic dermatitis, solar lentigo, melasma, xerosis, and epidermoid cyst, with significant differences according to sex, age, and referrals. The most frequent treatment prescribed was emollient.

- **Interpretation**: The use of teledermatology as a triage tool significantly reduced the waiting time for in-person visits, improving health care access and utilizing public resources wisely. Knowledge of sex, age, diagnoses, and treatment of common skin conditions can enable public health systems to optimize resource allocation.

### Impact of dermatology eConsults on access to care and skin cancer screening in underserved populations: A model for teledermatology services in community health centers [^113F13H6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical outcome of teledermatology with dermoscopy in large-scale primary care networks remains unclear.

We evaluate the impact of implementing a teledermatology consultation program with dermoscopy on a statewide scale, focusing on access to care and skin cancer screening for medically underserved populations. This is a descriptive retrospective cohort study of 2,385 dermatology referrals from primary care, conducted from June 2014 through November 2015.

Before implementing electronic consultations (eConsults), access to dermatology was limited; only 139 (11%) of 1,258 referrals resulted in a confirmed appointment with a median wait time of 77 days. Post implementation, 499 of 1,127 consults (44%) were sent electronically, of which 16% required a face-to-face visit with a median wait time of 28 days. Ten malignancies were identified via eConsults. Overall, consult volume remained stable pre- and post-eConsult implementation.

We evaluated eConsults in medically underserved populations seeking care at community health centers. Results might not be generalizable to other populations or in other settings.

eConsults increase access to dermatologic care and reduce wait times for patients receiving medical care at community health centers. Implementing dermoscopy into teledermatology could increase access to skin cancer screening and treatment for medically disadvantaged populations.

### Supporting virtual dermatology consultation in the setting of COVID-19 [^112XkpLR]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

We outline how, with the support of administration, clinicians, information technology, and nursing, we were able to rapidly implement teledermatology services for patients at multiple locations to continue providing critical patient care. The expansion of reimbursement for telemedicine by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), while beyond the scope of this work, also supported our efforts to implement store-and-forward static image-based consultations, live face-to-face teledermatology, and telephone encounters.

- **Patient scenarios**: We addressed three patient scenarios where teledermatology services were desirable:
	1. Patient at home
	2. Patient in an office that was not a dermatology office
	3. Patient admitted to the hospital (inpatient)

- **Dermatology responses**: We implemented three types of dermatology responses to these scenarios:
	- Live telemedicine visits
	- Store-and-forward dermatology consultation
	- Traditional in-person visit for urgent/emergent cases

In this report, we describe the implementation of teledermatology services by the Dermatology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

### Patient preferences for follow-up after recent excision of a localized melanoma [^116TGXk1]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

The standard model of follow-up post-treatment for localized melanoma relies on clinician detection of recurrent or new melanoma through routinely scheduled clinics, known as clinician-led surveillance. An alternative model proposes increased reliance on patient detection with fewer scheduled visits and enhanced support for patients' skin self-examination (SSE). This approach may include smartphone apps to instruct, prompt, and record SSE, and facilitate teledermatology, termed patient-led surveillance.

The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of adults treated for localized melanoma who prefer the standard scheduled visit frequency, as per Australian guideline recommendations, versus fewer scheduled visits, adapted from the Melanoma Follow-up (MELFO) study of reduced follow-up.

The study's design involved a survey using telephone interviews conducted at an Australian specialist center. A random sample of 400 patients who completed treatment for localized melanoma in 2014 was invited to participate. Participants were asked about their preferences for scheduled follow-up and their experiences with follow-up in the past 12 months. Those who had a recurrent or new primary melanoma diagnosed by the time of the interview, occurring 0.8–1.7 years since the first diagnosis, were inquired about how it was first detected and treated. SSE practices were also assessed.

The main outcomes and measures included the proportion of participants preferring standard versus fewer scheduled clinic visits, the median delay between the detection and treatment of recurrent or new primary melanoma, and SSE practices.

### Emergency department diagnosis and management of skin diseases with real-time teledermatologic expertise [^1137nYfW]. JAMA Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Skin conditions are a common reason for patients to consult emergency department (ED) physicians. This study aimed to evaluate real-time teledermatologic expertise using mobile telephones for the diagnosis and management of skin conditions in patients seen in the ED.

This observational study involved adults who consecutively consulted in the ED for a dermatologic condition under routine conditions from May 1, 2008, through June 30, 2010. The main outcomes measured were diagnosis agreement and management concordance.

A total of 111 patients were enrolled in the study, with 83 patients (74.8%) evaluated using videoconferencing. Dermatologic remote expertise invalidated, enlarged, or clarified ED physicians' diagnosis and management in 75 of 110 cases (68.2%). Videoconferencing improved the diagnostic performance in 57 of 83 cases (68.7%). Management concordance was moderate between ED physicians and dermatologists for specialist consultation within 24 hours (κ, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.14–0.84) and immediate hospitalization (κ, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.57). Patients were significantly more often discharged by dermatologists (46.8% vs. 39.1%).

Compared with standard hardware, new-generation mobile devices reduce the cost of videoconferencing, increase the versatility of teledermatology, and decrease general practitioner investment time.

### Application of mobile teledermatology for skin cancer screening [^113BsEmM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

With advancements in mobile technology, cellular phone-based store-and-forward teledermatology may be applied to skin cancer screening.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine diagnostic and management concordance between in-person and teledermatology evaluations for patients at skin cancer screenings whose clinical images and history were transmitted through mobile phones.

- **Methods**: A total of 86 patients with 137 skin lesions presented to a skin cancer screening event in California. These patients' clinical history and skin images were captured by a software-enabled mobile phone. Patients were assessed separately by an in-person dermatologist and a teledermatologist, who evaluated the mobile phone-transmitted history and images. Diagnostic and management concordance was determined between the in-person and teledermatology evaluations.

- **Results**: The primary categorical diagnostic concordance was 82% between the in-person dermatologist and the teledermatologist (95% confidence interval 0.73–0.89), with a Kappa coefficient of 0.62 indicating good agreement. The aggregated diagnostic concordance between the in-person dermatologist and the teledermatologist was 62% (95% confidence interval 0.51–0.71), with a Kappa coefficient of 0.60 indicating good agreement. Management concordance between the in-person dermatologist and the teledermatologist was 81% (95% confidence interval 0.72–0.88), with a Kappa coefficient of 0.57, which indicates moderate agreement between the dermatologists. Multivariate analysis showed that older age and presentation of atypical nevus were significant factors.

### Diagnostic accuracy of pediatric teledermatology using parent-submitted photographs: A randomized clinical trial [^115vcNo6]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). High credibility.

Advances in smartphone photography, including both quality and image transmission, may improve access to care via direct parent-to-clinician telemedicine. However, the accuracy of diagnoses based on parent-provided photographs has not been formally compared with diagnoses made in person.

To assess whether smartphone photographs of pediatric skin conditions, taken by parents, are of sufficient quality for accurate diagnosis, a prospective study was conducted. This involved 40 patient-parent dyads at a pediatric dermatology clinic at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from March 1 to September 30, 2016. The study aimed to assess concordance between diagnoses made by an independent pediatric dermatologist based on in-person examination and those based on parental photographs. Half of the patient-parent dyads were randomized for a secondary analysis to receive instructions on how best to take photographs with smartphones. Clinicians were blinded to whether parents had received photography instructions.

Half of the patient-parent dyads received a simple, 3-step instruction sheet on how best to take photographs using a smartphone (intervention group), whereas the other half did not (control group).

The main outcomes measured were the concordance between photograph-based versus in-person diagnosis in the intervention versus control groups. This was quantified using Cohen's κ, a measure of interrater agreement adjusted for the possibility of agreement occurring by chance.

### Patient satisfaction with a new skin cancer teledermatology service [^114QEQmq]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Rising numbers of two-week-wait (2WW) skin cancer referrals have caused increasing pressure on UK dermatology departments. Initiatives to address this include teledermatology. Previous studies have indicated good patient acceptability, but most have focused on general dermatology rather than skin cancer referrals and have taken place in rural settings, where teledermatology may be preferable.

- **Aim**: To evaluate patient satisfaction with teledermatology 2WW services in a London-based tertiary National Health Service (NHS) setting.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed, and a patient satisfaction survey was designed to evaluate: (i) ease of completing a questionnaire about the skin lesion; (ii) lifestyle impact; (iii) preferences regarding electronic data collection and communication of results; and (iv) confidence in the service. A five-point Likert scale was used to assess responses. The study took place over a 20-week period.

- **Results**: Over half (51%; n = 31 of 60 patients) were female; 78% (47) were aged ≤ 55 years, and 65% (39) were Caucasian. Over 80% (49) would recommend the service, and the majority felt confident with the teledermatology model. Overall, patients would be happy to complete electronic questionnaires and receive results electronically, with younger patients being more amenable to this. Patients with better health status, those of younger age, and those with less frequent visits to a dermatologist were more accepting of teledermatology.

### Artificial intelligence in mobile health for skin cancer diagnostics at home (AIM HIGH): a pilot feasibility study [^113xyM3w]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

General practitioners (GPs) face an increasing number of consultations for potentially cancerous skin lesions that most often turn out to be benign. This increasing workload is further complicated by their struggle to recognize cutaneous malignancies, resulting in avoidable referrals of benign skin lesions to secondary care or late recognition of cutaneous malignancies.

Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms have been developed for the detection of skin cancer. Some of these algorithms are now available on mobile phone (mHealth) applications and are accessible to the general population or healthcare providers. Using simple smartphone pictures, these apps can classify suspicious skin lesions as high or low risk for skin cancer. It is important that, when implemented, the accuracy of these apps is higher than the standard of care to reduce the risk of potential negative consequences. If such conditions are met, the implementation of such mHealth apps could be a potential solution to the high patient volume and the diagnostic challenges faced by GPs.

We envision that this technology can be employed in two distinct phases of the healthcare journey to streamline care for patients with suspicious skin lesions. First, these apps could be used by laypersons as a triaging tool prior to consulting a GP, which could potentially lead to a reduction in consultations for benign skin lesions. The second phase could involve the use of an app by the GP as a diagnostic aid for the assessment of suspicious skin lesions.

### Algorithm based smartphone apps to assess risk of skin cancer in adults: Systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^1174paFf]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Two authors independently extracted data using a prespecified data extraction form and assessed study quality. For diagnostic accuracy, each study ideally prospectively recruited a representative sample of patients who used the app on their smartphone device to evaluate lesions of concern. Verification of results, blinded to the apps' findings, was conducted to determine whether each lesion evaluated was skin cancer or not, using histological assessment (if excised) or follow-up (if not excised). For verification with expert recommendations, all lesions assessed by the app were reassessed in person by an expert dermatologist. Data were reported for all lesions, including those for which the app failed to provide an assessment. These aspects of study quality were assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool (QUADAS-2; online supplementary appendix 3). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

We plotted estimates of sensitivity and specificity from each study on coupled forest plots for each variation of each app. The app recommendations associated with the risk of melanoma for the different apps were tabulated. When apps reported three risk categories (high, moderate, low risk), we used the recommendations provided by each app to decide whether moderate risk results from the app should be combined with low or high risk results for the estimation of test accuracy. In cases of ambiguity, both options were pursued.

### How to do digital advice and guidance well [^1144TfiN]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a rapid expansion of digital advice and guidance (A&G) across UK medical and surgical specialties. Dermatology A&G requests have increased by over 400% since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, with a rapid expansion of teledermatology A&G services across England. Dermatology A&G is usually carried out asynchronously through dedicated digital platforms such as the National Health Service e-referral service, with streamlined conversion to referral if clinically indicated. A&G with images is advocated as the main referral pathway to dermatology specialist services in England (excluding the 2-week wait suspected skin cancer pathway).

Providing dermatological care through A&G requires specific clinical skill sets to ensure rapid, safe, and collaborative delivery, and optimization of educational benefit. Little published guidance is available to signpost clinicians to what constitutes a high-quality A&G request and response. This educational article discusses good clinical practice based on extensive local and national experience from primary and secondary care doctors.

- **Digital communication skills**: We cover digital communication skills, shared decision making, clinical competency, and building collaborative links between patients, referrers, and specialists. High-quality A&G, with agreed turnaround times and optimization of technology, can significantly streamline patient care and strengthen links between clinicians, providing it is appropriately resourced within the wider planning of elective care and outpatient activity.

### Teledermatology: Kids are not just little people [^111Q5EA9]. Clinics in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Teledermatology has emerged as a promising solution for both pediatric and adult patients accessing dermatologic care in a health care environment fraught with barriers to access. It has been extensively evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy, clinical outcomes, patient and provider satisfaction, and costs, relative to traditional health care delivery models. Research indicates that teledermatology is effective and efficient in the diagnosis and management of skin diseases.

The majority of studies on the subject, however, rely on adult patient data. Pediatric patients, with their unique clinical features and challenges, may interact with telemedicine differently than their adult counterparts. Maximizing the benefits of teledermatology in pediatric dermatologic care is dependent on future research. This review analyzes the commonalities and differences between pediatric and adult patient care using teledermatology.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Squamous cell skin cancer, version 1.2022 [^116fzSdn]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the NCCN, specifically in their 2021 guidelines, recommends obtaining the following preliminary workup for a lesion suspicious for skin cancer:

- **History and physical examination**: Conduct a comprehensive evaluation.

- **Biopsy**: If the lesion is more than superficial, include the deep reticular dermis for a more accurate diagnosis.

- **Imaging studies**: Order imaging studies of the area of interest as indicated for suspected locally extensive or metastatic disease. Recognize that extensive disease includes deep involvement such as bone, named nerves, and deep soft tissue.
	- **MRI with and without contrast**: Obtain if disease of named nerve(s) is suspected.
	- **CT with contrast**: Obtain if bone disease is suspected, unless contraindicated. The treating team should decide the imaging modality and targeted area based on the suspected extent of disease (local, regional, or metastatic).
	- **Histologic confirmation**: Obtain to diagnose local recurrence. Consider obtaining MRI with and without contrast to assess the extent of local disease. Obtain histologic analysis and/or additional imaging modalities to confirm nodal or distant metastases and assess the extent of disease.
	- **MRI of the brain**: Consider obtaining MRI with and without contrast to rule out subclinical cortical involvement in cases with bone invasion.

### Teledermatology in practice [^117JxRyk]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Teledermatology has been the focus of much interest in recent years. Potential uses include a simple supporting role for primary care, more accurate triage of dermatology patients, or an "advice only" service reducing the need for dermatology patients to attend outpatient clinics. With the under-provision of dermatology services in the UK and the waiting list targets set by the government, teledermatology systems have been proposed as a possible solution. "Store and forward" teledermatology systems are easy to set up, and it has been shown that accurate diagnoses can be made using digital images attached to an emailed history.

In an area of geographical isolation, a store and forward teledermatology system has been used successfully to reduce patient waiting times. In Peterborough, we have been using a store and forward teledermatology system for over four years. Our experience has demonstrated that for only a small number of selected patients, it was possible to provide an advice-only service, but the majority of patients still need to be seen in the outpatient clinic. Despite the technical simplicity of these systems today, there is still little evidence that teledermatology will have a significant impact on patient workload in the average dermatology clinic.

It must be recognized that teledermatology is potentially a useful communication tool for selected patients in primary care but is unlikely to solve waiting list problems or replace the need for local dermatology services.

### Inpatient teledermatology in the era of COVID-19 and the importance of the complete skin examination [^116NteXi]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In this case, in-person evaluation by dermatologists led to a profound influence on morbidity and, potentially, mortality. Near-miss cases such as this allow an opportunity for reflection and highlight the importance of the ability to accurately triage patients before determining whether they are amenable to teleconsultation. This requires a complete understanding of what is truly on their skin — including a full skin examination to identify additional, subtle features of disease or secondary diagnoses — which may be more important than the reason for consultation itself. Indeed, additional cutaneous diagnoses are not uncommon in the hospital setting, reported in 12% of hospitalized oncology patients in a single cohort. The reliability of referring provider examination is also undefined. Previous investigation of outpatient dermatology referrals for evaluation of specific lesions of interest demonstrated a significant proportion of malignant lesions that were incidentally found and previously unrecognized by the referring provider.

When one is presented with an isolated image, it can be very difficult to accurately assess risk, particularly if the image quality is poor. Subsequent in-person evaluation can reduce the potential for misdiagnosis, although this is not always possible. Although the viral pandemic presents unique barriers to patient care and requires practice flexibility, the need for inpatient teleconsultation will likely persist in underserved areas because of the incidence of cutaneous disease among hospitalized patients.

### Inpatient teledermatology in the era of COVID-19 and the importance of the complete skin examination [^115Lsifm]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, an unprecedented increase in telemedicine use has occurred. Rapid implementation of teledermatology in all subsets of the specialty has led to unique opportunities, as well as challenges. For dermatology hospitalists, the viral pandemic necessitated the creation of original workflow algorithms designed to balance the risk of exposure and resource consumption with the unique needs of hospitalized patients with skin disease. Teleconsultation was identified as a valuable tool; however, this modality necessitates the shift of vital components of dermatology consultation to the referring provider, including meaningful and complete skin examination, as well as procurement of appropriate, quality images. This is an important limitation and an area for opportunity and education, as highlighted by the following case.

### The clinical utility of teledermoscopy in the era of telemedicine [^114fGjFz]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Teledermoscopy is a novel diagnostic tool for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of skin diseases when direct visualization of lesions is difficult. It is an economically viable option that can complement telehealth visits, allowing providers to identify melanocytic lesions and optimize care with diagnostic accuracy comparable to face-to-face (FTF) diagnoses. Teledermoscopy is invaluable in monitoring chronic conditions requiring frequent follow-up and treatment optimization. Inclusion of clinical and dermoscopic images has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology services, thus reducing healthcare costs.

- **Nondiscriminatory accuracy**: Teledermoscopy exhibits similar diagnostic accuracy in both lighter and darker skin types. It enhances patient access to specialty services and reduces "no-shows" at FTF clinics and the length of surgery waiting times.

- **Economic viability**: Mobile teledermoscopy is user-friendly and feasible with inexpensive mobile dermatoscopes available on the market, reducing consumer out-of-pocket costs.

Research is limited on teledermoscopy's utility in diagnosing precancerous and cancerous skin lesions in adults, particularly complex pigmented lesions. Further research is recommended to investigate the role of dermoscopic expertise and artificial intelligence in evaluating teledermoscopic images.

### Artificial intelligence in mobile health for skin cancer diagnostics at home (AIM HIGH): a pilot feasibility study [^117695Dq]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

The final diagnosis was based on histopathology in 20% (n = 10) of the cases, in 8% (n = 4) on the clinical diagnosis by a dermatologist, and in 62% (n = 31) on the assessment of the panel of teledermatologists. Data collection was mostly complete, with only a few missing data points. In 18% (n = 9) there was no information about the patients' phone type, two patients did not indicate whether they thought the app's assessment would have influenced their decision to visit a GP, and in one case the GP did not register a differential diagnosis. In six cases, there was no teledermatology assessment because of failed photos (8%, n = 4) or because the patients did not fill in the photo identifier and could not be reached thereafter (4%, n = 2). In five cases (10%), this led to a missing final diagnosis because the lesion was neither seen by a dermatologist nor was histopathology available.

- **Barriers and facilitators for successful participation**: Qualitative analysis resulted in 5 overarching themes divided into 7 main barriers and 4 main facilitators. All themes, barriers, facilitators, and corresponding subthemes are presented in Table 2. Below, we elaborate on the most important concepts regarding the feasibility of the study.

	- Table 2 outlines the barriers and facilitators for study feasibility based on ethnographic observations, audio-diaries, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews with the GP, GPA, and patients.

- **Time and resources**: The first theme identified was time and resources. The main underlying barrier was a lack of time and resources, causing pressure.

### Technical challenges of enterprise imaging: HIMSS-SIIM collaborative white paper [^112EFrc9]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Imaging plays a significant role in dermatology for purposes such as comparing lesions and skin conditions over time, facilitating discussions with patients, enabling remote reviews (teledermatology), as well as enhancing teaching and research efforts. Typically, imaging is not utilized for primary diagnosis, which is traditionally performed visually or through biopsy, with some exceptions in teledermatology applications.

Instruments used for recording images include digital cameras and microscopes with digital image output capabilities. Medical photography in dermatology proves essential for tracking skin conditions longitudinally, transcending subjective written descriptions and inconsistent memory recalls that plague traditional methods. It also serves educational and publication purposes. Despite its benefits, many dermatologists hesitate to use photography due to the associated costs and complexity. To counter these challenges, the adoption of low-cost, reasonable quality, and readily available digital cameras is advocated. Emphasizing correct photographic techniques along with recording the patient's identity, date, and anatomical region is vital. Identifiable information and anatomical landmarks in images are helpful in cases where formal metadata systems are absent. However, these do not support easy retrieval indexing and pose challenges when de-identification is required. Consequently, for enterprise-level image distribution, implementing a sophisticated workflow that minimizes user burden while facilitating metadata capture is advisable.

Apart from hand-held photography, specialized dermatological devices cater to specific visible light applications. For instance, dermatoscopes are used for epiluminescence microscopy of skin lesions.

### Algorithm based smartphone apps to assess risk of skin cancer in adults: Systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^115ym1Fn]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

The performance of algorithm-based smartphone apps for skin cancer assessment is evaluated in this systematic review. Figure 2 presents results based on individual lesions. It is noted that no peer-reviewed studies have been published evaluating the TeleSkin skinScan app. The predecessor to SkinVision, known as SkinScan, was evaluated in a single study involving only 15 lesions, which included five melanomas. Sensitivity was observed to be low, irrespective of whether moderate risk was combined with low or high-risk categories, reporting 0% or 20% respectively, with specificities corresponding to 100% and 60% (refer to Figure 2).

When considering only high-risk results as test positive, the original SkinVision app demonstrated a sensitivity of 73% (95% confidence interval of 52% to 88%) in a study involving pigmented lesions (n = 144, 26 melanomas). However, sensitivity dropped to 26% (12% to 43%) when applied to both pigmented and non-pigmented lesions (n = 108, 35 malignant or premalignant lesions). The app accurately identified only one out of three melanomas as high risk. Corresponding specificities were 83% and 75% (see Figure 2).

A later revision of the app to accommodate non-pigmented lesions resulted in an increase of 15 percentage points in sensitivity for melanoma detection when applied to the original pigmented lesion dataset, showing a sensitivity of 88% (95% confidence interval 70% to 98%), although specificity decreased by 3 percentage points (79%, 70% to 86%). Furthermore, sensitivity for detecting malignant or premalignant lesions increased by 45 percentage points when considering both pigmented and non-pigmented lesion datasets, with a resulting sensitivity of 71% (54% to 85%), but specificity decreased by 19 percentage points (56%, 44% to 68%).

### Accuracy of periocular lesion assessment using telemedicine [^111veo7U]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). Low credibility.

To assess the agreement in diagnosis and management plans reached between clinicians reviewing eyelid lesions remotely and in face-to-face clinics.

- **Methods**: In this single-centre observational case series, data were prospectively collected on 50 consecutive adults referred with eyelid lesions suitable to be seen by a nurse. A proforma was completed to gather salient information. A nurse specialist saw patients in face-to-face clinics and collected information using the proforma, devising a diagnosis and management plan. Photographs of the eyelid lesions were taken by a medical photographer. A subsequent remote review was completed by an oculoplastic consultant using the proforma information and photographs in the absence of the patient. The diagnosis and management plan constructed by the nurse specialist were compared with those reached by the consultant.

- **Results**: Complete data were available for 44 consecutive cases. There was an overall 91% agreement (40 cases out of 44) between the diagnoses reached by the nurse specialist and the remote reviewer; kappa coefficient 0.88 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). There was an overall 82% agreement (36 out of 44 cases) in the management plans devised by the nurse-led clinic and remote reviewer; kappa coefficient 0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.90). The average time taken for a remote reviewer to reach a diagnosis and management plan was 1 min and 20 s.

- **Conclusions**: This study evaluated the feasibility of assessing eyelid lesions using asynchronous telemedicine. There was overall a high rate of concordance in the diagnosis reached.

### Mobile teledermatology for skin tumour screening: diagnostic accuracy of clinical and dermoscopic image tele-evaluation using cellular phones [^116kXkxq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The ability to accurately diagnose malignant skin tumours and distinguish them from benign lesions is vital in ensuring appropriate patient management. Little is known about the effects of mobile teledermatology services on diagnostic accuracy and their appropriateness for skin tumour surveillance.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and dermoscopic image tele-evaluation for mobile skin tumour screening.

- **Methods**: Over a 3-month period, up to three clinical and dermoscopic images were obtained of 113 skin tumours from 88 patients using a mobile phone camera. Dermoscopic images were taken with a dermatoscope applied to the camera lens. Clinical and dermoscopic images of each lesion, together with clinical information, were separately teletransmitted for decision-making. Results were compared with those obtained by face-to-face examination and histopathology as the gold standard.

- **Results**: A total of 322 clinical and 278 dermoscopic images were acquired. Two (1%) clinical and 18 (6%) dermoscopic pictures were inadequate for decision-making. After excluding inadequate images, the majority of which were dermoscopic, only 104 of the 113 skin tumours from 80 of 88 patients could be tele-evaluated. Among these 104 lesions, 25 (24%) benign nonmelanocytic, 15 (14%) benign melanocytic, 58 (56%) malignant nonmelanocytic, and six (6%) malignant melanocytic lesions were identified. Clinical and dermoscopic tele-evaluations demonstrated strong concordance with the gold standard (κ = 0.84 for each), and similar high sensitivity and specificity.

### Teledermatology for diagnosing skin cancer in adults [^11731o2L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Early accurate detection of all skin cancer types is essential to guide appropriate management and improve morbidity and survival. Melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are high-risk skin cancers with the potential to metastasize and ultimately lead to death, whereas basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is usually localized with the potential to infiltrate and damage surrounding tissue. Anxiety about missing early curable cases needs to be balanced against inappropriate referral and unnecessary excision of benign lesions. Teledermatology provides a way for generalist clinicians to access the opinion of a specialist dermatologist for skin lesions that they consider suspicious without referring the patients through the normal referral pathway. Teledermatology consultations can be 'store-and-forward', with electronic digital images of a lesion sent to a dermatologist for review at a later time, or can be live and interactive consultations using videoconferencing to connect the patient, referrer, and dermatologist in real-time.

- **Objectives**: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of teledermatology for detecting any skin cancer (melanoma, BCC, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)) in adults and to compare its accuracy with that of in-person diagnosis.

- **Search methods**: We undertook a comprehensive search of the following databases from inception up to August 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, CPCI, Zetoc, Science Citation Index, and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register.

### Proposed technical guidelines for the acquisition of clinical images of skin-related conditions [^1163Cm4Y]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Standardizing dermatological imaging is important to improve monitoring of skin lesions and skin conditions, ensure the availability of high-quality images for teledermatology, and contribute to the development of a robust archive of skin images to be used for research.

To provide guidelines for the clinical application of the standards for dermatological imaging set forward by the ISIC, the ISIC recommendations were developed through a hybrid Delphi methodology. The methods for achieving consensus have been described previously. The practical application of these recommendations was evaluated by two clinical photographers with expertise in skin imaging. Images corresponding to each recommendation were taken by a clinical photographer and provided as visual examples of how these recommendations can be implemented in clinical practice.

- **Results**: The standards for dermatological imaging developed by the ISIC members could be followed in the clinical setting. Images showing appropriate lighting, background color, field of view, image orientation, focus and depth of field, resolution, and scale and color calibration were obtained by the clinical photographer by following the detailed recommendations for regional, close-up, and dermoscopic images.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Adhering to the recommendations is both feasible and achievable in practice. Adopting these standards is the first step in achieving international standardization of skin imaging, with the potential to improve clinical outcomes and research activities.

### Photography in teledermatology: Comparing the clinical photographer-, general practitioner- and patient-led model in skin cancers [^114Ebma4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Use of teledermatology is increasing to meet rising demands, particularly for urgent suspected skin cancer referrals. High-quality photography is imperative in facilitating clinical assessments. In this article, we therefore seek to evaluate different modalities of image capture obtained by clinical photographers (CPs), general practitioners (GPs), and patients to support reliable and scalable teledermatology services. Interpretable dermoscopic and macroscopic images of suspicious lesions must be captured for safe patient assessment. This relies on appropriate training, access to and use of equipment, and reliable infrastructure to support the transfer of confidential images to specialists.

CPs are specifically trained in these domains and therefore well suited to the conventional 'store-and-forward' teledermatology model. Within the GP model, consistent dermoscopy use is resource intensive, considering device costs, maintenance, and training for appropriate use. Time constraints within the primary care system further limit full buy-in to this model. There is little data about patient-initiated images, although there is some suggestion that these may be more appropriate for non-lesional skin disease (i.e. excluding benign or malignant skin lesions), such as inflammatory skin disease or skin infections.

The evidence for a CP-led model remains superior, given the reliability of delivering high-quality images. It is, however, best suited to populations in urban centers. Remote populations may benefit from community hubs, but this is resource dependent. There may be a role.

### Skin imaging: Is it clinically useful [^116uXPnd]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Non-invasive skin imaging techniques have proliferated over the last decade. Whilst most have a research role, some are routinely used in dermatology clinics. Of these, the skin surface microscope (dermatoscope), a diagnostic aid for pigmented lesions, has had the most clinical impact. Such devices, when linked to a videomicroscope for computer analysis, have been dubbed as 'mole scanners'. Mole scanners are increasingly available on a commercial basis, even though computer diagnosis of pigmented lesions is currently no better than diagnosis by human experts. Meanwhile, other imaging techniques, such as high-resolution ultrasonography, spectroscopy, and optical coherence tomography, may yet find a role in diagnosis and disease monitoring.

### Teledermatology expedites urgent care for a case of acral melanoma with cutaneous in-transit metastases [^114pm61i]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Access to a dermatologist improves melanoma health outcomes. Yet, patients in the United States face significant barriers to dermatologic care, a problem that can be partially ameliorated through telemedicine, or the "use of medical information exchanged via electronic communications to improve a patient's clinical health status". As a highly visual specialty, dermatology is particularly well-suited for telemedicine (i.e. teledermatology). This report details a patient case in which teledermatology was essential for identifying an atypical lesion as amelanotic melanoma. This case is a prime example of teledermatology's utility in expediting urgent dermatologic care, especially for rare skin cancers, the atypical appearances of which often result in missed diagnosis and worse prognosis.

### A pilot trial of mobile, patient-performed teledermoscopy [^1124VGWb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Early detection by skin self-examination (SSE) could improve outcomes for melanoma. Mobile teledermoscopy may aid this process.

- **Objectives**: To establish the clinical accuracy of SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy vs. clinical skin examination (CSE) and to test whether providing people with detailed SSE instructions improves accuracy.

- **Methods**: Men and women aged 50–64 years (n = 58) performed SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy in their homes between May and November 2013. They were given technical instructions plus detailed SSE instructions (intervention) or technical instructions only (control). Within 3 months, they underwent a CSE. Outcome measures included (i) body sites examined, lesions photographed, and missed; (ii) sensitivity of SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy vs. in-person CSE using either patients or lesions as the denominator; and (iii) concordance of telediagnosis with CSE.

- **Results**: Overall, 49 of 58 randomized participants completed the study and submitted 309 lesions to the teledermatologist. Intervention-group participants were more likely to submit lesions from their legs compared with controls (P = 0.03), with no other differences. Eleven participants (22%) did not photograph 14 pigmented lesions that the dermatologist considered worthwhile photographing or monitoring. The sensitivity of SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy was 82% using the patient as the denominator and 42% using the lesion as the denominator. There was substantial agreement between telediagnosis and CSE (κ = 0.90), accounting for differential diagnoses.

- **Conclusions**: SSE plus mobile teledermoscopy is effective for…

### Can we safely diagnose pigmented lesions from stored video images? A diagnostic comparison between clinical examination and stored video images of pigmented lesions removed for histology [^112Gk8tB]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Rapid expansion of communication technology has permitted the clinician to perform a consultation with a patient located at a different site. Assuming adequate diagnostic accuracy, it could theoretically be possible to use telemedical techniques as a triage tool. Images of pigmented lesions sent by the primary care physician could be viewed by the consultant dermatologist, and those with banal lesions spared from attending the clinic. Previous studies assessing diagnostic accuracy of images of lesions have used 'face-to-face' diagnoses as the 'gold standard'. We set out to compare diagnostic accuracy of image examination with that of clinical examination, using histological examination as the diagnostic benchmark.

We found that pigmented lesions may be diagnosed as accurately by stored video image evaluation as by conventional clinical examination. None of the malignant skin tumors was misdiagnosed as benign in either group. Whilst these results are encouraging in terms of the clinical safety of store-and-forward imaging, the inability to examine the whole patient or to palpate the lesions may severely limit the acceptability of the technique. Further evaluation of the cost-benefit ratio of such a system to the health care provider must be undertaken before considering this technique as a potential adjunct to managing outpatient referrals.

### Can dermatologists reach their full potential in teledermatology? A validation study of diagnostic performance of skin diseases in live video conferencing teledermatology [^116PiPGL]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy rate of live videoconferencing (LVC) teledermatology by board-certified dermatologists compared to non-dermatologists has not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of board-certified dermatologists, dermatology specialty trainees, and board-certified internists in LVC teledermatology. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians from different specialties diagnosing the same group of patients. The clinicians were isolated from each other during the diagnosis process.

We enrolled 18 volunteer physicians (six board-certified dermatologists, six dermatology specialty trainees, and six board-certified internists) who reviewed the skin conditions of 18 patients via LVC teledermatology. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the final diagnosis as the reference standard, and averages were compared according to the physicians' specialties and disease categories.

- **Diagnostic accuracy rates**: The mean ± standard deviation diagnostic accuracy of the most detailed level diagnosis was 83.3% ± 3.5% (range, 77.8% - 89.0%) for board-certified dermatologists, 53.7% ± 20.7% (range 27.8% - 77.8%) for dermatology specialty trainees, and 27.8% ± 5.0% (range, 22.2% - 33.3%) for board-certified internists. Board-certified dermatologists showed significantly higher diagnostic accuracy, not only against board-certified internists (p < 0.0001) but also against dermatology specialty trainees (p < 0.05).

- **Disease categories**: Categories with high accuracy rates (≥ 80%) only achieved by board-certified dermatologists were inflammatory conditions.

### Teledermatology: From historical perspective to emerging techniques of the modern era: Part I: History, rationale, and current practice [^116nRJGB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications technology to support health care at a distance. Technological advances have progressively increased the ability of clinicians to care for diverse patient populations in need of skin expertise. Dermatology relies on visual cues that are easily captured by imaging technologies, making it ideally suited for this care model. Moreover, there is a shortage of medical dermatologists in the United States, where skin disorders account for 1 in 8 primary care visits, and specialists tend to congregate in urban areas. Even in regions where dermatologic expertise is readily accessible, teledermatology may serve as an alternative that streamlines health care delivery by triaging chief complaints and reducing unnecessary in-person visits. In addition, many patients in the developing world have no access to dermatologic expertise, rendering it possible for teledermatologists to make a significant contribution to patient health outcomes. Teledermatology also affords educational benefits to primary care providers and dermatologists and enables patients to play a more active role in the health care process by promoting direct communication with dermatologists.

### Supporting virtual dermatology consultation in the setting of COVID-19 [^1162vgBF]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

While telemedicine has been utilized more frequently over the past two decades, significant barriers to its broad implementation remained. The COVID-19 global pandemic served as a stimulus for the rapid expansion and implementation of telemedicine services across medical institutions worldwide to maximize patient care delivery, minimize exposure risk among healthcare providers and patients alike, and avoid overcrowding of patient care facilities.

In this experience report, we highlight the teledermatology initiatives executed by the Dermatology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, with particular emphasis on image ingestion and the potential for future automation and improvement.

### Algorithm based smartphone apps to assess risk of skin cancer in adults: Systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^111RDgUs]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

The study involved the assessment of validity and applicability of the evidence using QUADAS-2. Only four studies recruited a consecutive sample of study participants or lesions. The lesion selection process was often unclear, or convenience sampling was employed. One prospective study recruited patients from the general population attending a national skin cancer day event held at three university medical centers. Another recruited patients attending follow-up screenings, while seven recruited patients selected for excision of suspicious lesions or dermatological assessment.

Only two studies included skin lesions selected by study participants (up to two per participant), while two studies did not report their lesion selection process. In five studies, clinicians performed the lesion selection. Only two studies were rated as low risk of bias for patient selection. In eight of the nine studies, the selection of skin lesions for assessment did not reflect those that might be evaluated by users of the smartphone apps.

- **Overview of risk of bias and applicability concerns**: We observed high concerns (eight of nine) or unclear concerns (one of nine) regarding the application of the index test. In seven studies, researchers, rather than participants, used the app to photograph lesions. Two studies utilized previously acquired images of excised lesions from dermatology databases, raising concerns about the studies' representation of real-life use, where image quality might be lower.

### Teledermatology reduces dermatology referrals and improves access to specialists [^114vz6bT]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

SF-TD can be an effective tool for reducing referrals of common skin conditions among the general population to dermatologists. It can provide numerous benefits, such as optimizing in-person visits for patients with serious or complex skin conditions, and quickly and conveniently addressing common skin conditions with the primary care physician. This can save resources, working days, and patient transportation. Knowledge of the most common skin conditions and treatments encountered in primary care can inform public health policies for the prevention of diseases and help train physicians on how to address such cases.

### Accuracy of periocular lesion assessment using telemedicine [^116tLWMU]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). Low credibility.

Although the evaluation of eyelid lesions is akin to that of skin lesions, the inherent two-dimensional character of photographic evaluation poses particular challenges for eyelid lesions. The multilamellar anatomical construction of the eyelids means that the lesions can originate from or extend to deeper anatomical structures such as the tarsus or conjunctiva and may not be demonstrated well on photographs. Furthermore, eyelid lesions are likely to be smaller than those found on other parts of the body and may require more specialized lenses for adequate image resolution. A dynamic examination of eyelid lesions provides additional information as it is possible to ascertain, for example, if the lesion is tethered to the underlying structure, which is likely to narrow down the differential diagnoses.

Our study is one of the few that examined the utility of asynchronous telemedicine in oculoplastics. The proforma used in this study has been specifically designed to collect pertinent information to risk stratify the eyelid lesions by incorporating non-genetic risk factors such as age, history of previous skin malignancies, and drug history.

- **Study limitations**: Our study has several limitations. A small number of patients at a single center with a limited range of diagnoses was enrolled and suspected malignant cases were excluded, thus limiting generalizability of the study. Six cases were excluded as clinical photographs were not captured. The face-to-face evaluation was performed by a nurse while the remote review was conducted by a doctor. The discrepancy between face-to-face consultations and remote reviews presented challenges in evaluation consistency.

### An evaluation of the role of a store-and-forward teledermatology system in skin cancer diagnosis and management [^111dk5uh]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

There is currently much interest in the potential role of telemedicine in improving the delivery of dermatological care in the UK. The two teledermatology systems available at present are divided into live video and store-and-forward technology. We investigated the value of a store-and-forward teledermatology system in the diagnosis and management of lesions suspicious of skin cancer. A total of 163 store-and-forward referrals of patients with one lesion each were assessed independently by a consultant and a third-year trainee dermatologist. The accuracy of diagnosis and appropriateness of management from these assessments was compared to a subsequent face-to-face consultation with the consultant.

Analysis of the consultants' diagnoses showed that 48% were identical for teledermatology and conventional face-to-face consultations. A further 17% of teledermatology diagnoses included the actual clinical diagnosis as a possibility, but 20% were either incorrect or a diagnosis could not be made. In the remaining 15% of cases, the digital image was of insufficient quality for assessment. Of the trainee's reports, 44% were identical to the clinical diagnoses and another 20% included the clinical diagnosis as a possibility. The management plan was appropriate in 55% of the total teledermatology referrals assessed by the consultants and in 52% assessed by the trainee when compared with the conventional consultation.

This study illustrates that the store-and-forward type telemedicine system has limited diagnostic accuracy for skin lesions. However, our results suggest that store-and-forward teledermatology could still play a role in certain dermatological evaluations and management strategies.

### Algorithm based smartphone apps to assess risk of skin cancer in adults: Systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies [^1142KEWN]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

- **Study selection**: The search identified 418 unique records, of which 64 were selected for full-text assessment. Additionally, 16 studies were identified for the original review (refer to online supplementary figure 1 for the complete PRISMA flow diagram). We contacted corresponding authors for further information on three studies. Responses were received from two authors, with one providing additional relevant information. More than a third of studies (30 out of 80, 37.5%) were excluded based on the index test. Reasons for exclusion included the following:
	- Studies did not evaluate smartphones or smartphone apps (n = 18).
	- Studies were development studies without independent validation (n = 6).
	- Studies used magnifying attachments to the phone camera (n = 3).
	- Studies operated on a store-and-forward teledermatology basis (n = 2).
	- Studies were used for lesion monitoring (n = 1).

	- Two studies duplicated data included in other studies. Supplementary figure and online supplementary appendix 2 document other reasons for exclusion.

- **Characteristics of included studies**: Nine studies (9 out of 80, 11.3%) met eligibility criteria. Six studies, including 725 skin lesions, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of smartphone apps for risk stratification of suspicious skin lesions by comparing app risk gradings with a histopathological reference standard diagnosis. Some incorporated clinical expert face-to-face diagnosis for certain lesions. Five of the six studies aimed to detect melanoma only, while one aimed to differentiate between malignant (including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) or premalignant lesions and benign lesions.

### Accuracy of periocular lesion assessment using telemedicine [^111VWLM6]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). Low credibility.

We investigated the use of asynchronous telemedicine to remotely diagnose and formulate management plans for eyelid lesions. To enhance the diagnostic accuracy of this approach, templates for structured and pertinent data collection, including patient history and photographs of eyelid lesions, were designed and used. A clinician, in the absence of the patient, reviewed the data and photographs. The agreement between the diagnosis and management plan reached by the clinician reviewing the data remotely and those devised by the clinician reviewing patients in face-to-face clinics was assessed.

### Teledermatology: Key factors associated with reducing face-to-face dermatology visits [^1171g8vr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Teledermatology promises better, cheaper, and faster dermatologic care. It is considered "better" because, although it cannot offer as much to the patient as a traditional visit, it extends the dermatologist's reach to places and in ways not previously possible due to time and place limitations. It is deemed "cheaper and faster" because it has the potential to reduce costs and increase efficiency for both patients and providers. For teledermatology to fulfill these promises, it must enable dermatologists to improve access by increasing the number of patients evaluated and treated. Increased patient access depends on maximizing a scarce resource — dermatologists' time — in part by avoiding unnecessary and time-consuming face-to-face appointments.

We examined the literature at the time of writing to determine which teledermatology programs have greater or lesser success in reducing face-to-face visits. Our review highlights four factors that are associated with a higher number of face-to-face appointments avoided by teledermatology programs:

- **Effective preselection of patients for teleconsultation**: Allows for a more targeted approach to patient evaluation.
- **High-quality photographic images**: Essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
- **Dermoscopy if pigmented lesions are evaluated**: Enhances diagnostic accuracy.
- **Effective infrastructure and culture in place to implement teleconsultation recommendations**: Ensures the successful integration and utilization of teledermatology services.

In conclusion, teledermatology holds significant potential for reducing face-to-face visits, contingent on the successful implementation of these key factors.

### Teledermatology reduces dermatology referrals and improves access to specialists [^113Auttc]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Next, we assessed the 10 most common diseases presented by our subjects according to sex (Fig. 2 A) and whether they were referred to biopsy, an in-person dermatologist, or back to the general physician (Fig. 2 B).

- **Fig. 2**: The 10 most common skin conditions presented by the patients who participated in the teletriage project, categorized according to sex (A) and referrals (B), from July 2017 to July 2018 in the city of São Paulo.

There were substantial differences in the most common disorders between the two sexes. The women commonly presented melanocytic nevus (p < 0.0001), seborrheic keratosis (p = .0024), melasma (p < 0.0001), onychomycosis (p < 0.0001), acrochordon/other benign neoplasia (p < 0.0001), and solar lentigo (p < 0.0001). The male subjects primarily presented acne (p < 0.0001), atopic dermatitis (p < 0.0001), and epidermoid cysts (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in sex for the patients with xerosis (p = .899).

Four of the 10 most frequent lesions — melanocytic nevus, seborrheic keratosis, acrochordon, and cysts — belonged to the benign tumor group. One was an inflammatory process (acne), one was a fungal infection (onychomycosis), two were pigmentary disorders (melasma and solar lentigo), and two were in the eczema spectrum (atopic dermatitis and xerosis). They accounted for 24,238 lesions, corresponding to 44% of the total. Seventy-nine percent of those patients were sent back to their general physicians with recommendations and/or treatment plans, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Only 1% was referred for biopsy, mostly for melanocytic nevi, and the remaining 20% were sent to dermatologists for in-person evaluations.

### Comparison of humans versus mobile phone-powered artificial intelligence for the diagnosis and management of pigmented skin cancer in secondary care: a multicentre, prospective, diagnostic, clinical trial [^113cbqZb]. The Lancet Digital Health (2023). High credibility.

The diagnosis of skin cancer requires medical expertise, which is scarce. Mobile phone-powered artificial intelligence (AI) could aid in diagnosis, but it is unclear how this technology performs in a clinical scenario. Our primary aim was to test in the clinic whether there was equivalence between AI algorithms and clinicians for the diagnosis and management of pigmented skin lesions.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, prospective, diagnostic, clinical trial, we included specialist and novice clinicians and patients from two tertiary referral centres in Australia and Austria. Specialists had a specialist medical qualification related to diagnosing and managing pigmented skin lesions, whereas novices were dermatology junior doctors or registrars in trainee positions who had experience in examining and managing these lesions. Eligible patients were aged 18–99 years and had a modified Fitzpatrick I-III skin type; those in the diagnostic trial were undergoing routine excision or biopsy of one or more suspicious pigmented skin lesions bigger than 3 mm in the longest diameter, and those in the management trial had baseline total-body photographs taken within 1–4 years. We used two mobile phone-powered AI instruments incorporating a simple optical attachment: a new 7-class AI algorithm and the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) AI algorithm, which was previously tested in a large online reader study. The reference standard for excised lesions in the diagnostic trial was histopathological examination; in the management trial, the reference standard was a descending hierarchy from histopathological diagnosis (if available) to clinicopathological correlation and consensus among specialist clinicians.

### Accuracy of periocular lesion assessment using telemedicine [^111N2FzK]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). High credibility.

There was an overall 91% agreement (40 out of 44 cases) between the diagnoses made by the nurse specialist and the remote reviewer. The kappa coefficient for diagnostic agreement between face-to-face and remote review was 0.88 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99).

Three out of the four cases with disagreements in diagnosis resulted in different management plans. In one case, the nurse specialist diagnosed the lesion as a benign cyst and discharged the patient; however, the remote reviewer suspected a basal cell carcinoma due to the presence of central ulceration and listed the patient for a biopsy. The lesion subsequently resolved spontaneously without intervention, indicating it was of benign origin.

In two cases, the lesions (a chalazion and a lipoma, cases 3 and 9, respectively) were not well demonstrated in photographs because they were subcutaneous, the undulation caused by the lesions was subtle, and there were no overlying skin changes. The lesions in question were not the focal point in the photographs, possibly because the photographer was uncertain about the location of the concerning lesions.

### Ongoing development and evaluation of a method of telemedicine: Burn care management with a smartphone [^113Xi89L]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

In cases involving small burns in patients without a comorbidity or associated pathology, a referral from a surgeon is necessary and sometimes it cannot be ascertained when the patient is not brought in by a specialized team. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the quality of our method for performing telemedicine. This retrospective study included the 323 patients who were initially treated using the telemedicine system implemented between 2011 and 2016. This procedure only involved patients burned over a small portion of their body's surface area (i.e. ≤ 15%) who were between 15 and 75 years of age and who did not have a major comorbidity. The purpose of the procedure was to evaluate the need for surgery.

The initial diagnosis regarding the need for a surgical procedure was accurate in 94.4% (305/323) of the cases. Eleven patients (3.4%) were transferred unnecessarily as they ultimately did not require surgery, and seven patients (2.2%) were ultimately transferred even though the need for surgery was not initially established at the time that the pictures were viewed. No initial errors in the photographic evaluation caused a worsening in the life-threatening, functional, or aesthetic prognoses. We have recently opted to use telemedicine for initial patient management. In 94.4% of cases, the opinion that was provided was accurate. Only 3.2% of the patients for whom outpatient treatment was recommended ultimately underwent surgery without subsequently experiencing the slightest injury due to any delay in therapy.

### Views on mobile health apps for skin cancer screening in the general population: An in-depth qualitative exploration of perceived barriers and facilitators [^113m2bj2]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Preference for a human doctor instead of an algorithm**: The preference for visiting a GP or dermatologist for a suspicious skin lesion rather than using an app to perform a risk assessment was identified as a third barrier. While some participants stated that they would use an app for a skin cancer risk assessment, others appeared to prefer an assessment from a physical doctor. The assessment of a doctor was considered more believable than the assessment from an algorithm. Additionally, the possibility of communicating verbally and discussing the possibility of treatment was a reason to prefer a doctor consultation. Furthermore, participants explained that person-specific disease information related to prognosis (e.g. tumour staging) should only be communicated by doctors rather than an app. Lastly, participants mentioned that even if an app were integrated within healthcare systems, patients should always maintain the choice to visit a doctor instead of using an app compulsorily.

- **Privacy concerns**: Participants expressed concerns about the sharing of personal data with mHealth apps for skin cancer screening. While some participants considered an image of a skin lesion to be nonintrusive personal data, others saw this as a reason not to use an app. Participants reported preferably wanting to fill in as few personal details as possible. The fear of unsolicited data sharing by trackers and spyware was a reason to refrain from using mHealth. The need to create an account and fill out personal details, alongside requests for permission (e.g. to access GPS location) further contributed to privacy concerns.

### Successful triage of patients referred to a skin lesion clinic using teledermoscopy (IMAGE IT trial) [^112FAVXY]. The British journal of dermatology (2010). High credibility.

Teledermatology is a rapidly growing field, with studies showing high diagnostic accuracy when compared with face-to-face diagnosis. Teledermoscopy involves the use of epiluminescence microscopy to increase diagnostic accuracy. However, the utility of teledermoscopy as a triage tool has not yet been established.

- **Objectives**: To assess teledermoscopy as a triage tool for a hospital skin lesion clinic.

- **Methods**: Patients referred to a dermatology skin lesion clinic were recruited. Digital and dermoscopic photographs were taken of skin lesions of concern, and the patients were then seen independently, face-to-face, by two out of three dermatologists. The digital images were evaluated 4 weeks later, as a teledermoscopy consultation, by two of these dermatologists. The diagnosis and management from both types of consultation were compared.

- **Results**: Two hundred patients with a total of 491 lesions were seen. There was excellent agreement between teledermoscopy and face-to-face diagnosis, with only 12.3% of lesions having disparate diagnoses of clinical significance. Twelve of 491 (2.4%) lesions appeared to have been under-reported by teledermoscopy when compared with face-to-face diagnosis. However, when histopathology became available, only one malignant lesion had been missed (a basal cell carcinoma diagnosed as solar keratosis) by teledermoscopy. Teledermoscopy approximated 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Importantly, 74% of all lesions were determined to be manageable by the general practitioner without needing to be seen.
