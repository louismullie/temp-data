## Question

Vanc trough for osteomyelitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what vancomycin trough target should be used for osteomyelitis and how newer AUC-based guidance affects that target. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pathogens that make vancomycin necessary in osteomyelitis. Then, I should verify the historical IDSA trough recommendations and the pharmacodynamic rationale that led to 15–20 mg/L. Next, I will review the safety signals and evidence that undermined trough-only monitoring. After that, I need to confirm the 2020 consensus shift to AUC-guided dosing and its practical implications for osteomyelitis. Finally, I will synthesize adult and pediatric targets, special populations, adjunctive measures, and concrete monitoring steps with caveats about MIC and nephrotoxicity risk [^111CrD7v] [^111w7k4H] [^112QWv3D].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: osteomyelitis is a deep-seated bone infection where MRSA is a key pathogen for which vancomycin is often chosen in both vertebral and nonvertebral disease, making this a "serious" infection in guideline frameworks, so the exposure target discussion for serious MRSA infections squarely applies here [^111CrD7v] [^111w7k4H] [^112QWv3D].

> Next, I should review the historical standard of care; wait, let me verify the exact numbers from IDSA 2011 before I proceed too fast: for adult MRSA osteomyelitis, the guidance targeted vancomycin troughs of 15–20 mg/L, and notably, those same trough goals were extended to pediatrics with acute hematogenous MRSA osteomyelitis, reflecting the then-prevailing practice of using trough as a surrogate for AUC/MIC ≥ 400 [^111CrD7v] [^111w7k4H] [^115pnhc4] [^1152Kb4n].

> I need to check the pharmacodynamic basis now; vancomycin is time-dependent with efficacy linked to 24-hour AUC/MIC, and the contemporary consensus places the effective and safe AUC/MIC window at 400–600 mg·h/L assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L, which explains why 15–20 mg/L troughs were historically used as a practical surrogate when direct AUC estimation was not routine [^112QWv3D] [^114ZGFNy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using troughs alone; I should confirm the safety signal that prompted reevaluation: higher troughs, especially ≥ 15 mg/L, are independently associated with nephrotoxicity, and trough-only strategies often overshoot AUC > 600 mg·h/L without clear added efficacy, while meta-analytic data show no consistent mortality benefit to higher troughs across MRSA infections but do show increased nephrotoxicity, and in children the same AUC targets are often achieved at lower troughs, underscoring poor correlation between trough and AUC [^1113szqG] [^114b2RdS] [^113ujL2t] [^112zxvAT] [^116BXYWr].

> Let me verify the modern consensus; the 2020 joint ASHP/IDSA/PIDS/SIDP guideline explicitly shifts to AUC-guided dosing and monitoring for serious MRSA infections with a target AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L (MIC by broth microdilution assumed 1 mg/L) and de-emphasizes trough monitoring due to increased nephrotoxicity and poor precision, which should be applied to osteomyelitis as a serious infection phenotype [^112QWv3D] [^114b2RdS].

> Now, synthesizing this for adults with MRSA osteomyelitis, I should confirm the practical recommendation: preferred is AUC-guided monitoring to 400–600 mg·h/L; if only troughs are feasible, the legacy 15–20 mg/L target from 2011 remains the historical reference but requires vigilant AKI surveillance given the exposure–toxicity relationship; and I need to remember that if the isolate MIC is > 1 mg/L, achieving pharmacodynamic targets becomes tenuous and alternatives should be considered rather than forcing vancomycin to toxic exposure levels [^111CrD7v] [^111w7k4H] [^112QWv3D] [^114aECFP].

> For pediatrics, let me think this through and be precise: the 2011 guidance echoed 15–20 mg/L troughs for acute hematogenous MRSA osteomyelitis, but emerging pediatric PK/PD data indicate target AUCs can be reached with lower troughs (often 10–15 mg/L, sometimes even 7–15 mg/L), and typical starting daily doses are 60–80 mg/kg/day in divided doses, which should be refined by AUC-guided monitoring to balance efficacy and AKI risk; so while the older trough targets exist, a modern, safer approach is AUC-guided dosing in children as well [^115pnhc4] [^1152Kb4n] [^1118k2Ef] [^112zxvAT] [^116BXYWr] [^112QWv3D].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also address adjunctive therapy and source control because they materially influence outcomes; IDSA recommendations support adding rifampin to the vancomycin backbone after clearance of bacteremia in appropriate MRSA osteomyelitis scenarios, and surgical debridement remains a cornerstone for cure with antibiotic duration commonly at least 4–6 weeks, recognizing that longer courses may be needed in vertebral or chronic infection without debridement [^111MGoEg] [^116NjBW6] [^1162ciGc] [^1152Kb4n].

> I will now examine special populations and operational pitfalls; burn patients often have augmented clearance requiring higher or more frequent dosing with careful monitoring, hemodialysis patients require tailored protocols with predialysis levels often targeted at 15–20 mg/L when trough-based strategies are used, and I need to ensure troughs are drawn correctly at true steady-state just before the dose because early draws can artifactually elevate values and lead to inappropriate dose reductions that underexpose patients [^111RsPiE] [^113MFBBr] [^116cRbsd] [^112DRAJk].

> Let me reconsider and provide a concise, practical wrap-up with safety guardrails: for osteomyelitis due to MRSA, target an AUC/MIC of 400–600 mg·h/L via Bayesian AUC-guided monitoring when available; if constrained to troughs, adults can use 15–20 mg/L with close renal monitoring and attention to total daily AUC, while pediatrics often achieve target AUCs at 10–15 mg/L with less nephrotoxicity risk and should preferentially use AUC-guided methods; monitor serum creatinine at baseline and at least every 2–3 days early in therapy, obtain initial TDM at 48–72 hours, treat for a minimum of 4–6 weeks individualized to clinical and surgical factors, and if MIC is > 1 mg/L or AUC targets require excessive exposure, move to alternatives like daptomycin rather than forcing vancomycin above safe exposure thresholds [^112QWv3D] [^1162ciGc] [^114ji8fF] [^1166JvUm] [^114aECFP].

---

For osteomyelitis, vancomycin trough levels should be **15–20 mg/L** [^111CrD7v] to ensure adequate bone penetration and clinical efficacy [^111w7k4H]. Troughs should be measured just before the fourth dose at steady state [^116hsMEx], with earlier checks if renal function changes or dosing is adjusted. Maintain troughs ≥ 15 mg/L to reduce treatment failure [^113ujL2t], but **avoid > 20 mg/L** to limit nephrotoxicity risk [^1113szqG] [^11418UTz]. Adjust dosing based on troughs, renal function, and patient factors; consider alternatives (e.g. daptomycin, linezolid) [^114ji8fF] if targets are not achieved [^114aECFP] or toxicity occurs [^114tM1xZ].

## Recommended vancomycin trough levels for osteomyelitis

Adult patients should maintain vancomycin trough concentrations of **15–20 mg/L** [^111CrD7v] to ensure adequate bone penetration and clinical efficacy [^111w7k4H]. Pediatric patients with acute hematogenous MRSA osteomyelitis target the same troughs (**15–20 mg/L**) [^115RYb4t] [^115pnhc4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended trough levels

Efficacy improves when vancomycin trough levels are **≥ 15 mg/L** and is associated with reduced treatment failure and better clinical outcomes in serious MRSA infections [^113ujL2t], including osteomyelitis. The risk of **nephrotoxicity** increases at elevated trough levels (≥ 15 mg/L), especially with prolonged therapy or concomitant nephrotoxins [^1113szqG] [^112QWv3D].

---

## Timing and frequency of trough level monitoring

Initial monitoring involves obtaining the first trough level **just before the fourth dose** at steady state, typically 30 minutes before the next dose [^112DRAJk] [^116hsMEx]. Subsequent monitoring should be performed **every 3–5 days**, or sooner if renal function or clinical status changes or if dosing is adjusted.

---

## Factors influencing vancomycin trough levels

Several **patient-specific factors** influence vancomycin trough levels and dose adjustments:

| **Factor** | **Impact on vancomycin trough levels** |
|-|-|
| Renal function | - Impaired renal function increases vancomycin levels <br/> - Dose adjustments are necessary [^1113szqG] |
| Age | Older patients may have higher trough levels due to reduced clearance [^1147C16e] |
| Body weight | Obesity or low body weight affects vancomycin distribution and clearance [^114ZGFNy] |
| Concomitant medications | Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides) increase nephrotoxicity risk [^1113szqG] |
| Infection severity | Severe infections may require higher doses to achieve therapeutic levels [^114ZGFNy] |

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic trough levels

Subtherapeutic levels (** < 15 mg/L**) are associated with increased treatment failure, persistent infection [^113ujL2t], and longer bacteremia duration, whereas **supratherapeutic levels (> 20 mg/L)** are linked to an increased risk of nephrotoxicity [^1113szqG], prolonged hospitalization, and higher healthcare costs.

---

## Alternative antibiotics for osteomyelitis

If vancomycin trough levels cannot be maintained within the therapeutic range or toxicity occurs, consider **alternative antibiotics**:

- **Daptomycin**: 6 mg/kg IV once daily [^114ji8fF] [^1166JvUm].

- **Linezolid**: 600 mg IV/PO every 12 hours [^114tM1xZ] [^116jThyQ].

- **Clindamycin**: 600 mg IV every 8 hours.

- **Rifampin**: 600 mg daily or 300–450 mg PO BID (in combination therapy) [^111MGoEg] [^116NjBW6].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

IDSA guidelines recommend vancomycin trough levels of **15–20 mg/L** [^111CrD7v] for osteomyelitis, with careful monitoring to balance efficacy and nephrotoxicity risk [^111w7k4H]. AUC-guided dosing with **AUC/MIC targets of 400–600 mg·h/L** [^112QWv3D] is suggested in recent guidelines to optimize efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity, though trough monitoring remains practical in many settings [^114b2RdS].

---

Vancomycin trough levels of **15–20 mg/L** are recommended for osteomyelitis to ensure efficacy and minimize nephrotoxicity. Monitoring and dose adjustments should consider renal function, age, weight, and concomitant medications. Alternative antibiotics should be considered if therapeutic levels cannot be maintained or toxicity occurs.

### Increasing vancomycin serum trough concentrations and incidence of nephrotoxicity [^1113szqG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conflicting evidence regarding the association of vancomycin serum concentrations with efficacy and toxicity has resulted in controversy regarding optimal target concentrations. Recent publications recommend attaining higher vancomycin trough concentrations of 15 to 20 mg/L for target infections; however, limited research is available assessing the correlation of vancomycin serum concentrations with toxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between vancomycin serum trough concentrations and nephrotoxicity.

- **Methods**: A 2-phase retrospective analysis was completed. Phase 1 evaluated 2,493 courses of vancomycin completed between January 2003 and December 2007. The analysis describes a 5-year trend in vancomycin prescribing practices and assesses the association of nephrotoxicity with baseline serum creatinine, vancomycin serum trough concentrations, and duration of vancomycin therapy. Phase 2 examined patients receiving vancomycin therapy during 2007 to evaluate specific risk factors for the development of nephrotoxicity.

- **Results**: The proportion of vancomycin serum trough concentrations ≥ 15 mg/L and ≥ 20 mg/L increased significantly over time. Statistical analysis identified vancomycin serum trough concentrations ≥ 14 mg/L, duration of vancomycin therapy ≥ 7 days, and baseline serum creatinine levels ≥ 1.7 mg/dL as independent predictors of nephrotoxicity. Phase 2 analysis again implicated mean vancomycin serum trough concentration as a significant predictor of nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity resolved in 81% (17/21) of cases evaluated.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the importance of monitoring vancomycin serum trough concentrations and other factors to mitigate the risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Association of vancomycin serum concentrations with efficacy in patients with MRSA infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ujL2t]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). High credibility.

Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections recommend maintaining vancomycin trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L for serious infections. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies assessing the impact of low (< 15 mg/L) vs. high (≥ 15 mg/L) vancomycin trough levels on the efficacy of MRSA infection treatment.

Four prospective and twelve retrospective studies were included, encompassing a total of 2,003 participants. No significant difference was demonstrated between low and high vancomycin trough levels for the outcome of all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–1.46, I² = 28%). However, in studies evaluating mainly MRSA pneumonia, there was significantly higher mortality with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.11–2.84).

No significant difference was demonstrated in treatment failure rates (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.88–1.78, I² = 51%). Nonetheless, excluding one outlier study from the analysis, treatment failure rates became significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin trough levels (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12–1.91, I² = 16%). Microbiologic failure rates were significantly higher in patients with low vancomycin levels (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.08–2.26, I² = 0%).

Nephrotoxicity incidence was significantly higher with vancomycin levels of ≥ 15 mg/L; however, no cases of irreversible renal damage were reported. Data on the effectiveness of higher vancomycin trough levels in the treatment of MRSA infections are limited to a few prospective and mainly retrospective studies.

### The nephrotoxicity of vancomycin [^112bXgq3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is the drug of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) but has been associated with significant nephrotoxicity. It remains uncertain, however, to what extent vancomycin is directly responsible. Herein, we critically examine relevant available data in adult patients. We review the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of vancomycin metabolism and discuss efficacy and safety data. The pathophysiology of vancomycin nephrotoxicity is considered. Risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) development are enumerated, and suggestions for practice and further research are given.

Vancomycin has been plagued with concerns about nephrotoxicity since its approval in 1958. Initial preparations were termed "Mississippi mud" and had significant impurities considered the major reason for the nephrotoxicity. Through improved purification procedures, preparations now contain approximately 90–95% vancomycin B (the active moiety). The rate of nephrotoxicity with the use of modern preparations varies in the literature, with the incidence ranging from as low as 0% in the absence of concomitant nephrotoxins to over 40%. Unfortunately, the majority of studies assessing nephrotoxicity are retrospective, often lacking a control group, and are typically subject to confounding by indication and other biases, as many of the patients are critically ill and have other potential reasons for kidney injury.

Numerous potential risk factors for the development of AKI while receiving parenteral vancomycin therapy have been ascertained. Some factors are directly related to vancomycin exposure.

### Can oritavancin be used for treatment and/or suppressive antimicrobial therapy of bone and joint infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium [^116yDFTX]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections pose substantial challenges for the treatment and suppression of bone and joint infections. Oritavancin, a long-acting lipoglycopeptide antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against VRE. Limited data are available on using oritavancin for bone and joint infections caused by VRE, both for treatment (therapy to eliminate active infection) and suppressive antimicrobial therapy (long-term antibiotic administration to prevent infection recurrence in patients at high risk for that complication).

- **Questions/purposes**: (1) What proportion of patients in a small case series achieve freedom from infectious symptoms with use of oritavancin for treatment of VRE bone and joint infections? (2) What proportion of patients achieve freedom from infection recurrence with use of oritavancin when used for suppressive antimicrobial therapy of VRE bone and joint infections? (3) What proportion of patients develop adverse drug events associated with oritavancin use in VRE bone and joint infections?

- **Methods**: We describe a retrospective, multicenter, observational case series of patients who received oritavancin for treatment and/or suppressive antimicrobial therapy of VRE bone and joint infection, including osteomyelitis, native septic arthritis, myositis, and prosthetic joint infection, between December 2014 and April 2024. The minimum surveillance period was 1 year, unless infection recurrence or an adverse drug event was documented before 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a life expectancy of less than 7 days.

- **Linezolid**: 600 mg BID
- **Clindamycin**: 600 mg TID

### Vancomycin: We can't get there from here [^114aECFP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011).

We sought to characterize the pharmacodynamic profile of the more intensive vancomycin dosing regimens currently used in response to the recent vancomycin guidelines.

- **Methods**: A series of Monte Carlo simulations was performed for vancomycin regimens ranging from 0.5 g intravenous (IV) Q12H to 2 g IV Q12H. The probability of achieving an AUC/MIC ratio ≥ 400 for each dosing regimen was calculated for minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from 0.5 to 2 mg/L. The risk of nephrotoxicity for each regimen was derived from a previously published vancomycin trough-nephrotoxicity logistic regression function. Restricted analyses were performed that only included subjects with troughs between 15 and 20 mg/L.

- **Results**: At a MIC of 2 mg/L, even the most aggressive dosing regimen considered (2 g every 12 h) only yielded a probability of target attainment (PTA) of 57% while generating a nephrotoxicity probability upward of 35%. At a MIC of 1 mg/L, ≥ 3 g per day provided PTA in excess of 80% but were associated with unacceptable risks of nephrotoxicity. In the restricted analyses of subjects with troughs between 15 and 20 mg/L, all regimens produced a PTA of 100% at MICs ≤ 1 mg/L. The PTA was variable among the regimens at a MIC of 2 mg/L and was highly dependent on the total daily dose administered.

- **Conclusions**: This study indicates that vancomycin may not be useful for treating serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections with MIC values > 1 mg/L where PTA is questionable. Since an AUC/MIC ratio ≥ 400 is a target associated with efficacy, one should consider alternative treatments when these targets are not achievable.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: Do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^1162rFdd]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Trough concentrations of vancomycin required for an AUC of 400 in neonates are lower than those reported for adults. Based on the actual MIC distribution of neonatal invasive CoNS strains, a vancomycin dosing AUC/MIC of 400 is achieved in less than half of neonates. Vancomycin doses required for an 80% probability of this target attainment are associated with potentially toxic trough levels. With vancomycin dosing, treatment failure occurs in about a quarter of cases.

### Prediction of vancomycin area under the curve with trough concentrations only: Performance evaluation of pediatric population pharmacokinetic models [^114614Ui]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

- **Figures 3 and 4**: Model vancomycin AUC 24h based on trough concentration vs. true AUC 24h for cohort A (postnatal age < 50 days) and cohort B (postnatal age ≥ 50 days). Plots present the 13 evaluated population pharmacokinetic models. Green dots in the gray shaded area illustrate individual AUC 24h values that show alignment in dosage advice based on the model AUC 24h and true AUC 24h. Red dots illustrate patients requiring a dosage change based on the model AUC 24h or true AUC 24h. For example, a green dot in the left-most gray window indicates a dosage increase by the model AUC 24h and the true AUC 24h (< 400 mg·h/L). AUC 24h refers to the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve.

- **Evaluation of predicted area under the curve**: For each model, the AUC 24h was predicted a priori with covariates solely and estimated by available vancomycin concentrations per Bayesian analysis. Supplementary Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the AUC 24h across all scenarios (peak and/or trough, a priori).

### Effect of vancomycin therapy for osteomyelitis on colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: Lack of emergence of glycopeptide resistance [^111URgJ9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

The long-term impact of vancomycin therapy on colonization by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus in treating orthopedic infections is unknown.

- **Design**: Prospective surveillance of the effect of long-term vancomycin therapy on colonization by MRSA and the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus.

- **Methods**: Thirty-four patients with microbiologically documented MRSA osteomyelitis were longitudinally observed for the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus at three body sites: wound, anterior nares, and groin. This was done during the initial period of vancomycin therapy and at a 2-month follow-up. Twenty patients received the standard dose (20 mg/kg/d) for 34 ± 6 days, and fourteen patients received a high dose (40 mg/kg/d) of vancomycin for 37 ± 9 days.

- **Results**: During vancomycin treatment, global MRSA carriage (all body sites) decreased from 100% to 25% in patients receiving the standard dose of vancomycin, and from 100% to 40% in those receiving the high dose. During the 2-month follow-up period after vancomycin therapy, global MRSA carriage increased from 25% to 55% in the group receiving the standard dose and decreased from 43% to 36% in the group receiving the high dose.

- **Conclusion**: Therapy with a high dose of vancomycin contributes to the sustained eradication of MRSA carriage without promoting the emergence of glycopeptide resistance.

### Initial vancomycin dosing protocol to achieve therapeutic serum concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis [^113MFBBr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Although recent consensus guidelines proposed more aggressive vancomycin troughs of > 10 or 15–20 mg/L for complicated Staphylococcus aureus infections, dosing information to achieve these targets in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) is scarce.

- **Methods**: We used Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) methods with a previously published population-pharmacokinetic model and relevant patient demographics to evaluate and revise our existing vancomycin dosing protocol (1,000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose, with doses infused during the last hour of dialysis). A new protocol (1,000-mg load followed by 500-mg maintenance dose for patients 100 kg) was developed and prospectively validated to achieve therapeutic serum troughs in patients undergoing high-flux HD.

- **Results**: MCSs predicted that our existing protocol would be suboptimal in more than one-third of patients. Simulations predicted that the new vancomycin dosing protocol would achieve maintenance (pre-HD) troughs of 10–20 mg/L in 86.0% of cases, including 15–20 mg/L in 35.2%. In prospective validation, the observed postload trough (pre-HD session 2) was 13.5 ± 3.4 mg/L, with 76.9% of levels (20 of 26) between 10 and 20 mg/L. The observed maintenance trough was 17.3 ± 4.0 mg/L, with 65.5% (19 of 29) between 10 and 20 mg/L and 89.7% (26 of 29) within 10% of the upper limit (i.e. 10–22 mg/L).

- **Conclusions**: In this study, a practical vancomycin dosing protocol for patients undergoing HD was developed and prospectively validated.

### A multicenter, retrospective outcome analysis of vancomycin area under the curve versus trough-based dosing strategies in patients with burn or inhalational injuries (MONITOR) [^112no4gV]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2024). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that requires close therapeutic monitoring. Prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations increases the risk of serious adverse effects, such as nephrotoxicity, whereas subtherapeutic concentrations may lead to bacterial resistance and clinical failure or death. The most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America publication regarding therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin recommends using area under the curve (AUC)-based monitoring to maximize clinical success. Despite this guideline recommendation, many institutions still use trough-only monitoring, including those treating patients with acute burn injuries.

Following a burn injury, patients are at a higher risk for infections, multiorgan failure, and pharmacokinetic alterations. The primary objective of this multicenter retrospective study is to determine optimal therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin by comparing clinical success between AUC and trough-based monitoring in patients with burns. MONITOR was a multicenter, retrospective study of patients with thermal or inhalation injuries admitted to one of 13 burn centers from January 1, 2017, to August 31, 2022, who received vancomycin. Demographic and clinical course data, including acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence and clinical success, were obtained. Patients were evaluated for clinical success and grouped according to the method of monitoring and adjusting doses: AUC vs. trough-based monitoring.

Clinical success was defined as a composite definition and lack of meeting any one of the five criteria: (1) persistent infection.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^115DkTY8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters reveal important insights into its use for pediatric MRSA bacteremia. The initial vancomycin dose and initial concentration (C) trough, as well as AUC 0–24 and AUC 24–48, are detailed extensively. The median time for measuring the initial C trough was 30.8 hours (IQR: 19.8–50.3) after vancomycin initiation. Among MRSA isolates, 76.8% had a vancomycin MIC of ≤ 1.0 mg/L, with 42 isolates (75%) showing an MIC of 1.0 mg/L and 1 isolate (1.8%) showing an MIC of 0.5 mg/L. Conversely, 13 isolates (23.2%) exhibited an MIC of 2.0 mg/L. There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.646; P < 0.01) between the average C trough within the first 72 hours and AUC 24–48.

- **Significance of vancomycin AUC 24–48 of 400 mg·h/L**:
	- Patients with an AUC 24–48 ≥ 400 mg·h/L displayed similar demographic and clinical characteristics to those with an AUC 24–48 < 400 mg·h/L, except for having a higher median age (2.8 vs. 1.0 year, P < 0.01). Primary outcomes, such as clinical failure and persistent bacteremia, did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred exclusively in patients with an AUC 24–48 ≥ 400 mg·h/L. Among patients experiencing AKI, AUC 24–48 values were markedly higher (572.1 mg·h/L for AKI vs. 374.1 mg·h/L for non-AKI, P = 0.01), despite these patients receiving slightly lower initial vancomycin doses (30.6 vs. 42.6 mg/kg/day, P = 0.06).

### Vancomycin area under the curve-guided dosing and monitoring for adult and pediatric patients with suspected or documented serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: Putting the safety of our patients first [^114b2RdS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The revised vancomycin consensus guidelines recommended area under the curve (AUC)-guided dosing and monitoring for patients with serious invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections as a measure to minimize vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) while maintaining similar effectiveness. Data indicate that the intensity of vancomycin exposure drives VA-AKI risk. Troughs of 15–20 mg/L will ensure an AUC ≥ 400 mg × hr/L, but most patients will have daily AUCs > 600. VA-AKI increases as a function of AUC, especially when > 600. In addition to minimizing VA-AKI risk while maintaining similar efficacy, AUC-guided dosing and monitoring is a more precise way to conduct therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin relative to trough-only control.

### Systemic antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis in adults [^1162ciGc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The standard recommendation for treating chronic osteomyelitis is six weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy. However, oral antibiotics are available that achieve adequate levels in bone, and there are now more published studies of oral than parenteral antibiotic therapy for patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Oral and parenteral therapies achieve similar cure rates; however, oral therapy avoids risks associated with intravenous catheters and is generally less expensive, making it a reasonable choice for osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms. The addition of adjunctive rifampin to other antibiotics may improve cure rates. The optimal duration of therapy for chronic osteomyelitis remains uncertain. There is no evidence that antibiotic therapy for more than four to six weeks improves outcomes compared with shorter regimens. In view of concerns about encouraging antibiotic resistance due to unnecessarily prolonged treatment, defining the optimal route and duration of antibiotic therapy and the role of surgical debridement in treating chronic osteomyelitis are important, unmet needs.

Regarding specific circumstances for nonvertebral osteomyelitis, more specifically with respect to patients with MRSA osteomyelitis, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the addition of rifampin 600 mg daily or 300–450 mg PO BID to the antibiotic chosen above. Rifampin should be added after the clearance of bacteremia in patients with concurrent bacteremia.

### Trough concentrations of vancomycin: Adult therapeutic targets are not appropriate for children [^113bwWTg]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Despite the need for effective vancomycin therapy, there are few data guiding vancomycin monitoring in children. We reviewed retrospectively vancomycin use in children aged 1 month to 12 years. Initial and adjusted target trough vancomycin concentrations in serum were infrequently achieved, regardless of the dosing schedule. Currently recommended trough concentrations need to be re-examined with a more detailed pharmacokinetic study in children.

The IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend a specific course of treatment for pediatric patients with acute hematogenous MRSA nonvertebral osteomyelitis. In these circumstances, vancomycin should be administered intravenously. It is essential to maintain vancomycin concentrations within the range of 15–20 mcg/mL.

### Limitations of vancomycin in the management of resistant staphylococcal infections [^116wLKhk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and has been widely used in the past few years. However, several recent reports have highlighted the limitations of vancomycin, and its role in the management of serious infections is now being reconsidered. Vancomycin treatment failure rates are associated with an increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration as well as a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing. The intrinsic limitations of vancomycin also include poor tissue penetration, particularly in the lung, relatively slow bacterial killing, and the potential for toxicity.

In addition, intermediate-level vancomycin resistance has emerged among staphylococci, as have rare cases of fully resistant strains. Because of these problems, when using vancomycin, it is probably prudent to carefully establish the diagnosis, test for antimicrobial susceptibility, and monitor serum trough concentrations to ensure adequate dosing.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^115rZ3cp]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Infections in intensive care units (ICU) are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. In the United States, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) account for 8% of all hospital-acquired infections, and MRSA infections are associated with an estimated 18,650 deaths annually. In the pediatric population, MRSA infections also contribute to significant morbidity and hospital expenses.

The appropriate treatment for severe infections caused by S. aureus is a significant challenge, as therapeutic failure can result in death. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is widely used for treating severe infections caused by Gram-positive microorganisms, particularly MRSA. It is currently considered the first choice for empirical therapy of these infections.

According to the consensus recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, maintaining an area under the curve (AUC)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 400 is a suitable target for achieving a successful outcome in the treatment of MRSA infections. This pharmacodynamic target is considered the best predictor of microbiological and clinical outcomes when treating MRSA infections. However, calculating the AUC is clinically impractical. Measuring the trough serum concentration shortly before the fourth dose, i.e. at steady state, with a value of 15–20 mg/L, correlates with an AUC/MIC > 400 in adult patients with MRSA MIC < 1 mcg/mL.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children [^112wgakb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). High credibility.

In the context of nonvertebral osteomyelitis, particularly concerning pediatric patients, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering the administration of clindamycin intravenously at 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (to achieve a daily dosage of 40 mg/kg) as empirical therapy. This is suggested for stable pediatric patients without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection, provided the clindamycin resistance rate remains low (< 10%). Transition to oral therapy is advised if the strain is susceptible.

### Optimizing vancomycin monitoring in pediatric patients [^116BXYWr]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported that trough levels may not be optimal for monitoring vancomycin therapy because of overexposure and nephrotoxicity risks. Therefore, we developed a population pharmacokinetic model to optimize vancomycin dosing and monitoring in pediatrics.

- **Methods**: Data were retrospectively collected on 76 pediatric patients aged 1–12 years, admitted to general pediatric wards or intensive care units at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The predictability of three methods for calculating the area under the curve (AUC) at steady state was assessed for optimum vancomycin therapy monitoring. These methods included simple linear regression, the Bayesian approach, and the 2-sample pharmacokinetic equation method. We also used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate vancomycin dosing.

- **Results**: A 1-compartment model adequately described the data. A strong correlation was observed between the observed and predicted AUC from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0–24h), calculated using the Bayesian approach with a trough sample only or pharmacokinetic equations based on two measured samples (R = 0.93 and 0.92, respectively). For the simple linear regression method with a trough sample only, the predicted AUC0–24h at steady state with vancomycin trough levels of 10, 15, and 20 µg/mL were 413, 548, and 714 µg·hour/mL, respectively. The target AUC0–24h above 400 was achieved in 46% and 95% of individuals with trough values of 7–11 and 11–15 µg/mL, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations showed that 60–80 mg/kg/d doses are needed to optimize vancomycin therapy.

- **Conclusions**: The results indicate that different approaches can optimize vancomycin dosing in pediatric patients to reduce risks related to overexposure and nephrotoxicity.

For specific circumstances involving vertebral osteomyelitis in patients with MRSA osteomyelitis, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering an additional 1–3 months (or possibly longer for chronic infection, or if debridement is not performed) of oral rifampin-based combination therapy. This can include TMP/SMX, doxycycline-minocycline, clindamycin, or a fluoroquinolone, chosen based on susceptibilities.

### Vancomycin [^114Bu9We]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections; they do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be informed that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### The association between vancomycin trough concentrations and acute kidney injury in the neonatal intensive care unit [^115GgVNk]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

There has been an ongoing debate about the dosage, frequency of administration, and the most appropriate monitoring of vancomycin therapy. Multiple factors influence the clearance of vancomycin, including gestational age, postnatal age, weight, renal tubular function, and creatinine levels. Historically, area-under-the-curve concentration versus time to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC:MIC) was accepted as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictor of adequate treatment with vancomycin. An AUC:MIC ratio greater than 400 has been recommended to achieve the desired antimicrobial effect in both adult and pediatric populations.

A consensus statement released by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists in 2009 recommended vancomycin as the first-choice drug for MRSA with MIC ≥ 400 if the MIC of MRSA is less than 1. However, with increasing MICs, higher trough concentrations are recommended. In serious clinical infections such as endocarditis, meningitis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis, trough concentrations between 15–20 are recommended. These higher troughs allow for greater vancomycin exposure, a higher AUC, and the ability to reach the goal AUC:MIC ≥ 400.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^117M3HJo]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Definitions are as follows: An immunocompromised state was defined as primary immune deficiency, a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 1 year, and the use of immunosuppressants or corticosteroid therapy. This includes prednisone or its equivalent at doses of ≥ 20 mg/day (≥ 2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing less than 10 kg) for at least 14 days within 30 days before MRSA bacteremia. Severe presentation at the onset of MRSA bacteremia was defined as cases requiring new ICU care for the management of sepsis, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or inotropic drug use within 24 hours before or after the onset of MRSA bacteremia.

Polymicrobial bloodstream infection (BSI) was defined as the detection of common commensal microorganisms in two or more consecutive blood cultures from separate blood draws or at least one pathogenic microorganism, in addition to MRSA, in a blood culture. The definitions of healthcare-associated infection, central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), specific primary site definitions of secondary bacteremia, and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) were based on respective references.

- **Uncertain focus**: This category included cases where the definition of CRBSI was not met within CLABSI, as well as instances where no identifiable focus was present.
- **Eradicable focus**: This category included CRBSI, peripheral catheter infection, surgically removable infections, and drainable abscesses. The term "eradicated focus" refers to the removal of an infected device or the completion of incision and drainage within three days.

### Optimizing initial vancomycin dosing in burn patients [^111RsPiE]. Burns (2011). Low credibility.

Burned patients exhibit altered vancomycin pharmacokinetics, necessitating adjusted dosing. Published initial dosing recommendations targeting trough concentrations of 15–20 mg/L for this population are insufficiently detailed. This study was conducted to develop initial vancomycin dosing recommendations based on the pharmacokinetics observed in acute burn patients.

A retrospective chart review of 49 patients treated with vancomycin was conducted. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters were determined, and Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to develop initial vancomycin dosing recommendations that strive to attain trough concentrations between 15 and 20 mg/L.

Vancomycin pharmacokinetic parameters were significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the time elapsed after the burn, whether it was less than or greater than 14 days. The Monte Carlo simulation indicated that the most commonly used empiric dosing regimen (1 g intravenous every 12 hours) achieved target concentration probabilities varying with time post-burn.

This study provides initial vancomycin dosing recommendations for burned patients from 48 hours to 14 days after burn, and for those more than 14 days post-burn. However, due to the heterogeneity in pharmacokinetics and the observation that vancomycin pharmacokinetics evolve over time post-burn, monitoring of vancomycin serum concentrations is mandated.

### Preoperative vancomycin administration for surgical site prophylaxis: Plasma and soft-tissue concentrations in pediatric neurosurgical and orthopedic patients [^115Uqann]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is used for antibiotic prophylaxis in pediatric surgical patients without a complete understanding of plasma and soft-tissue pharmacokinetics. Guidelines recommend incision within 60 minutes after administration; however, tissue vancomycin concentrations at that early time may not be therapeutic. We conducted a study of plasma and skin concentrations in pediatric neurosurgical and orthopedic patients to characterize intraoperative vancomycin pharmacokinetics.

- **Methods**: Patients (0.1–18.8 years of age) undergoing posterior spinal fusion (n = 30) or ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (n = 30) received intravenous vancomycin 15 mg/kg (maximum 1000 mg) over 1 hour. Skin was biopsied at incision and skin closure. Blood samples were collected at incision, at 2 and 4 hours intraoperatively, and at closure. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to characterize pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and to develop a model of intraoperative plasma and skin vancomycin concentrations versus time.

- **Results**: Pharmacokinetic analysis included data from 59 subjects, 130 plasma samples, and 107 skin samples. A 2-compartment model, volume of the central (Vc) and volume of the peripheral compartment (V2), proved to have the best fit. Stepwise covariate selection yielded a significant relationship for body surface area on elimination clearance and body weight on V2. Skin vancomycin concentrations rose continuously during surgery. Modeling predicted that equilibration of skin and plasma vancomycin concentrations took ≥ 5 hours.

- **Conclusions**: Skin vancomycin concentrations continued to rise throughout the surgery, indicating a need for further investigation into optimal dosing times to ensure therapeutic levels during the procedure.

### Ceftobiprole compared with vancomycin plus aztreonam in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections: Results of a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial (TARGET) [^115zPeYC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The safety findings of ceftobiprole in this study were consistent with its established safety profile, including that reported in previous studies in cSSTIs and pneumonia. The most common adverse effects were related to gastrointestinal disorders, and less than 2% of patients experienced adverse effects leading to treatment discontinuation, suggesting that ceftobiprole is well tolerated in the majority of patients.

When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America include several antibacterial options, such as vancomycin, linezolid, clindamycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, or telavancin, with specific recommendations varying depending on the severity of infection and type of ABSSSI. Since these guidelines were issued in 2014, additional agents have become available, including tedizolid, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and delafloxacin. With the exception of delafloxacin, these agents are all indicated in gram-positive infections only. Our study results, together with previous studies with ceftobiprole in this setting, suggest that ceftobiprole has the potential to be an effective broad-spectrum treatment option for ABSSSIs, with suitability for use in those with gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, or mixed gram-positive/gram-negative infections. Unlike with vancomycin, monitoring of serum trough concentrations is not required with ceftobiprole, which may help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

### Point: Vancomycin is not obsolete for the treatment of infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^116KZ9WC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Since the discovery, development, and US Food and Drug Administration approval of vancomycin in the 1950s, this agent has remained a mainstay for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, because of the development of new antistaphylococcal antibiotics and reports of vancomycin failures, the utility of vancomycin has recently been questioned. Although vancomycin did not undergo the strict US Food and Drug Administration approval process that is in place today to demonstrate efficacy, there is considerable information available that sheds light on the role vancomycin has in infectious diseases pharmacotherapy today.

In addition, although we look to in vitro susceptibility testing to assess vancomycin activity against S. aureus, we have come to appreciate that resistance of S. aureus to vancomycin can be a continuous — rather than a categorical — phenomenon. This has resulted in clinical microbiology laboratories having difficulty identifying S. aureus that may not respond to conventional doses of vancomycin. A better understanding is needed of the pharmacodynamic relationship between vancomycin and MRSA as it relates to optimal dosing strategies, including consideration for loading doses, and the development of rational categorical breakpoints for susceptibility based on clinical outcomes. By better understanding these critical issues, it may be possible to optimize the use of vancomycin, resulting in a cost-effective treatment option for many patients infected with MRSA.

### Serum vancomycin levels resulting from continuous or intermittent infusion in critically ill burn patients with or without continuous renal replacement therapy [^1169sKXg]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

We evaluated vancomycin levels as recent guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin recommend trough levels of 15 to 20 μg/mL; however, this may be more difficult to achieve in patients with accelerated vancomycin clearance, such as burn patients or recipients of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) therapy. We retrospectively studied 2110 serum vancomycin levels of 171 patients admitted to the burn intensive care unit for more than four years and who received vancomycin by continuous infusion (CI) or intermittent infusion (II), with or without simultaneous CVVH.

In-hospital mortality, 14- and 28-day mortality following vancomycin therapy were not different between dosing methods, although increased mortality was observed in the subgroup of patients receiving CI vancomycin empirically for clinical sepsis with negative blood cultures. More vancomycin was delivered to patients daily by CI than II, and therapeutic drug monitoring costs were similar.

After controlling for differences in vancomycin dose by case matching with propensity scores, mean vancomycin levels were 20.0 ± 3.8 μg/mL for CI vs. 14.8 ± 4.4 μg/mL for II (P < .001). CI dosing resulted in similar levels with or without CVVH, whereas in II dosing, CVVH appeared to significantly decrease vancomycin levels. Although CI dosing was associated with higher vancomycin levels in general and fewer levels of < 10 μg/mL, significant nephrotoxicity or neutropenia was not observed. Fifty-seven patients (33.3%) developed bacteremia, and 106 Gram-positive bacteri…

### Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity: Grave concern or death by character assassination [^113ramNE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity was reported in 0% to 5% of patients in the 1980s. Numerous clinical trials have confirmed this by comparing novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents with vancomycin at the Food and Drug Administration-approved dosage of 1 g every 12 hours. Treatment failures of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections have been reported despite in vitro susceptibility. These failures have led to the use of vancomycin doses higher than those approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Higher doses are being administered to achieve goal vancomycin trough concentrations of 10 to 20 microg/mL, as recommended by several clinical practice guidelines endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Recent studies suggest that increased rates of nephrotoxicity are associated with aggressive vancomycin dosing. These increased rates are confounded by concomitant nephrotoxins, renal insufficiency, or changing hemodynamics. However, these studies have also demonstrated that vancomycin's nephrotoxicity risk is minimal in patients without risk factors for nephrotoxicity. Clinicians unwilling to dose vancomycin in accordance with clinical practice guidelines should use an alternative agent because inadequate dosing increases the likelihood of selecting heteroresistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates.

### Correlation of a vancomycin pharmacokinetic model and trough serum concentrations in pediatric patients [^112zxvAT]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough concentrations specific to pediatric patients have yet to be validated to achieve an area under the curve (AUC) over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio ≥ 400. The primary objective of this study was to validate a pharmacokinetic model in a pediatric hospital and determine the correlation between a calculated AUC/MIC ratio and measured trough vancomycin concentration.

- **Methods**: A retrospective evaluation was conducted on patients aged 3 months to 18 years prescribed vancomycin at a pediatric hospital between January 2012 and June 2013. The correlation between patient-specific AUC/MIC and measured vancomycin trough concentration was assessed.

- **Results**: Forty pediatric patients with 40 vancomycin trough concentrations and documented Staphylococcus aureus cultures were included in the study. The median age was 8.5 years (interquartile range, 2–14.3 years), median weight was 28.7 kg (range, 14–50.2 kg), and mean baseline serum creatinine was 0.51 ± 0.3 mg/dL. The mean daily dose of vancomycin prescribed was 58 ± 13.8 mg/kg/d. The mean vancomycin trough concentration was 11 ± 5.5 mcg/mL, and the mean AUC/MIC was 534 ± 373. No correlation was found between trough concentration and AUC/MIC (r = 0.082, p = 0.07).

- **Conclusions**: This study validates the clinical applicability of a pharmacokinetic model for calculating vancomycin clearance to determine patient-specific AUC over 24 hours in pediatrics. Trough concentrations associated with proposed therapeutic AUC/MIC ratios were lower than reported in the adult population. Further research is needed to determine if AUC-based therapeutic monitoring offers advantages in dose optimization for pediatric patients.

### Current recommended dosing of vancomycin for children with invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections is inadequate [^114QrFHn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Vancomycin area-under-the-concentration-time-curve (AUC) for 24 hours divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (AUC24/MIC) > 400 optimally treats invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in adults. It is unknown whether recommended vancomycin dosing regimens for children achieve this value.

- **Methods**: AUC24/MIC was calculated in children using vancomycin doses of 40 and 60 mg/kg/d. AUC24 was calculated as daily dose/vancomycin clearance. Vancomycin clearance in children was estimated by two approaches: (1) previously literature-reported vancomycin clearance and (2) calculated vancomycin clearance using previously derived predictor models and a hypothetical population of healthy children. A representative MIC of hospital MRSA isolates was used (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 µg/mL).

- **Results**: The MIC50/90 for pediatric MRSA isolates in the previous year was 1.0 µg/mL. With a dose of 40 mg/kg/d, both approaches consistently predicted AUC24/MIC 400 was more readily achieved when MIC was 1.0 µg/mL. However, an MIC of 2.0 µg/mL resulted in AUC24/MIC 400 for invasive MRSA infections even when MIC is 1.0 µg/mL. A starting dose of 60 mg/kg/d should be used in settings where isolates with MIC of 1.0 are common. Alternatives to vancomycin should strongly be considered for patients with MIC ≥ 2.0 µg/m.

### Pediatric antibiotic stewardship: Optimization of vancomycin therapy based on individual pharmacokinetics [^1134KxW8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Vancomycin has been a first-line treatment for Gram-positive infections for decades; however, strategies for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and dose optimization in pediatrics remain controversial. In this study, we analyzed the impact of specific antibiotic stewardship interventions on the efficacy and safety of vancomycin therapy.

- **Methods**: From September 2014 to May 2017, we conducted a prospective study to compare a control and a TDM intervention group in our tertiary care center. As part of an antibiotic stewardship program, we implemented internal guidelines on correct vancomycin dosing, TDM timing, targeted trough level range, and installed a pharmacokinetic (PK) consultation service to adapt vancomycin dosing to individually calculated PK parameters. Primary clinical outcomes included the percentage of patients with sustained therapeutic vancomycin trough levels and treatment days with therapeutic vancomycin trough levels, defined as 10–15 mg/L. Secondary outcomes included nephrotoxicity, readmission rate, and mortality. The median daily dose required to achieve therapeutic trough levels was also examined.

- **Results**: Clinical outcomes for 90 control patients were compared with outcomes for 19 patients guided by a PK consultation service. The percentage of patients with sustained therapeutic vancomycin trough levels increased from 17.8% to 94.7% (P < 0.001), and the percentage of treatment days with therapeutic vancomycin trough levels increased from 18.4% (117/637) to 66.5% (155/233, P < 0.001). The readmission rate decreased from 24.4% to 5.3% (P = 0.07).

### Should therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin area under the concentration-time curve be standard for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections?-No [^116MYdo4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

In this counterpoint, we critically appraise the evidence supporting therapeutic drug monitoring based on the vancomycin 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC24) for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We reveal methodological weaknesses and inconsistencies in the data and suggest that, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence of benefit compared with modestly reducing trough targets, alternative strategies are more likely to result in superior safety and efficacy. These include focusing on fundamental antibiotic stewardship to limit vancomycin exposure overall, achieving earlier and more complete source control, and establishing alternative therapeutic options to vancomycin. Implementation of AUC24-based therapeutic drug monitoring will take resources away from these more promising, alternative solutions.

### Mitigating risk of acute kidney injury among children with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis [^112J4tPH]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2025). Low credibility.

Children with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are treated with vancomycin despite the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This study evaluates the rate of AKI and resource utilization for children with or without AKI when vancomycin is used in this setting.

- **Methods**: Children with MRSA AHO treated with vancomycin were retrospectively studied. AKI was assessed by clinical diagnosis and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Cohorts of children with or without AKI were compared for differences in treatment, resource utilization, and outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with risk for AKI. Cost analysis was performed using the Pediatric Health Information System and Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project databases.

- **Results**: Among 85 children studied, 14 (16.5%) had chart-diagnosed AKI and 24 (28.2%) met KDIGO criteria. Children with AKI had more febrile days and higher thrombosis rates. They had longer vancomycin treatment (8 vs. 5 days), higher troughs (27.8 vs. 17.5 mg/L), and prolonged hospitalization (19.9 vs. 11.1 days). Multivariate analysis found a maximum vancomycin trough level (odds ratio: 1.05, P = 0.003) with a cutoff of 21.7 mg/L predicted AKI. Only 2 of 20 (10%) children who had MRSA isolates with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 achieved therapeutic vancomycin levels. Pediatric Health Information System data of 3,133 children with AHO treated with vancomycin identified 75 (2.4%) with AKI who had significantly longer lengths of stay.

### Oral antibiotic management of acute osteomyelitis of the hand: Outcomes and cost comparison to standard intravenous regimen [^116r85TX]. Hand (2021). Low credibility.

Acute, direct inoculation osteomyelitis of the hand has traditionally been managed by intravenous antibiotics. With proven high levels of bone and joint penetration, specific oral antimicrobials may deliver clinical efficacy but at substantially lower cost.

- **Methods**: Sixty-nine adult patients with surgically proven acute, direct inoculation osteomyelitis of the hand were evaluated for clinical response on a 6-week postdebridement regimen of susceptibility-matched oral antibiotics. Inclusion required gross purulence and bone loss demonstrated at the initial debridement and radiographic evidence of bone loss. Excluded were 2 patients with extreme medical comorbidities. There were 53 men and 16 women with a mean age of 46 years. Mean follow-up was 16 weeks (± 10).

- **Cost model**: The cost model for the outpatient oral antibiotic treatment was intentionally maximized using Walgreen's undiscounted cash price. The cost model for the traditional intravenous treatment regimen was intentionally minimized using the fully discounted Medicare fee schedule.

- **Results**: All patients achieved resolution of osteomyelitis by clinical and radiographic criteria. In addition, 7 patients underwent successful subsequent osteosynthesis procedures at the previously affected site without reactivation. The mean postdebridement direct cost of care per patient in the study cohort was $482.85, the cost of the antibiotic alone. The postdebridement direct cost of care per patient on a regimen of vancomycin 1.5 g every 12 hours via peripherally inserted central catheter line was $21,646.90.

### Implementation of a dose calculator for vancomycin to achieve target trough levels of 15–20 microg/mL in persons undergoing hemodialysis [^116cRbsd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is a key antibiotic for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections in patients undergoing dialysis. It has a narrow therapeutic range. Overdosing imposes a risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, whereas underdosing predisposes to treatment failure and the emergence of drug resistance. Trough levels of 15–20 μg/mL have been identified as the optimal target trough levels.

A multivariate model called the vancomycin dose calculator (VDC) was prospectively developed and validated to permit accurate vancomycin dosing in persons undergoing hemodialysis. The model identified three simple parameters responsible for 94.6% of the variance observed: predialysis vancomycin trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session. Maintenance dosing was accurate in 77.9% of patients, while major over- and underdosing were avoided in the remaining patients. The mean measured trough level of 16.5 μg/mL was 5.6% lower than the mean predicted trough level of 17.5 μg/mL. Regarding loading doses, a fixed loading dose of 20 mg/kg led to subtherapeutic trough levels in half of the patients.

The VDC permits accurate vancomycin maintenance dosing based on predialysis trough level, dry body weight, and period to the next dialysis session in the majority of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Higher loading doses that accounted for the period to the next dialysis may be more appropriate than the fixed loading doses used in this study.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^11684FrQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of all patients aged 3 months to 18 years diagnosed with MRSA bacteremia at Asan Medical Center Children's Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Seoul, between September 2013 and December 2021. Patients were excluded if they received vancomycin within 72 hours before the onset of MRSA bacteremia, had a duration of vancomycin treatment of less than 72 hours, or received renal replacement therapy at baseline.

Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected, including underlying diseases, primary infection source, history of infection source control, details of vancomycin administration (timing, dose, and interval), use of inotropes, ventilator support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Laboratory data, such as blood culture results, vancomycin MIC, vancomycin C trough, and serum creatinine levels, were extracted. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Schwartz equation. Serum vancomycin levels were measured using the Cobas Integra 800 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and vancomycin C trough was generally sampled before the 4th or 5th dose and within the 30 minutes before the next dose of vancomycin.

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (IRB No. 2021–1667).

The primary outcome measures were microbiological and clinical outcomes, with persistent bacteremia being evaluated as a microbiological outcome.

### Relationship between initial vancomycin concentration-time profile and nephrotoxicity among hospitalized patients [^11418UTz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Data suggest that higher doses of vancomycin can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. No study has been undertaken to determine the pharmacodynamic index (i.e. the area under the curve [AUC] or the trough value) that best describes the relationship between vancomycin exposure and onset of nephrotoxicity.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted among patients who received vancomycin for a suspected or proven gram-positive infection during the period from 1 January 2005 through 31 December 2006 at Albany Medical Center Hospital. Patients were included in our study if they (1) were ≥ 18 years old, (2) had an absolute neutrophil count of ≥ 1000 cells/mm³, (3) received vancomycin for > 48 hours, (4) had 1 vancomycin trough level collected within 96 hours of vancomycin therapy, and (5) had a baseline serum creatinine level of < 2.0 mg/dL. Patients were excluded if they (1) had a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, (2) received intravenous contrast dye within 7 days of starting vancomycin or during therapy, or (3) required vasopressor support during therapy.

Demographics, comorbid conditions, and treatment data were collected. The highest observed vancomycin trough value within 96 hours of initiation of vancomycin therapy and the estimated vancomycin AUC were analyzed as measures of vancomycin exposure. The vancomycin AUC value from 0 to 24 hours at steady state (in units of mg x h/L) for each patient was estimated by use of the maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian procedure in ADAPT II. Nephrotoxicity was defined as an increase in serum creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL or 50% above baseline.

### Evaluation of a pilot vancomycin precision dosing advisory service on target exposure attainment using an interrupted time series analysis [^116o6HSw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). High credibility.

This study evaluated the ability of a pilot therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) advisory service to facilitate vancomycin therapeutic target attainment within a real-world clinical setting. The service provided area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)-guided vancomycin dose recommendations, using Bayesian forecasting software and clinical expertise, to prescribers at an Australian hospital. A retrospective audit of intravenous vancomycin therapy (lasting more than 48 hours) in adults (18 years and older) was conducted over a 54-month period to evaluate attainment of established vancomycin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets (AUC over 24 hours/minimum inhibitory concentration: 400–600) before (36-month period) and after (18-month period) service implementation.

Interrupted time series analysis was employed to evaluate monthly measures of the median proportion of therapy spent within the target range. Indices of time to target attainment were also assessed before and after service implementation. The final cohort comprised 1,142 courses of vancomycin (816 patients); 835 courses (596 patients) were administered before service implementation, and 307 courses (220 patients) were administered after. Prior to piloting the service, the median proportion of time in the target range was 40.1% (95% CI, 34.3–46.0%); this increased by 10.4% (95% CI, 1.2–19.6%, P = 0.03) after the service and was sustained throughout the post-service evaluation period. Post-service target attainment at 48–72 hours after initiation of therapy increased by 7.8% (95% CI, 1.3–14.3%, P = 0.02). The findings of this study…

Regarding specific circumstances for vertebral osteomyelitis, particularly in patients with MRSA osteomyelitis management, the IDSA 2011 guidelines recommend considering administering clindamycin IV 10–13 mg/kg/dose every 6–8 hours (to administer 40 mg/kg/day) as empirical therapy. This is suggested for stable pediatric patients without ongoing bacteremia or intravascular infection if the clindamycin resistance rate is low (< 10%). Transition to oral therapy is recommended if the strain is susceptible.

### Therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: A revised consensus guideline and review by the American Society of Health-system Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^112QWv3D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Recent clinical data on vancomycin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics suggest a reevaluation of dosing and monitoring recommendations. The previous 2009 vancomycin consensus guidelines recommend trough monitoring as a surrogate marker for the target area under the curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). However, recent data suggest that trough monitoring is associated with higher nephrotoxicity. This document is an executive summary of the new vancomycin consensus guidelines for vancomycin dosing and monitoring. It was developed by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists vancomycin consensus guidelines committee. These consensus guidelines recommend an AUC/MIC ratio of 400–600 mg*hour/L (assuming a broth microdilution MIC of 1 mg/L) to achieve clinical efficacy and ensure safety for patients being treated for serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^114z5PWP]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics of vancomycin differ in pediatric patients, and studies in children confirm that few patients reach a trough serum level in the range of 15–20 mg/L when using the recommended doses.

In 2009, Frymoyer et al. found that it is unlikely that a vancomycin dose of 40 mg/kg/day in children can reach the recommended pharmacodynamic target of AUC/MIC > 400 for invasive infections by MRSA, even when the MIC is 1 mcg/mL. In our study, the average initial dose of 40 mg/kg/day proved to be insufficient to achieve the serum level of 10–20 mg/L for most patients, emphasizing the need for a review of the available literature regarding the dose that offers the best pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic efficacy.

We observed no evidence of a significant association between serum level adequacy (10–20 mg/L) and age. A previous study, which evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of vancomycin in critically ill children, also did not demonstrate the influence of age on the parameters evaluated. However, Gordon et al. found significant lower levels of vancomycin in children under the age of six, even using similar doses as those administered to older patients. Madigan et al. observed the effect of age and weight on serum concentrations of vancomycin in pediatric patients. The authors suggest that vancomycin's prescription in pediatric patients should also consider age and weight. The age classification for our study was based on the Madigan et al. study.

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early? Frequency and impact on clinical actions [^112DRAJk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and their associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured over 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs. 15.5 ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs. 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs. 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

### Coagulase negative staphylococcal sepsis in neonates: do we need to adapt vancomycin dose or target [^112vZ4n6]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Several limitations of the study need to be noted. The relatively small number of participants in each gestational age band may have under- or overestimated the within-group variability. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, only trough concentration data were available, as monitoring of peak concentration has been found to be of no value in guiding vancomycin therapy. Concomitant medications and underlying illnesses may have influenced the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin, and minor fluctuations may have occurred in the recorded collection times for trough concentrations. The microbiological outcome may have been affected by the combination of antibacterial drugs used at the beginning of the treatment episode.

Practice guidelines for therapeutic monitoring of vancomycin treatment for Staphylococcus aureus infection in adult patients were reviewed by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. A literature review of existing evidence regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring of serum concentrations, in addition to patient outcomes combined with expert opinion regarding the drug's pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety record, resulted in new recommendations for targeting and adjustment of vancomycin therapy.

### The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin [^114ZGFNy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Vancomycin is one of only a few antibiotics available to treat patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. Therefore, understanding the clinical implications of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of vancomycin is a necessity for clinicians. Vancomycin is a concentration-independent antibiotic (also referred to as a "time-dependent" antibiotic), and several factors affect its clinical activity, including variable tissue distribution, inoculum size, and emerging resistance. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data related to vancomycin and discusses clinical issues such as toxicities and serum concentration monitoring.

### Continuous versus intermittent vancomycin infusions in infants: A randomized controlled trial [^112oUnxg]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

In adults, continuous infusions of vancomycin (CIV) are associated with earlier attainment of target drug concentrations, require fewer blood samples for monitoring, and may reduce drug toxicity. We aimed to determine, in young infants, if CIV or intermittent infusions of vancomycin (IIV) better achieve target vancomycin concentrations at the first steady-state level and to compare the frequency of drug-related adverse effects.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter randomized controlled trial across two tertiary neonatal units over a 40-month period, young infants aged 0 to 90 days requiring vancomycin therapy for at least 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive either CIV or IIV.

- **Results**: Of 111 infants randomized, 104 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups. The proportion of infants achieving target concentrations at the first steady-state level was higher for CIV compared with IIV (45 in 53 [85%] versus 21 in 51 [41%]; P < .001). Fewer dose adjustments were required in the CIV group (median 0; range 0–1) compared with the IIV group (median 1; range 0–3; P < .001). The mean daily dose required to achieve target concentrations was lower with CIV compared with IIV (40.6 [SD 10.7] versus 60.6 [SD 53.0] mg/kg per day, respectively; p = 0.01). No drug-related adverse effects occurred in either group.

- **Conclusions**: In young infants, CIV is associated with earlier and improved attainment of target concentrations compared with IIV. Lower total daily doses are required to achieve target levels with CIV. There is no difference in the rate of drug-related adverse effects between the two methods.

### Describing vancomycin serum levels in pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients: Are expected goals being met [^111HD99q]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

In the pediatric population, infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are associated with significant morbidity and hospital costs. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic widely used for the treatment of serious infections by Gram-positive microorganisms, especially MRSA. It is recommended to maintain the serum level of vancomycin between 10 and 20 mg/L, correlating with an AUC/MIC > 400 in adults. This pharmacodynamic target is extrapolated to pediatric patients despite the lack of similar evidence. However, recent studies suggest that serum levels between 7 and 10 mg/L are predictive of reaching the pharmacodynamic target in this population. Despite its widespread use, ideal information about dosage for the pediatric population remains limited.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit during the period from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014. We investigated variables such as age, positive fluid balance, and use of vasoactive drugs on the ability of these patients to achieve the proposed recommended serum level target and the vancomycin serum levels.

- **Results**: Our study showed that only 26% of children reached the 10–20 mg/L serum level, whereas the 7–20 mg/L serum level was reached by 51% of patients.

- **Conclusions**: We observed no evidence of a significant association between the inadequacy of serum level and age. The positive fluid balance also had no influence on the vancomycin serum level, but patients using vasoactive drugs had a greater serum level adequacy than other patients.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^115w7nNq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Vancomycin is the most frequently used drug for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. The parameter associated with its therapeutic efficacy is the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). However, due to difficulties in directly measuring AUC, trough concentration (C_trough) monitoring has been employed as a surrogate marker since 2009. Nonetheless, several studies have indicated that C_trough does not consistently reflect AUC values and lacks a significant correlation with outcomes. Moreover, a meta-analysis suggested that AUC monitoring may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with C_trough measurement. The 2020 revised vancomycin therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) guidelines recommend AUC monitoring and suggest using Bayesian software to estimate AUC. Bayesian-derived TDM can easily estimate AUC using the vancomycin population pharmacokinetic model and individual patient data.

Previous studies on adults with severe MRSA infections have recommended an AUC/MIC ≥ 400 mg·h/L as a therapeutic target, despite variations in AUC estimation methods and the inherent limitations of retrospective studies. Given the differences in clinical severity, prognosis, and physiological responses to vancomycin in pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia compared with adults, it remains uncertain whether the AUC/MIC target recommended for adults can be directly extrapolated to the pediatric population. Two retrospective pediatric studies, in which the AUC was calculated using Bayesian estimations, have attempted to address this knowledge gap.

### Optimal vancomycin AUC target in pediatric MRSA bacteremia: A Bayesian-guided approach [^111yqkGd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

In this retrospective study involving pediatric MRSA bacteremia cases with a 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 3.7%, we suggest an optimal target for vancomycin AUC simulated using Bayesian dosing software. An AUC of 24–48 ≤ 530 mg·h/L may serve as a threshold for improved outcomes, reducing the risk of persistent bacteremia ≥ 48 hours and acute kidney injury (AKI).

Bayesian-derived therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is more adaptive to the patient's dynamic physiological changes and has the advantage of requiring fewer constraints on the timing or frequency of samplings, even before steady-state is achieved. Though still evolving, this approach shows promise in optimizing dosing strategies for patient outcomes and may be cost-effective, depending on the institution's size. In pediatric patients with MRSA bacteremia, no study has proposed an applicable Bayesian-derived AUC target. One study utilizing an equation model indicated an association between an initial AUC/MIC < 300 mg·h/L and persistent bacteremia at 48–72 hours. However, the study relied on equations using only C trough to estimate the AUC, and as MIC values were identified using MicroScan, the interpretation of AUC/MIC values cannot be directly compared with those derived from the broth microdilution (BMD) method. For MIC determination of S. aureus isolates, this study adopted the MicroScan method, which tends to overcall MIC compared with the BMD method. These discrepancies in MIC results depending on measurement methods raise challenges in establishing interinstitutional targets of AUC/MIC as parameters for appropriate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets. Consequently, AUC itself may be a more viable parameter for consideration.

### An evaluation of the empirical vancomycin dosing guide in pediatric cardiology [^1118k2Ef]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Vancomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic used for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). An initial dose ranging between 40 and 60 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours is usually sufficient and safe for most pediatric patients. The serum blood level, obtained at a steady state just before the fourth dose, is used as a robust pharmacodynamic marker to ensure drug safety and efficacy. A trough level ranging between 10 and 15 mg/L is often required for general indications, while a higher level ranging between 15 and 20 mg/L is recommended for more complicated infections.

Due to the emergence of bacterial tolerance and resistance, higher doses are currently prescribed to achieve the target vancomycin trough concentration (7–10 mg/L), a level desired for the majority of mild-moderate infections precipitated by MRSA. Major organizations, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, endorse a total daily dose (TDD) of 60–80 mg/kg for children younger than 12 years old, and 60–70 mg/kg for children older than 12 years for MRSA strains with a MIC ≤ 1 mg/L.

### Attention to age: Similar dosing regimens lead to different vancomycin levels among older and younger patients [^1147C16e]. Age and Ageing (2019). Low credibility.

Little is known about the clinical implications of vancomycin trough levels among older patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between vancomycin levels and outcomes among older versus younger patients in a retrospective study.

- **Subjects**: Patients aged 18–64 and ≥ 65 years treated with vancomycin for documented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

- **Methods**: We compared the effectiveness and toxicity of vancomycin according to trough levels in older versus younger patients. A subgroup analysis of patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) > 60 ml/min/1.73 m² was performed.

- **Results**: We included 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years and 104 younger patients. The mean age in the older group was 76.9 ± 8 years versus 50.9 ± 12.4 in the younger group. Vancomycin trough levels and 24-hour area under the curve to minimal inhibitory concentrations (AUC/MIC) were significantly higher in older patients. These patients were also significantly more likely to achieve trough levels of ≥ 15 mg/l within 4 days (98/181, 54.1% vs. 38/104, 36.5% in younger patients, P = 0.004). Results were similar among patients with GFR > 60. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in older patients (74/181, 40.9% vs. 13/104, 12.5%, P < 0.001). There was no association between vancomycin trough levels and mortality among older patients. No significant differences were demonstrated in clinical or microbiological success or nephrotoxicity.

- **Conclusions**: Applying uniform dosing recommendations across age groups among adults with MRSA infections results in higher vancomycin levels and outcomes need further evaluation.
