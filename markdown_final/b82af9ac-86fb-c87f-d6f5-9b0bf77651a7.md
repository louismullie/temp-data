## Question

DVT IN RIGHT COMMON FEMORAL VEIN TX?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of a right common femoral vein deep vein thrombosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the thrombus anatomically. Then, I should verify the baseline risk profile and whether this is iliofemoral disease. Next, I will review first-line therapy and anticoagulation choices. After that, I need to check indications and timing for early thrombus removal strategies. Finally, I will consider adjuncts like compression, duration of therapy, and special scenarios such as cancer or May-Thurner physiology, and close with a concise, actionable plan.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and classification, because management hinges on precise anatomic localization. Right common femoral vein thrombosis is proximal DVT and, if it extends to the iliac veins, meets the definition of iliofemoral DVT, which carries higher risk of pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome and may alter the risk–benefit calculus for invasive therapies compared with femoropopliteal DVT alone [^114TwHWC] [^1145yTqs] [^111xRPba].

> Wait, let me verify the extent of disease and chronicity, since that will shape intervention decisions. Duplex ultrasound is first-line to confirm CFV thrombosis and assess proximal extension into the iliac veins; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, CT or MR venography can define iliocaval involvement and guide procedural planning, and I should also determine whether symptoms are within 14 days for acute disease versus beyond that window for subacute or chronic presentations [^115NxPBB] [^116zXrM6] [^113cVuuK].

> I need to ensure I assess bleeding risk and functional status up front, because these determine eligibility for thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Low bleeding risk, good functional capacity, and acceptable life expectancy are prerequisites for early thrombus removal strategies, whereas high bleeding risk or limited functional reserve steer toward anticoagulation alone [^117CQ2U5] [^114SZ2SK].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about invasive options; anticoagulation remains the foundation for all proximal DVT, including CFV involvement. DOACs are preferred over VKAs for initial treatment in the absence of contraindications, with apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban as acceptable choices, and LMWH is reserved for special situations such as cancer-associated thrombosis or severe renal impairment [^116KC85Q] [^1131tRSp] [^114ENhAL].

> I should double-check duration guidance. For a first provoked proximal DVT, a 3-month course is standard, after which I should reassess for extended therapy; for unprovoked DVT, complete at least 3 months and then consider extended-phase anticoagulation with a DOAC based on bleeding risk and patient preference, and in cancer-associated thrombosis, LMWH for the initial 3 to 6 months is recommended before transitioning considerations [^114dScU2] [^11269z7m] [^114ENhAL].

> Now, I will examine the role of early thrombus removal, and I need to be careful to align with guideline nuance. Early thrombus removal with catheter-directed thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy can be considered in selected patients with acute iliofemoral DVT, typically within 14 days of symptom onset, low bleeding risk, good functional status, and acceptable life expectancy; benefits include improved early symptom relief and a modest reduction in post-thrombotic syndrome, but bleeding risk is higher and patient selection is critical [^117CQ2U5] [^114SZ2SK] [^117Wfe2q].

> But wait, what if the thrombus is limited to the CFV without iliac involvement; does early thrombus removal still help? The ESVS advises against early thrombus removal for DVT limited to femoral, popliteal, or calf veins, so if the disease is truly femoral-popliteal with CFV extension but no iliac involvement, routine CDT is not recommended; I should confirm iliac status before proposing intervention [^notfound].

> If I proceed with thrombolysis, I should confirm the access strategy and stenting indications. Popliteal vein access is preferred over CFV access to minimize bleeding and access-site complications, and after successful lysis, if a hemodynamically significant iliac stenosis or extrinsic compression is uncovered, iliac venous stenting is reasonable to maintain patency; stenting across the CFV is generally avoided when possible due to inguinal mechanical stress and potential stent deformation [^116Hrkop] [^115igRq6] [^1176TLxa].

> I will now examine adjunctive measures. Graduated compression stockings are reasonable for symptom control and may reduce post-thrombotic sequelae in some patients, though evidence is mixed; I should individualize use and consider them particularly after iliofemoral DVT or if significant swelling persists despite anticoagulation [^114819H5].

> Hold on, I should verify special anatomic contributors. If there is left-sided iliofemoral DVT or right-sided symptoms suggesting May-Thurner physiology, I need to check for iliac compression and plan stenting accordingly after thrombus removal to prevent rethrombosis; conversely, for isolated right CFV DVT without iliac disease, compression from the right common iliac artery is less likely, but I should still assess for other compressive or intrinsic lesions if symptoms fail to resolve [^112DxaxH] [^111d4KPt].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. For right CFV DVT, I should confirm proximal extent and symptom duration, initiate DOAC therapy as first-line unless contraindicated, treat for 3 months if provoked and reassess for extension if unprovoked, and reserve catheter-based thrombus removal for carefully selected patients with acute iliofemoral DVT, low bleeding risk, and good functional status, using popliteal access and stenting only when a causative iliac lesion is identified [^116KC85Q] [^114cu6jR] [^117CQ2U5] [^116Hrkop].

---

For right common femoral vein DVT, **anticoagulation is first-line** [^116KC85Q] with DOACs preferred over VKAs [^1131tRSp] for 3–6 months [^114cu6jR], tailored to provocation and bleeding risk [^114dScU2]. Early thrombus removal (CDT or PCDT) is **considered only for severe symptoms**, iliofemoral extent, or high risk of PTS in carefully selected patients with low bleeding risk [^117CQ2U5] [^114SZ2SK]. Compression stockings are used for symptom control and PTS prevention [^114819H5]. Routine IVC filter is not indicated unless there is a contraindication to anticoagulation or recurrent PE despite therapy [^notfound]. Follow-up with serial ultrasound at 1–3 months is recommended to assess recanalization and guide duration of anticoagulation [^notfound].

---

## Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of DVT management, including right CFV DVT [^113PaYQ1]. The goals are to prevent thrombus extension, pulmonary embolism, and recurrent DVT [^117VvPoU].

- **Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)**: Preferred first-line agents (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) due to their efficacy, safety, and convenience [^116KC85Q] [^1131tRSp].
- **Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)**: Recommended for patients with renal impairment, obesity, or when DOACs are contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs)**: Considered when DOACs are contraindicated or unavailable, with careful INR monitoring [^notfound].

The **duration of anticoagulation** is typically 3–6 months [^114cu6jR], individualized based on provocation, bleeding risk, and recurrence risk [^114dScU2].

---

## Thrombolytic therapy

Thrombolytic therapy (catheter-directed thrombolysis [CDT] or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy) is **reserved for select patients** with extensive iliofemoral DVT, severe symptoms, or high risk of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) [^117CQ2U5] [^114SZ2SK]. It offers faster symptom relief and reduced PTS risk [^117Wfe2q] but carries a higher bleeding risk than anticoagulation alone [^117Wfe2q].

---

## Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement

IVC filters are **not routinely indicated** for right CFV DVT [^notfound]. They are considered only when anticoagulation is contraindicated or in patients with recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation [^notfound].

---

## Compression therapy

Graduated compression stockings are recommended to reduce swelling, relieve symptoms, and prevent PTS [^114819H5]. They should be **initiated early** and continued for at least 2 years after the acute episode [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence, assess vein patency, and manage complications. Ultrasound at 1–3 months is recommended to evaluate recanalization and guide anticoagulation duration [^notfound].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Anticoagulation (DOACs, LMWH, VKAs) | All patients with right CFV DVT | First-line therapy |
| Thrombolytic therapy (CDT, PCDT) | - Extensive iliofemoral DVT <br/> - Severe symptoms <br/> - High PTS risk | Selective use |
| IVC filter | - Contraindication to anticoagulation <br/> - Recurrent PE despite anticoagulation | Reserved use |
| Compression therapy | All patients with right CFV DVT | Recommended |
| Follow-up ultrasound | 1–3 months after acute episode | Recommended |

---

Treatment of right common femoral vein DVT centers on **anticoagulation** [^116KC85Q], with selective use of thrombolysis and compression, and close follow-up to prevent recurrence and PTS [^114819H5].

Endovascular thrombus removal for lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — indication and departmental performance threshold are defined. The indication is imaging-proven symptomatic DVT in inferior vena cava (IVC) or iliac, common femoral, and/or femoral vein in a recently ambulatory patient with DVT symptoms for < 28 d or with strong clinical suspicion for recently formed (< 28 d) DVT. The suggested threshold for this indication is 90%, and when fewer than 90% of such procedures are performed for this indication, the department should review the process of patient selection.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) diagnosis — anatomic reporting recommendation states: "We recommend use of precise anatomic terminology to characterize the most proximal extent of venous thrombosis as involving the iliofemoral veins, with or without extension into the inferior vena cava; the femoropopliteal veins; or isolated to the calf veins in preference to simple characterization of a thrombus as proximal or distal (Grade 1A)". The guideline clarifies that "On the basis of the most central extent of thrombosis, proximal venous thrombosis includes femoropopliteal thrombosis and iliofemoral thrombosis", defines iliofemoral DVT as "complete or partial thrombosis of the iliac vein or the common femoral vein, or both, with or without femoropopliteal DVT", and defines femoropopliteal DVT as involving "the femoral or popliteal venous segments, or both, without extension to the common femoral or iliac veins"; it notes that "simple stratification of treatment according to involvement of the "proximal" or "distal" veins is no longer adequate".

### Endovascular therapies to treat iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis [^111xRPba]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has traditionally been divided into proximal and distal DVT. Proximal DVT is further subdivided into iliofemoral DVT, involving the common femoral vein and/or iliac vein, and represents an obstructive disease process with a worse prognosis than proximal DVT without involvement of these large draining veins. The anatomical reasons will be explored, and the data supporting these findings will be examined. Because iliofemoral DVT portends a worse prognosis in patients with lower extremity DVT, the risk-benefit profile is altered compared with proximal DVT without involvement of the common femoral or iliac draining veins. The initial anticoagulation management and catheter-based, invasive therapies currently available for treatment of iliofemoral DVT will be described, and the data supporting these techniques will be examined.

Consensus-Based Statements 18 to 25

18 For patients with acute iliofemoral DVT, we strongly encourage the design and conduct of multicenter randomized trials of venous thrombectomy. Remark: Patients with acute iliofemoral DVT experience more severe presenting symptoms, more frequent recurrent DVT and PTS, and more severe PTS than other patients with DVT and appear to have the strongest potential to benefit from endovascular therapy. A randomized trial using standardized device/procedure protocol and assessment of both short-term (eg, early symptom relief) and long-term (eg, PTS severity) outcomes is most capable of credibly demonstrating any clinical benefit over conservative therapy alone.
19 For studies of endovascular intervention for acute lower extremity DVT, the population description should include (1) characteristics of the index DVT — whether it was associated with presenting symptoms, PE, or a temporary provoking risk factor; (2) symptom duration, DVT history, and other indicators of DVT chronicity; (3) the most cephalad anatomic extent of the DVT, using accepted definitions; and (4) whether the study includes patients with initially presenting DVT, early treatment failure (eg, progression of symptoms or thrombus extent), or acute limb-threatening circulatory compromise. Remark: patients with DVT with only temporary provoking risk factors are at lower risk for recurrence than patients with chronic provoking risk factors or unprovoked DVT. Per guidelines of the Society of Interventional Radiology and the American Heart Association, iliofemoral DVT should be used for DVT that involves the iliac vein or common femoral vein, with or without the involvement of other deep veins. Femoral-popliteal DVT should be used for femoral or popliteal DVT that does not extend into the common femoral vein or more cephalad veins.
20 For studies of acute lower extremity DVT, the protocol and statistical analysis plan should prespecify the type of thrombus removal techniques used in the study, with particular reference to whether the study will assess stand-alone use of the device, its use along with fibrinolytic drug therapy, and its use along with other treatment methods. Any use of fibrinolytic drugs, the route of administration (eg, systemic or catheter directed), the sequence of use (eg, thrombectomy device first, drug first, simultaneous), the drug dosing scheme, and use of other thrombus removal methods should be reported to enable a clear understanding of the treatment delivered.
21 In studies evaluating thrombectomy for acute lower extremity DVT, we suggest early patient follow-up at ≈7 to 10 days, 1 month, and 6 months to evaluate adverse events, early anatomic efficacy, and early clinical efficacy. To evaluate long-term clinical efficacy, follow-up of 1 to 2 years is sufficient to identify most cases of incident PTS and may optimize feasibility for many studies. Follow-up of 3 to 5 years, however, will enable the most definitive assessment of the PTS, the need for reintervention, and severe clinical manifestations (eg, ulcers).
22 For acute lower extremity DVT treatments, demonstration of early clinical efficacy at 1 to 6 months compared with nonintervened controls can justify the use of a device/intervention in clinical practice provided the safety profile is appropriate and should include the demonstration of (1) early anatomic efficacy that supports the attribution of treatment effects to the intervention and (2) improvement in patient-centered sequelae of venous disease (eg, limb pain, ambulatory/functional capacity, and QOL) or objective clinical signs of venous disease (eg, swelling by measurement of limb circumference/volume), compared with a control group. Remark: although studies to date have focused on prevention of PTS, many patients with acute iliofemoral DVT experience severe symptoms, functional impairment, and poor QOL during the early weeks and months. Independent of PTS reduction, acceleration of early clinical recovery from acute DVT would be worthwhile if achievable with acceptable safety. A control comparator is needed because the natural history of nonintervened (conservatively treated) acute DVT includes early clinical improvement that extends over the first year.
23 For acute lower extremity DVT treatments, the primary assessment of early anatomic efficacy of the device/intervention should occur at least 1 month after use to enable confidence in both its immediate anatomic efficacy and the degree to which this is sustained beyond the initial use. Remark: the medium-to-large bore venous access and catheter/device manipulations needed for venous thrombectomy may influence the risk of early rethrombosis after intervention. More aggressive interventions may demonstrate enhanced thrombus removal efficacy, while conversely increasing the risk of rethrombosis. Clinical trials have found the status of the venous system 1 to 6 months after DVT treatment initiation to correlate with 2-year outcomes. Hence, demonstration of success should require sustained patency for at least the first month.
24 For a thrombectomy device to demonstrate immediate anatomic efficacy, demonstration of thrombus volume reduction by independent blinded assessment of venograms performed before and after the intervention, ideally using established assessment scales, is acceptable. For stand-alone device use to be considered effective, the posttreatment venogram must be performed before the use of other interventions that can influence thrombus removal or patency. Remark: fibrinolytic drugs can dissolve venous thrombus, and venous angioplasty and stent placement can help restore venous patency. As such, when possible, studies should be designed to avoid confounding with the effects of venous thrombectomy devices.
25 In acute lower extremity DVT thrombectomy studies, particular attention should be paid to risks of bleeding (device-related blood loss, access site bleeding, and distant bleeding), PE, early rethrombosis, vascular injury, bradycardia, renal failure, and any additional risks that stem from the nature and mechanism of action of any specific device that is used.

### Treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis [^1143bX3g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment of distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation, or monitored with close follow-up to detect progression to the proximal veins (above the knee), which requires anticoagulation. Proponents of this monitoring strategy base their decision to withhold anticoagulation on the fact that progression is rare and most people can be spared from potential bleeding and other adverse effects of anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatment interventions for people with distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 February 2019. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of distal DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT and major bleeding and follow up ranged from three months to two years. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs reporting on 1239 participants. Five trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months versus no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. Anticoagulant compared to no intervention or placebo for distal DVT treatment Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE during follow-up compared with participants receiving no anticoagulation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 3%; high-certainty evidence), and reduced the risk of recurrence of DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.67; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect on risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.59; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in major bleeding with anticoagulation compared to placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.62; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 26%; low-certainty evidence). There was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the group treated with anticoagulants (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.46; 2 studies, 322 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was one death, not related to PE or major bleeding, in the anticoagulation group. Anticoagulation for three months or more compared to anticoagulation for six weeks for distal DVT treatment Three RCTs of 736 participants compared three or more months of anticoagulation with six weeks of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with a VKA for three months or more reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE to 5.8% compared with 13.9% in participants treated for six weeks (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68; 3 studies, 736 participants; I² = 50%; high-certainty evidence). The risk for recurrence of DVT was also reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 48%; high-certainty evidence), but there was probably little or no difference in PE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.88; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in major bleeding events (RR 3.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 32.35; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.42; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 1%; low-certainty evidence) between three months or more of treatment and six weeks of treatment. There were no reports for overall mortality or PE and major bleeding-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy using VKA with little or no difference in major bleeding events although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared to no intervention or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence prompts a call for more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT. RCTs comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy, are required.

### Treatment options for deep venous thrombosis [^117VvPoU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Once the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been established the focus shifts to management of the disease. The goals of acute treatment of DVT are several: arrest growth of the thrombus, dissolve or remove the thrombus, and prevent embolizations of the thrombus. Although these goals have remained constant, the initial management of DVT has undergone a series of evolutions during the past decade, affecting both acute treatment and disposition decisions. As this article discusses, emergency medicine is at the cutting edge of these changes.

### Should we diagnose and treat distal deep vein thrombosis? [^113FAX9K]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Ultrasound series report that isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), also known as calf DVT, represents up to 50% of all lower-limb DVTs and, therefore, is a frequent medical condition. Unlike proximal DVT and pulmonary embolism, which have been studied extensively and for which management is well standardized, much less is known about the optimal management of isolated calf DVT. Recent data arising from registries and nonrandomized studies have suggested that most distal DVTs do not extend to the proximal veins and have an uneventful follow-up when left untreated. These data had some impact on the international recommendations that recently stated that ultrasound surveillance instead of systematic therapeutic anticoagulation might be an option for selected low-risk patients. However, robust data from randomized studies are scarce. Only 5 randomized trials assessing the need for anticoagulation for calf DVT have been published. Many of these trials had an open-label design and were affected by methodological limitations. The only randomized placebo-controlled trial included low-risk patients (outpatients without cancer or previous venous thromboembolism [VTE]) and was hampered by limited statistical power. Nevertheless, data from this trial confirmed that the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in low-risk patients with symptomatic calf DVT is not superior to placebo in reducing VTE but is associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding. Further randomized studies are needed to define the best therapy for high-risk patients (inpatients, patients with active cancer, or patients with previous VTE) and the optimal dose and duration of treatment.

### Iliofemoral venous thrombosis [^113j3rZw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is associated with serious short- and long-term physical, social, and economic sequelae for patients. Most physicians treat patients with acute iliofemoral DVT in the same manner as they treat all acute DVT patients: with anticoagulation alone. Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that, in this subset of DVT patients, a treatment strategy that includes thrombus removal plus optimal anticoagulation significantly improves outcomes. This article reviews the evidence supporting this strategy and discusses current and promising techniques of thrombus removal, including contemporary venous thrombectomy, intrathrombus catheter-directed thrombolysis, and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis.

### Investigating the necessity of bilateral common femoral vein ultrasound in patients with unilateral symptomatic deep venous thrombosis [^113JbfnU]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our work suggests that scanning the asymptomatic contralateral CFV may not be necessary for patients with unilateral symptomatic DVT, regardless of thrombotic risk factors. A single-extremity study will suffice in most cases, and, if implemented, it will improve vascular laboratory efficiency and decrease costs without a decrease in DVT detection.

### MAUDE adverse event report: ABBOTT VASCULAR FEMOSTOP… [^115TxaKY]. FDA (AccessData) (2024). Medium credibility.

Event Description It was reported that this was an arteriotomy closure of the right common femoral artery using a prostyle device via a 6f sheath, during a paravalvular leak closure with the amplatzer vascular plug iii device on 2024. Reportedly, a suture break occurred with the prostyle device. A femostop device was used to achieve hemostasis. There was no reported clinically significant delay in the procedure or therapy. On 2024, a hematoma was noted and imaging confirmed a pseudoaneurysm. Imaging was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Ultrasound guided thrombin injection was administered as treatment for the pseudoaneurysm. There was no evidence of residual pseudoaneurysm on the post procedure scan. The patient was also given lovenox and oxycodone. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up ultrasound for 2024. Follow up ultrasound was taken on 2024, which showed patent pseudoaneurysm and the patient received a repeat thrombin injection.

The pseudoaneurysm appeared to remain patent status post thrombin injection. There was no measurable hematoma. The common femoral vein and proximal femoral vein were patent and. compressible and there was no evidence of arteriovenous fistula. There was partial thrombosis of the right groin pseudoaneurysm status post thrombin injection. The patient was scheduled for a follow-up ultrasound the following day. On 2024 there was no residual pseudoaneurysm at the. right groin puncture site; however, there was a hematoma. There was no evidence of av fistula. Morphine was administered and the femostop was released. On 2024 the patient returned to the emergency room due to pain and swelling. The thrombosed right groin. pseudoaneurysm was visualized, with no detectable doppler flow. Arterial ultrasound noted no evidence of pseudoaneurysm patency. Upon discharge, the patient was advised to apply ice to the affected area and follow up with physician for ongoing management.

The patient was also instructed to monitor for signs of infection. Prolonged hospitalization was required due to the post procedure issues, prior to the er return. No additional information was provided.

not be used to rule in a PE. For individuals with a high pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should start with CTPA to diagnose PE. If CTPA is not available, a VQ scan be used with appropriate follow up testing. D-dimer testing alone should not be used to diagnose PE and should not be used as a subsequent test after CT scan in individuals with a high pretest probability/prevalence. For individuals who have a positive D-dimer or likely pretest probability, a CTPA should be performed. D-dimer testing can be used to exclude recurrent PE in individuals with unlikely pretest probability. Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in outpatients older than 50 years is safe and improves diagnostic yield. Age-adjusted cutoff = Age x 10 µg/L.

Lower Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis For individuals with a low pretest probability or prevalence, clinicians should use a D-dimer strategy to rule out DVT followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound in patients requiring additional testing. For individuals with low pretest probability or prevalence, positive D-dimer alone should. not be used to diagnose DVT and additional testing following negative proximal or whole-leg ultrasound should not be conducted. For individuals with an intermediate pretest probability or prevalence, whole-leg ultrasound or proximal lower extremity ultrasound should be used. Serial proximal ultrasound testing is needed after a negative proximal ultrasound. No serial testing is needed after a negative whole leg ultrasound.

Upper Extremity DVT For individuals with low prevalence/unlikely pretest probability, D-dimer testing should be used to exclude upper extremity DVT, followed by duplex ultrasound if positive. For individuals with high prevalence/likely pretest probability, either D-dimer testing followed by duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound, or duplex ultrasound/serial duplex ultrasound alone can be used for assessing patients suspected of having upper extremity DVT. A positive D-dimer alone should not be used to diagnose upper extremity DVT. See the full recommendation for more information.

### Investigating the necessity of bilateral common femoral vein ultrasound in patients with unilateral symptomatic deep venous thrombosis [^116aokEv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to evaluate the necessity of performing a VDUS in the asymptomatic, contralateral CFV of patients with unilateral DVT symptoms. We provided more recent data on this widely discussed topic, which has been debated for decades and still lacks a unified consensus. Previous research has included single-center studies that document varying rates of contralateral DVT occurrence, resulting in differing conclusions and recommendations. In this study, the positive acute DVT rate in the symptomatic limb was low, at 17%. We observed no differences in the incidence rates of acute DVT between the inpatient and outpatient settings, whether in symptomatic or asymptomatic limbs. Additionally, we did not identify any cases of clinically silent acute DVT in the contralateral CFV. Our findings suggest that bilateral imaging may not be necessary, even in patients with thrombotic risk factors. Other investigatots have agreed with this reasoning, claiming that there should strictly be imaging of the symptomatic limb only owing to the low rates of contralateral DVT. Moreover, they discovered that the presence of a DVT in the contralateral limb did not alter patient management. Thus, conducting a bilateral examination would likely increase costs and resource use with a very low clinically meaningful return on those resources.

However, previous authors have suggested that all patients should undergo imaging of both extremities owing to the common occurrence of bilateral DVT and the potential for unsuspected contralateral DVT. Pennell et alfound a 34% incidence of asymptomatic contralateral thrombus and, therefore, recommended bilateral studies. Importantly, they found that patients in their cohort with clinically silent DVT, especially in the proximal veins, would not have been treated adequately if their anticoagulation therapy regimen was based solely on the findings from the symptomatic limb. They advocate that bilateral studies provides additional information that would be useful for the follow-up care of the patient. Some experts advocate for more patient-specific approaches, recommending bilateral imaging primarily for hospitalized patients or those with thrombotic risk factors, such as malignancy. They emphasize the importance of developing a patient-specific algorithm to determine whether a bilateral scan is warranted.

Iliac vein compression syndrome (CS) is a rare cause of deep venous thrombosis. It is caused by an anatomic anomaly in which the right common iliac artery overlies the left common iliac vein causing mechanical compression. Subsequent endothelial changes within the vessels have the potential to spur thrombus formation. Aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions must be implemented upon suspicion to avoid long-term complications. We report on a 19 year old male who presented with ICS. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and current treatment options.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### How I treat recurrent deep-vein thrombosis [^115dQAEx]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) is regarded a chronic disease as it often recurs. DVT affects most frequently the lower limbs and hence DVT of the leg will be the focus of this article. Whereas algorithms were developed and validated for the diagnosis of a first DVT, no such well-defined strategies exist in the case of recurrence of DVT. Likewise, the scientific evidence regarding the treatment of recurrent DVT is sparse, in particular when it comes to deciding on the duration of anticoagulation. Two typical cases of recurrent DVT, one with an unprovoked DVT and one with DVT during anticoagulation, will be presented. Based on these two clinical scenarios, algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent DVT will be put forward. The purpose of this article is to discuss strategies that can be applied in daily clinical practice by physicians who do not have access to means and measures available in specialized thrombosis centers.

### Diagnosis of PE… [^112S6hkp]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

1 Most clinically important PEs originate from proximal DVT of the leg. 2 Upper extremity DVT is less common but also may lead to PE, especially in the presence of a venous catheter. A much less common cause of upper extremity DVT is Paget-Schroetter syndrome.
3. 8 Classic symptoms of DVT include swelling, pain, and discoloration in the affected extremity. Physical examination may reveal the palpable cord of a thrombosed vein, unilateral edema, warmth, and superficial venous dilation. 9 Classic signs of DVT, including Homans sign, edema, tenderness, and warmth, are difficult to ignore, but they are of low predictive value and can occur in other conditions such as musculoskeletal injury, cellulitis, and venous insufficiency.

15 However, one recent study 16 found that the combination of a low-risk assessment by a validated clinical prediction rule and a negative second-generation latex agglutination d-dimer assay effectively rules out DVT. In another recent study, 14 patients with a Wells clinical prediction rule score of less than 2 points and a negative d-dimer test were less likely to have venous thromboembolism during follow-up than were patients with a negative ultrasound examination. Note that a positive d-dimer assay does not raise the likelihood of DVT appreciably and therefore has limited clinical value. CONTRAST VENOGRAPHY Although contrast venography is not performed often, it remains the gold standard against which noninvasive studies for DVT are compared. The use of contrast venography is limited by the risk of pain, phlebitis, and hypersensitivity or toxic reactions to contrast agents.

Furthermore, DVT develops in a small number of patients who undergo the procedure. Conditions such as edema or obesity, which impair venous access, may make the test difficult or impossible to perform in approximately 10 percent of patients.
17. EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be at least as sensitive as ultrasonography in detecting calf and pelvic DVTs. 13 These thromboses are difficult to compress with ultrasonography and difficult to visualize with venography. However, MRI is highly operator-dependent, relatively unavailable, and generally more than twice as expensive as ultrasound examination.

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^114QCH9i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

SAFETY OUTCOME ASSESSMENT

Safety reporting is commonly focused on the requirements of applicable regulatory bodies. However, studies should also strive to report safety outcomes in a manner that reflects the scientific and clinical conventions for the applicable disease area, ideally with the use of society-endorsed standardized definitions and reporting guidelines that can enable meaningful comparisons across studies. Advance consideration should be given to prespecifying, defining, and reporting the full range of safety events that may be expected to occur with a particular intervention. When no events occurred, this fact should be explicitly stated in reporting results. Given the variability in devices and treatments, the duration of follow-up may vary; in general, longer follow-up should be considered for devices that are intended for long-term implantation.

Any venous interventional procedure may be complicated by the development of thrombosis or bleeding. Symptomatic thrombosis can manifest as DVT, PE, both, or neither. DVT can be limited to a treated vein segment or can extend to involve additional segments and can lead to PE, PTS, or neither; PE can lead to right heart strain, hemodynamic compromise, death, or none of these consequences. Blood loss can be overt or occult and can result from device-related aspiration, device-related hemolysis, venous access site hemorrhage, vascular perforation or rupture, or development of a distant site of bleeding; concomitant anticoagulant and fibrinolytic drugs can contribute to the onset and severity of these events. Some bleeding events require blood transfusion or surgical or endovascular therapy to address. In reporting events, such details should be provided to enable their overall clinical impact to be discerned. To enable standardization of event reporting, guidelines have been developed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, the GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) investigators, and the Society of Interventional Radiology, among other bodies. – The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis scheme may be particularly applicable to VTE populations.

Safety events can be related to a specific device (eg, fracture of a stent), an overall endovascular treatment (eg, thrombosis of a venous segment treated with pharmacomechanical CDT followed by stent placement), associated treatments that were mandated by the protocol (eg, gastrointestinal bleed in a patient who was placed on antiplatelet therapy after stent placement), standard care (eg, subdural hematoma in a patient receiving anticoagulation for preexisting DVT), or none of these. Therefore, in reporting treatment-related events, investigators should provide the specific definition of relatedness that was used.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^1126xgss]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Values statement — The committee recognized the poor quality of evidence supporting several of the recommendations, particularly arising from the common use of surrogate end points and the sparse data demonstrating the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies on patient-important outcomes. The committee placed a relatively high value on preventing DVT and the postthrombotic syndrome, and in recommending the thrombolytic techniques over surgical thrombectomy, we placed a relatively high value on avoiding the potential complications of an infrequently performed surgical procedure. In recommending treatments for lesions uncovered by thrombus removal, we highly valued the avoidance of complications related to untreated iliac stenosis, and in recommending compression stockings, we considered this intervention to be relatively inexpensive, to not require expertise, and able to be applied on a large scale. Indirect evidence was occasionally used due to lack of more direct evidence. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate, and clinical judgment is of the utmost importance in such situations.

Introduction

Iliofemoral venous obstruction is a common condition that affects the deep veins of the pelvis and can lead to long-term disability - that is associated with impaired quality of life.- The obstruction may be caused by thrombotic (acute deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or chronic post-thrombotic scarring) or non-thrombotic pathologies, including compression from overlying structures such as the right common iliac artery, or a malignancy. Symptoms can vary and are largely dependent upon the cause, the extent of obstruction, and the duration of the disease.

Acute iliofemoral DVT usually causes severe pain, lower extremity swelling and can lead to life-threatening pulmonary embolism. In rare cases, it may also be limb-threatening. Incomplete resolution of the initial thrombus and the formation of scar tissue in the lumen of the vein more often, however, leads to chronic outflow obstruction resulting in venous hypertension and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Symptoms of PTS include pain, particularly on walking (venous claudication), swelling, skin changes, and in severe cases, venous ulceration. Similar signs and symptoms may also be observed in non-thrombotic causes of chronic outflow obstruction, and both are associated with a significant psychological and financial burden. -

Conservative treatment with anticoagulation and compression stockings alone may be insufficient to resolve severe symptoms, prevent recurrence, and avoid development of post-thrombotic syndrome. Therefore, in recent years, endovascular therapies have been proposed as a potential treatment for deep venous obstruction with balloon angioplasty and stenting. - Good outcomes have been reported in large case series of patients using re-purposed arterial stents, - however, concerns regarding complications such as stent migration, contralateral vein thrombosis caused by placement of the stent against the vessel wall of the inferior vena cava, and imprecise deployment systems, have led to the development of dedicated venous stent technology. A number of these devices have now become available worldwide, and while there have been some concerns raised about their migration and deployment mechanism leading to product recall in some instances, the use of this technology appears to be ever increasing.

A previous systematic review was carried out before the availability of these new technologiesand the present study aims to see if there has been a difference in 12-month outcomes following the introduction of the first-generation of dedicated venous stents.

Materials and methods

This study was approved by the institutional review board. Thirty-three consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed from 01/01/2012 to 01/01/2021. Inclusion criteria included those with symptomatic (for 14 days or less), unilateral, iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis who were treated with single-procedure therapy using the 8Fr rheolytic thrombectomy catheter. Exclusion criteria included any patients that demonstrated a contraindication to anticoagulation. Iliofemoral DVT was defined as thrombosis at minimum involving the common femoral vein and/or iliac veins, with involvement of ipsilateral femoropopliteal and tibioperoneal segments permitted. Involvement of the inferior vena cava to any significant degree (defined as over 2 cm) resulted in exclusion from this analysis. The extent of thrombus was determined on pre-intervention imaging using computed tomographic venography (CTV) for the iliac veins and venous duplex sonography for the infrainguinal deep veins (Fig. 1 A, B). Patients were excluded if they had any contraindications to anticoagulation.

The technique of venous stent placement

In contra-distinction to iliac or aortic work, where the common femoral artery is the most common route of access, the common femoral vein should best be avoided in all forms of pelvic venous or ilio-caval venous stent placement. This is because the disease process may often extend down close to the common femoral venous CFV puncture point; the worst-case situation is when a stent should ideally be placed across the actual CFV access point.

For acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, popliteal vein access is preferred. If thrombosed, we employ catheter-directed thrombolysis –or ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis. If the popliteal vein is open, a single session, mechanical or pharmaco-mechanical thrombectomy may be the best option (O'Sullivan). Following thrombus removal/dissolution, the proximal stenosis is uncovered; usually, this lesion requires stent placement.

### Anticoagulant treatment for isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iUCfA]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (IDDVT) refers to a lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that occurs below the knee (i.e. below the popliteal vein) in the absence of concomitant thrombosis in other venous districts and represents the most common site of DVT presentation in the lower limbs. With some interindividual variability, the distal deep veins of each leg, including the anterior and posterior tibial veins, the peroneal vein, and the muscular veins (soleus and gastrocnemius muscles), converge to form the trifurcation area, which drains into the popliteal vein. Due to its anatomical contiguity to the proximal deep veins and similar clinical features as proximal DVT, thrombosis at the level of the trifurcation is conventionally managed as proximal DVT. Although IDDVT has long been considered a benign condition, several studies have reported non-negligible rates of complications, including extension to the proximal veins, thrombosis recurrence, pulmonary embolism (PE), and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). These rates are particularly evident in high-risk subpopulations, such as patients with active cancer. A number of randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been carried out to compare different management strategies for IDDVT, but their findings have not always been consistent. This has led to substantially weak and variable recommendations from clinical guidelines and to heterogeneous management strategies in daily clinical practice.

To summarize the available evidence on anticoagulation for IDDVT, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCT and cohort studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant treatments, and assessed the incidence of relevant outcomes in relation to the use, dose and duration of anticoagulation.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.

### Interventional approaches to deep vein thrombosis [^112SSRMK]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen increased use of aggressive, catheter-based methods of treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this article, we outline the risks, benefits, and uncertainties surrounding endovascular DVT therapies, describe clinical situations in which endovascular treatment options should reasonably be considered, and update the reader on new outcome data that pertains to catheter-based DVT interventions. Endovascular thrombolytic therapy is reasonable to perform for selected patients with DVT causing acute limb-threatening circulatory compromise, acute inferior vena cava occlusion, or acute iliofemoral DVT for the purposes of limb salvage and relief of presenting DVT symptoms, and appears likely to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with proximal DVT. A multicenter randomized trial, the ATTRACT Study, is currently underway in the United States to determine whether pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) is sufficiently safe and effective to be recommended for routine use in proximal DVT patients. Selected patients with established moderate-to-severe PTS in association with an occluded iliac vein or a refluxing saphenous vein may also be amenable to endovascular intervention to reduce venous hypertension, alleviate symptoms, and improve limb function and quality of life. Pending the results of further studies, an individualized approach to patient selection for interventional DVT therapies is recommended.

Patient selection for stent placement — venous stent placement may be appropriate in highly selected symptomatic patients with chronic iliac vein obstruction but should be avoided in most patients who do not have all of the following: life interference of at least moderate severity attributable to venous disease; anatomic evidence of significant venous obstruction in the IVC, the iliac vein, or common femoral vein; good inflow to the common femoral vein from a patent femoral and/or deep femoral vein; and, when individualized risk indicates substantial stent thrombosis risk, the ability to receive long-term anticoagulation (Level of Evidence C, Strength of Recommendation Weak). The risk-benefit ratio has not been evaluated in well-designed multicenter randomized trials, and because available stents are permanent implants, it is important to avoid placements that do not provide durable patency and clinical benefits.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis of lower limb thrombosis [^115amWoZ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Late complications of thrombosis of the deep veins in the region between the popliteal vein termination and the confluence of the common iliac veins and inferior vena cava (suprapopliteal deep-vein thrombosis) are common and often unrecognized by those responsible for the initial management. Pharmacomechanical-assisted clearance of the thrombus at the time of first presentation provides the best opportunity for complete recovery with preservation of normal venous valve function and avoidance of recurrent deep-vein thrombosis and postthrombotic syndrome. Recent interventional radiology methods provide for rapid and complete thrombolysis even in some patients in whom thrombolysis was previously considered contraindicated. This review describes the methods, safety, and efficacy of acute interventional treatment of suprapopliteal deep-vein thrombosis.

### Investigating the necessity of bilateral common femoral vein ultrasound in patients with unilateral symptomatic deep venous thrombosis [^11522H43]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: In patients with unilateral symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (DVT), we observed no thrombus occurrence in the contralateral common femoral vein.
- **Take Home Message**: Patients with unilateral symptomatic DVT may not need a venous duplex ultrasound examination in the contralateral common femoral vein. A single-extremity study will suffice in most cases and, if implemented, will improve vascular laboratory efficiency without a decline in DVT detection.

Nine hundred thousand people in the United States are diagnosed with a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) per year. If left untreated, 1 in 10 people with a DVT will develop a pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially life-threatening complication. Therefore, a quick and accurate diagnosis of DVT is needed. Venous duplex ultrasound (VDUS) tests are accepted as the initial imaging study to rule out lower extremity DVT in patients with suggestive symptoms such as pain and swelling. VDUS tests are noninvasive and have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.

To maintain the accuracy of imaging tests like VDUS, the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission (IAC) accredits and provides testing standards and performance criteria for noninvasive imaging at vascular laboratories. To be accredited by the IAC, some vascular laboratories, including ours, are required to scan the asymptomatic contralateral common femoral veins (CFVs) in patients presenting with unilateral lower extremity DVT symptoms. The presumed rationale behind this recommendation is to ensure that there is no proximal DVT in the asymptomatic contralateral limb. To our knowledge and experience, it is extraordinarily rare to diagnose any abnormality in the asymptomatic contralateral CFV. Moreover, performing a bilateral VDUS when it is not indicated clinically decreases efficacy, increases costs, and negatively affects vascular laboratory workflow.

Thus, our study aimed to investigate the necessity and utility of scanning the contralateral CFV in symptomatic patients undergoing a unilateral lower extremity VDUS test to rule out DVT by (1) defining the prevalence of DVT or other abnormalities in the contralateral asymptomatic limb and (2) identifying risk factors to help identify the population predisposed to the development of DVT in the asymptomatic limb.

### Deep venous thrombosis post mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke [^114Tk48s]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 20s presented with neck pain, slurred speech and left-sided weakness. She successfully underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for total occlusion of the basilar artery and made full neurological recovery. Initial ultrasound Doppler of legs (USDL) did not show any deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, 2days later, a repeat USDL revealed an extensive proximal DVT in the right common femoral vein. CT scan confirmed a haematoma arising from the femoral access site causing compression of the adjacent common femoral vein. This may have initiated DVT formation or exacerbated extension of a previously undetected DVT. Echocardiogram revealed a patent foramen ovale. As the patient was asymptomatic, delayed or missed diagnosis of DVT would have put her at risk of life-threatening pulmonary embolism or further strokes. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion of DVT as a direct procedural complication from MT so treatment can be initiated promptly.

### Delphi consensus on reporting standards in clinical studies for endovascular treatment of acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis and chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction [^111mXuXL]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Second, Duplex ultrasound is well suited to visualize thrombus in the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. However, this modality is operator dependent, and reproducibility of assessments is a concern, especially given the length of the femoral vein and the varying distributions of thrombus and venous flow obstruction that may exist. In general, adherence to the technical standards for the performance and interpretation of venous Duplex ultrasound that were created by the International Accreditation Coalition and the American College of Radiology is likely to support consistent exam quality. A proactive plan for the core laboratory to review studies as they are submitted and retrain site technical staff as needed will also be helpful for many studies. The published literature currently suffers from a lack of standardization in venous ultrasound outcome reporting. For example, some studies have evaluated whether veins are completely compressible (free of thrombus) while others have evaluated for the presence of Doppler flow (which can exist even with substantial residual thrombus). While both parameters may be relevant, this variance precludes easy comparison of the results of different studies. In early VTE treatment studies, the development of thrombus involving > 10 cm vein length or a change in residual vein diameter ≥ 4 mm during anteroposterior transducer compression correlated with symptomatic recurrent DVT events. – In other studies, clinical patency constructs have been used in which patency was assumed if the patient did not present with recurrent symptoms. The panel strongly discourages assignment of patency to any vein that was not evaluated by imaging. Adjudication of imaging studies by blinded core laboratory personnel will help to minimize bias in outcome assessment.

Third, a central challenge is the absence of any well-validated, widely available venous physiological test. Although Duplex ultrasound is effective in evaluating the presence and duration of venous valvular reflux in individual veins, its ability to provide overall hemodynamic assessment of the limb is limited. Direct intravenous pressure measurements are rarely helpful because catheterized patients are generally supine, a position in which the hemodynamic and clinical alterations of venous disease are minimized. Although a resting supine mean venous pressure gradient of 4 mm is usually associated with clinically meaningful hemodynamic impairment, such patients almost always have clear venographic features of obstruction such as tight stenosis and robust filling of collateral veins.– Pressure measurements are insensitive; many patients with symptomatic venous disease exhibit mean pressure gradients below 4 mm Hg. Plethysmography has historically been used to provide detailed physiological venous assessments, but few vascular laboratories now routinely conduct these studies. – Development and validation of new tools that are easy to use and that enable accurate and reliable measurement of venous obstruction and overall venous function should be prioritized.

### Thrombolytic strategies versus standard anticoagulation for acute deep vein thrombosis of the lower limb [^117Wfe2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Standard treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) aims to reduce immediate complications. Use of thrombolytic clot removal strategies (i.e. thrombolysis (clot dissolving drugs), with or without additional endovascular techniques), could reduce the long-term complications of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) including pain, swelling, skin discolouration, or venous ulceration in the affected leg. This is the fourth update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thrombolytic clot removal strategies and anticoagulation compared to anticoagulation alone for the management of people with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and AMED and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registries to 21 April 2020. We also checked the references of relevant articles to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining thrombolysis (with or without adjunctive clot removal strategies) and anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone for acute DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in included trials with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Certainty of the evidence was evaluated using GRADE. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We pooled data using a fixed-effect model, unless we identified heterogeneity, in which case we used a random-effects model. The primary outcomes of interest were clot lysis, bleeding and post thrombotic syndrome.

Main Results

Two new studies were added for this update. Therefore, the review now includes a total of 19 RCTs, with 1943 participants. These studies differed with respect to the thrombolytic agent, the doses of the agent and the techniques used to deliver the agent. Systemic, loco-regional and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) strategies were all included. For this update, CDT interventions also included those involving pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Three of the 19 included studies reported one or more domain at high risk of bias. We combined the results as any (all) thrombolysis interventions compared to standard anticoagulation. Complete clot lysis occurred more frequently in the thrombolysis group at early follow-up (RR 4.75; 95% CI 1.83 to 12.33; 592 participants; eight studies) and at intermediate follow-up (RR 2.42; 95% CI 1.42 to 4.12; 654 participants; seven studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Two studies reported on clot lysis at late follow-up with no clear benefit from thrombolysis seen at this time point (RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.17 to 62.63; two studies). No differences between strategies (e.g. systemic, loco-regional and CDT) were detected by subgroup analysis at any of these time points (tests for subgroup differences: P = 0.41, P = 0.37 and P = 0.06 respectively). Those receiving thrombolysis had increased bleeding complications (6.7% versus 2.2%) (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.78; 1943 participants, 19 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). No differences between strategies were detected by subgroup analysis (P = 0.25). Up to five years after treatment, slightly fewer cases of PTS occurred in those receiving thrombolysis; 50% compared with 53% in the standard anticoagulation (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.93; 1393 participants, six studies; moderate-certainty evidence). This was still observed at late follow-up (beyond five years) in two studies (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.73; 211 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We used subgroup analysis to investigate if the level of DVT (iliofemoral, femoropopliteal or non-specified) had an effect on the incidence of PTS. No benefit of thrombolysis was seen for either iliofemoral or femoropopliteal DVT (six studies; test for subgroup differences: P = 0.29). Systemic thrombolysis and CDT had similar levels of effectiveness. Studies of CDT included four trials in femoral and iliofemoral DVT, and results from these are consistent with those from trials of systemic thrombolysis in DVT at other levels of occlusion.

Authors' Conclusions

Complete clot lysis occurred more frequently after thrombolysis (with or without additional clot removal strategies) and PTS incidence was slightly reduced. Bleeding complications also increased with thrombolysis, but this risk has decreased over time with the use of stricter exclusion criteria of studies. Evidence suggests that systemic administration of thrombolytics and CDT have similar effectiveness. Using GRADE, we judged the evidence to be of moderate-certainty, due to many trials having small numbers of participants or events, or both. Future studies are needed to investigate treatment regimes in terms of agent, dose and adjunctive clot removal methods; prioritising patient-important outcomes, including PTS and quality of life, to aid clinical decision making.

Early thrombus removal strategies — diagnostic evaluation: We recommend use of precise anatomic terminology to characterize the most proximal extent of venous thrombosis as involving the iliofemoral veins, with or without extension into the inferior vena cava; the femoropopliteal veins; or isolated to the calf veins in preference to simple characterization of a thrombosis as proximal or distal. If iliofemoral venous thrombosis is suspected but not confirmed using standard diagnostic modalities such as venous ultrasound imaging, we recommend the use of adjunctive imaging modalities, such as computed tomography venography or magnetic resonance venography to characterize the most proximal thrombus extent.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^115YsqY4]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis — indications for early thrombus removal (section 2.1): We suggest a strategy of early thrombus removal in selected patients meeting the following criteria: (a) a first episode of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis, (b) symptoms < 14 days in duration, (c) a low risk of bleeding, and (d) ambulatory with good functional capacity and an acceptable life expectancy (Grade 2C). Overall, the quality of evidence supporting early thrombus removal strategies is very low (Grade C). Among patients enrolled in the National Venous Registry, those with chronic symptoms, femoropopliteal DVT, and symptoms > 10 days in duration had significantly worse outcomes than those with a first episode of acute iliofemoral DVT of < 10 days in duration. Other guidelines have suggested that DVT associated with symptoms present for ≤ 14 days be considered acute, and a recently published randomized trial included patients with symptoms of < 21 days. On balance, recommendations for consideration of early thrombus removal strategies in patients with symptoms of < 14 days of duration would seem fairly secure, although a benefit in patients with a duration of symptoms of > 14 days cannot be excluded and the relative benefits vs risks in such patients should be considered on an individualized basis. A decision analysis evaluating systemic streptokinase in the treatment of DVT suggests that patients would be unlikely to accept more than a 1.7-fold increase in major bleeding compared with heparin therapy, and on this basis of individual variation in values and preferences, strategies of early thrombus removal should be considered a Grade 2 recommendation; recommendation of a strategy of early thrombus removal requires a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits for the individual patient and a careful discussion with the patient.

### Benefit of anticoagulation for the treatment of lower extremity superficial venous thrombosis [^112pSsoR]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) of the lower extremity is an acute disorder characterized by thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins. This most commonly affects varicose veins but can also occur in patients with nonvaricose veins, who may have an underlying condition such as a malignant disease or thrombophilia. It is important to be aware that SVT confers a significant risk for the development of the more serious and debilitating condition of deep venous thrombosis and the potentially life-threatening condition of pulmonary embolism. Recognition of SVT, determination of appropriateness of therapy, and institution of timely therapy are paramount to prevention of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in properly selected patients. The objective of this evidence-based summary was to provide clinically applicable information from the current literature and guidelines regarding the best treatment options for SVT. There are no randomized trials that compare the efficacy and outcomes of newer therapies, such as the novel oral anticoagulants and endovenous ablation, with traditional therapies, such as traditional anticoagulant and surgery exclusion, in the treatment of SVT.

### Imaging of deep venous pathology [^112GzsPR]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

While studies on the comparison of imaging techniques after intervention are virtually non-existent, DUS offers a good starting point to evaluate the patency of the venous system after interventions. Both in- and outflow through (central) venous stents as well as lumen patency of the deep vein system of the leg can routinely (and serially) be performed with DUS. (Figs. 1, 2, 3).

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^116fSSds]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Coronary angiojet catheterization for the management of dural venous sinus thrombosis. technical note [^114oSwCt]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

In most cases of deep venous sinus thrombosis, systemic anticoagulation represents the initial treatment of choice for preventing propagation of a clot in the dural sinuses. In patients with deep or extensive venous sinus thrombosis, a combination of treatment modalities may be required including systemic anticoagulation, selective venous thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy. In the current study the authors report on a patient who presented with the acute onset of headache, vomiting, a depressed level of consciousness, and a left hemiparesis and in whom a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion was initially diagnosed. Results of diagnostic cerebral angiography demonstrated a patent right MCA and a deep venous sinus thrombosis involving most of the dural sinuses. Despite adequate systemic heparinization, the patient's neurological condition deteriorated and direct administration of alteplase into the transverse sinus in conjunction with mechanical clot disruption using a coronary AngioJet was required. Venous flow was successfully reestablished in the deep and superficial venous sinuses by using a 0.014-in exchange wire routed from the right common femoral vein through the sinuses and out the left common femoral vein. Excellent angiographic results were obtained, and the patient had recovered completely by the 7-month follow up.

Deep and perforating venous anatomy and nomenclature — femoral vein terminology and connections: Deep veins accompany the main arteries of the limb and pelvis; the deep veins of the calf (anterior, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins) are paired, and the popliteal and femoral veins may also be paired. The gastrocnemius and soleal veins are important deep tributaries. The old term superficial femoral vein has been replaced by the new term femoral vein, and the femoral vein connects the popliteal to the common femoral vein. The pelvic veins include the external, internal, and common iliac veins, which drain into the inferior vena cava (IVC), with large gonadal veins draining into the IVC on the right and the left renal vein on the left. Perforating veins connect the superficial to the deep venous system, passing through the deep fascia; communicating veins connect veins within the same system, and the most important leg perforating veins are the medial calf perforators.
