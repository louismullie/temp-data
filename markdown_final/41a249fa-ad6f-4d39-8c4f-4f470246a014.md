## Question

what is secondary work up for osteoporosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the secondary workup for osteoporosis entails. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale and epidemiology that justify a secondary evaluation. Then, I should determine who warrants a basic versus advanced workup. Next, I will structure the history and examination to guide testing, define a universal initial lab panel, and map targeted tests based on clinical clues. After that, I will verify spine imaging for occult vertebral fractures and clarify DXA strategy and interpretation nuances. Finally, I will synthesize management pathways depending on whether a secondary cause is found, and I will correct the truncated section by explicitly outlining the approach when no secondary cause is identified.

> Let me first confirm why a secondary evaluation matters. Secondary contributors are common and often modifiable, particularly in men and premenopausal women, and failure to identify them can blunt response to anti-osteoporosis drugs, so addressing the underlying driver is foundational to optimal outcomes [^1156gQuy].

> I need to check which patients should undergo secondary workup. A universal baseline evaluation is appropriate in all patients with a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis or a fragility fracture and in those for whom pharmacotherapy is being initiated, while an expanded evaluation is especially indicated in men under 50, premenopausal women, individuals with Z-scores ≤ −2.0, those with atypical fractures for bone density, or an unexpectedly poor response to therapy, and in older patients lacking classic risk factors, aligning with guideline recommendations to assess secondary causes before or alongside treatment decisions [^1156gQuy] [^113dmLMe] [^116ZJjaF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before testing; a careful history and examination often narrow the differential and improve yield. I should confirm medication exposures such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants; screen for endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematologic, rheumatologic, renal or hepatic disorders; quantify alcohol and tobacco use; and elicit falls and fracture history, menstrual or menopausal details in women, and symptoms of hypogonadism in men, while on exam documenting height loss, kyphosis, BMI, features of Cushing's, signs of hypogonadism, and frailty or gait impairment, as emphasized in Endocrine Society and CMAJ guidance [^114TKhem] [^115XtCQ6] [^111uZcTL].

> Next, I should review a high-yield universal laboratory panel and verify its components. I will obtain serum calcium corrected for albumin, phosphate, creatinine with eGFR, liver enzymes, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH, a complete blood count, and a 24-hour urine calcium; in men, I should add a morning total testosterone with reflex LH, FSH, SHBG, and prolactin if low, noting that a simple panel of calcium, PTH, and urinary calcium can detect the majority of occult skeletal disorders in otherwise healthy women and that vitamin D should be targeted to at least 30 ng/mL in patients with osteoporosis [^113pruiz] [^111UBTm6] [^1113qXWH] [^115Nrp3r].

> Wait, let me verify the indications for supplementary tests triggered by clinical clues, because indiscriminate panels reduce value. If hypercalcemia with non-suppressed PTH suggests primary hyperparathyroidism, I should repeat calcium and PTH and proceed with localization as appropriate; if malabsorption or autoimmune features are present, I should check tissue transglutaminase antibodies for celiac disease; if myeloma is suspected, I will order SPEP with free light chains and UPEP; if iatrogenic or endogenous Cushing's is suspected, I will measure 24-hour urinary free cortisol or perform a 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test; if thyroid disease is suspected, I should add free T4; and if male hypogonadism is suspected or an initial low testosterone is found, I should repeat a morning testosterone, add SHBG, and assess LH and prolactin to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism, consistent with Endocrine Society and EAA guidance and the role of glucocorticoids in secondary bone loss [^115Z7vSd] [^115Nrp3r] [^112MATPR] [^115Z7vSd] [^111UPR6V].

> I will now examine the role of vertebral imaging, because silent vertebral fractures reclassify risk and influence therapy. Let me first confirm that vertebral fracture assessment by DXA or lateral spine radiographs is recommended when there is osteoporosis or osteopenia with clinical suspicion such as height loss, glucocorticoid use, or age-related risk, given its impact on diagnosis and treatment thresholds in multiple guidelines [^111eSY7J] [^112dWsGE] [^112YkSr8].

> Next, I should review the bone density measurement strategy and interpretation nuances. Standard DXA sites are the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, with distal one-third radius added when hip or spine cannot be interpreted or in hyperparathyroidism; Z-scores are used in men under 50 and premenopausal women, whereas T-scores apply to postmenopausal women and men 50 and older; in men, densitometric diagnosis should use a female reference database; and TBS or FRAX may be considered to complement BMD, noting disease-specific limitations and adjustments in some secondary conditions [^1173qMNv] [^1131ycLw] [^112XDq6G] [^111VR2ML] [^1156gQuy].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring intervals and the purpose of repeat testing. Repeat DXA is typically performed every 1 to 2 years until results are stable, with intervals individualized by age, baseline BMD, therapy type, and factors associated with rapid change such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, malabsorption, or systemic inflammation, and follow-up should be timed when results are likely to change management and should prompt re-evaluation if changes are outside expected ranges [^1173qMNv] [^115ceMto].

> Let me synthesize management when a secondary cause is identified, because treating the driver can improve skeletal outcomes. If hyperparathyroidism is confirmed, parathyroid surgery may be indicated; if hypogonadism is verified, address and treat per guideline and re-assess BMD; if celiac disease is diagnosed, institute a gluten-free diet and correct deficiencies; if glucocorticoids are necessary, optimize the lowest effective dose and institute bone-protective therapy as indicated; after correcting the secondary process, I should reassess BMD in 6 to 12 months and continue or escalate anti-osteoporosis therapy if fracture risk remains high, incorporating sex-specific recommendations such as sequential anabolic-to-antiresorptive therapy in very high-risk men [^1156gQuy] [^111UPR6V] [^112MkeNB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I notice that the original trace cut off at "If no secondary cause found" and did not complete the thought; let me correct that and make it explicit. If no secondary cause is found after an appropriate evaluation, I should proceed with standard osteoporosis risk stratification using BMD, clinical risk factors, FRAX with consideration of TBS where applicable, ensure calcium and vitamin D adequacy, implement fall-risk mitigation, and initiate pharmacotherapy according to guideline thresholds and risk categories, with consideration of anabolic therapies for very high-risk phenotypes or parenteral options when oral therapy is not feasible, and arrange follow-up DXA as above [^112YkSr8] [^111rPDs3] [^113QiCgQ].

> I should double-check implementation pitfalls, because missed evaluations are common and quality systems improve care. Primary care cohorts often show incomplete secondary workups despite clear indications, while fracture liaison services and integrated models markedly increase secondary screening and treatment initiation after fractures; therefore, referral to an osteoporosis specialist should be considered when evaluation is uncertain, comorbidities complicate management, or adverse effects arise from therapy [^112TxgpD] [^112jViW2] [^1151q9st] [^115XBqWG].

Secondary workup for osteoporosis is a **targeted evaluation** to identify underlying causes of bone loss, guided by history [^114TKhem], exam, and initial labs [^111UBTm6]. It includes a **core lab panel** (CBC, CMP, 25(OH)D [^111x2JTt], PTH, TSH, testosterone in men, 24-hour urine calcium) [^111UBTm6] [^113pruiz] and selective tests (serum/urine protein electrophoresis, cortisol, celiac serology, prolactin, LH/FSH, ESR/CRP) [^115Z7vSd] based on clinical suspicion. Imaging [^112dWsGE] (vertebral fracture assessment [^111eSY7J], lateral spine X-rays, forearm DXA [^1131ycLw], bone scan, MRI) is used when indicated, and referral to endocrinology or rheumatology [^113Y72hx] is recommended for complex or unclear cases [^1151q9st].

---

## Clinical indications for secondary workup

A **secondary evaluation** is indicated [^116ZJjaF] for patients with osteoporosis who have:

- **Fragility fractures**, especially in premenopausal women or men under 50 years [^1156gQuy].
- **Z-score ≤ -2.0**, suggesting bone loss below expected for age [^1156gQuy].
- **Atypical fractures** or **rapid bone loss** [^113rdqfV].
- **Refractory osteoporosis** or **poor response to therapy** [^113rdqfV].
- **Clinical suspicion of secondary causes** based on history or exam [^114TKhem].

---

## Core laboratory tests

A **standard initial laboratory panel** [^111UBTm6] should be obtained for all patients with osteoporosis to screen for common secondary causes [^111x2JTt]:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| CBC | Anemia, malignancy, chronic disease |
| CMP | Calcium, phosphate, creatinine, liver function |
| 25(OH)D | Vitamin D deficiency |
| PTH | Hyperparathyroidism |
| TSH | Hyperthyroidism |
| Testosterone (men) | Hypogonadism |
| 24-hour urine calcium | Hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism |

---

## Additional laboratory tests based on clinical suspicion

Additional tests should be guided by **clinical suspicion** and **initial results** [^115Z7vSd]:

- **Serum/urine protein electrophoresis**: Multiple myeloma [^115Z7vSd].
- **Cortisol**: Cushing's syndrome [^1156gQuy].
- **Celiac serology**: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies.
- **Prolactin, LH, FSH**: Hypogonadism [^115Nrp3r].
- **ESR/CRP**: Inflammatory disorders [^1156gQuy].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging studies are essential to **detect fractures** and **assess bone quality** [^112dWsGE]:

- **Vertebral fracture assessment**: DXA-based [^111eSY7J].
- **Lateral spine X-rays**: Vertebral fractures [^111mHFqo].
- **Forearm DXA**: Hyperparathyroidism, androgen deprivation therapy [^1131ycLw].
- **Bone scan/MRI**: Suspected malignancy or atypical fractures [^112dWsGE].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** should include a detailed **history** of medications, chronic diseases, alcohol and tobacco use, falls, fractures, and family history, along with a focused **physical exam** assessing height loss, kyphosis, balance, mobility, and frailty [^114TKhem].

---

## Referral to specialists

Referral to **endocrinology** or **rheumatology** [^113Y72hx] is recommended for complex cases, when secondary causes remain unclear, or when comorbidities complicate management or adverse effects from pharmacotherapy occur [^1151q9st].

---

Secondary workup for osteoporosis is a **structured approach** combining labs, imaging, and clinical assessment to identify and treat underlying causes, **improving outcomes and reducing fracture risk** [^116ZJjaF].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteoporosis and bone mineral density: 2022 update [^112dWsGE]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

Osteoporosis constitutes a significant public health risk. An estimated 10.2 million adults in the United States over 50 years of age have osteoporosis, a systemic condition that weakens the bones, increasing susceptibility to fractures. Approximately one-half of women and nearly one-third of men over 50 years of age will sustain an osteoporotic fracture. These fractures are associated with a decrease in quality of life, diminished physical function, and reduced independence.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary imaging modality used to screen for osteoporosis in women over 65 years of age and men over 70 years of age. DXA may be used in patients under 65 years of age to evaluate bone mass density if there are additional risk factors. In certain situations, vertebral fracture assessment and trabecular bone score may further predict fracture risk, particularly in patients who are not yet osteoporotic but are in the range of osteopenia. Quantitative CT is useful in patients with advanced degenerative changes in the spine.

Given the proven efficacy of pharmacologic therapy, the role of imaging to appropriately identify and monitor high-risk individuals is critical in substantially reducing osteoporosis-associated morbidity and mortality, as well as reducing the considerable cost to the healthcare system. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed sources.

### Secondary osteoporosis [^1156gQuy]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a global public health problem, with fractures contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Although postmenopausal osteoporosis is most common, up to 30% of postmenopausal women, more than 50% of premenopausal women, and between 50% and 80% of men have secondary osteoporosis. Exclusion of secondary causes is important, as treatment often begins by addressing the underlying condition. These causes are varied but often neglected, ranging from endocrine to chronic inflammatory and genetic conditions.

General screening is recommended for all patients with osteoporosis. Advanced investigations are reserved for premenopausal women, men aged under 50 years, older patients without classical osteoporosis risk factors, and all patients with the lowest bone mass (Z-score ≤ -2). The response of secondary osteoporosis to conventional anti-osteoporosis therapy may be inadequate if the underlying condition is unrecognized and untreated. Bone densitometry, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, may underestimate fracture risk in some chronic diseases, including glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, and may overestimate fracture risk in others, such as Turner syndrome.

FRAX and trabecular bone score may provide additional information regarding fracture risk in secondary osteoporosis, but their use is limited to adults aged 40 years and older and 50 years and older, respectively. Additionally, FRAX requires adjustment in some chronic conditions, such as glucocorticoid use, type 2 diabetes, and HIV.

### Osteoporosis [^115kSiGJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. Evidence-based screening strategies improve the identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fractures. In addition, careful consideration of when pharmacotherapy should be started, choice of medication, and duration of treatment maximizes the benefits of fracture prevention while minimizing the potential harms of long-term drug exposure.

### Bone densitometry and the diagnosis of osteoporosis [^1135NFgC]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, bone density scanning has become an essential part of evaluating patients at risk of osteoporosis. Although dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the technique most associated with the recent growth in bone densitometry, several innovative devices for performing measurements at sites in the peripheral skeleton are also available. This article examines the question of whether there is any one method or measurement site that performs better than all the others at identifying patients at risk of fracture.

Given the necessity to employ small, low-cost peripheral devices in identifying and treating the many millions of women most at risk, what approaches to the interpretation of bone density scans can be adopted to ensure the greatest degree of consistency among different methods? Finally, does it matter if the imperfect correlation among different types of measurement results in different patients being selected for treatment on the basis of different techniques?

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline No. 1 [^117LQgH8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for the prevention, screening, and diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

The target population includes postmenopausal patients without identified risk factors for fracture, low bone mineral density, or secondary osteoporosis related to medication or a medical condition.

- **Methods**: This guideline was developed using an a priori protocol in conjunction with a writing team. The team consisted of two specialists in obstetrics and gynecology appointed by the ACOG Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines-Gynecology and one external subject matter expert. ACOG medical librarians completed a comprehensive literature search for primary literature within the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, and MEDLINE. Studies that advanced to the full-text screening stage were assessed by two authors from the writing team using standardized inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies underwent quality assessment, and a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) evidence-to-decision framework was applied to interpret and translate the evidence into recommendation statements.

- **Recommendations**: This Clinical Practice Guideline includes updated recommendations on the role of exercise, calcium, and vitamin D in osteoporosis prevention; osteoporosis screening and diagnosis; rescreening intervals; and interventions to prevent falls. Recommendations are classified by strength and evidence quality. Ungraded Good Practice Points are included to provide additional guidance.

### Clinical use of bone densitometry: Clinical applications [^1122YLZt]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis represents a difficult problem for physicians because, although many diagnostic tests are available, interpreting their results is not straightforward. As a result, many patients, even those with clear indications such as long-term steroid therapy or vertebral fractures on radiography, do not get screened or treated.

Evidence-based guidelines recommend screening for all white women older than 65 years who are not already receiving osteoporosis treatment and for many nonwhite women. For postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have strong risk factors for osteoporosis, screening may also be beneficial. The optimal testing strategy depends on what is available locally. The best role for follow-up testing is still being defined, and interpretation of such testing is tricky. Reports of results can be difficult to understand; however, a randomized controlled trial of clearer reports increased testing and decreased confusion about the meaning of test results.

Densitometry might be more effectively used in practice if strategies such as having patients fill out a short questionnaire to assess risk factors or creating a nurse-based system were used to identify patients. Clinicians need better approaches for identifying patients most likely to benefit from screening, systems that facilitate their application, and test results that are easy to interpret.

### Clinical characteristics and medication use among premenopausal women with osteoporosis and low BMD: The experience of an osteoporosis referral center [^115thu9o]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is uncommon in premenopausal women, and most cases have a secondary cause. Women with osteoporosis and no known secondary cause are said to have idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP). We aimed to estimate the proportion of premenopausal women seen in our referral center with IOP as opposed to secondary osteoporosis, to describe their clinical characteristics, to compare women with a low-trauma fracture history with those with low bone mineral density (BMD) alone, and to estimate the frequency of bisphosphonate use.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical records from all premenopausal women evaluated for osteoporosis or low BMD in our center during 2005. We included premenopausal women diagnosed on the basis of low-trauma fracture, low BMD (Z score ≤ -2.0 or T score ≤ -2.5), or both.

- **Results**: Among these patients (n = 61; mean age 37 ± 8), 57 (93%) were Caucasian, 34 (57%) had a family history of osteoporosis, and 26 (43%) had used bisphosphonates. The most common secondary causes were amenorrhea (34%, n = 21), anorexia nervosa (16%, n = 10), and glucocorticoid exposure (13%, n = 8). After exclusion of secondary causes, 39% (24 of 61) of the entire group and 48% (14 of 29) of the fracture group were thought to have IOP. Women with a known secondary cause had lower BMD Z scores at the spine and hip than those with IOP. Women with low BMD and no fractures had shorter stature and weighed less than those with fractures, but overall differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Bisphosphonates had been prescribed for 38% (11 of 29) of women.

### Yield of laboratory testing to identify secondary contributors to osteoporosis in otherwise healthy women [^113pruiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

Our purpose in this study was to determine the prevalence of undetected disorders of bone and mineral metabolism in women with osteoporosis and to identify the most useful and cost-efficient screening tests to detect these disorders. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 664 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at the Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Disease Program at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York between January 1992 and June 1996.

Women without a history of diseases or medications known to adversely affect bone who completed extensive laboratory testing — including complete blood count, chemistry profile, 24-hour urinary calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and PTH — were included. Among the 173 women who met the inclusion criteria for the study, previously undiagnosed disorders of bone and mineral metabolism were identified in 55 women (32%). Disorders of calcium metabolism and hyperparathyroidism were the most frequent diagnoses.

A testing strategy involving measurement of 24-hour urine calcium, serum calcium, and serum PTH for all women and serum TSH among women on thyroid replacement therapy would have been sufficient to diagnose 47 of these 55 women (85%) at an estimated cost of $75 per patient screened. Previously undiagnosed disorders affecting the skeleton are common in otherwise healthy women with low bone density. A simple testing strategy is likely to identify most such disorders.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, the AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a baseline axial DEXA scan (lumbar spine, hip, and 1/3 radius if indicated) and repeating it every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining a 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine or hip is not evaluable, or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. It should be considered to repeat every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval based on clinical circumstances.

### Bone mineral measurements [^114SGSuc]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The accurate measurement of bone mineral density using noninvasive methods can be valuable in detecting and evaluating primary and secondary causes of decreased bone mass, including primary osteoporosis and secondary disorders like hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, multiple myeloma, diffuse metastases, and glucocorticoid therapy or intrinsic excess. By far, the largest patient population is encompassed by primary osteoporosis with increased susceptibility to fractures in the absence of other recognizable causes of bone loss.

Primary osteoporosis is a common clinical disorder and a major public health problem due to the significant number of related bone fractures occurring annually. As bone mineral density falls, the risk of vertebral and femoral neck fractures rises dramatically; therefore, fracture risk in individual patients may be estimated. Additionally, in estrogen-deficient women, bone mineral density values may be used to make rational decisions about hormone replacement therapy or other bone mineral therapies and to assess the success of such treatment in follow-ups.

In this article, we discuss different methods of bone densitometry and focus on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), highlighting the factors that should be considered for interpreting a DXA scan.

### Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^111UPR6V]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis:

- **Definition**: Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is a form of secondary osteoporosis that is associated with the use of corticosteroids.

- **Pathophysiology**: Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone loss secondary to direct and indirect effects of corticosteroids on bone remodeling.

- **Epidemiology**: The annual incidence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in patients who initiated corticosteroids within the last 6 months is 5.1% and 2.5%, respectively. For patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy (≥ 6 months), the corresponding figures are 3.2% and 3.0%.

- **Disease course**: Bone loss results from corticosteroid-mediated increases in the expression of RANK ligand, which leads to increases in the number of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Indirect effects of corticosteroids also include decreased renal calcium reabsorption, lower sex steroid hormone levels, and increased PTH activity, which predispose patients to osteonecrosis and fractures.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of fracture decreases by 29% after 2–6 months of corticosteroid discontinuation and becomes similar to non-corticosteroid users by 12 months.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention in Canada: 2023 update [^1151q9st]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for osteoporosis in men, the OC 2023 guidelines specifically recommend consulting with a healthcare professional with expertise in osteoporosis, such as a family physician, general internist, endocrinologist, rheumatologist, or geriatrician, when uncertainty exists about fracture risk or treatment. This includes situations with possible secondary causes of osteoporosis, comorbidities complicating management, and important adverse effects from pharmacotherapy.

### Secondary causes of osteoporosis [^11349G49]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

To provide an updated review of several causes of secondary osteoporosis as well as screening recommendations for these disorders, we conducted an updated review of the literature published since 2006. This information has been integrated with data published between 1990 and 2006, included in our prior review from 2006. This review also includes recent clinical guideline recommendations.

Secondary osteoporosis occurs in almost two-thirds of men, more than half of premenopausal women, and about 30% of postmenopausal women. Its causes are vast, including hypogonadism, medications, hyperthyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, primary hyperparathyroidism, solid organ transplantation, gastrointestinal diseases, hematologic diseases, Cushing's syndrome, and idiopathic hypercalciuria. These causes have their own pathogenesis, epidemiologic features, and effects on the skeleton.

The causes of secondary osteoporosis are numerous. Understanding their characteristics with respect to bone density and potential fracture risk is essential in managing osteoporosis. A heightened awareness of the possibility of their existence is necessary to provide optimal care.

### Evidence-based guideline for the management of osteoporosis in men [^1113cd3n]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Historically, osteoporosis has been viewed as a disease of women, with research, trials of interventions, and guidelines predominantly focused as such. It is apparent, however, that this condition causes a substantial health burden in men also, and that its assessment and management must be addressed across both sexes. In this article, an international multidisciplinary working group of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, and Musculoskeletal Diseases presents GRADE-assessed recommendations for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of osteoporosis in men. The recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of the latest research related to diagnostic and screening approaches for osteoporosis and its associated high fracture risk in men, covering disease burden, appropriate interpretation of bone densitometry (including the use of a female reference database for densitometric diagnosis in men) and absolute fracture risk, thresholds for treatment, and interventions that can be used therapeutically and their health economic evaluation. Future work should specifically address the efficacy of anti-osteoporosis medications, including denosumab and bone-forming therapies.

### Timing the scan: Optimizing screening for osteoporosis and risk of fracture in celiac disease [^112m6fV5]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with celiac disease (CeD) have an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures, but the ideal timing for bone mineral density (BMD) assessment remains unclear due to conflicting recommendations. This study evaluated the optimal timing for Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) screening, considering different clinical targets: early detection of BMD alterations, osteoporosis diagnosis, or fracture risk stratification.

- **Methods**: An observational study prospectively enrolled 627 CeD patients over 25 years old who underwent DXA scans of the lumbar spine and hip as part of standard care. Data on clinical presentation, serology, histology, and fracture risk were analyzed. Logistic regression identified risk factors for low BMD and osteoporosis. The reliability of the National Osteoporosis Guidelines Group (NOGG) guidelines for avoiding unnecessary DXAs was assessed.

- **Results**: Low BMD for age was present in 17.2% of patients, with significant prevalence in the 25–34 age group (13.4%), increasing further in the 45–54 age group. Osteoporosis was detected in 17.9% of patients, with prevalence increasing significantly in patients over 45 years of age. Risk factors included weight loss, underweight status, and iron-deficiency anemia. Using the NOGG criteria, 67% of patients could have avoided DXA, with a 0.5% risk of missing clinically significant findings requiring treatment while also losing 15.7% of patients with low BMD for age.

- **Conclusions**: The ideal timing for DXA screening in CeD patients depends on the clinical objective. DXA at diagnosis maximizes early detection.

### Secondary osteoporosis: Are we recognizing it [^116Exgf2]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

As a growing percentage of Americans will be reaching their elderly years in the next decade, the prevalence of osteoporosis and its effects will have an even greater impact on the healthcare system. Advancements in bone research and the development of newer treatments have allowed for the establishment of more refined guidelines and a growing awareness of the need to prevent, screen, and diagnose osteoporosis. Consequently, more women are now being screened with dual X-ray absorptiometry scans (DXA) than ever before. The importance of a true understanding of the test results obtained from such screening is paramount. In our institution, recommendations to consider a secondary evaluation are made by the DXA interpreters when the Z-score is low. Few, if any, studies have evaluated the rates of physician and patient adherence with specific recommendations provided on the bone density report.

- **Methods**: To assess compliance with such recommendations provided in DXA interpretations, we investigated the number of ordering providers who actually pursued these advisements.

- **Results**: We found that among providers ordering DXAs, primary care providers did not pursue recommendations to pursue a secondary workup as often as their subspecialty counterparts. We also found a significant amount of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism in the population evaluated.

- **Conclusions**: Primary care providers should be further educated on treatable secondary causes of osteoporosis as opposed to an often reflexive response of prescribing a pharmacological antiresorptive agent.

### Secondary osteoporosis in men and women: Clinical challenge of an unresolved issue [^116zfyZB]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and etiological factors of osteoporosis. We also tested the FRAX algorithm to compare the assessment of fracture risk in patients with primary or secondary osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: A prospective study was carried out in a large sample of 123 men and 246 women. All subjects underwent biochemical, densitometric, and radiological examinations of the thoracic and lumbar spine.

- **Results**: The prevalence of primary (men 52.9% vs. women 50%; p = nonsignificant) and secondary (men 21.1% vs. women 17.5%; p = nonsignificant) osteoporosis did not differ between the sexes. In contrast, the prevalence of primary osteoporosis was significantly higher than secondary causes (p < 0.0001) in both men and women. Women generally sought medical attention for osteoporosis prevention, while men sought help due to clinical symptoms or disease-related complications, such as fractures. As evaluated by the FRAX tool, patients with osteopenia do not require treatment, in agreement with Italian guidelines. The estimated risk of major osteoporotic and hip fractures was significantly higher in women with secondary osteoporosis compared to men, and also compared to women with primary osteoporosis.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men is similar to that in women and is less frequent than commonly reported. In patients with secondary osteoporosis, FRAX calculation may provide an estimate of a particularly high fracture risk in patients whose bone fragility is usually attributed to another disease.

### Cystic fibrosis-related bone disease: An update on screening, diagnosis, and treatment [^116HXQN9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a clinical diagnosis in children and young adults, pairing a clinically significant fracture history with low bone density for age. In postmenopausal women and men over 50 years of age, the diagnosis of osteoporosis can be determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone mineral density (BMD) alone.

- **Fracture criteria**: Fracture is a critical part of the diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis in cystic fibrosis (CF). Significant osteoporotic fractures in CF include vertebral compression fractures, low trauma fractures of long bones of the lower limb, or two or more upper long bone fractures.

- **BMD measurement**: BMD by DXA is used and reported in terms of Z-scores and T-scores. T-scores are a standard deviation calculation comparing an individual's BMD against gender-matched controls aged 25–29 (peak bone mass) and are generally used for postmenopausal women and men over 50. Z-scores are utilized for premenopausal women and men under 50, calculating the standard deviation of an individual's BMD against gender and age-matched controls. In children, Z-scores are adjusted for height to account for growth during bone size analysis.

- **Biochemical evaluation**: Multiple sources describe biochemical screening for secondary causes of osteoporosis. There are no unified recommendations for when to screen for secondary etiologies of osteoporosis in CF specifically.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and treatment: A review [^116tjUTF]. Journal of Women's Health (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, defined as low bone mass leading to increased fracture risk, is a major health problem that affects approximately 10 million Americans. The aging U.S. population is predicted to contribute to as much as a 50% increase in prevalence by 2025. Although common, osteoporosis can be clinically silent, and without prevention and screening, the costs of osteoporotic fracture-related morbidity and mortality will burden the U.S. healthcare system. This is a particularly relevant concern in the context of diminishing healthcare resources.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is the most widely used, validated technique for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) and diagnosing osteoporosis. Cost-effectiveness analyses support early detection and treatment of high-risk patients with antiresorptive medications such as bisphosphonates. Moreover, optimization of bone health throughout life can help prevent osteoporosis.

Guidelines recommend screening women by age 65 years. However, because no guidelines for screening intervals exist, decisions are made on the basis of clinical judgment alone. Although the recent literature provides some guidance, this review further explores recommendations in light of newer evidence to provide more clarity on prevention, screening, and management strategies for patients with osteoporosis in the primary care setting.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115ceMto]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

The latest ISCD 2023 update includes the following: Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy. Follow-up BMD testing should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management. Follow-up BMD testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed, though it should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention.

Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment. Repeat BMD testing intervals must be individualized, considering an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors associated with bone loss. Shorter intervals between BMD testing may be indicated in the presence of factors associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. Examples include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies; medical disorders such as malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases; and other conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.

If changes in BMD are outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care. A DXA report (baseline and follow-up) should state that a follow-up exam is recommended as long as a valid comparison can be made.

### Recommendations for the clinical evaluation of agents for treatment of osteoporosis: Consensus of an expert panel representing the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD), and the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) [^111tJ2eZ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

A panel of experts representing ASBMR, NOF, and ISCD reviewed evidence and reached a consensus that regulatory approval of treatments for osteoporosis should be based on trials with fracture endpoints, lasting 18–24 months, and extending treatment to 5 years; other indications could be approved based on bone mineral density (BMD) and turnover markers.

The expert panel was convened in response to an FDA request for clinical trial guidance in osteoporosis, with representatives from ASBMR, NOF, and ISCD.

The panel used a validated evidence-based expert panel process (the Rand Appropriateness Method) to address issues of trial duration, trial design, use of intermediate endpoints as outcomes, and use of placebo-controlled trials in high-risk patients.

The panel concluded that placebo-controlled trials with fracture endpoints are appropriate and, with informed consent, are ethical for the registration of new compounds. Trials may be 18–24 months in duration for efficacy, assuming a longer duration to 5 years for safety and demonstration of sustained fracture reduction. Once fracture efficacy has been established for a particular agent, intermediate endpoints (e.g. BMD and bone turnover markers) may be used as outcomes for new indications other than corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.

### Evaluation of secondary causes of bone loss in a primary care setting [^112TxgpD]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical and laboratory work-up for secondary causes of bone loss in a primary care setting, we conducted a retrospective review of medical records of 100 patients with either osteoporosis or osteopenia, who presented to a university-based primary care clinic. Patients with chronic kidney disease or a history of organ transplantation were excluded, as were premenopausal women.

Results showed that age at menopause was ascertained in 43% of female patients. Only 2% of patients were specifically asked about symptoms of malabsorption, whereas a history of malignant disease or its treatment was elicited from 24% of patients. Fifty percent of the overall study group were asked about a history of thyroid disease and 18% about a history of liver disease. Testicular examination was documented in 40% of male patients.

Serum calcium and creatinine levels, complete blood cell count, and thyroid function tests were evaluated in 100% of patients. Vitamin D status was assessed in only 1 patient; no study patient had a 24-hour urine collection for determination of calcium excretion. Serum parathyroid hormone was measured in 7% and serum phosphorus in 10% of patients. Sixty percent of male patients had their testosterone levels assessed. Although the serum creatinine level was determined in all patients, only 1% had a formal estimation of the creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate.

The evaluation of secondary causes of bone loss was notably inadequate in our study population. Because most patients with osteoporosis or osteopenia are managed in the primary care setting, it is essential to enhance these evaluations to better address secondary causes of bone loss.

The development of these guidelines is sponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) Board of Directors and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Board of Trustees, adhering to the published AACE protocols for the standardized production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Recommendations are based on diligent reviews of the clinical evidence with transparent incorporation of subjective factors, according to established AACE/ACE guidelines protocols.

The Executive Summary of this 2020 updated guideline contains 52 recommendations: 21 Grade A (40%), 24 Grade B (46%), 7 Grade C (14%), and no Grade D (0%) recommendations. These detailed, evidence-based recommendations allow for nuanced clinical decision-making that addresses multiple aspects of real-world care of patients. The evidence base presented in the Appendix provides relevant supporting information for the Executive Summary recommendations. This update contains 368 citations: 123 (33.5%) evidence level (EL) 1 (highest), 132 (36%) EL 2 (intermediate), 20 (5.5%) EL 3 (weak), and 93 (25%) EL 4 (lowest).

New or updated topics in this CPG include clarification of the diagnosis of osteoporosis, stratification of the patient according to high-risk and very-high-risk features, a new dual-action therapy option, and transitions from therapeutic options. This guideline serves as a practical tool for endocrinologists, physicians in general, regulatory bodies, health-related organizations, and interested laypersons regarding the diagnosis and evaluation of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

### Clinical use of bone densitometry: Scientific review [^1111cxQx]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis causes substantial morbidity and costs $13.8 billion annually in the United States. Measurement of bone mass by densitometry is a primary part of diagnosing osteoporosis and deciding a preventive treatment course. Bone mineral densitometry has become more widely available and commonly used in practice.

- **Objective**: To review evidence about the value of various clinical applications of bone densitometry.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was performed to update previous meta-analyses of the relationship between various measurements of bone density and risk of vertebral and hip fracture. We used data from the prospective Study of Osteoporotic Fractures to estimate the risk of fracture from bone density and age in postmenopausal women.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: When available, meta-analyses and systematic reviews are emphasized in the review.

- **Data synthesis**: Bone mineral density (BMD) predicts fracture and can be used in combination with age to estimate the absolute risk of fractures in postmenopausal white women. Hip BMD predicts hip fracture more strongly than other measurements of BMD. There are insufficient data to translate BMD results into the risk of fracture for men and nonwhite women. The benefits of treatments to prevent fractures depend on BMD: women with osteoporosis have a greater risk of fractures and greater benefit from treatments than women without osteoporosis.

- **Conclusions**: Guidelines based on systematic reviews and a cost-effectiveness analysis have suggested that it is worthwhile to measure BMD in white women older than 65 years.

### Osteoporosis: Part I. Evaluation and assessment [^112FGvX9]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis afflicts 75 million persons in the United States, Europe, and Japan and results in more than 1.3 million fractures annually in the United States. Because osteoporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs, family physicians must identify the appropriate timing and methods for screening those at risk. Prevention is the most important step, and women of all ages should be encouraged to take 1,000 to 1,500 mg of supplemental calcium daily, participate in regular weight-bearing exercise, avoid medications known to compromise bone density, institute hormone replacement therapy at menopause unless contraindicated, and avoid tobacco and excessive alcohol intake.

All postmenopausal women who present with fractures, as well as younger women who have risk factors, should be evaluated for the disease. Physicians should recommend bone mineral density testing to younger women at risk and postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have risk factors for osteoporosis other than being postmenopausal. Bone mineral density testing should be recommended to all women 65 years and older regardless of additional risk factors. Bone mineral density screening should be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment only if the results would influence the choice of therapy or convince the patient to take appropriate preventive measures.

### Secondary osteoporosis: a review of the recent evidence [^115zTGDR]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this review is to examine several causes of secondary osteoporosis and provide screening recommendations for underlying disorders.

- **Methods**: We conducted a review of the literature on many of the causes of osteoporosis published over the past 15 years, focusing on sources available from 2000 to the present. Notably, over two-thirds of the articles we reviewed were printed in the past six years. These reports examined secondary osteoporosis in general and many specific causes.

- **Results**: Secondary osteoporosis is present in almost two-thirds of men, more than half of premenopausal and perimenopausal women, and about one-fifth of postmenopausal women. Its causes are diverse, including hypogonadism, medications, hyperthyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, primary hyperparathyroidism, solid organ transplantation, gastrointestinal diseases, hematologic diseases, Cushing's syndrome, and idiopathic hypercalciuria. Each cause has distinct pathogenesis, epidemiologic features, and effects on the skeleton.

- **Conclusion**: The causes of secondary osteoporosis are numerous, and understanding their characteristics in relation to bone density and potential fracture risk is essential for managing osteoporosis. Increased awareness of their possible existence is necessary to provide optimal care.

### A missed opportunity? Osteoporosis treatment following femoral neck fractures: Reducing the risk of secondary hip fracture [^116jNT4L]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). High credibility.

Hip fractures represent devastating injuries with extensive morbidity and mortality. Despite guidelines recommending osteoporosis pharmacotherapy after hip fracture, treatment rates remain low. This study sought to determine the effect of osteoporosis pharmacotherapy on the secondary hip fracture rate in patients undergoing operative treatment for femoral neck fractures (FNFx).

- **Methods**: A large national database was queried for patients ≥ 50 years old who underwent operative fixation of FNFx between 2009 and 2022. Age, sex, comorbidities, and pharmaceutical records were collected from the database. Among the 17,128 study patients, the mean age was 79 years (range, 50 to 103), and 65% were women. Patients previously treated for osteoporosis were excluded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to compare secondary hip fracture rates in patients who were medically treated for osteoporosis within one year of index FNFx versus those who were never treated for osteoporosis. Cumulative rates of osteoporosis pharmacotherapy initiation and secondary hip fracture were determined.

- **Results**: Treatment initiation within one year was associated with a significantly reduced hip fracture hazard at three years (HR [hazard ratio] 0.56, 95% CI [confidence interval] 0.32 to 0.95, P = 0.03), five years (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.98, P = 0.04), and 10 years (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.87, P = 0.01) following FNFx. Only 6.3% of study patients were initiated on osteoporosis medication within one year following FNFx.

### Bone-density testing interval and transition to osteoporosis in older women [^111Dd6Zw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Although bone mineral density (BMD) testing to screen for osteoporosis (BMD T score, -2.50 or lower) is recommended for women 65 years of age or older, there are few data to guide decisions about the interval between BMD tests.

- **Methods**: We studied 4957 women, 67 years of age or older, with normal BMD (T score at the femoral neck and total hip, -1.00 or higher) or osteopenia (T score, -1.01 to -2.49) and with no history of hip or clinical vertebral fracture or of treatment for osteoporosis. These women were followed prospectively for up to 15 years. The BMD testing interval was defined as the estimated time for 10% of women to make the transition to osteoporosis before having a hip or clinical vertebral fracture, with adjustment for estrogen use and clinical risk factors. Transitions from normal BMD and from three subgroups of osteopenia (mild, moderate, and advanced) were analyzed using parametric cumulative incidence models. Incident hip and clinical vertebral fractures and initiation of treatment with bisphosphonates, calcitonin, or raloxifene were treated as competing risks.

- **Results**: The estimated BMD testing interval was 16.8 years (95% confidence interval, 11.5 to 24.6) for women with normal BMD, 17.3 years (95% CI, 13.9 to 21.5) for women with mild osteopenia, 4.7 years (95% CI, 4.2 to 5.2) for women with moderate osteopenia, and 1.1 years (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.3) for women with advanced osteopenia.

- **Conclusions**: Our data indicate that osteoporosis would develop in less than 10% of older, postmenopausal women during rescreening intervals of approximately 15 years.

### The value of laboratory tests in diagnosing secondary osteoporosis at a fracture and osteoporosis outpatient clinic [^1111kj18]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

As more patients meeting the criteria for osteoporosis are referred to a fracture and osteoporosis outpatient clinic (FO clinic), the laboratory costs to screen for secondary osteoporosis also increase. This study was conducted to determine the value of screening for underlying diseases at an FO clinic by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests.

- **Methods**: We included all 541 patients aged 50 years and older with a fracture referred to our FO clinic during the period January 2005 to January 2007. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and expressed as a T score. A standard set of laboratory tests was obtained to screen for underlying diseases.

- **Results**: Laboratory results were as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD compared to patients with a low BMD. Underlying diseases were infrequently diagnosed. However, the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis in men was quite high, up to 18.2%. The costs to diagnose one patient with an underlying disease varied between €92 and €972 depending on the group of patients described.

- **Conclusion**: Screening all patients referred to an FO clinic for underlying diseases by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests is probably not useful since laboratory tests are as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD compared to patients with a low BMD. Moreover, the prevalence of secondary osteoporosis is low, while laboratory costs are substantial.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^116ngQh9]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Statements based on IWG consensus:

- **Dxa BMD measurement**: DXA BMD measurement should be performed at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and, if indicated, one-third radius.

- **Consider DXA in demographics**: Consider DXA in all women aged ≥ 65 years, men aged > 70 years, and women and men aged ≥ 50 years with risk factors for osteoporosis.

- **Evaluate for vertebral fractures**: Evaluate for prevalent vertebral fractures with VFA or standard radiography in patients ≥ 50 years with specific risk factors, or with a T-score ≤ −2.5 at any site, height loss > 4 cm, self-reported but undocumented vertebral fracture, or long-term glucocorticoid therapy.

- **DXA in younger adults**: Consider DXA in younger adults (premenopausal women and men under 50 years) with specific diseases, medical drugs, and/or fracture history.

- **Precision error and LSC**: Each DXA facility should determine its precision error and calculate the least significant change (LSC), to be repeated when a new DXA system is installed.

- **Osteoporosis diagnosis**: In accordance with the established WHO operational definition, osteoporosis is diagnosed based on a T-score of −2.5 or lower in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or one-third radius. The lowest T-score at any of these measured sites should be used for diagnosis.

- **Presumed osteoporosis**: Some societies presumed a diagnosis of osteoporosis in the presence of low-trauma major fracture (hip, spine, forearm, humerus, pelvis).

- **NHANES III reference database**: The NHANES III reference database is recommended for T-score calculation depending on the society, based on 20–29-year-old White women or same sex-type.

- **Recommend follow-up DXA**: Recommend follow-up DXA as indicated, depending on clinical circumstances. Follow-up of patients should ideally be conducted in specialized centers.

### ACR appropriateness criteria osteoporosis and bone mineral density [^111mHFqo]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Osteoporosis is a considerable public health risk, with 50% of women and 20% of men over 50 years of age experiencing fractures, accompanied by mortality rates of 20% within the first year. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the primary diagnostic modality for screening women over 65 years of age and men over 70 years of age for osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women under 65 years of age with additional risk factors for fractures, DXA is recommended. Some patients with bone mineral density above the threshold for treatment may still qualify for treatment based on vertebral body fractures detected through a vertebral fracture assessment scan, a lateral spine equivalent generated from a commercial DXA machine. Quantitative CT is useful in patients with advanced degenerative bony changes in their spines. New technologies, such as the trabecular bone score, represent an emerging role for the qualitative assessment of bone in clinical practice.

It is critical that both radiologists and referring providers consider osteoporosis in their patients, thereby reducing substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost to the health care system. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, or GRADE) to rate their appropriateness.

### Recommendations for improving women's bone health throughout the lifespan [^113o2KQg]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Low credibility.

Increasing access and coverage for DXA screening

Currently, the health care system performs poorly in assessing bone health, and screening recommendations are not satisfactorily modeled for secondary prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) recommend bone measurement screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years and older, and in women younger than 65 who are at increased clinical risk. However, rapid bone loss can occur in women through the early postmenopausal years, leading to increased risk for osteoporosis. As such, the Working Group highlighted that another underutilized window of opportunity to engage women around the topic of PBM and bone health is during the transition to menopause (perimenopause).

Awareness of declining bone mass tends to increase in postmenopausal conversations, usually only after an inciting event (e.g. a bone fracture) or around 65 years of age when broader screening is recommended for women without certain risk factors. The average age of menopause in the United States is 51 years old; waiting to engage women more than 10 years postmenopause is a missed opportunity to introduce preventive lifestyle practices and potential treatment options that may preserve bone density and reduce fall and fracture risk as estrogen levels decline and compromise bone health in midlife and later.

Thus, the Working Group resolved that reducing the consensus guidelines' recommended age for screening to the perimenopause window would provide women and their health care providers with an opportunity to implement preventive measures earlier.

### Patterns of bone mineral density testing: current guidelines, testing rates, and interventions [^113jGCcz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To identify potential obstacles to bone mineral density (BMD) testing, we performed a structured review of osteoporosis screening guidelines, studies of BMD testing patterns, and interventions to increase BMD testing. We searched MEDLINE and HealthSTAR from 1992 through 2002 using appropriate search terms. Two authors examined all retrieved articles, and relevant studies were reviewed with a structured data abstraction form.

A total of 235 articles were identified, and 51 met criteria for review: 24 practice guidelines, 22 studies of screening patterns, and 5 interventions designed to increase BMD rates. Of the practice guidelines, almost half (47%) lacked a formal description of how they were developed, and recommendations for populations to screen varied widely. Screening frequencies among at-risk patients were low, ranging from 1% to 47%. Only eight studies assessed factors associated with BMD testing. Factors such as female patient gender, glucocorticoid dose, and rheumatologist care were positively associated with BMD testing. Female physicians, rheumatologists, and physicians caring for more postmenopausal patients were more likely to test patients. Five articles described interventions to increase BMD testing rates, but only two tested for statistical significance, and no firm conclusions can be drawn.

This systematic review identified several possible contributors to suboptimal BMD testing rates. Osteoporosis screening guidelines lack uniformity in their development and content.

### Screening for osteoporosis: An update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^115Z78gV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This review updates evidence since the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on osteoporosis screening. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and harms of osteoporosis screening in reducing fractures for men and postmenopausal women without known previous fractures. It assesses the performance of risk-assessment instruments and bone measurement tests in identifying persons with osteoporosis, optimal screening intervals, and the efficacy and harms of medications to reduce primary fractures.

Data Sources: The study utilized the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter of 2009), MEDLINE (January 2001 to December 2009), reference lists, and Web of Science.

Study Selection: Researchers focused on randomized, controlled trials of screening or medications with fracture outcomes published in English. They included performance studies of validated risk-assessment instruments, as well as systematic reviews and population-based studies of bone measurement tests or medication harms.

Data Extraction: Data on patient populations, study design, analysis, follow-up, and results were extracted. The quality of the studies was rated using established criteria.

Data Synthesis: The results showed that risk-assessment instruments are modest predictors of low bone density (area under the curve, 0.13 to 0.87; 14 instruments) and fractures (area under the curve, 0.48 to 0.89; 11 instruments). Simple and complex instruments perform similarly. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry predicts fractures similarly for men and women; calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography also predicts fractures.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: Is now the time [^111VUTnZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: Clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for effectiveness of therapy. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. As a consequence, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated for longer than necessary, whereas others at high risk for fracture may have treatment stopped when they might benefit from continuation of the same treatment or a change to a more potent therapeutic agent. The objective of this statement is to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for the management of patients with osteoporosis.

- **Participants**: We recommend that a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders in the care of osteoporosis explore the options, review the evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

- **Evidence**: Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed for commonalities of correlations between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

- **Consensus process**: Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in the process of developing consensus on easily measurable osteoporosis treatment targets that are supported by the best available evidence and likely to be accepted by clinicians and patients in the care of osteoporosis.

### Optimizing screening for osteoporosis in patients with fragility hip fracture [^112iYCKy]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis, the underlying cause of most hip fractures, is underdiagnosed and undertreated. The 2008 Joint Commission report, "Improving and Measuring Osteoporosis Management", showed that only an average of 20% of patients with low-impact fractures are ever tested or treated for osteoporosis. We developed an integrated model utilizing hospitalists and orthopaedic surgeons to improve osteoporosis care in patients with hip fractures.

- **Questions/purposes**: Does our integrated model combining hospitalists and orthopaedic surgeons improve the frequency of evaluation for osteoporosis, screening for secondary causes, and patients' education on osteoporosis?

- **Patients and methods**: Our Hospitalist-Orthopaedic Surgeon Integrated Model of Care was implemented in September 2009. We compared the rate of evaluation and treatment for osteoporosis in 140 patients admitted with fragility hip fractures at our institution before (70 patients) and after (70 patients) implementation of the care plan.

- **Results**: Evaluation of patients for osteoporosis was higher in the postimplementation group compared to the preimplementation group (89% versus 24%). Screening of patients for secondary causes of osteoporosis was also improved in the postimplementation group (89% versus 0%), as was the proportion of patients who received education on osteoporosis management (89% versus 0%).

- **Conclusion**: Our model of integrated care by hospitalists and orthopaedic surgeons resulted in improvement in the evaluation for osteoporosis, screening for secondary causes of osteoporosis, and education on osteoporosis management.

### Bone density screening for osteoporosis [^115BvHoU]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) testing is an effective approach for the early detection of osteopenia and osteoporosis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Gynecologic Practice recommends BMD testing for all postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and for those who present with fractures. The committee also concludes that BMD testing may be recommended for postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis. Bone mineral density testing may also be useful for pre-menopausal and postmenopausal women who present with certain diseases or medical conditions and those who take certain drugs associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis.

### Secondary osteoporosis and metabolic bone disease in patients 50 years and older with osteoporosis or with a recent clinical fracture: A clinical perspective [^116o9kGw]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide guidance to clinicians about which laboratory tests should be performed in patients with osteoporosis or with a recent fracture.

Recent findings indicate that newly diagnosed secondary osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases (SECOB) have been found in 5–48% of patients with osteoporosis. In patients with a recent fracture, new SECOB is found in 10–47% of patients with osteoporosis and in 26–51% if all patients with a fracture, regardless of bone mineral density (BMD), are screened. More than one SECOB can be found in the same patient, even when they have already known SECOB.

In conditions such as primary hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, and multiple myeloma, both SECOB and its treatment have an impact on BMD and fractures. For other SECOBs, no treatment is available, or there are no data about the effect of treatment of the SECOB on BMD and fractures.

We recommend performing the following tests in all patients with osteoporosis or a recent clinical fracture: calcium, phosphate, creatinine, albumin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in all patients. Additionally, 24-hour urine calcium in men and serum testosterone in men less than 70 years. On indication, additional tests can be performed.

### How can we improve osteoporosis care? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of quality improvement strategies for osteoporosis [^112jViW2]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). High credibility.

Although osteoporosis affects 10 million people in the United States, screening and treatment rates remain low. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of quality improvement strategies to improve osteoporosis screening (bone mineral density [BMD]/dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA] testing) and/or treatment (pharmacotherapy) initiation rates. We developed broad literature search strategies for PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases and applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select relevant studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed for outcomes of BMD/DXA testing and/or osteoporosis treatment. Forty-three randomized clinical studies met the inclusion criteria.

- **Increasing BMD/DXA testing**: Meta-analyses demonstrated several efficacious strategies for patients with recent or prior fractures, including orthopedic surgeon or fracture clinic initiation of osteoporosis evaluation or management (risk difference 44%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 26%-63%), fracture liaison service/case management (risk difference 43%, 95% CI 23%-64%), multifaceted interventions targeting providers and patients (risk difference 24%, 95% CI 15%-32%), and patient education and/or activation (risk difference 16%, 95% CI 6%-26%).

- **Increasing osteoporosis treatment**: For patients with recent or prior fractures, meta-analyses demonstrated significant efficacy for interventions like fracture liaison service/case management (risk difference 20%, 95% CI 1%-40%) and multifaceted interventions targeting providers and patients (risk difference 12%, 95% CI 6%-17%).
