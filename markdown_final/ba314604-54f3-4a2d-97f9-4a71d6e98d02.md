## Question

Does urinary incontinence need bladder ultrasound?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bladder ultrasound is necessary for evaluating urinary incontinence, and in which situations it should be used or avoided. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core initial evaluation that applies to most patients with urinary incontinence. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about post-void residual (PVR) measurement and whether ultrasound is the preferred modality. Next, I will examine when bladder ultrasound is not recommended routinely. After that, I need to check special populations and contexts where ultrasound adds value, including neurogenic bladder, preoperative planning, and post-procedural complications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note limitations and exceptions where ultrasound may be less accurate or unnecessary.

> Let me first confirm the foundation of initial assessment for urinary incontinence, because I need to ensure we are not over-ordering tests. Across guidelines, the core elements are a careful history, physical examination including focused pelvic and neurologic assessment, and urinalysis to screen for infection or hematuria. Bladder diaries and symptom questionnaires are commonly added to characterize patterns and severity, and this approach applies to women and men with uncomplicated presentations [^116nZDaP] [^1121Q34M] [^115AvKNr] [^1114xy98] [^114poN2j].

> Now, I should verify the role of post-void residual (PVR) because that is where bladder ultrasound most often enters the pathway. Wait, let me verify guideline positions: the AUA/SUFU OAB guideline advises that clinicians may obtain PVR to exclude incomplete emptying, especially when voiding or emptying symptoms coexist with urgency or when antimuscarinic therapy is planned, and it recommends ultrasound as the noninvasive method of choice. The EAU female LUTS guidance explicitly recommends measuring PVR with ultrasound during initial assessment of LUTS, including incontinence phenotypes. And the ICS teaching module supports ultrasound as preferred over catheterization for PVR due to lower risk and comparable clinical utility in most settings [^114y1LDm] [^113jZCFN] [^112fjeUx] [^114e9pps].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ordering broad imaging. I need to check whether routine bladder or renal ultrasound is advised in uncomplicated incontinence. The AUA/SUFU OAB guideline states that urodynamics, cystoscopy, and diagnostic renal and bladder ultrasound should not be used in the initial workup of uncomplicated OAB, and the EAU female LUTS guidance similarly recommends against routine upper or lower urinary tract imaging in the routine evaluation of LUTS, including stress UI; so, outside of PVR, routine bladder ultrasound is not indicated in straightforward cases [^116nZDaP] [^113LZxY4] [^1158QBEh] [^112rKtZU].

> Next, I should review special populations where ultrasound meaningfully changes management. Let me consider neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: in patients with neurologic disease or risk for neurogenic bladder, guidelines support PVR assessment and, when indicated, broader urologic imaging and urodynamics, with ultrasound being a practical first-line tool for retention risk and upper tract surveillance in higher-risk strata. Stroke and Parkinson's guidance also endorse bladder scanning to assess retention and guide catheter management strategies [^111qGD4c] [^111Fyvzq] [^111BfCHB] [^114kgSZv].

> I will now examine preoperative and procedural contexts. Before invasive therapy for stress UI, documenting PVR is a standard minimum dataset element, and ultrasound is an accepted method. In men considering stress incontinence surgery after prostate treatment, cystourethroscopy is recommended to assess urethral and bladder pathology that could alter outcomes, and ultrasound may be used adjunctively for anatomic assessment. In women with recurrent UI after pelvic floor surgery, targeted ultrasound can help identify mesh or sling complications and guide interventions such as tape lysis. And emerging data suggest preoperative ultrasound parameters like bladder wall thickness and urethral morphology may predict sling outcomes, though this remains investigational in many centers [^112SAUzN] [^114m5sBN] [^111JXhxR] [^111PMcKy].

> But wait, what about bladder wall thickness or other ultrasound biomarkers for detrusor overactivity or obstruction? I should double-check the evidence. Systematic reviews and expert reports indicate bladder wall thickness may correlate with detrusor overactivity or obstruction, yet there is no standardized methodology or validated cutoff that reliably replaces urodynamics; thus, these measures remain promising research tools rather than routine clinical standards at this time [^116stA3N] [^117UUP4c] [^112XRyq9].

> I need to ensure I address technical limitations of ultrasound PVR, because accuracy matters for decision-making. Portable bladder scanners are generally accurate and safer than catheterization, but accuracy can be reduced in obesity, after lower abdominal or pelvic surgery, with ascites or pelvic cysts, in pregnancy, or with significant vaginal prolapse; therefore, if the clinical picture and ultrasound PVR disagree, repeating the measurement or using catheterization is reasonable, and single PVR values should be interpreted cautiously [^112G7ZuL] [^115DhGhS].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and verify it aligns with guidelines. For uncomplicated urinary incontinence, start with history, exam, and urinalysis, add a bladder diary, and consider a PVR by ultrasound when voiding symptoms are present, when antimuscarinic therapy is planned, or when retention is suspected; avoid routine bladder or renal ultrasound otherwise. For complicated presentations — neurogenic features, refractory symptoms, hematuria or suspected pathology, preoperative planning, or post-procedural complications — targeted ultrasound, including PVR and selective anatomic imaging, is appropriate. This risk-stratified strategy balances diagnostic yield, safety, and resource use [^116nZDaP] [^113jZCFN] [^1158QBEh] [^114y1LDm].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. Bladder ultrasound is not universally required for all patients with urinary incontinence, but measuring post-void residual with ultrasound is a guideline-supported component of initial evaluation for many patients with LUTS, particularly when voiding symptoms coexist or when therapies that affect emptying are contemplated; outside of PVR, routine bladder ultrasound should be avoided in uncomplicated cases, while targeted ultrasound remains valuable in neurogenic bladder, preoperative assessment, and evaluation of procedural complications [^111JXhxR] [^111Fyvzq] [^114y1LDm] [^1158QBEh].

---

Not all patients with urinary incontinence require bladder ultrasound [^113LZxY4]; it is indicated when **post-void residual (PVR) is suspected** [^114y1LDm] or when **voiding symptoms** are present [^113jZCFN] to assess for retention or obstruction [^112ehSzA]. Routine ultrasound is not needed for uncomplicated stress or urge incontinence [^116nZDaP] [^1158QBEh]; use it selectively for complex cases, before invasive therapy, or when initial management fails [^111Cqh7P]. Ultrasound is preferred for PVR because it is noninvasive [^112G7ZuL], but catheterization is reserved when ultrasound is unavailable or inaccurate [^114y1LDm] [^111Fyvzq].

## Indications for bladder ultrasound in urinary incontinence

Bladder ultrasound is **not universally required** for all patients with urinary incontinence; indications include:

- **Post-void residual (PVR) measurement**: Recommended when voiding symptoms or incomplete emptying are suspected [^114y1LDm], especially in patients with LUTS [^113jZCFN] [^112ehSzA] or before initiating antimuscarinic therapy [^112fjeUx].

- **Complex or refractory cases**: Use when initial evaluation and treatment fail, or when diagnostic uncertainty persists [^111Cqh7P] [^113LZxY4].

- **Preoperative assessment**: Consider before invasive procedures or surgery to assess bladder structure and function [^111wPdWt] [^112SAUzN].

- **Neurogenic bladder**: Essential in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction to assess retention and bladder structure [^111Fyvzq] [^114kgSZv].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Bladder ultrasound indicated?** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence (SUI) | No | Routine imaging not recommended [^1158QBEh] |
| Uncomplicated urge urinary incontinence (UUI) | No | Routine imaging not recommended [^116nZDaP] [^113LZxY4] |
| Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) | No | Routine imaging not recommended [^112rKtZU] |
| Suspected post-void residual or incomplete emptying | Yes | Recommended to assess retention/obstruction [^114y1LDm] [^113jZCFN] |
| Complex or refractory cases | Yes | Recommended when initial management fails [^111Cqh7P] [^113LZxY4] |
| Preoperative assessment | Yes | Recommended before invasive procedures [^111wPdWt] [^112SAUzN] |
| Neurogenic bladder | Yes | Essential for assessment and management [^111Fyvzq] |

---

## Limitations and contraindications

Bladder ultrasound has **limitations and contraindications**:

- **Accuracy**: Reduced in obesity, prior abdominal/pelvic surgery, ascites, or pelvic cysts [^112G7ZuL] [^111Fyvzq].

- **False positives/negatives**: Single measurements can mislead; repeat or confirm as needed [^115DhGhS] [^111Fyvzq].

- **Operator dependence**: Requires trained personnel; variability can occur [^1118ku3M].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

When ultrasound is unavailable or inconclusive, **alternatives include**:

- **Urodynamic studies**: Gold standard for bladder function assessment, especially in complex cases [^114kgSZv] [^1178VX1u].

- **Cystoscopy**: Direct visualization of bladder/urethra when structural abnormalities are suspected [^114m5sBN].

- **Catheterization**: Accurate PVR measurement when ultrasound is unavailable or inaccurate [^114y1LDm] [^111Fyvzq].

---

## Clinical outcomes and patient management

Bladder ultrasound can improve outcomes by identifying retention or obstruction, guiding therapy, and reducing complications. It informs management decisions — such as catheterization, medication adjustment, or surgical planning — and is **noninvasive and convenient**, enhancing patient comfort and adherence [^1121hak2] [^112bbWS3].

---

Bladder ultrasound is **not universally required** for urinary incontinence; use it selectively for suspected retention, complex cases, preoperative planning, or neurogenic bladder. It is noninvasive and informative, but operator-dependent and less accurate in some settings; use clinical judgment and confirm results when needed.

Introduction

CHF affects approximately 6.5 million adults in the United States and is commonly accompanied by fluid overload conditions, which account for most CHF hospitalizations. In critical care and inpatient settings, clinicians monitor urine output to assess a patient's fluid balance, renal function, and overall metabolic state to optimize the titration of diuretics and other treatments. In outpatient settings, patients are expected to weigh themselves at the same time daily to monitor for any sudden weight changes indicative of fluid overload. However, in both environments there are concerns about proper volume monitoring, whether it is infection risk from the monitoring method used or patient adherence to a routine.

The current gold standard of urine output monitoring in hospitals are indwelling urinary catheters. The catheter allows for urine to flow freely from the bladder into a drainage bag, the volume of which medical staff can then measure. The drawback of an invasive approach is the catheter introduces an infection vector to the patient, resulting in 1 million urinary tract infections annually in the United States. The additional healthcare costs to treat the infections is estimated to range from $115 million to $1.82 billion annually. Moreover, use of a catheter may be a contraindication for the patient. To prevent infections, reduce costs, and address contraindications, noninvasive bladder monitoring methods are greatly needed.

Non-invasive methods do not require the patient to matriculate to obtain a reading, therefore can monitor bladder volume directly. One method used to influence clinical decisions today is ultrasound. The technique requires a trained clinician to manually perform periodic scans to assess bladder volume. General purpose ultrasound devices have large errors of 21.8% and remain largely dependent on the technician operating them. The large error of conventional ultrasound methods arises from the positioning of the scanner and volume estimation algorithm, which itself is dependent on the current bladder volume. Dedicated handheld ultrasound scanners, such as BVI 9400™ and Prime™ from BladderScan® can have smaller errors. Nonetheless, both require a trained technician present to take measurements, resulting in noncontinuous monitoring. Recent advancements in miniaturization of ultrasound transducers have enabled the development of wearable systems that could increase scan frequency. However, these systems have largely focused on detecting voiding, or bladder state detection (full vs empty) to help patients manage incontinence rather than bladder volume estimation.

### Role of perineal ultrasound in the evaluation of urinary stress incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse: a systematic review [^116Ex8xt]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

A review of the international literature on urogynecology was performed to focus on the actual role of perineal ultrasound. It is an increasingly used tool for the assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction and incontinence. In recent years ultrasound studies have predominated but there is little information on normal values and confusion on methodology and measurements. The aim of this study is to report the data available in the Literature about ultrasound as investigational evaluation helpful in diagnosing of urinary incontinence and urethral hypermobility, to document pelvic floor anatomy and to assess anatomic and functional changes after surgery.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was conducted using combinations of heading terms: perineal, ultrasound, pelvic floor, urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse.

Results

Ultrasound has become an indispensable diagnostic procedure in urogynecology. Perineal, introital, and endoanal ultrasound are the most recommended techniques and the results comprise qualitative and quantitative findings. These are important for determining the localization of the bladder neck and vesico-urethral junction and also for pre- and postoperative comparisons, and moreover for clinical applications and scientific investigations.

Conclusions

There are as yet little data and there is a need to find in the near future more standard and objective parameters for the diagnosis of urinary incontinence. They will be obtained by means of more accurate analysis and comparison of the parameters, leading to a more clinically useful diagnostic test and assuring reliable and reproducible results.

Incontinence and Constipation

Hip fracture patients should be screened for urinary incontinence at arrival to a postacute facility and reversible causes should be treated accordantly. All patients should receive medications to prevent constipation unless contraindicated.

Incontinence is a common, bothersome, and potentially disabling condition in the geriatric population. Although hospital-acquired urinary incontinence can often be prevented, urinary incontinence evaluation and management might not be a priority for orthopedic care. Hip fracture patients may be exposed to urinary catheters during their hospital stay due to urinary incontinence and/retention and the need for protecting the surgical site. This type of incontinence/retention should be managed by environmental manipulation, scheduled toileting, appropriate use of toilet substitutes such as bed side commodes or bedpans, and careful attention to skin care. Recording voiding frequency and volume and incontinence patterns will help identifying possible reversible contributors to the incontinence.

Urinary retention with "overflow" incontinence should be considered in any patient who suddenly develops urinary incontinence after hip fracture surgery. Immobility, anticholinergic and opiate medications, as well as fecal impaction can precipitate urinary retention and overflow incontinence in geriatric patients. Many hip fracture patients come to the PAC facility with an indwelling catheter. The reason the catheter was placed in the acute hospital should be ascertained. If the patient had the catheter placed for acute urinary retention during the hospitalization, a period of 7 to 10 days of catheterization is appropriate to allow the bladder muscle to recover. All PAC facilities should have a specific "bladder retraining" protocol in place to remove indwelling catheters, and a bladder ultrasound to monitor postvoid residual volumes to avoid repeated catheterizations and the associated risk of discomfort and infection.

### How can urodynamic innovations be better integrated into the clinical pathway? ICI-RS 2025 [^115gpUe9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urodynamics has seen, in common with any medical field reliant upon technology, many recent advances in the application of innovations. Novel and effective ideas have been developed and marketed, but relatively few have been incorporated into clinical practice.

Methods

A debate held at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) meeting in Bristol, UK, in June 2025 looked at new technology and its possible inclusion into the patient pathway.

Results

Discussion acknowledged that new ideas have not always been comprehensively examined, assessed, or applied. The meeting considered ways to rectify this gap and proposed research that is needed to give evidence-based take-up of innovation in this field.

Conclusions

We propose a tool that examines the time, costs, and a test's specificity and sensitivity for each patient group, to suggest an optimal pathway for that group. The meeting also concluded that techniques involving ultrasound and catheter-free monitoring hold promise and proposed research needed to promote the take-up of innovation in this field.

What kind of bladder dysfunction can occur in individuals with PD?

Neurogenic bladder dysfunction is found (depending on the stage of the disease) in around 60% of all individuals with PD. The bladder filling or storage phase is most frequently affected, leading to urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urge and urge incontinence. Such symptoms impact significantly on the quality of life of affected individuals and often require dedicated, multidisciplinary management. Non-neurogenic bladder disorders (e.g. prostate hyperplasia in men or pelvic floor prolapse in women) must be carefully differentiated from neurogenic bladder disorders in close collaboration with allied specialties such as urology and gynecology. In addition to urological/gynecological consultations, urinalysis is also essential to rule out reversible causes of bladder disturbances such as urinary tract infections, and to screen for proteinuria, diabetes mellitus or space-occupying lesions, in case of persistent hematuria. Keeping a bladder diary for 48–72 h helps to quantify the micturition frequency, urine volume, incontinence episodes, as well as to identify nocturnal polyuria, ultimately enabling an accurate estimation of the individual symptomatic burden. Additional examinations include the measurement of post-void residual urine volume by means of bladder ultrasound or in-and-out catheterization, uroflowmetry, and urodynamics. The latter is considered the gold standard in the diagnostic workup of neurogenic bladder disorders.

### Can we replace the catheter when evaluating urinary residuals? [^111ck7ch]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To test the different formulae to calculate the bladder volume using ultrasound; the accuracy of patients hearing/feeling "bubbles" at the end of urodynamics testing as a measure of being empty; and how good we are at estimating PVR using X-ray at the end of video urodynamics testing.

Methods

This was a prospective cohort study. Using Sonosite 180 plus, bladder volumes were calculated as, height×width×depth×proportionality constant (0.52, 0.625, 0.65, and 0.7) Patients were asked whether the patient heard or felt "bubbles" at the end of the investigation. Each patient was fluoroscopically screened and the clinician estimated the volume and compared with single-use catheter volume.

Results

A total of 85 patients were assessed. All four formulae were significantly correlated. The PC, 0.52, correlated best (r = 0.938, P < 0.001) with no significant difference with the actual volumes (P = 0.275). The "bubbles test" had a positive predictive value of 93%. A video postvoid residual (PVR) estimation significantly correlated with catheterised bladder volume (r = 0.842, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the estimated and actual bladder volumes (P = 0.579).

Conclusion

This study showed that although all four formulae correlated significantly, the PC of 0.52 was the only formula without a significant difference from the actual volume. More work is needed to produce patient individualised PC. Our clinicians were able to accurately estimate the PVR on X-ray. This study has identified the best formula to accurately estimate bladder volume and that video estimation along with the "bubbles" test can avoid unnecessary intervention.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^112fjeUx]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU Guideline) — postvoid residual (PVR) assessment and anti‑muscarinic therapy monitoring: Because anti‑muscarinic medications can induce urinary retention, PVR should be assessed in patients with obstructive symptoms, history of incontinence or prostatic surgery, neurologic diagnoses, and at clinician discretion; PVR should be measured with an ultrasound bladder scanner immediately after the patient voids, and if an ultrasound scanner is not available, then urethral catheterization may be used to assess PVR. For any patient on anti‑muscarinic therapy, the clinician should be prepared to monitor PVR during the course of treatment should obstructive voiding symptoms appear, and baseline PVRs should be performed for men with symptoms prior to initiation of anti‑muscarinic therapy. Anti‑muscarinics should be used with caution in patients with PVR > 250–300 mL, and most randomized trials evaluating anti‑muscarinics for OAB used a PVR of 150–200 mL as an exclusion criterion. The occurrence of symptomatic urinary retention or asymptomatic elevations of postvoid residuals after the addition of anti‑muscarinic agents occurs in a small proportion of patients.

### Bladder-wall-thickness ultrasound scan in the investigation of LUTS in women: challenges and limitations [^113nruS5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Bladder-wall-thickness (BWT) ultrasound assessment in lower urinary tract conditions has been studied extensively for the last 30 years. There is some evidence that it may have diagnostic utility in detrusor overactivity (DO). The cutoff value for BWT for diagnosing DO is still a matter of debate, with different studies using different values. Transvaginal scanning is the most accurate route of measuring BWT, with excellent interobserver variation and reproducibility. There is still ongoing evaluation of bladder ultrasound and its place in the investigation of overactive bladder symptoms.

### EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence [^1114nUbj]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The first European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on incontinence were published in 2001. These guidelines were periodically updated in past years.

Objective

The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2009 update of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI).

Evidence Acquisition

The EAU working panel was part of the 4th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and, with permission of the ICI, extracted the relevant data. The methodology of the 4th ICI was a comprehensive literature review by international experts and consensus formation. In addition, level of evidence was rated according to a modified Oxford system and grades of recommendation were given accordingly.

Evidence Summary

A full version of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence is available as a printed document (extended and short form) and as a CD-ROM from the EAU office or online from the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The extent and invasiveness of assessment of UI depends on severity and/or complexity of symptoms and clinical signs and is different for men, women, frail older persons, children, and patients with neuropathy. At the level of initial management, basic diagnostic tests are applied to exclude an underlying disease or condition such as urinary tract infection. Treatment is mostly conservative (lifestyle interventions, physiotherapy, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) and is of an empirical nature. At the level of specialised management (when primary therapy failed, diagnosis is unclear, or symptoms and/or signs are complex/severe), more elaborate assessment is generally required, including imaging, endoscopy, and urodynamics. Treatment options include invasive interventions and surgery.

Conclusions

Treatment options for UI are rapidly expanding. These EAU guidelines provide ratings of the evidence (guided by evidence-based medicine) and graded recommendations for the appropriate assessment and according treatment options and put them into clinical perspective.

### Ultrasound estimated bladder weight and measurement of bladder wall thickness – useful noninvasive methods for assessing the lower urinary tract? [^117UUP4c]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

In the last decade interest has arisen in the use of ultrasound derived measurements of bladder wall thickness, detrusor wall thickness and ultrasound estimated bladder weight as potential diagnostic tools for conditions known to induce detrusor hypertrophy. However, to date such measurements have not been adopted into clinical practice. We performed a comprehensive review of the literature to assess the potential clinical usefulness of these measurements.

Materials and Methods

A MEDLINE® search was conducted to identify all published literature up to June 2009, investigating measurements of bladder wall thickness, detrusor wall thickness and ultrasound estimated bladder weight.

Results

Measurements of bladder and detrusor wall thickness, and ultrasound estimated bladder weight have been studied in men, women and children. A convincing trend has been shown in the ability of these measurements to differentiate men with from those without bladder outlet obstruction. In addition, measurements of bladder wall thickness have revealed a considerable difference between detrusor overactivity and urodynamic stress incontinence. A number of confounding variables and a lack of standardized methodology has resulted in discrepancies among studies. Therefore, reproducible diagnostic ranges or cutoff values have not been established.

Conclusions

Ultrasound derived measurements of bladder and detrusor wall thickness, and ultrasound estimated bladder weight are potential noninvasive clinical tools for assessing the lower urinary tract.

### Mixed urinary incontinence: are there effective treatments? [^112Kx7oy]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSION

Although standard treatments for UI benefit some patients, a large unmet medical need remains. Emerging pharmacological treatments seem to offer better risk‐benefit profiles than current options, but they are still mainly targeting UUI and overactive bladder and actively excluding patients with MUI from the development phase. While the development of safe and effective UUI treatments are a worthy endeavor, it does not address the current unmet need of patients with MUI, for whom adequate treatment remains a challenge.

Geriatric emergency department guidelines — indwelling urinary catheter indications and discontinuation specify that "The patient must have an indication for use of an indwelling catheter and a physician order in the chart", and "After receiving a physician order with the appropriate indications documented, nursing will insert the indwelling catheter as per protocol, using sterile technique". Indications include "Urinary retention/obstruction", "Very close monitoring of urine output and patient unable to use urinal or bedpan", "Open wound in sacral or perineal area with urinary incontinence", "Patient too ill, fatigued or incapacitated to use alternative urine collection method", "Patient s/p recent surgery", "Management of urinary incontinence on patient's request", and "Other – needs specification and clarification documented"; other acceptable indications also include "Neurogenic bladder", "Emergent pelvic ultrasound", "Emergent surgery", "Altered mental status or unresponsive", "Urologic procedures", "Hip fracture", and "Hospice or palliative care". For discontinuation, "Indwelling catheters will be removed as soon as feasibly possible", and because "Evidence shows that catheter associated bacteriuria increases and is directly associated with catheter days", "daily catheter rounds should prompt for continued use or removal of indwelling catheters".

### Adherence to professional society guidelines among women with stress or mixed urinary incontinence [^116wafod]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple professional societies have developed evidence‐based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of female UI. These include the American Urological Association (AUA), the Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS), as well as international societies, such as the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and others. Broad consensus exists for most components of the UI care pathway, and these are listed in Table 1. Standard components of UI evaluation include patient history, physical examination, urinalysis, and postvoid residual urine (PVR) assessment. Additional testing is recommended for special populations, such as cystoscopy for patients with lower urinary tract abnormalities (e.g. microscopic hematuria) or urodynamic testing (assessment of the bladder, urethra, and pelvic floor function during urine storage and micturition) for patients with high‐grade prolapse and/or geriatric patients. After ruling out transient causes of UI and identifying complex cases that require further evaluation and/or specialist referral, a diagnosis of SUI, UUI, or MUI may be determined. Recommended treatment for all three UI subtypes follows a stepwise approach. First‐line interventions for SUI, UUI, and MUI are nonsurgical, nonpharmacologic and include pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and other behavioral therapies (e.g. bladder training, weight loss, fluid titration, caffeine reduction). Included in this guidance is the role of the physician to counsel about and offer these treatment options and an emphasis on the role of the physician or other clinician to supervise the implementation of PFMT. Recommendations around supervision are consistent with the most recent Cochrane systematic review on the subject indicating that supervised PFMT consistently yields superior outcomes when compared to unsupervised PFMT. Beyond first‐line care, treatment recommendations diverge, according to UI subtype. Continence pessaries may be helpful for women with SUI. Advanced treatment for SUI may include peri‐urethral bulking agents or surgical intervention. Pharmacologic agents, including anticholinergic agents and beta‐agonists, may be prescribed for UUI or the urgency component of MUI. Advanced treatment for UUI may include onabotulinumtoxinA detrusor chemodenervation or peripheral or sacral neuromodulation.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the initial assessment and treatment of urinary incontinence in women: a US focused review [^113Dv7bE]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify clinical practice guidelines from prominent US organizations for the initial management of urinary incontinence (UI) in women and compare them with recommendations from the International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI). The challenge of implementing guidelines in the US was also identified.

Methods

The medical literature was reviewed to identify relevant practice guidelines on the initial management of UI in community-dwelling women according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Guidelines were compared with the ICI international gold standard relating to patient identification, initial therapy, and recommendation for specialist referral. Literature on programs to implement guidelines into clinical practice was reviewed.

Results

There is general agreement on how females with UI should be initially managed based on guidelines, monographs, and technical bulletins from prominent US organizations. Though these recommendations are more than 5 years old, they are fairly similar to the latest guidelines developed by the ICI in 2001. Minor discrepancies are mainly related to the lack of updating US guidelines based on most recent knowledge. Implementing existing guidelines into clinical practice presents a challenge.

Conclusion

No evidence-based practice guidelines from prominent US organizations on the initial management of UI in women exist that are less than 5 years old, but the latest versions are in alignment with recent ICI/WHO guidelines. Although optimization of UI management may be the goal of guidances, the debate remains over whether these recommendations are actually effective in modifying practice. Simplifying and updating guidelines regularly may enhance adaptation in the initial management of UI in women.

### EAU guidelines on neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction [^115Nrmzc]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Most patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) require life-long care to maintain their quality of life (QoL) and to maximise life expectancy.

Objective

To provide a summary of the 2008 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on NLUTD and to assess the effectiveness of currently available diagnostic tools, particularly ultrasound imaging and urodynamics.

Evidence Acquisition

The recommendations provided in the 2008 EAU guidelines on NLUTD are based on a review of the literature, using online searches of Medline and other source documents published between 2004 and 2007. A level of evidence and/or a grade of recommendation have been assigned to the guidelines where possible.

Evidence Synthesis

NLUTD encompasses a wide spectrum of pathologies, and patients often require life-long, intensive medical care to maximise their life-expectancy and to maintain their QoL. Treatment must be tailored to the needs of the individual patient and, in many cases, involves a multidisciplinary team of experts. Timely diagnosis and treatment are essential if irreversible deterioration of both the upper and lower urinary tracts are to be avoided. Therapeutic decisions are made on the basis of a comprehensive medical assessment, including urodynamics to identify the type of dysfunction. Advances in investigative technologies have facilitated the noninvasive and conservative management of patients who have NLUTD.

Conclusions

The diagnosis and treatment of NLUTD, which is a highly specialised and complex field involving both urology and medicine, requires up-to-date expert advice to be readily available. The current guidelines are designed to fulfil this need.

Post-void residual urine (PVR) assessment should be documented preoperatively and the method specified (STANDARD), and it may be part of inclusion/exclusion criteria with recognition that incomplete bladder emptying preoperatively may impact postoperative voiding dysfunction; methods include catheterization or ultrasound. Other preoperative testing includes voiding/bladder diaries, which can be difficult, burdensome, and unreliable (ADDITIONAL); urodynamic studies, which increase cost and discomfort, have not been shown to improve outcomes or change operative plans in uncomplicated SUI and are not readily available (ADDITIONAL); and pad testing, which was deemed to have little value in SUI studies (UNNECESSARY).

Intestinal and bladder incontinence

Age, aphasia, impaired urinary awareness and dyskinesia are the leading causes of urinary incontinence. Pizzi et al, who monitored the urodynamic pattern in 84 patients with post-stroke urinary incontinence, suggested that post-stroke urinary incontinence was associated with different changes in urodynamic patterns, and each urodynamic model may require different treatment strategies. Ersoz et al studied the bladder emptying method at various stages after stroke and suggested that urinary retention should be assessed by bladder scan or intermittent catheterisation volume after urination.

Recommendations

It is recommended to evaluate bladder function of patients with acute stroke (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence).
Regular urination and pelvic floor muscle training should be considered for urinary incontinence in patients who had a stroke after discharge (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Intestinal function assessment should include stool hardness, frequency and time of defecation before the stroke, and a history of bowel treatment (Class IIa recommendation, Level C evidence).

Hemiplegic shoulder pain

Recommendations

It is recommended to educate patients and their families about post-stroke prevention of shoulder pain and shoulder care (Class I recommendation, Level C evidence).
Clinical evaluation of hemiplegia shoulder pain includes musculoskeletal assessment, spasm assessment, shoulder subluxation and local sensory disturbance examination (Class I recommendation, Level C evidence).
Botulinum toxin injection can effectively alleviate the pain caused (Class IIa recommendation, Level A evidence).
For patients with subluxation of the shoulder joint, position fixation and supportive devices and shoulder straps should be considered (Class IIa recommendation, Level B evidence).
Ultrasound can be used as a diagnostic tool for shoulder soft-tissue injury. Acupuncture, NMES, suprascapular nerve block, and subacromial or shoulder joint injection of corticosteroids can be used as an adjuvant treatment for hemiplegia (Class IIb recommendation, Level B evidence).

### An integrated and flexible ultrasonic device for continuous bladder volume monitoring [^1121hak2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is an umbrella term that includes conditions and diseases related to the bladder and the urethra. LUTD affected 2.3 billion people worldwide in 2018, which is expected to increase in the future due to the aging population. Common conditions that cause LUTD include benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH)and neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. For BPH-LUTD alone, the global economic burden was estimated to be more than $73 billion in 2019.

Since LUTD revolves around the abnormalities during the filling and emptying of the bladder, bladder volume monitoring is an essential tool to evaluate bladder function. At present, the gold standard measurement method is bladder catheterization (Supplementary Note 1). Despite its accuracy, it is not recommended for routine examinations due to the high adverse outcomes associated with the invasive procedure. Hence, clinicians rely on ultrasound imaging of the bladder to estimate the bladder volume, which is a quick and non-invasive method to obtain information such as post-void residual volume of the bladder (Supplementary Note 2). However, this method cannot provide continuous monitoring and necessitates trained personnel with expensive benchtop equipment. Moreover, both of these methods are applicable to patients while they are admitted to the hospital only. Outside the hospital, monitoring relies on the patients themselves to fill urinary diaries and questionnaires to provide information regarding the volume and frequency of micturition. Although continuous monitoring via implantable sensors does exist at the research level –, only patients with complicated or severe symptoms would be suitable for such invasive devices. Given the importance of bladder volume monitoring and the current status; precise and non-invasive technologies to monitor bladder volume outside the hospital settings are needed.

### Measurement of post-void residual urine [^114e9pps]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2016). Low credibility.

Aims

To present the teaching module "Measurement of Post-void residual urine".

Methods

This module has been prepared by a Working Group of the ICS Urodynamics Committee. The methodology used included comprehensive literature review, consensus formation by the members of the Working Group, and review by members of the ICS Urodynamics Committee core panel.

Results

In this ICS teaching module the evidence for and relevance of PVR measurement in patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) is summarized; in short: The interval between voiding and post-void residual (PVR) measurement should be of short duration and ultrasound bladder volume measurement is preferred to urethral catheterization. There is no universally accepted definition of a significant residual urine volume. Large PVR (> 200–300ml) may indicate marked bladder dysfunction and may predispose to unsatisfactory treatment results if for example, invasive treatment for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is undertaken. PVR does not seem to be a strong predictor of acute urinary retention and does not indicate presence of BOO specifically. Although the evidence base is limited, guidelines on assessment of LUTS generally include PVR measurement.

Conclusion

Measurement of PVR is recommended in guidelines and recommendations on the management of LUTS and urinary incontinence, but the level of evidence for this measurement is not high. This manuscript summarizes the evidence and provides practice recommendations for teaching purposes in the framework of an ICS teaching module.

### From clinical trials to routine practice: are urodynamics still useful? [^1118UT6s]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The UPSTREAM and FUTURE trials found no added benefit from routine urodynamics (UDS) in men with presumed benign prostatic obstruction or women with overactive bladder symptoms unresponsive to initial therapy. However, these population-based studies were not powered to evaluate specific subgroups for which a higher degree of diagnostic certainty could have led to better outcomes. This consensus paper argues that UDS is essential in selected cases for which comprehensive clinical assessment alone may be insufficient. A selective approach to UDS will ensure that patients receive the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^111Fyvzq]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — post-void residual (PVR) definition, measurement, and follow-up — has no universally agreed definition, and in NLUTD there is no definite upper limit defining normal or a lower limit defining abnormal; a volume of greater than 300 cc has been suggested as a definition for non-neurogenic chronic urinary retention. An elevated PVR that could be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary tract infection (UTI), or upper tract deterioration is generally considered abnormal and should prompt further evaluation with multichannel UDS and treatment as indicated. PVR can be measured by transabdominal bladder scanner, real-time ultrasound (US), or urethral catheterization; catheterization is the most accurate but most invasive, and the accuracy of transabdominal US may be compromised by factors such as obesity, prior lower abdominal or pelvic surgery, ascites or pelvic cysts, and vaginal prolapse. A single elevated PVR may not reflect emptying ability and should be confirmed with a second measurement at another visit; a PVR should be performed at the time of diagnosis and may be checked periodically thereafter, recognizing that some NLUTD patients cannot empty on command and that a low PVR does not absolutely exclude significant NLUTD risk.

### Physiologic outcome measures for urinary incontinence [^117NCvkm]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Physiologic outcome measures are divided into 2 groups: (1) measures that visualize, quantify, and analyze the reasons for urine loss and (2) measures that assess the anatomy and neuromuscular function of continence-related structures. Few of the frequently used physiologic outcome measures have been rigorously tested. The evidence in support of their use derives mainly from case series information and expert opinion. Perineal pad testing is used to quantify urine leakage associated with stress incontinence. One-hour pad tests are commonly used for clinical trials and office visits; 24- and 48-hour tests are more reliable and reproducible. Urodynamic testing simultaneously assesses bladder and urethral function during bladder filling and emptying to help guide therapy and identify patients who are at risk for surgical failure. Testing usually includes (1) uroflowmetry, an assessment of voiding without catheters in place; (2) cystometry, which assesses bladder sensation, capacity, compliance, and inappropriate detrusor activity during filling; (3) urethral pressure profilometry, to gauge urethral closing pressures and pressure transmission ratios; (4) leak-point pressure, the minimum intra-abdominal pressure required to cause incontinence, which serves as a measure of urethral function; and (5) pressure flow studies, which diagnose obstruction by evaluating detrusor pressure and flow rate during voiding. The cotton swab test is used to assess bladder neck mobility after surgical interventions. Using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system, researchers can describe pelvic support in a standardized, reproducible fashion. Applications of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in urogynecology are promising but remain in the investigational stages.

Predicting post-repair overactive bladder

Three papers considered the preoperative risk factors for persistent or de novo overactive bladder (OAB; symptom of urinary frequency and urgency with or without the complaint of urgency incontinence) following surgical repair. Two studies used symptoms to assess for postoperative OAB, one used urodynamic assessment post-operatively to assess for DO. Pre-operative DO was not predictive of post-repair OAB or DO; however, one study found that preoperative OAB symptoms are more likely to resolve in the absence of preoperative DO.

Summary: assessment of voiding dysfunction in women with POP

Voiding dysfunction in patients with POP is common but evaluation techniques provide limited information.
The post-void residual volume estimation is commonly used for assessment of voiding dysfunction. The most commonly used value for diagnosing an elevated post-void residual is 100 mL by catheter or ultrasound.
Severity of POP is associated with reduced maximum and average flow rate, and voiding dysfunction is associated with the cystoscopic finding of trabeculation; however, there is no demonstrated benefit for using any of these methods in the routine assessment of the patient with POP.
Reduction of POP by pessary or packing often resolves voiding dysfunction and if this is noted on evaluation, it has a high predictive value for resolution of voiding difficulty after surgical POP repair.
Postoperative persistence of voiding dysfunction was found to be associated with diabetes, age, PVR > 200 ml, P det max < 10 and failure of a pessary to resolve voiding difficulty.
Preoperative urodynamic assessment was the most commonly utilized diagnostic tool for DO. Preoperative urodynamic diagnosis of DO did not change management, but the absence of preoperative urodynamic DO suggests that symptoms of OAB are more likely to resolve after surgery.

Further research

Further research is needed in the development of predictive models for persistence of voiding difficulty or DO postoperatively to aid in patient counseling.
Understanding how varying degrees of POP and how prolapse of different compartments affects voiding is poorly understood and needs further research.
Further study to assess the effect of voiding dysfunction on the patient both from a symptomatic and a morbidity perspective (recurrent UTIs, upper urinary tract disease) is not currently well understood

### Correlation of introital ultrasound with LUTS after sling surgery [^111JXhxR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This study aims to assess the role of the introital ultrasound in the evaluation of patients with low urinary tract symptoms after sling surgery for incontinence.

Methods

From 2000 till 2007, a total of 31 patients underwent sub-urethral tape placement for stress urinary incontinence and developed thereafter lower urinary tract symptoms. The urological evaluation consisted of a detailed medical history, a urogynecologic examination, a complete urodynamic exam, a measurement of the post-void residue, and an introital ultrasound. All patients filled up the MHU (Mesure du Handicap Urinaire) questionnaire. These patients had a transvaginal tape lysis under local anesthesia. We correlated the ultrasound findings with postoperative clinical success and failure.

Results

Thirty-one patients with low urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to sling placement underwent a tape lysis. Median age was 63.1 ± 10.9 years, and the median time between the anti-incontinence surgery and the tape lysis was 21.5 ± 16.2 months. Seven patients had only obstructive symptoms, 15 patients had obstructive and overactive bladder symptoms, and nine patients had overactive bladder symptoms. Introital ultrasound revealed an abnormality of the tape in 26 patients. Ten patients had a position abnormality, five patients had a urethral distortion by the tape, and 11 patients had the previous two abnormalities. After tape lysis, the obstructive symptoms disappeared in 19 out of 22 patients (86%), and the overactive bladder symptoms disappeared in 16 out of 24 patients (66%). In case of ultrasound anomaly, the tape lysis was efficient in 23 out of 26 patients (89%), while in the absence of ultrasound anomaly (five patients) the tape lysis was not useful in treating LUTS in all patients.

Conclusion

Ultrasonography is a useful tool in investigating postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms and in the selection of patients who will benefit from tape lysis.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^111E5X9U]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics background and risks — In clinical practice, the role of invasive UDS testing is not clearly defined, and urologists generally accept that conservative or empiric, non-invasive treatments may be instituted without urodynamic testing. Many types of urodynamic testing require urethral catheterization and include cystometry, PFS and VUDS including urethral function testing, and such testing subjects patients to risks of urethral instrumentation including infection, urethral trauma and pain; thus, the clinician must weigh whether urodynamic tests offer additional diagnostic benefit beyond symptom assessment, physical examination and other diagnostic testing. Uroflowmetry and ultrasound PVR may be appropriate non-invasive tests given the clinical scenario and the options for treatment. In the evaluation and treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), the literature is scarce and inconsistent with data to elucidate the optimal role of urodynamics in guiding therapy, yet there may be a role for various types of UDS testing in order to exclude complicating factors and potentially guiding therapy.

Despite being categorized as low-risk, they are not at zero risk of urological manifestations of NLUTD and may develop new incontinence or difficulty emptying, recurrent UTIs, stones, or upper tract/renal function deterioration, and if their urinary tract condition has changed over time and a clinical assessment changes their risk stratification they should be followed up according to their new category.

### ACOG guidelines on urinary incontinence in women… [^114a8Rb7]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

The inability to demonstrate the sign of stress incontinence during simple bladder filling and cough stress testing correlates with the absence of urodynamic stress incontinence. However, interpretation of these tests can be difficult. To maximize diagnostic accuracy, tests in patients with borderline or negative results should be repeated. Cystometric testing is indicated as part of the evaluation of more complex disorders of bladder filling and voiding, such as the presence of neurologic disease and other comorbid conditions, but there are only limited data suggesting its need in the routine evaluation of women with urinary incontinence. Multichannel or subtracted cystometry allows more precise measurements of detrusor pressures with filling and voiding, although both false-negative and false-positive results routinely are found with cystometry.

No studies have determined whether the addition of multichannel cystometry or video assessment over simple filling cystometry improves diagnostic accuracy or outcomes after treatment. Other complex urodynamic tests, such as pressure-flow voiding studies, uroflometry, and electromyography of the urethral sphincter, are available for the assessment of complex and neurogenic causes of urinary incontinence and voiding disorders. Cystoscopy is indicated for the evaluation of patients with incontinence who also have hematuria or pyuria; irritative voiding symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence in the absence of reversible causes; bladder pain; recurrent cystitis; suburethral mass; and when urodynamic testing fails to duplicate symptoms of urinary incontinence. Bladder lesions are found in less than 2 percent of patients with incontinence; therefore, cystoscopy should not be performed routinely in patients with incontinence to exclude neoplasm.

Not all patients with urinary incontinence need urodynamic testing before surgery. These patients include nonpregnant women who lose urine only with physical exertion and those who have normal voiding habits; no associated neurologic or physical findings; no history of anti-incontinence or radical pelvic surgery; a hypermobile urethra, pliable vaginal wall, and adequate vaginal capacity on physical examination; and a normal postvoid residual volume. Long-term data suggest that Burch colposuspension and sling procedures have similar objective cure rates; therefore, treatment selection should be based on patient characteristics and physician experience. Tension-free vaginal tape and open Burch colposuspension have similar success rates.

### Post-radical prostatectomy urinary incontinence: is there any discrepancy between medical reports and patients' perceptions? [^116T2aL9]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Initial management of PPI comprises detailed history taking, physical examination, objective evaluation of symptoms, and a voiding diary. According to European Association of Urology guideline, some tests such as urine chemistry and bladder ultrasound, including measurement of post-void residual volume, must be included. The guideline states that standardized questionnaires are valuable as additional tools, particularly in the clinical trial setting. There are multiple validated tools available: International Consultation on Incontinence-Short Form, Patient's Global Impression of Improvement Score and the UCLA/RAND-Prostate Cancer Index Urinary Function Score.

As described by Avery et al. ICIQ-SF is a brief, but robust assessment of impact of urinary incontinence, which may be quickly completed with little data loss (1.6% on average), and most items show moderate to strong concordance with other questionnaires. In our study, we subjectively determined PPI severity as reported by patients, and applied the ICIQ-SF questionnaire by phone to assess the current severity of the condition. Most patients (43.9%) rate their incontinence as moderate, however, 80.6% of subjects score as severe/very severe based on the questionnaire. Improvement rate of 23,4% has been shown in literature between 24 and 48 months after radical prostatectomy. In our study, despite the overall improvement in incontinence rate over time according to patients' report (from 70 to 46,2% between last visit and phone call), the incontinence's profile declined since the proportion of patients with severe incontinence increased from 35 to 80,6%. We hypothesize that this may be related to the long follow-up of our study and the impact of increasing age in incontinence's severity. Evaluating the change patterns of urinary incontinence over a 5-year time span in 827 subjects, Iglesias et al reported a progression of slight and moderate incontinence to moderate and severe degrees, whereas severe UI remained unchanged in 40.1%.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^111Cqh7P]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — initial evaluation of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) states that clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics (UDS), cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB, and that clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as UDS, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging, in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. The initial evaluation of patients with symptoms of OAB should include a medical history, physical examination, and urinalysis, and additional components of an OAB evaluation may also include post-void residual (PVR) measurement, voiding diary, and a symptom questionnaire. There is no need to obtain UDS, cystoscopy, or upper tract imaging in the initial evaluation of a patient with OAB symptoms, but further evaluation with UDS, cystoscopy, and/or urinary tract imaging can be considered to clarify diagnosis when diagnostic uncertainty or abnormal findings exist and can also be considered if patients have a suboptimal or unexpected response to standard OAB therapy.

### Pelvic floor ultrasound in incontinence: what's in it for the surgeon? [^116zhN57]. International Urogynecology Journal (2011). Low credibility.

There is increasing interest in imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance and ultrasound amongst pelvic floor surgeons, as evidenced by the number of workshops and conference presentations in this field. Ultrasound is employed more commonly, due to much lower costs, greater accessibility and practicability. Consequently, this review focuses on sonography. At this time, imaging is probably under-utilised in urogynaecology and female urology, although it has the potential to greatly benefit our patients. In this review, I will outline the main uses of imaging in the work-up of women with urinary incontinence, before and after treatment, and focus on areas in which this benefit to patients and clinicians is most evident.

### Evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in females [^111uThSR]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Ongoing controversy exists as to the extent of the necessary evaluation of the female presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms. Most would agree that a detailed history, a physical examination and a urine analysis are essential components of the initial evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in the female. Beyond these assessments, however, there are no universally accepted guidelines or recommendations. In selected patients, a urodynamic, endoscopic and/or radiographic evaluation may be indicated. When further investigation of lower urinary tract symptoms is being considered, individual test characteristics, including sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and accuracy, must be balanced against such factors as cost, morbidity, discomfort, availability and invasiveness. This review discusses some of the recent reports, controversies and developments in the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in the female, and briefly reviews the most recent relevant International Continence Society subcommittee publications.

Recent Findings

The proceedings of the International Consultation on Incontinence, as well as recent publications by a number of its subcommittees, have provided some guidance for the structured evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in the female, especially with regard to the investigation of urinary incontinence. The role of urodynamics and radiographic imaging continues to be refined. Magnetic resonance imaging is, at present, still primarily a research tool in the evaluation of lower urinary tract disorders in the female; however, a clinical role for this technology is evolving.

Summary

The goal of a diagnostic evaluation is the accurate characterization of lower urinary tract symptoms for the purposes of treatment. Ideally, a brief, low-cost, non-invasive evaluation would provide a high degree of diagnostic accuracy. However, existing technology is limited in this regard. Until future refinements permit a completely non-invasive, cost-effective and accurate analysis of female lower urinary tract symptoms, existing technology must be appropriately utilized. Well-conducted, evidence-based, prospective studies are needed.

### Application of guidelines to the evaluation of the male patient with urgency and / or incontinence [^116c7og5]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review and evaluate the evidence from contemporary evidence-based guidelines regarding the assessment of men with urinary urgency and/or incontinence.

Recent Findings

There are a number of evidence-based guidelines which describe the pathways for assessing men with the symptoms of urgency and/or incontinence. We summarize the conclusions of the European Association of Urology, American Urological Association and National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines.

Summary

All guidelines recommend a directed history, examination (including digital rectal examination), urinalysis and bladder diary as being essential in the assessment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms, although there are no high levels of evidence studies to support this. Creatinine estimation and prostate-specific antigen are recommended in selected groups of men, the latter after appropriate counselling. Uroflowmetry with postvoid residual assessment is recommended for at specialist assessment. Pad tests may be useful to quantify leakage. Ultrasound assessment of prostatic size and protrusion into the bladder base may be useful. Cystometry is recommended for men considering prostatic surgery, although there is a poor level of evidence underpinning this. Noninvasive surrogates for cystometry, such as penile plethysmography, lack sufficient evidence to allow recommendations to be made.

### History and physical… [^114iEfsz]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

OVERACTIVE BLADDER Involuntary loss of urine preceded by a strong urge to void, whether or not the bladder is full, is a symptom of the condition commonly referred to as "urge incontinence. " To expand the number and types of patients eligible for clinical trials, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration adopted the term "overactive bladder" to describe a clinical syndrome that includes not only urge incontinence, but urgency, frequency, dysuria and nocturia as well. Other commonly used terms such as detrusor instability and detrusor hyperreflexia refer to involuntary detrusor contractions observed during urodynamic studies. In this article, the term overactive bladder will be used in place of the terms urge incontinence, detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia.

Some cases of overactive bladder can be attributed to specific conditions, such as acute or chronic urinary tract infection, bladder cancer and bladder stones, but most cases result from an idiopathic inability to suppress detrusor contractions. While simple or complex urodynamic studies may be performed to make the definitive diagnosis of detrusor instability or detrusor hyperreflexia, most patients may be treated without undergoing invasive testing. Table 1 lists a few key questions that can provide information on the severity of urinary incontinence and help distinguish the major subtypes. If the patient answers affirmatively to these screening questions, a 24-hour "bladder diary" can be given to the patient to complete. The diary entries can then be reviewed at a subsequent office visit. An algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of urinary incontinence is provided in Figure 2.

The lumbosacral nerve roots should be assessed by checking deep tendon reflexes, lower extremity strength, sharp/dull sensation and the bulbocavernosus and clitoral sacral reflexes. Abnormal findings such as deep tendon hyperreflexia or absence of the bulbocavernosus reflex should alert the physician to possible underlying neurologic lesions contributing to urinary incontinence. Likewise, pelvic floor electrical stimulation is also effective in treating women with overactive bladder. Results of one prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 20 revealed that pelvic floor electrical stimulation resulted in a 50 percent cure rate of detrusor instability. This procedure is widely used in Europe, but acceptance has been slower in the United States.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^115DhGhS]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — post-void residual (PVR) assessment in LUTS states that the potential benefits of measuring PVR include identifying significant urinary retention and decreasing potential morbidity, and while no conclusive evidence exists to support or refute its use to predict treatment outcomes, it may be used on the basis of expert opinion as a safety measure to evaluate for significant urinary retention both initially and during subsequent monitoring; risks/harms of catheterization are low and include UTI or urethral trauma and can be eliminated with ultrasound determination of PVR, but because measurement of PVR may be associated with false positives and negatives and thus could lead to inappropriate treatment, it is recommended that decisions not be based on a single measurement.

### Beyond urodynamics: non-invasive approaches to diagnosing detrusor underactivity in men with lower urinary tract symptoms-a systematic review [^112xUUSg]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Non-invasive diagnostic methods, including ultrasound parameters, biomarkers, UFL analysis, symptom questionnaires, clinical characteristics, and AI integration, show promise in diagnosing DU and offer safer, more convenient alternatives to invasive UDS. However, many methods face limitations such as a lack of accuracy and external validation, as well as variability in test conditions, which affect their reliability and applicability. Our work provides a valuable resource for clinicians seeking to optimize diagnostic strategies for DU by consolidating evidence on the efficacy and limitations of these non-invasive tests. Furthermore, our analysis highlights important areas that require further investigation to refine existing methods, examine their applicability, and create diagnostic tools customized for specific patient subgroups.

### Critical appraisal of guidelines for daytime urinary incontinence in children: evaluation of quality and recommendations on diagnostics [^1167tGCm]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3.1 Recommendations on Diagnostic Evaluation

3.3.1.1 History Taking and Voiding Diary

Medical history taking, with or without the use of specific questionnaires, and the use of a voiding diary for 2 or 3 days, were stated as primary evaluation in all guidelines (Table 3). Two did not specify a timespan for the voiding chart, and one advised to keep an incontinence diary as well for 14 days.

Table 3
Recommendations on diagnostic evaluation of a child with DUI.

3.3.1.2 Physical Examination

Physical examination was always advised, but its extensiveness varied. The ICCS did not specify what must be examined. Congruous advice was to investigate at least the abdomen, spine, and genitals. Neurological examination (with or without gait) was mentioned in five guidelines.

3.3.1.3 Urinalysis

Urinalysis using dipstick was advised in every guideline. A urine culture was recommended for all children in three, and only for those with suspicion of a urinary tract infection (UTI) based on history or urinalysis in two. Urine cultures were not mentioned in two guidelines. The NSW did not specify when to perform a urine culture.

3.3.1.4 Uroflowmetry

There was no consensus on the routine use of uroflowmetry. Three guidelines recommended at least one measurement in each child. Other guidelines only demanded uroflowmetry in case of refractory or complicated UI. One guideline did not mention uroflowmetry, and another (primary care guideline) referred to uroflowmetry as a diagnostic tool for secondary care.

3.3.1.5 Ultrasound (Us)

One guideline advised an US of the bladder, one an US of the upper urinary tract, and three advise both in all children with DUI. Two guidelines recommended a renal US only when there is suspicion of comorbidities such as co‐existing UTIs, but an abdominal US to determine the diameter of the rectum in all children. One guideline referred to the secondary care for US.

3.3.1.6 Invasive Examination

More invasive examinations such as cystoscopy or urodynamic studies were reserved for a select group of patients with UI. All guidelines, except the RCH, recommended this when the UI was refractory to prior treatment, when there was a suspicion of anatomical abnormalities or before invasive treatment was started.

### A phase II dose-ranging study of mirabegron in patients with overactive bladder [^116ncLfs]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

At visit 1, eligible patients received a micturition diary, used to evaluate mirabegron efficacy, which was to be completed during the 3 days preceding all visits after screening. For each micturition or incontinence episode, patients rated the degree of associated urgency on the five-point Patient's Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (0, no urgency; 1, mild urgency; 2, moderate urgency; 3, severe urgency; and 4, urge incontinence). At visit 2, micturition diary scores were checked against inclusion criteria to confirm study eligibility.

Overactive bladder symptoms and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB) and ICIQ-OAB QOL (ICIQ-OABqol) questionnaires. Patients' assessment of treatment benefit was also evaluated, starting at visit 2, with the question "has the treatment been of any benefit to you?" (possible responses: "no", "yes, a little", or "yes, very much"). These were assessed at all five study visits after screening.

Observed and spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) were assessed at all visits, post-screening. Vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures) were measured by the investigator at visit 1 (screening) and by the patient in triplicate, twice-daily (BID), during the 3-day diary period preceding each visit in accordance with available guidelines. 12-lead ECGs were performed at visits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. Blood and urine samples for safety assessments (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis and urine culture) were collected by a central laboratory at visits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and PVR was assessed by ultrasonography or bladder scan at visits 1 and 6.

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1996) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Institutional Review Board and local Independent Ethics Committee approval for the protocol and amendments was obtained and patients provided written informed consent before any procedures.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^114y1LDm]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — post‑void residual (PVR) and incomplete emptying: Clinicians may obtain a post-void residual in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to exclude incomplete emptying or urinary retention, especially in patients with concomitant voiding or emptying symptoms (Clinical Principle). PVR should be performed immediately after voiding with a non-invasive ultrasound bladder scanner, and straight catheterization is acceptable if a bladder scanner is unavailable. It is important to note that there is no accepted volume threshold that defines elevated PVR, although most RCTs evaluating medication for OAB used a PVR of 150–200 mL as an exclusion criterion. The use of antimuscarinic medications in patients with an elevated PVR may exacerbate incomplete emptying. If a patient has a low functional bladder capacity (< 300 mL), the clinician can use bladder voiding efficiency (voided volume/bladder capacity) to evaluate for incomplete emptying.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1121Q34M]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — diagnosis of urinary incontinence in women states that physicians should proactively ask female patients about bothersome urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms as part of a routine review of systems, clinicians should take a focused history and ask specific questions about time of onset, symptoms, and frequency, and clinicians should also do a focused physical examination and evaluate neurologic symptoms. An example prompt is, "Do you have a problem with urinary incontinence (or your bladder) that is bothersome enough that you would like to know more about how it could be treated?", and this quality improvement intervention has been shown to increase appropriate care by 15% in patients aged 75 years or older.

Clinical Principle. In some patients, additional procedures and measures may be necessary to validate an OAB diagnosis, exclude other disorders and fully inform the treatment plan. At the clinician's discretion, a urine culture and/or post-void residual assessment may be performed and information from bladder diaries and/or symptom questionnaires may be obtained.

### Ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness in different forms of detrusor overactivity [^1171Hf95]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Aims of this study were to compare the ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness (BWT) in women with different urodynamic diagnosis and to correlate BWT to the different urodynamic findings of detrusor overactivity (DO).

Methods

Two hundred forty seven women with urinary symptoms have been prospectively enrolled. Urodynamics and transvaginal ultrasound BWT were performed. Patients were divided into four urodynamic subgroups. BWT of women with DO was compared with the BWT of any other subgroup.

Results

Women with DO had a BWT value significantly higher (p < 0.0001). A cut-off of 6.5 mm for BWT had a positive predictive value of 100% for all DO. We use ROC curves to analyze the BWT for urgency urinary incontinence (AUC 0.645 95% CI 0.57–0.72) and the BWT for "pure DO" (AUC 0.702 95% CI 0.64–0.76) and for "all DO" (AUC 0.704 95% CI 0.64–0.77) vs other urodynamic diagnoses.

Conclusions

The ultrasound BWT showed a highly significant association with DO. However, the performance of this test cannot currently replace urodynamic testing.

### EAU guidelines on assessment and nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence [^1132cGGz]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

The European Association of Urology guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI) have been updated in cyclical fashion with successive major chapters being revised each year. The sections on assessment, diagnosis, and nonsurgical treatment have been updated as of mid-2016.

Objective

We present a condensed version of the full guideline on assessment and nonsurgical management of UI, with the aim of improving accessibility and increasing their dissemination.

Evidence Acquisition

Our literature search was updated from the previous cut-off of July 2010 up to April 2016. Evidence synthesis was carried out by a pragmatic review of current systematic reviews and any newer subsequent high-quality studies, based on Population, Interevention, Comparator, and Outcome questions. Appraisal was conducted by an international panel of experts, working on a strictly nonprofit and voluntary basis, to develop concise evidence statements and action-based recommendations using modified Oxford and GRADE criteria.

Evidence Synthesis

The guidelines include algorithms that summarise the suggested pathway for standard, uncomplicated patients with UI and are more useable in daily practice. The full version of the guideline is available at http://uroweb.org/guideline/urinary-incontinence/.

Conclusions

These updated guidelines provide an evidence-based summary of the assessment and nonsurgical management of UI, together with a clear clinical algorithm and action-based recommendations. Although these guidelines are applicable to a standard patient, it must be remembered that therapy should always be tailored to individual patients' needs and circumstances.

Patient Summary

Urinary incontinence is a very common condition which negatively impacts patient's quality of life. Several types of incontinence exist and since the treatments will vary, it is important that the diagnostic evaluation establishes which type is present. The diagnosis should also identify patients who need rapid referral to an appropriate specialist. These guidelines aim to provide sensible and practical evidence-based guidance on the clinical problem of urinary incontinence.

### Correlation between urodynamics and perineal ultrasound in female patients with urinary incontinence [^1148BEib]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

We performed urodynamics and perineal ultrasound in female patients with urinary incontinence to assess morphology and function of the bladder base-urethra complex and of the detrusor muscle, and to find the correlation between these investigations in the diagnosis of (a) bladder neck and urethral hypermobility and (b) detrusor overactivity; we wanted to compare the tolerabililty of the urodynamic investigation and of the perineal ultrasound.

Methods

We considered 66 female patients referred to our outpatient clinic for urinary incontinence; we also studied 14 healthy control patients. After accurate case-history collection and physical examination, urodynamic investigation and perineal ultrasound were performed, with recording of parameters specific to both investigations. The statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test, and Spearman correlation test. The tolerability index between the diagnostic investigations performed was assessed by a 3-point scale suggested by the patient.

Results

In patients with stress incontinence the posterior urethro-vesical angle, the angle of urethral inclination, and the proximal pubo-urethral distance are significantly different under stress compared to the resting phase; in patients with urge incontinence, the detrusor wall is thicker and is accompanied by an increase in opening detrusor pressure and detrusor pressure at maximum flow; it is also accompanied by detrusor overactivity with increased urethral functional length. Increased urethral functional length is suggested on axial US images by alteration of its normal characteristic target-like appearance with four concentric rings of different echogenicity. In all cases the tolerability of perineal ultrasound has been higher than that of urodynamics.

Conclusions

There is a good correlation between urodynamic and perineal ultrasound in the diagnosis of bladder neck and urethral hypermobility; perineal ultrasound can also be useful in the diagnosis of urge incontinence. Functional compressive urethral obstruction can be diagnosed on the basis of the ultrasound aspect of the urethral sphincter.

### A new automated ultrasound quantification of urethral mobility for stress urinary incontinence: a feasibility study [^11521qqw]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vision, Next Steps, and Limitations

Our vision for this innovative technique in analyzing pelvic floor mobility is to summarize the diagnostic information into a comprehensive "report" format that physicians can readily use to evaluate urinary incontinence. An illustrative example of such a report summary is presented in Figure 10. These reports have the potential to aid physicians in stratifying patients, effectively determining who would most benefit from each type of surgical or non‐surgical intervention. This ability to differentiate is crucial for developing personalized management plans tailored to individual patient needs. Future studies, linking treatment outcomes to specific parameters, can identify the most predictive factors and determine their cutoffs. These studies help understand the normal range of urethral movement, the impact of surgical interventions, and treatment outcomes. This ensures reports not only summarize data but also guide clinical decision‐making. They provide reference ranges that clinicians can use to make informed treatment decisions and recommendations.

Figure 10
Sample urethral mobility "report" for stress urinary incontinence evaluation. The figure presents an example report showcasing key metrics evaluating urethral mobility. The displayed metrics are illustrative and will be expanded to encompass a broader range of relevant quantities of interest in the final analysis.

It is important to recognize current limitations and areas for future research. We have not yet examined the timing of muscle activation, which might be of clinical importance. In this study and at the methodology development stage, the focus was on urethral mobility and Valsalva maneuvers; however, evaluation of cough and pelvic muscle contraction are feasible as well and remain the topic of our ongoing research. Furthermore, a wider range of conditions, including women with pelvic organ prolapse, needs to be studied. Our current analysis relies on manual selection of ROIs, which inevitably introduces some variability. A key goal for future development is to employ machine learning for segmentation of TPUS images of the pelvic floor, enabling automatic ROI selection. This would streamline the process and further reduce variability. Our analysis currently focuses only on urethral motion from rest to maximum excursion, without examining any potential hysteresis. Similarly, we have not yet quantified changes in urethral size (bladder base and neck configuration) or assessed urethral funneling during motion. These are all factors of potential significance in SUI diagnosis and management. Addressing some of these limitations remains a topic of our ongoing research.

### Systematic review of the accuracy of ultrasound as the method of measuring bladder wall thickness in the diagnosis of detrusor overactivity [^116stA3N]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

A systematic review was carried out to study the hypothesis that bladder wall thickness (BWT) on ultrasound is accurate in diagnosing detrusor overactivity (DO).

Methods

Databases were searched from database inception to January 2009. Two reviewers independently selected articles and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and results.

Results

Five out of 190 screened studies were included. There were variations in the quality, methods of performing the ultrasound and urodynamics studies, and the format of reporting findings. BWT was more in women with DO than those with other types of incontinence in four out of five studies. Using a 5-mm cutoff (two studies), sensitivity varied between 40% and 84%, and specificity 78–89%.

Conclusions

There is lack of data to reliably estimate accuracy of BWT in DO.

### Preoperative ultrasound predictors of treatment failure after 24 months of transobturator midurethral sling [^111PMcKy]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

To evaluate the role of pelvic floor ultrasound (PF-US) in predicting persistent urinary incontinence after tension-free vaginal obturator tape (TVT-O) placement surgery and to identify prognostic ultrasound parameters.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of 74 patients who underwent TVT-O placement for stress urinary incontinence (UI) or stress-predominant mixed UI. Preoperative assessment included clinical evaluation, urinary diary, validated questionnaires, and PF-US to measure bladder neck mobility and descent, presence of urethral funneling, urethral length, and bladder wall thickness (BWT). Surgical success was defined as resolution of incontinence at 24 months postoperatively.

Results

At 24 months, 19% of patients presented with persistent incontinence. Preoperative factors associated with surgical failure were age, body mass index, BWT at dome, anterior wall and average BWT, urethral length and urethral funneling. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only preoperative ultrasound findings were associated with UI persistence, including the presence of urethral funneling, a BWT greater than 7 mm at the dome of the bladder, and a urethral length longer than 45 mm.

Conclusion

Preoperative ultrasound is a valuable tool to predict functional outcomes of TVT-O surgery. Preoperative assessment of urethral funneling, BWT at dome and urethral length may help identify patients at higher risk of surgical failure with persistent incontinence. Integration of ultrasound into routine evaluation could improve patient selection and surgical planning.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^116cL2UY]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics — Guideline Statement 8 states: Clinicians should counsel patients with urgency incontinence and mixed incontinence that the absence of DO on a single urodynamic study does not exclude it as a causative agent for their symptoms. UDS may not diagnose DO even in patients who are very symptomatic; therefore, urodynamic findings should be interpreted in the context of the global assessment, including examination, diaries and residual urine as well as other pertinent information. It is equally prudent in many cases to reserve urodynamic testing until after a failed empiric treatment or following consideration of a form of invasive therapy, and in these situations UDS is important in determining the presence or absence of other factors (e.g. SUI, BOO) that could influence treatment decisions.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^111Ci3kr]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining urodynamic studies in patients with overactive bladder not adequately responding to pharmacotherapy or minimally invasive therapies or procedures to further evaluate bladder function and exclude other disorders.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^111CuQRg]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for urinary incontinence in men, more specifically with respect to urodynamic testing, AUA/SUFU 2012 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining multi-channel filling cystometry to determine whether detrusor overactivity or other abnormalities of bladder filling/urine storage are present in patients with LUTS, particularly when invasive, potentially morbid, or irreversible treatments are considered.

### International consultation on incontinence-research society (ICI-RS) report on non-invasive urodynamics: the need of standardization of ultrasound bladder and detrusor wall thickness measurements to quantify bladder wall hypertrophy [^112XRyq9]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ultrasonic measurements of urinary bladders are suitable to quantify bladder wall hypertrophy due to bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor overactivity, or neurogenic bladder dysfunction in adult men or women and in children. Quantification of bladder wall hypertrophy seems to be useful for the assessment of diseases, prediction of treatment outcomes, and longitudinal studies investigating disease development and progression.

Measurement Techniques

Four distinct measurement techniques have been published using bladder wall thickness (BWT), detrusor wall thickness (DWT), or ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) assessed by suprapubic or transvaginal positioning of ultrasound probes and different bladder filling volumes. As a result, different threshold and reference values were established causing confusion. This ICI-RS report summarizes the agreements of different research groups in terms of ultrasonic BWT or DWT measurements, critically discusses the four ultrasonic measurement techniques, suggests criteria for quality control, and proposes future research activities to unify measurement strategies.

Proposed Standardization and Research

For quality control, all future reports should provide information about frequency of the ultrasound probe, bladder filling volume at measurement, if BWT, DWT, or UEBW was measured, enlargement factor of the ultrasound image, and one ultrasound image with marker positioning. The ICI-RS intends to found a standardization committee that will initiate and judge studies on ultrasonic bladder wall measurements to clarify the most suitable, most accurate, and least invasive measurement technique.
