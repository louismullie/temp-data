## Question

does rosaces respond to steroid cream

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether steroid creams help rosacea and what the evidence-based stance is on using topical corticosteroids in rosacea. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about authoritative labeling and guideline recommendations. Then, I should verify the clinical evidence on steroid-induced rosacea and whether steroids worsen or improve disease. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology to see if there is a mechanistic basis for harm. After that, I need to check what to do if someone is already using steroids on the face. Finally, I will review evidence-based alternatives and synthesize a clear recommendation with safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that often settles the question quickly. Multiple FDA labels explicitly instruct to avoid topical corticosteroids on the face and specifically prohibit their use in rosacea and perioral dermatitis, citing risks such as HPA axis suppression and paradoxical worsening; examples include fluocinonide 0.1% (Vanos and generics) and clobetasol propionate 0.05%, which state "should not be used in the treatment of rosacea or perioral dermatitis" and "avoid use on the face" [^117Xh7Vr] [^113HeYae] [^114hXjZB] [^114e42P1] [^113sKsrC]. Wait, let me verify a lower-potency example too: fluticasone propionate 0.05% carries the same contraindication for rosacea and perioral dermatitis, reinforcing that this is a class-wide warning rather than potency-specific [^114RZsft].

> Next, I should review guideline consensus to ensure this isn't just labeling language. The British Association of Dermatologists 2021 guideline recommends first-line topical therapies of ivermectin, metronidazole, or azelaic acid for papulopustular rosacea and brimonidine or oxymetazoline for persistent erythema, with no role for topical corticosteroids in rosacea management algorithms [^112aiQxr] [^114SfPXd] [^112P2Ld5]. Hold on, I should double-check that no major guideline endorses steroids; indeed, contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews consistently omit topical steroids as therapy and instead emphasize trigger avoidance, gentle skin care, and these approved topical agents [^114mK59H] [^113Q74Cw] [^112P2Ld5].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence on steroid-induced rosacea, because this directly addresses whether steroids help or hurt. Prolonged facial use of topical corticosteroids can precipitate steroid-induced rosacea, a recognized iatrogenic entity characterized by papules, pustules, telangiectasia, and burning that often flares on withdrawal; this is well described in dermatology literature and case series, and is mechanistically linked to steroid exposure on the face [^116Z1PAD] [^1125o9iu]. Wait, let me verify management guidance in this scenario: expert reviews and case-based literature recommend discontinuation of the steroid and treatment with anti-inflammatory alternatives such as calcineurin inhibitors or antibiotics, not continuation or tapering of steroids, which can perpetuate the cycle [^114i1yF9] [^114i1yF9] [^114Bf3sW].

> But wait, what if a patient reports transient improvement with a steroid — does that change the calculus? Initially, steroids may blunt erythema via vasoconstriction, but this is typically followed by rebound and worsening inflammation; moreover, steroids can mask infections and promote atrophy and telangiectasia on facial skin, which is thin and highly permeable [^111wVvGA]. Hold on, I should verify whether any high-quality trials support steroids for rosacea; I find none, and major evidence syntheses do not list topical corticosteroids as effective therapies for rosacea, aligning with the absence from guidelines [^116Z1PAD] [^114idnQX].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure there isn't a subgroup that might benefit. Rosacea features dysregulated innate and adaptive immunity with a prominent Th17-polarized response. Glucocorticoids can paradoxically induce CCL20 in keratinocytes, amplifying Th17 recruitment and potentially worsening inflammation in rosacea, which provides a plausible mechanistic basis for steroid insensitivity or aggravation in this disease [^111YzFxB] [^1112mk4i]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought steroids might uniformly suppress inflammation here as in other dermatoses, but this CCL20 mechanism suggests a context-specific, proinflammatory effect in rosacea that undermines their utility and safety in this indication [^111YzFxB].

> Next, I should review what to do if a patient is currently using facial steroids. I need to ensure we advise complete discontinuation rather than tapering, because tapering can perpetuate steroid-induced dermatoses; then treat with evidence-based anti-inflammatory agents and gentle skin care while counseling about a temporary flare during withdrawal, which is expected and manageable [^114i1yF9] [^114mK59H] [^111wVvGA]. Let me verify supportive options: calcineurin inhibitors such as pimecrolimus or tacrolimus can help in steroid-induced rosacea, and small studies suggest benefit, though they are not first-line for primary rosacea and should be used judiciously with attention to Demodex proliferation risk in some cases [^114Bf3sW] [^114i1yF9] [^111ieZyN].

> I should confirm the evidence-based alternatives for true rosacea so I can offer a constructive plan. For papulopustular disease, topical ivermectin, metronidazole, or azelaic acid are first-line and supported by high-quality evidence. For persistent erythema, topical brimonidine or oxymetazoline reduce redness. For moderate-to-severe disease, low-dose doxycycline is an effective systemic option. And for refractory cases, low-dose isotretinoin may be considered, all aligned with contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews [^112aiQxr] [^113Q74Cw] [^114ESXsL] [^1177sixw] [^115aAUsW]. Hold on, I should verify ocular considerations too: for ocular rosacea, lid hygiene, lubricants, and, when needed, tetracyclines or topical cyclosporine are recommended, with ophthalmology referral for persistent symptoms or vision-threatening disease [^115pg8L9] [^114F4U3R] [^113PTw8V].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is unambiguous. Steroid creams do not help rosacea and are contraindicated. They can cause or worsen rosacea, produce atrophy and telangiectasia, and complicate management if used on facial skin, so they should be avoided in rosacea and perioral dermatitis [^117Xh7Vr] [^114hXjZB] [^114RZsft] [^116Z1PAD] [^111wVvGA]. If steroids have been used, stop them and initiate guideline-supported therapies and gentle skin care, counseling about expected withdrawal flares and monitoring closely for improvement [^114i1yF9] [^114mK59H] [^112aiQxr] [^113Q74Cw] [^111wVvGA].

Steroid creams are **not recommended for rosacea** because they can cause or worsen it, especially with prolonged use [^113HeYae] [^117Xh7Vr]. They may briefly reduce redness but often trigger rebound flares and steroid-induced rosacea [^116Z1PAD] [^1125o9iu]. Guidelines advise against topical steroids for rosacea; instead, use approved therapies such as metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin, or brimonidine [^112aiQxr] [^113Q74Cw] [^114SfPXd]. If steroid-induced rosacea occurs, stop the steroid and treat with antibiotics or calcineurin inhibitors [^114Bf3sW] [^1159hfsM].

## Clinical evidence on steroid creams in rosacea

Steroid creams can **transiently reduce rosacea-associated inflammation and erythema** by vasoconstriction and immunosuppression, but this is typically short-lived and often followed by rebound flares and worsening of symptoms [^116Z1PAD]. Prolonged use can cause steroid-induced rosacea, characterized by persistent erythema, telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and burning or stinging sensations [^116Z1PAD] [^1125o9iu].

---

## Risks and adverse effects of steroid creams in rosacea

Steroid creams, particularly when used on facial skin, carry **significant risks and adverse effects** in rosacea patients:

- **Steroid-induced rosacea**: Prolonged use of topical steroids can induce a rosacea-like dermatitis, characterized by persistent erythema, telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and burning sensations [^116Z1PAD] [^1125o9iu].

- **Rebound flares**: Discontinuation of steroid creams can lead to rebound flares, worsening the underlying rosacea symptoms [^111wVvGA].

- **Skin atrophy**: Chronic use of topical steroids can cause skin thinning, telangiectasia, and other atrophic changes [^1125o9iu].

- **Secondary infections**: Steroid creams can mask or exacerbate underlying infections, leading to secondary bacterial or fungal infections [^111wVvGA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus **strongly discourage the use of steroid creams** in rosacea management:

- **British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2021 guidelines**: Recommend against the use of topical steroids in rosacea due to the risk of inducing or exacerbating the condition [^notfound].

- **American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines**: Similarly advise against the use of topical steroids in rosacea, emphasizing the risk of steroid-induced rosacea and rebound flares.

- **FDA warnings**: Topical steroids, such as fluocinonide, carry explicit warnings against use in rosacea or perioral dermatitis due to the potential for severe adverse effects [^113HeYae] [^117Xh7Vr].

---

## Alternative treatments for rosacea

Given the risks associated with steroid creams, **several alternative treatments** have been recommended for rosacea management:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Metronidazole | Antibiotic and anti-inflammatory | Effective in reducing papules, pustules, and erythema [^117DfAQP] [^113d13Hz] |
| Azelaic acid | Anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial | Effective in reducing inflammatory lesions and erythema [^1141LJSK] |
| Ivermectin | Antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory | Effective in reducing inflammatory lesions and erythema [^113Bri7p] [^114ZDaF5] |
| Brimonidine | Alpha-adrenergic agonist | Effective in reducing persistent erythema [^114SfPXd] [^116TF3tv] |
| Doxycycline | Antibiotic and anti-inflammatory | Effective in moderate-to-severe rosacea [^1177sixw] |

---

## Management of steroid-induced rosacea

If steroid-induced rosacea occurs, **immediate discontinuation of the steroid cream** is essential. Management strategies include:

- **Discontinuation**: Immediate cessation of the topical steroid is critical [^114i1yF9].

- **Alternative therapies**: Use of antibiotics (such as doxycycline) or calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus or tacrolimus) may be beneficial in managing steroid-induced rosacea [^114Bf3sW] [^1159hfsM].

- **Patient education**: Patients should be educated about the risks of topical steroids and the importance of adherence to alternative therapies [^116Z1PAD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Steroid creams are **not recommended for rosacea** due to the risk of inducing or exacerbating the condition, rebound flares, and other adverse effects. Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus strongly advise against their use. Alternative treatments, such as metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin, brimonidine, and doxycycline, are effective and safer options for rosacea management. If steroid-induced rosacea occurs, immediate discontinuation of the steroid cream and initiation of alternative therapies are recommended.

### Induction of rosaceiform dermatitis during treatment of facial inflammatory dermatoses with tacrolimus ointment… [^111ieZyN]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Background Tacrolimus ointment is increasingly used for anti-inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face, and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in steroid-aggravated rosacea and perioral dermatitis. We report on rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment. Conclusions Our observations suggest that the spectrum of rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment is heterogeneous. A variety of factors, such as vasoactive properties of tacrolimus, proliferation of Demodex due to local immunosuppression, and the occlusive properties of the ointment, may be involved in the observed phenomena. Future studies are needed to identify individual risk factors. effective in inflammatory pustular dermatoses such as erosive pustular dermatosis, 6 eosinophilic folliculitis, 4 pyoderma gangrenosum.

7 A recent article documents successful management of steroid-induced rosacea and perioral dermatitis with tacrolimus ointment. 8 Taken together, these observations indicate that tacrolimus ointment may be a useful treatment alternative in inflammatory dermatoses with a component of amicrobial folliculitis or pustulosis, such as rosacea and steroid-aggravated facial dermatoses. A topical, once-daily regimen of 0. 05% retinaldehyde and
0. 1% tacrolimus ointment was introduced, as well as intermittent use of ketoconazole shampoo. After 2 weeks of effective and well-tolerated treatment, she experienced a flare on her cheeks with papulopustular lesions. Surface biopsy with a cyanoacrylate strip revealed the presence of Demodex. Tacrolimus ointment was discontinued, and the lesions slowly resolved. Rosacealike demodicosis has been reported in local10 and systemic immunosuppression, 11 which suggests that Demodex proliferation is facilitated by local or systemic immunosuppressive factors.

We recently observed a case where a flare of rosaceiform dermatitis during treatment of facial atopic dermatitis with 1% pimecrolimus cream was associated with the appearance of Demodex, 12 and the good response of patients to oral doxycycline is another indication of the pathogenic role of Demodex.

### Pharmacologic treatments for rosacea [^113MPPsR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Rosacea represents a common and chronic inflammatory skin disorder. Clinical features include transient and permanent erythema, inflammatory papules and pustules, phymatous changes, and ocular signs and symptoms. Rosacea is generally classified into four subtypes and one variant. Subtype 1, erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, includes clinical features of flushing and persistent central facial erythema with or without telangiectasia. Subtype 2, papulopustular rosacea, is characterized by persistent central facial erythema with transient papules or pustules or both on the central face. Subtype 3, phymatous rosacea, includes thickening of the skin with irregular surface nodularities and enlargement. Subtype 4, ocular rosacea, includes inflammation of different parts of the eye and eyelid. A variant, granulomatous rosacea, is noninflammatory and is characterized by hard, brown, yellow, or red cutaneous papules or nodules of uniform size. Patients may present with more than one subtype, and each individual characteristic may fluctuate. There is debate whether rosacea progresses from one subtype over time or subtypes represent discreet entities. Defining clinical presentation and improved understanding of pathophysiology has resulted in identification of novel treatment approaches. This contribution outlines a rationale for treatment, highlights an evidence-based approach with approved treatments, and considers novel developments and off-license therapy available.

### Interventions for rosacea [^113z15F1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition affecting the face, characterised by flushing, redness, pimples, pustules, and dilated blood vessels. The eyes are often involved and thickening of the skin with enlargement (phymas), especially of the nose, can occur in some patients. A range of treatment options are available but it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy and safety of treatments for rosacea.

Search Strategy

In February 2011 we updated our searches of the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Ongoing Trials Registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, and analyses were carried out by two independent review authors.

Main Results

Fifty-eight trials, including 27 from the original review, comprising 6633 participants were included in this updated review. Interventions included topical metronidazole, oral antibiotics, topical azelaic cream or gel, topical benzoyl peroxide and/or combined with topical antibiotics, sulphacetamide/sulphur, and others. Only two studies assessed our primary outcome 'quality of life'. Pooled data from physician assessments in three trials provided some evidence that metronidazole was more effective compared to placebo (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.56). Three trials provided data, based on participants' assessments, illustrating azelaic acid was more effective than placebo (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.76). Physician-based assessments in two trials indicated that doxycycline appeared to be significantly more effective than placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.47 and RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.99). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between 100 mg and 40 mg doses of doxycycline, but there was evidence of less adverse effects with the lower dose (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.54). One study reported that cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion was significantly more effective than artificial tears for treating ocular rosacea (for all outcomes).

Authors' Conclusions

Although the majority of included studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias there was some evidence to support the effectiveness of topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, and doxycycline (40 mg) in the treatment of moderate to severe rosacea, and cyclosporine 0.5% ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. Further well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials are required.

### Topical therapies for rosacea [^112P2Ld5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for rosacea include topical agents, oral therapies, laser and light treatments, and surgical procedures. Topical therapies play a critical role in the treatment of patients with papulopustular rosacea and erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, and have the ability to effectively minimize certain manifestations of the disease, including papules, pustules, and erythema. The 3 primary agents for the topical treatment of rosacea are metronidazole, azelaic acid, and sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur. Each of these therapies is approved for the treatment of rosacea and has been validated by multiple studies. Additional topical therapies including benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, retinoids, topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and permethrin are not approved for the treatment of rosacea and play variable roles in the management of this condition.

### Rosacea core domain set for clinical trials and practice: a consensus statement [^115S6YWg]. JAMA Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Inconsistent reporting of outcomes in clinical trials of rosacea is impeding and likely preventing accurate data pooling and meta-analyses. There is a need for standardization of outcomes assessed during intervention trials of rosacea.

Objective

To develop a rosacea core outcome set (COS) based on key domains that are globally relevant and applicable to all demographic groups to be used as a minimum list of outcomes for reporting by rosacea clinical trials, and when appropriate, in clinical practice.

Evidence Review

A systematic literature review of rosacea clinical trials was conducted. Discrete outcomes were extracted and augmented through discussions and focus groups with key stakeholders. The initial list of 192 outcomes was refined to identify 50 unique outcomes that were rated through the Delphi process Round 1 by 88 panelists (63 physicians from 17 countries and 25 patients with rosacea in the US) on 9-point Likert scale. Based on feedback, an additional 11 outcomes were added in Round 2. Outcomes deemed to be critical for inclusion (rated 7–9 by ≥ 70% of both groups) were discussed in consensus meetings. The outcomes deemed to be most important for inclusion by at least 85% of the participants were incorporated into the final core domain set.

Findings

The Delphi process and consensus-building meetings identified a final core set of 8 domains for rosacea clinical trials: ocular signs and symptoms; skin signs of disease; skin symptoms; overall severity; patient satisfaction; quality of life; degree of improvement; and presence and severity of treatment-related adverse events. Recommendations were also made for application in the clinical setting.

Conclusions and Relevance

This core domain set for rosacea research is now available; its adoption by researchers may improve the usefulness of future trials of rosacea therapies by enabling meta-analyses and other comparisons across studies. This core domain set may also be useful in clinical practice.

### Superiority of ivermectin 1% cream over metronidazole 0. 75% cream in treating inflammatory lesions of rosacea: a randomized, investigator-blinded trial [^117RDybg]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Few therapeutic alternatives currently exist in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea (PPR).

Objectives

To demonstrate superiority of once-daily ivermectin 1% cream (IVM 1%) once daily vs. twice-daily metronidazole (MTZ 0.75%) cream, regarding percentage reduction of inflammatory lesions in subjects with moderate to severe PPR.

Methods

In this Phase 3, investigator-blinded, randomized, parallel-group study, subjects received IVM 1% once daily, or MTZ 0.75% twice daily over 16 weeks. Efficacy assessments were inflammatory lesion counts and Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA). Safety assessments included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and local tolerance parameters. Subjects evaluated their disease following a 5-grade scale and completed questionnaires.

Results

A total of 962 subjects were randomized to receive IVM 1% (n = 478) or MTZ 0.75% (n = 484). At week 16, IVM 1% was significantly superior to MTZ 0.75% in terms of reduction from baseline in inflammatory lesions (83.0% vs. 73.7%; P < 0.001), observed as early as week 3 (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF). IGA results (subjects 'clear' or 'almost clear') also favoured IVM 1%: 84.9% vs. 75.4%, respectively (P < 0.001). Incidence of AEs was comparable between groups and local tolerability was better for IVM 1%. More subjects receiving IVM rated their global improvement as 'excellent' or 'good'.
Conclusions

Ivermectin 1% cream was significantly superior to MTZ 0.75% cream and achieved high patient satisfaction.

### Revisiting rosacea criteria: where have we been, where are we going, and how will we get there? [^114zH2Ur]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Rosacea is one of the most common and misunderstood dermatologic conditions. Currently, rosacea criteria are based on expert opinion; the definition of rosacea is primarily a reflection of opinion that is prone to bias. It has been more than a decade since the initial criteria were created by the National Rosacea Society. Revisiting the criteria and incorporating evidence-based techniques used by rheumatology and psychiatry can improve the validity and reliability of rosacea criteria. Literature from other specialties is reviewed and a method proposed for developing valid criteria. Examples are provided to motivate and highlight the importance of implementing such techniques.

### Fluocinonide (Vanos) [^117Xh7Vr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

VANOS Cream is a corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses in patients 12 years of age or older. (1)

Limitation of Use:

Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 60 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. (1)
Avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae. (1.2)
Avoid use in perioral dermatitis or rosacea. (1.2)

1.1 Indications

VANOS®(fluocinonide) Cream, 0.1% is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses in patients 12 years of age or older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

1.2 Limitation of Use

Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended and the total dosage should not exceed 60 g per week because the safety of VANOS Cream for longer than 2 weeks has not been established and because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Therapy should be discontinued when control of the disease is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary. Do not use more than half of the 120 g tube per week.

VANOS Cream should not be used in the treatment of rosacea or perioral dermatitis, and should not be used on the face, groin, or axillae.

### Bilateral Morganella morganii keratitis in a patient with facial topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis: a case report [^111zVdhE]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bilateral keratitis rarely occurs in individuals without predisposing factors. Here we describe the clinical course of a patient who developed a bilateral keratitis caused by Morganella. morganii which might be associated with long term using of topical corticosteroids-containing preparations on the face.

Case Presentation

A 52-year-old female patient presented with marked bilateral corneal infiltration and hypopyon without any usual predisposing factors for bilateral infectious keratitis. There was diffuse erythema with itching on face before the onset of eye discomforts. Microbiological culture of materials from both corneas revealed significant growth of Morganella morganii. Topical corticosteroid-induced rosacea-like dermatitis was diagnosed by dermatologist because of the characteristic eruptions and long history of using the corticosteroids-containing cosmetic creams on her face. The corneal ulcers responded well to levofloxacin eye drops and ofloxacin ointment and healed with opacity and neovascularization.

Conclusion

This case illustrates that bilateral bacterial corneal infection can develop in patients with long term using of topical corticosteroids-containing preparations on the face. To our knowledge, this is the first case of bilateral keratitis caused by Morganella morganii.

### Perioral dermatitis [^113ZsPpv]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Perioral dermatitis is a relatively common inflammatory disorder of facial skin, often appearing in patients with rosacea, but with less inflammation. A typical perioral dermatitis presentation occurs with the eruption of papules and pustules confined to the nasolabial folds and the skin of the chin. Clinically, small pink papules and pustules may recur over weeks to months, sometimes with fine scales. The differential diagnosis includes seborrheic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, acne vulgaris, lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei, steroid-induced rosacea, and even basal cell carcinoma. The histopathology is similar to that found in rosacea. With advancement of the process, a perivascular and perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate develops. Sebaceous hyperplasia may be prominent in some patients. The most severe forms of disease show perifollicular noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. Treatment may include topical metronidazole as for rosacea (once or twice daily), azelaic acid cream, benzyl peroxide preparations, and to a lesser degree, topical erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline. Oral tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline may also be helpful in presentations that are more resistant.

### Rosacea: a common, yet commonly overlooked, condition [^112rS1u9]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common, but often overlooked, skin condition of uncertain etiology that can lead to significant facial disfigurement, ocular complications, and severe emotional distress. The progression of rosacea is variable; however, typical stages include: (1) facial flushing, (2) erythema and/or edema and ocular symptoms, (3) papules and pustules, and (4) rhinophyma. A history of exacerbation by sun exposure, stress, cold weather, hot beverages, alcohol consumption, or certain foods helps determine the diagnosis; the first line of treatment is avoidance of these triggering or exacerbating factors. Most patients respond well to long-term topical antibiotic treatment. Oral or topical retinoid therapy may also be effective. Laser treatment is an option for progressive telangiectasis or rhinophyma. Family physicians should be able to identify and effectively treat the majority of patients with rosacea. Consultation with subspecialists may be required for the management of rhinophyma, ocular complications, or severe disease. (Am Fam Physician 2002;66:442.)

### Results of a national rosacea patient survey: common issues that concern rosacea sufferers [^1142f9zE]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

A survey of people with rosacea was conducted in 2006 to gain insight into experiences with rosacea therapies and relationships with health care providers. The survey was completed by 2946 participants, of whom 2847 had been diagnosed with rosacea. Participants ranged in age from 20 to 81 years (mean age 50 years). Among those diagnosed with rosacea, 80% agreed that medication prevented their rosacea from worsening. Most respondents currently using prescription medication (82%) did not plan to discontinue its use. Among current users of medication, 46% had switched from a prior agent, usually due to the lack of improvement. Among respondents who previously switched therapies, 84% reported using some formulation of topical metronidazole. Of those respondents who discussed rosacea with their physician, 83% agreed that their physician influences their use of medication; 61% viewed their physician-in most cases a dermatologist-as a partner in managing their rosacea.

### Primum non nocere; the importance of evaluating the effect of treatment and considering side effects [^115a52jt]. Contact Dermatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

CASE REPORT

A 62‐year‐old man without a history of atopy had been experiencing episodic facial erythema for 30 years. He had been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and treated with topical corticosteroids, and he had been patch tested and told he had reacted to hydrocortisone in the 1980s. After discontinuation of the steroid cream, facial erythema remained uncontrolled. Rosacea was later diagnosed, and the patient was twice treated with tetracyclines. Topical 1% ivermectin cream and 0.33% brimonidine gel (Mirvaso) were prescribed.

In 2018, his facial erythema was worsening. Patch testing, photo patch, and photo testing were performed. The patient did not react to allergens in the baseline, cosmetics, or corticosteroids series, or to personal products. The photo tests revealed normal responses. Blood tests for antinuclear antibodies was negative. The patient resumed using both brimonidine gel and ivermectin cream and was also prescribed both Fucidin cream (fusidic acid) and Locoid cream (hydrocortisone‐17‐alfa‐butyrate) when his symptoms increased. He gradually developed a severe facial rash with a burning sensation, with fluctuating severity, which never completely healed. He had been told that his skin was sensitive and so only used the medications when he felt that he started to have symptoms.

### Pimecrolimus 1% cream for the treatment of steroid-induced rosacea: an 8-week split-face clinical trial [^114Bf3sW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Steroid-induced rosacea is a relatively common dermatosis that is caused by the prolonged application of topical steroid to the face.

Objectives

The purpose of this investigator-blind, split-face study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pimecrolimus 1% cream for the treatment of steroid-induced rosacea.

Patients/Methods

Patients were instructed to apply pimecrolimus 1% cream twice daily to the involved areas of a randomly allocated half side for the first 2 weeks, and to follow this by applying pimecrolimus 1% cream to both sides for a further 6 weeks.

Results

Fifteen of the 18 patients completed the 8-week study. After 1 week of application, a statistically significant improvement was observed for investigator's global assessments of erythema and papules on prior-treated sides (P-side). Later-treated sides (L-side) showed subsequent improvement after use of pimecrolimus on the L-side. Likewise, a statistically significant improvement was also observed for numbers of papules/pustules on P-sides after 1 week, and L-sides showed a significant improvement after application of pimecrolimus on the L-side. Comparative reflectance colorimetric assessments revealed that DeltaL*, Deltaa* and Deltab* tended to converge to zero during the first 4 weeks. A statistically significant improvement was observed for percentage area affected on P-sides after 1 week of application. The L-side showed a significant improvement after use of pimecrolimus cream on that side. The visual analogue scale of P-sides decreased more rapidly than those of L-sides. Cutaneous side-effects were mild and transient.

Conclusions

This study suggests that pimecrolimus 1% cream is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for steroid-induced rosacea.

### Rosacea treatments: what's new and what's on the horizon? [^116A4rAe]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common, chronic, cutaneous disorder presenting with recurrent episodes of facial flushing, erythema, papules, pustules and telangiectasias. It is a multifactorial disease and its various clinical presentations probably represent the consequence of combined different triggers upon a specific background. Its management is largely based on long-established treatments empirically tailored to the specific presenting symptoms and no real breakthrough has occurred to date. However, recent insights into the still rather obscure pathophysiology of rosacea seem to open the way for etiologically oriented treatments. These may include, on the one side, the more effective application of traditional drugs, such as tetracyclines and metronidazole, to specifically selected patients or, on the other side, new therapeutic options, such as vitamin D receptor antagonists. It is to be remarked that the quality of most studies evaluating rosacea treatment is rather poor, mainly due to a lack of proper standardization. For a major breakthrough to occur in the management of rosacea, we need both a better understanding of its pathogenesis and the adherence of future clinical trials to clearly defined grading and inclusion criteria, which are crucial for investigators to correctly compare and interpret the results of their work.

### Ocular rosacea: an updated review [^113PTw8V]. Cornea (2025). Medium credibility.

For moderate rosacea, treatment should include what has already been mentioned for mild rosacea and topical medications should also be taken to control inflammation and prevent complications. The continued use of preservative-free ocular lubricants is recommended. Topical azithromycin (1%–1.5%) twice a day for 2 days or once a day for 5 days helps reduce inflammation and increases the quality and quantity of the tear film lipid layer. Topical cyclosporine (0.05%–0.1%) twice daily and topical tacrolimus (0.03%) twice daily have been strongly recommended by several societies such as the ROSCO international panel, the National Rosacea Society Expert Committee, and the Rosacea Treatment guidelines of Switzerland. In independent RCTs, they have shown their superiority against placebo warm compress and artificial tears. They can be used for long-term management, reducing inflammation and improving tear production, symptoms, and corneal staining, and are an effective alternative to corticosteroids without complications. Lifitegrast 5% twice a day for 1 month has shown efficacy in improving MGD symptoms and corneal staining. Topical steroids are often required to reduce and halt ocular surface inflammation but are reserved for active inflammation unresponsive to other treatments. They should be used cautiously because of the risk of ocular complications such as ocular hypertension, steroid-induced glaucoma, and cataracts. Topical brimonidine might be an alternative to reduce ocular redness.

### Fluocinonide (fluocinol pak) [^113HeYae]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Fluocinonide Cream USP, 0.1% is a corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses in patients 12 years of age or older.

Limitation of Use:

Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended and the total dosage should not exceed 60 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. (1)
Avoid use on the face, groin, or axillae. (1.2)
Avoid use in perioral dermatitis or rosacea.

1.1 Indication

Fluocinonide Cream USP, 0.1%, is indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses in patients 12 years of age or older [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

1.2 Limitation of Use

Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended and the total dosage should not exceed 60 g per week because the safety of Fluocinonide Cream USP, 0.1% for longer than 2 weeks has not been established and because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Therapy should be discontinued when control of the disease is achieved. If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary. Do not use more than half of the 120 g tube per week.

Fluocinonide Cream USP, 0.1% should not be used in the treatment of rosacea or perioral dermatitis, and should not be used on the face, groin, or axillae.

### Topical corticosteroids: choice and application… [^111wVvGA]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acneiform eruption, and purpura. 20 Other cutaneous adverse effects include folliculitis, periocular dermatitis, delayed wound healing, gluteal granulomas, telangiectasias and erythema, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, masking or aggravation of dermatophyte infection, secondary infection, and contact dermatitis. 17 Mucocutaneous infections are also common with topical corticosteroid use. 20 The inflammatory suppression from topical corticosteroids can contribute to the prolongation, progression, and atypical presentation of cutaneous infections. Contact sensitization to topical corticosteroids can also occur but is rare. Differentiation from hypersensitivity to other components of the topical treatment is important if contact sensitization is suspected.

22 Topical corticosteroid use has not been associated with adverse effects in patients who are lactating. 20 There is no evidence that topical corticosteroids lose effectiveness over time. 23 However, corticosteroid withdrawal can occur upon cessation after prolonged use on the face and genitals, causing erythema, scaling, stinging, burning, papules, pustules, and edema.
24. Formulations Topical corticosteroids come in several formulations, each with advantages and disadvantages. The most common formulations include ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, and solutions. 18 Ointments are petroleum-based. They are thick and lubricating and are useful for dry or hyperkeratotic lesions on smooth, nonhairy skin. Ointments are occlusive and leave a residue on the skin after application. They generally have fewer added compounds and are therefore less prone to provoke allergic reactions.

Duration and Frequency of Treatment The duration of treatment depends on the strength of the corticosteroid and the condition being treated. In general, super-high-potency topical corticosteroids should be used for no more than three weeks at a time. High- and medium-potency corticosteroids should be used for no more than 12 weeks at a time. For treatments of longer duration, a potent corticosteroid may be used intermittently or transitioned to a milder corticosteroid for ongoing control. Lesions on the face, groin, and skinfolds may be treated in one- to two-week intervals. Therapy may be discontinued when the lesions resolve.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^113Bri7p]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Topical ivermectin versus topical metronidazole

Topical ivermectin 1% cream once daily likely improved quality of life slightly more than topical metronidazole 0.75% twice daily, based on one study at low risk of bias with 962 patients [RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.21 (P = 0.02); NNTB 15, 95% CI 8–100; moderate‐certainty evidence]. 156 Reduction in Dermatology Life Quality Index was 5.18 in the topical ivermectin group and 3.92 in the topical metronidazole group [both meeting minimal important difference (MID)]. 159, 160 Good‐to‐excellent improvement based on participants' assessments was reported by 409 of 478 with ivermectin vs. 362 of 484 with metronidazole [RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07–1.22 (P < 0.001); NNTB 10, 95% CI 7–17; moderate‐certainty evidence]. 156 There was no difference in number of participants reporting an adverse event. Physicians' assessments in two studies were in concordance with participants' assessments. 20, 155 Mean ± SD reduction in lesion count was 27.70 ± 8.85 with ivermectin vs. 23.60 ± 8.23 with metronidazole [MD −4.10, 95% CI −5.18 to −3.02 (P < 0.001); high‐certainty evidence]. 156

### Oxymetazoline and energy-based therapy in patients with rosacea: evaluation of the safety and tolerability in an open-label, interventional study [^114bu1pK]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology of rosacea is thought to involve dysregulation of the facial neuro vasculature and an abnormally heightened immune response, resulting in chronic dilation of facial blood vessels, persistent erythema, and the formation of telangiectasias [6]. Despite this vasodilation becoming fixed over time, the blood vessels responsible for persistent erythema remain responsive to sympathetic nervous system signaling. Activation of α 1 ‐ and α 2 ‐adrenoceptors on smooth muscle cells in the cutaneous vasculature results in vasoconstriction of the vessels and may improve the persistent erythema associated with rosacea [6]. Conversely, telangiectasias do not contain a smooth muscle layer, are not vasoactive [7], and may therefore become more visible when background persistent erythema is reduced [8].

Energy‐based therapies such as lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) have been employed in rosacea in order to selectively target and thermally damage dysregulated blood vessels and can often effectively manage some of the vascular signs of the disease, including telangiectasia and persistent erythema. However, not all patients respond to energy‐based therapies, some patients may require more than one treatment — with substantial associated costs — and energy‐based therapies may result in adverse side effects including unwanted purpura or erythema [8, 9, 10]. Energy‐based treatment also has limited efficacy in reducing diffuse erythema associated with acne rosacea due to the small caliber of vessels, which are more difficult to target. A combination approach to treatment including both pharmacological and physical approaches may allow more effective management of the vascular manifestations of rosacea than utilization of any one treatment modality as monotherapy.

Oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream, 1% (oxymetazoline; RHOFADE®, EPI Health, Charleston, SC) is an α 1A ‐adrenoceptor agonist approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the topical treatment of persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults [11]. Oxymetazoline applied once daily has been shown to be well tolerated and safe, and was effective in the treatment of moderate to severe persistent facial erythema of rosacea in Phase 3 clinical trials (REVEAL studies) that evaluated short‐term treatment (29 days) [12, 13] and 1 year of treatment [3]. The current study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oxymetazoline when used as an adjunctive treatment with energy‐based therapy for patients with moderate to severe facial erythema associated with rosacea; efficacy assessments were exploratory.

### Topical metronidazole combination therapy in the clinical management of rosacea [^115M4196]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Metronidazole was the first topical agent approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rosacea. Several controlled studies have confirmed the efficacy and safety of topical metronidazole 0.75% gel, lotion and cream and 1% cream for rosacea. At present, little data exists regarding the use of combination topical therapy in rosacea management, although anecdotal evidence and preliminary studies suggest at least some additive benefit when topical metronidazole is used in combination with sulfacetamide 10% /sulfur 5%. In this paper, the results of observational experience evaluating topical metronidazole 0.75% gel used in combination with other topical rosacea therapies and/or subantimicrobial dose doxycycline are reported.

### Fluticasone propionate [^114RZsft]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There was some evidence of corresponding decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels. The A.M. plasma cortisol level remained slightly depressed for 48 hours but recovered by day 6 of treatment.

Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%, caused HPA axis suppression in 2 of 43 pediatric patients, ages 2 and 5 years old, who were treated for 4 weeks covering at least 35% of the body surface area. Follow-up testing 12 days after treatment discontinuation, available for 1 of the 2 subjects, demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis (see PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use).

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use).

The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence: irritation, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infections, skin atrophy, striae, hypertrichosis, and miliaria.

Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% may cause local cutaneous adverse reactions (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

If irritation develops, Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used in the presence of preexisting skin atrophy and should not be used where infection is present at the treatment site. Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used in the treatment of rosacea and perioral dermatitis.

### Pimecrolimus 1% cream for the treatment of rosacea [^113U1GRj]. The Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disorder; the pathogenesis is unclear. Various treatment options for rosacea are available, but most have limited effectiveness. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 1% pimecrolimus cream for the treatment of rosacea. Thirty patients with rosacea were enrolled in this 4-week, single-center, open-label study of 1% pimecrolimus cream. Patients were instructed to apply the cream to their faces twice daily and were not permitted to use any other agents. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by a rosacea grading system using photographic documentation and a mexameter. The 26 patients who completed the study experienced significantly reduced rosacea clinical scores from 9.65 ± 1.79 at baseline to 7.27 ± 2.11 at the end of treatment (P < 0.05). The mexameter-measured erythema index decreased significantly from 418.54 ± 89.56 at baseline to 382.23 ± 80.04 at week 4 (P < 0.05). The side-effects were mostly transient local irritations. The results of this study suggest that 1% pimecrolimus cream is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for patients with mild to moderate inflammatory rosacea.

### Assessment of rosacea severity: a review of evaluation methods used in clinical trials [^113DZxgF]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Novel rosacea treatments are needed. Assessment methodologies for clinical trials of rosacea treatments are not standardized and are relatively inadequate. To determine the efficacy of new treatments, a valid and reliable assessment methodology is needed.

Objective

We sought to determine the assessment methodologies used in clinical trials for rosacea treatments, to demonstrate the need for a valid and reliable assessment tool, and to describe the relevant properties of such a tool.

Methods

PubMed and MEDLINE were searched for clinical trials of rosacea treatments since January 1, 1985.

Results

In all, 32 clinical trials met inclusion criteria. Assessment methodologies were highly variable, and standardized assessment methodologies were used in only 3 studies. The various manifestations of rosacea were assessed inconsistently.

Limitations

Eighteen articles could not be included as a result of lack of access to the full text.

Conclusions

The diverse methodologies make the assessment of novel treatments and comparison of treatments difficult. A valid and reliable assessment tool is needed to properly assess novel treatments to improve the management of rosacea.

### Adverse effects of topical glucocorticosteroids [^1125o9iu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Topical corticosteroids were introduced into medicine about 50 years ago. They represent a significant milestone in dermatologic therapy. Despite encouragement to report observed adverse drug reactions, the clinical practice of reporting is poor and incomplete. Likewise, adverse effects and safety of topical corticosteroids are neglected in the medical literature. The authors provide an updated review of their adverse-effect profile. Children are more prone to the development of systemic reactions to topically applied medication because of their higher ratio of total body surface area to body weight. Cutaneous adverse effects occur regularly with prolonged treatment and are dependent on the chemical nature of the drug, the vehicle, and the location of its application. The most frequent adverse effects include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne, and purpura. Those that occur with lower frequency include hypertrichosis, pigmentation alterations, delayed wound healing, and exacerbation of skin infections. Of particular interest is the rate of contact sensitization against corticosteroids, which is considerably higher than generally believed. Systemic reactions such as hyperglycemia, glaucoma, and adrenal insufficiency have also been reported to follow topical application. The authors provide an updated review of local and systemic adverse effects upon administration of topical corticosteroids, including the latest FDA report on the safety of such steroids in children.

Learning Objective

At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with topical corticosteroids and their proper use.

### Standard management options for rosacea: the 2019 update by the national rosacea society expert committee [^117UWx6v]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2017, a National Rosacea Society Expert Committee developed and published an updated classification of rosacea to reflect current insights into rosacea pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and management. These developments suggest that a multivariate disease process underlies the various clinical manifestations of the disorder. The new system is consequently based on phenotypes that link to this process, providing clear parameters for research and diagnosis as well as encouraging clinicians to assess and treat the disorder as it may occur in each individual. Meanwhile, a range of therapies has become available for rosacea, and their roles have been increasingly defined in clinical practice as the disorder has become more widely recognized. This update is intended to provide a comprehensive summary of management options, including expert evaluations, to serve as a guide for tailoring treatment and care on an individual basis to achieve optimal patient outcomes.

Combination of Topical Ivermectin with Oral Doxycycline 40 mg Modified Release

Topical ivermectin and DMR are registered for treating rosacea, and both address inflammation. One recent phase IIIb/IV, randomized, investigator-blinded trial in 273 participants with severe rosacea (IGA 4) compared ivermectin 1% cream and DMR with ivermectin 1% cream combined with placebo. After 12 weeks, both regimens resulted in lesion count reduction, but the combination was more effective (80.3% versus 73.6%, respectively; p = 0.032). Furthermore, combination treatment had a faster onset of action with a difference noted by week 4, and more participants achieved IGA 0 (11.9% vs 5.1%; p = 0.043) and 100% lesion reduction (17.8% vs 7.2%; p = 0.006). Both treatment groups also experienced improvements in erythema, stinging, burning, flushing, and ocular signs and symptoms. Few adverse events were reported in both groups.

Topical metronidazole

Topical metronidazole is available as 0.75% gel and 1% cream. Nine trials at low‐to‐high risk of bias compared metronidazole with placebo. 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 91, 103, 111 Data from three studies could not be pooled for participants' assessments owing to substantial heterogeneity (65%) but indicated that metronidazole was more effective than placebo (low‐certainty evidence), which was in line with physicians' assessments of 94/195 improving with metronidazole and 40/139 with placebo [RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.29–3.02 (P = 0.002; I² = 44%); moderate‐certainty evidence]. 85, 88, 111 Data from six studies showed that 379 of 1375 participants reported an adverse event with metronidazole vs. 64 of 398 with placebo [RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94–1.51 (I² = 0%); moderate‐certainty evidence]. 83, 84, 85, 88, 103, 111 Adverse events were mild, consisting of pruritus, skin irritation and dry skin. No SDs were provided for lesion counts and erythema; data were skewed but appeared to support those reported as physician‐assessed improvement (both moderate‐certainty evidence).

Topical azelaic acid versus topical metronidazole

Three studies at unclear risk of bias (total of 451 participants) reported contradictory data for this comparison (moderate‐certainty evidence). 97, 105, 130 Azelaic acid might be slightly more beneficial than metronidazole (according to participants and physicians), but the difference may not be important. Azelaic acid likely results in a small and possibly unimportant increase in adverse events when compared with topical metronidazole. Reductions in lesion counts were comparable in both groups.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea: state of the art [^1175GeV2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common disorder that is both under recognized and undertreated. Prevalence figures indicate that it may be present in 1 of every 10 adults in a primary care waiting room. Untreated, patients with rosacea can suffer significant emotional, workplace, and social impairments. While rosacea has been recognized since ancient times, only recently have investigators begun to identify the pathophysiologic elements responsible for the characteristic erythema, flushing, dysesthesias, and papulopustular manifestations of the disease. Although the etiology of rosacea is unclear, inflammation appears to be a central element. Experimental evidence suggests that abnormalities of the skin's innate and adaptive immune responses may play pivotal roles. Once recognized, effective topical and systemic therapies can be prescribed to lessen the impact of the disease on the patient's life. Although initially administered in an empiric fashion, it now seems clear that the role of antibiotics in patients with rosacea depends upon their anti-inflammatory rather than their antimicrobial properties. Consequently, practitioners have the opportunity to practice good antibiotic stewardship when treating the disease, particularly with systemic therapies. Therapy with subantimicrobial dosing and with topical treatments can modulate the inflammation of rosacea without exerting antibiotic pressure responsible for the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

### Oxymetazoline and energy-based therapy in patients with rosacea: evaluation of the safety and tolerability in an open-label, interventional study [^117CbnHw]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Rosacea is a chronic skin condition estimated to affect more than 5% of adults worldwide [1]. The primary diagnostic criteria for rosacea include transient‐to‐persistent centrofacial erythema, typically exacerbated by trigger factors that may vary by patient, inflammatory papules and/or pustules, and telangiectasia [2, 3]. Additional features that may be present can include burning or stinging sensations, erythematous plaques, facial dryness/scaling, edema, ocular manifestations such as blepharitis and conjunctivitis, and, in patients with long‐standing disease, phymatous changes [2, 3]. When these features are not treated effectively, rosacea can negatively affect patients' emotional well‐being, self‐esteem, social life, and work life [4], and greater severity of facial erythema of rosacea may be associated with a greater impact on the patient's quality of life [5].

### A review of the current modalities for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea [^113PttqF]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Papulopustular rosacea is characterized by papules and pustules in the central facial region. We review the literature surrounding the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane (Central) databases searches of articles published from 1980 to 2015 were performed using the MeSH terms or keywords "rosacea" and "clinical trial". Additional searches were performed to include rosacea and each treatment modality used. Topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin, and oral doxycycline have the most robust data to support their use. Variation in assessment tools and a lack of clinical trial standardization makes comparison of therapeutic options difficult.

### Optimizing the use of topical brimonidine in rosacea management: panel recommendations [^115k7ao2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disease with a complex pathophysiology that manifests with central facial redness with or without papulopustular lesions. Often, patients with rosacea present with a constellation of signs and symptoms; for best results, the treatment plan should take into account all symptoms manifesting in the individual patient. The first available pharmacologic treatment to address the redness associated with rosacea is topical brimonidine. In the United States, brimonidine topical gel 0.33% is indicated for persistent facial erythema of rosacea; approval was based on clinically significant efficacy and good safety data from large-scale clinical trials. Use of brimonidine in routine clinical practice has yielded new insights that elaborate on the findings from clinical trials. For example, real-world use has shown that a percentage of patients (in our experience, approximately 10 to 20%) treated with brimonidine experience a worsening of erythema that has been called "rebound". Our routine use of this agent for > 1 year has yielded strategies to set patient expectations, optimize treatment initiation, and minimize potential problems; this article details those strategies. Because we believe that the term "rebound" has been used to describe several physiologically distinct events, we have also proposed more specific terminology for such events.

### Use of an alternative method to evaluate erythema severity in a clinical trial: difference in vehicle response with evaluation of baseline and postdose photographs for effect of oxymetazoline cream 1. 0% for persistent erythema of rosacea in a phase IV study [^113wY3K4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

At least a moderate improvement (~50% or greater) in persistent erythema was noted in a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with oxymetazoline than those who received vehicle (P < 0.001) (Fig. S3; see Supporting Information). At 1 h, these proportions were 45.8% of patients in the oxymetazoline group compared with 9.8% of patients in the vehicle group; at 3 h, 80.2% vs. 19.5%; at 6 h, 74.5% vs. 22.9%; at 9 h, 63.4% vs. 21.4% and at 12 h, 54.2% vs. 17.9%. At least a marked (~75% or greater) erythema reduction was achieved in up to 43.6% of patients treated with oxymetazoline vs. 7.1% for those treated with vehicle. Figure 3 shows photographs of a patient from the oxymetazoline group who achieved moderate (~50%) or marked (~75%) reduction or complete clearing (~95%) in erythema at different time points.

Figure 3
Photographs of a patient with rosacea from the oxymetazoline group with representative percentage improvements in erythema from baseline on day 1. Percentage improvement scale for reduction in erythema: 0, none; ~25%, mild; ~50%, moderate; ~75%, marked; ~95%, complete clearing.

The percentage erythema reduction scores had a strong negative correlation with the CEA scores (Spearman rank correlation −0.7084; P < 0.001), indicating a high level of agreement between these methods of assessment. The majority of photographs rated as showing ~95% erythema improvement compared with baseline were assigned CEA scores of 0 or 1 (93.1%, 148 of 159). Similar observations were made for photographs showing ~75% erythema improvement [CEA scores of 1 or 2 (90.8%, 484 of 533)], ~50% improvement [CEA scores of 2 or 3 (85.9%, 869 of 1012)], ~25% improvement [CEA scores of 2 or 3 (87.1%, 758 of 870)] and no improvement [CEA scores of 3 or 4 (93.5%, 1497 of 1601)].

### Glucocorticoids promote CCL20 expression in keratinocytes [^1112mk4i]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Systematically identifying GR targets in skin‐resident cells is of interest because they may help to explain the pathogenesis of steroid‐insensitive or steroid‐induced skin conditions such as rosacea and perioral dermatitis. These studies could also provide insight into mechanisms of steroid resistance, tachyphylaxis and withdrawal – phenomena that are not completely understood but are important in a broad range of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to inflammatory skin conditions.

The effect of GCs on skin inflammation is complex, with influences from other cytokines and chemokines, resident cell types and the skin microbiome. In addition to direct transcriptional effects at target loci, GC and cytokine signalling reciprocally affect each other through direct protein interaction and post‐translational modifications.GCs can also generate epigenetic changes that establish longer‐term effects on skin inflammation. Consistent with this, perioral dermatitis typically manifests only after prolonged steroid use, indicating that steroid‐induced molecular changes may take time to accumulate to the point where they manifest clinically.

GCs remain among the most essential and common medications used in dermatology and medicine. Continued study of their molecular mechanisms in the skin and other tissues will be critical to understand how they can be best used for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

### Glucocorticoids promote CCL20 expression in keratinocytes [^116Z1PAD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease that classically manifests with flushing, telangiectasias, and inflamed papules and pustules on the face. A wide spectrum of stimuli can exacerbate rosacea, including ultraviolet exposure, temperature, microbes and drugs. The inflammation of rosacea is often treated with topical or oral antibiotics, and its chronic nature typically requires long‐term management and the avoidance of triggers.

Rosacea responds poorly to treatment with steroids. In general, steroids are envisioned as having potent immunosuppressive properties and have an essential role in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, clinicians have long recognized that topical steroids worsen rosacea with prolonged treatment or upon their withdrawal. A related inflammatory skin condition – perioral dermatitis – is frequently associated with the long‐term use of topical steroids on the face. In fact, these two clinical entities (rosacea and perioral dermatitis) are histologically similar and considered by some clinicians to be variants of the same condition. Together they represent cardinal examples of skin conditions that are initiated or worsened by steroids. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie their atypical proinflammatory response to steroids is not well understood.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^111Jh4gX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The global ROSacea COnsensus panel (ROSCO), an international panel of dermatologists and ophthalmologists developed recommendations for diagnosis, classification and treating rosacea, on a phenotype rather than subtype approach. 6, 8 The classification recommendations from that consensus were adopted in this update.

Three reviews on topical ivermectin in rosacea have been published. 164, 165, 166 One was a narrative review describing the pharmacological properties of ivermectin and available data on efficacy and tolerability. 164 Another was a systematic review with clinical guideline recommendations in which the Jadad score (randomization, double blinding and dropouts) was used to assess risk of bias but was not a key criterion (concealment of treatment allocation). 165 Nevertheless, their conclusions are in concordance with those in this review. As head‐to‐head studies comparing various topical treatments are generally lacking, a network meta‐analysis comparing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topical ivermectin with other currently available topical agents has been conducted. 166 This study expanded and built upon earlier versions of our review, 161, 167 and was conducted and reported robustly. The authors concluded that topical ivermectin appeared to be more effective than other topical treatment options for papules/pustules of rosacea, with similar safety and tolerability.

Limitations of our review were that the lack of response from investigators regarding missing trial details largely resulted in less favourable risk‐of‐bias assessments (unclear as opposed to low risk). Unfortunately, our outcomes of time to improvement and duration of remission were not or minimally addressed in the studies. The lack of standardized and validated scales was challenging for pooling data. Scales should be developed with greater focus on specific features rather than conflation of multiple features into a single scale, as previously done with the subtype approach. This focus will provide greater clarity on the effect of interventions on distinct rosacea features. As an example, this would avoid the current conundrum of extracting the effect on persistent erythema versus perilesional erythema of inflammatory lesions in studies on 'papulopustular rosacea'.

### Rosacea treatment update: recommendations from the global ROSacea COnsensus (ROSCO) panel [^1144Hayr]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rosacea is currently treated according to subtypes. As this does not adequately address the spectrum of clinical presentation (phenotypes), it has implications for patient management. The ROSacea COnsensus panel was established to address this issue.

Objectives

To incorporate current best treatment evidence with clinical experience from an international expert panel and establish consensus to improve outcomes for patients with rosacea.

Methods

Seventeen dermatologists and three ophthalmologists reached consensus on critical aspects of rosacea treatment and management using a modified Delphi approach. The panel voted on statements using the responses 'strongly disagree', 'disagree', 'agree' or 'strongly agree'. Consensus was defined as ≥ 75% 'agree' or 'strongly agree'. All voting was electronic and blinded.

Results

The panel agreed on phenotype-based treatments for signs and symptoms presenting in individuals with rosacea. First-line treatments were identified for individual major features of transient and persistent erythema, inflammatory papules/pustules, telangiectasia and phyma, underpinned by general skincare measures. Multiple features in an individual patient can be simultaneously treated with multiple agents. If treatment is inadequate given appropriate duration, another first-line option or the addition of another first-line agent should be considered. Maintenance treatment depends on treatment modality and patient preferences. Ophthalmological referral for all but the mildest ocular features should be considered. Lid hygiene and artificial tears in addition to medications are used to treat ocular rosacea.

Conclusions

Rosacea diagnosis and treatment should be based on clinical presentation. Consensus was achieved to support this approach for rosacea treatment strategies.

Regarding medical management for rosacea, more specifically with respect to retinoids, BAD 2021 guidelines recommend to consider offering intermittent courses of low-dose isotretinoin (0.25 mg/kg) in patients with persistent and severe rosacea. Discuss the potential side effects and teratogenicity.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^112aVprF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

One study demonstrated that a combination of brimonidine gel in the morning and ivermectin cream in the evening was effective in treating both erythema and papules/pustules vs. vehicles. 42

Topical metronidazole 0.75%, ivermectin 1% and azelaic acid 15% gel seem effective and safe as maintenance treatments regarding papules/pustules. Other maintenance treatments for rosacea have not been addressed in RCTs.

Since the last update of this review in 2015, 161 a number of other reviews or guidelines have been published. 162, 163, 164, 165, 166 The Canadian Clinical Practice guidelines for rosacea, published in 2016, used the 2015 version of this review as a source of clinical evidence and basis for making recommendations using the GRADE approach. 162

A Swiss S1 guideline for the treatment of rosacea has been published in which assessments of evidence (A–E) were used, and 13 national experts on rosacea reached consensus on recommendations. 163 They concluded that there was level A evidence (no major design flaws and at least one double‐blind RCT) for pimecrolimus, topic retinoids, topical permethrin, topical benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin, topical erythromycin and topical dapsone, oral zinc sulfate and oral ampicillin, on which we clearly disagree. There were no details on inclusion criteria for studies, neither basis of appraisal of quality nor judgements on the risk of bias. No patients or patient‐advocacy groups were included and the guideline appeared solely reliant on the contribution of expert panels. In contrast, and in terms of recognizing the significant impact of this condition on patients, we have tried to ensure that we received timely, patient‐relevant input at all stages of conducting and reporting this review, and have included two patients as co‐authors. Furthermore, we applied the widely adopted GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for our predefined outcomes of the most clinically relevant comparisons.

### A chronic nonresponsive facial eruption [^111tMF3P]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

C. Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea – Incorrect. Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea presents with episodic flushing, dilated telangiectasia, and central facial erythema. Erythema may also affect the peripheral face, ears, neck, and upper aspect of the chest. The histopathologic features of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea are telangiectasia with lymphohistiocytic perifolliculitis, vascular ectasia, and solar elastosis.

D. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) – Correct. SCLE typically presents with erythematous plaques, which may have an annular configuration or papulosquamous appearance. Lesions occur on sun-exposed areas with sparing of the midfacial skin. The sides of the face, upper trunk, and extensor aspects of the upper extremities are commonly affected. Hypopigmentation typically results after lesion resolution, but SCLE does not lead to scarring or dermal atrophy. Histopathologic hallmarks of SCLE include a cell-poor (vacuolar) interface dermatitis, epidermal atrophy or hyperplasia, superficial perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic inflammation, and mucin deposition.

E. Topical corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy – Incorrect. Cutaneous atrophy secondary to chronic topical corticosteroid use presents with thinning, telangiectasia, and small hematomas. Advanced stages present with lacerations and hemorrhage in the dermis, which can ultimately lead to dissecting hematomas. The histopathologic features of topical corticosteroid-induced cutaneous atrophy are thinning of the epidermis and telangiectasia.

Question 2: Which of the following represents the most appropriate initial therapeutic plan?

A. Discontinuation of topical corticosteroid application
B. Drug cessation, photoprotection, topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors, and antimalarials
C. Photoprotection and topical vitamin C
D. Systemic corticosteroids
E. Topical metronidazole and photoprotection

Answers:

A. Discontinuation of topical corticosteroid application – Incorrect. In the setting of topical corticosteroid-induced atrophy, discontinuation of topical corticosteroid use has been shown to reverse cutaneous atrophy.

### Rosacea: new concepts in classification and treatment [^112bpCxm]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Updating the diagnostic approach to rosacea focussing on individual features has led to advances in understanding of pathophysiology, treatment approaches, and ultimately patient care. New treatments for rosacea have been developed in three ways — greater understanding of pathophysiology; development of novel topical modalities for active interventions previously known to be effective in rosacea; and repurposing treatments used in other dermatologic conditions for rosacea. These therapeutic advances expand treatment options and could improve outcomes in rosacea patients. Nevertheless, while achievement of complete or almost complete clearance of rosacea features is the goal, not all patients achieve these outcomes presently, despite treatment adherence. Thus, there is still an ongoing need for more efficacious treatments, including those used in combination, to achieve this outcome. Finally, current treatment approaches have almost exclusively focused on only two features of rosacea — erythema and papules/pustules. Ocular rosacea and phyma, including medical interventions for early inflammatory phases of the latter, have largely been neglected. To comprehensively address the needs of all patients with rosacea, further advances in pathophysiology and treatments are awaited.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea fulminans: a comprehensive review [^117X5ELv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Rosacea fulminans is a rare inflammatory condition of the central face marked by the abrupt onset of erythematous coalescing papules, pustules, nodules, and draining sinuses. Due to infrequent reporting in the literature, the pathophysiology, classification, and nomenclature of this condition remain controversial. This comprehensive review evaluated a total of 135 cases of rosacea fulminans for clinical and histopathologic features and reported treatment strategies. Patients were 91% female with an average age of onset of 31.3 years. Only 19% of cases reported duration of symptoms longer than 3 months, and reports of recurrence were uncommon. A majority of patients had history of rosacea or flushing, and common triggers included hormonal shifts, emotional stress, and medications. Extrafacial or systemic involvement was rare. Though oral and topical antibiotics were frequently utilized to treat rosacea fulminans, there was a clear shift in reported treatments for rosacea fulminans following the introduction of isotretinoin use in 1987, marked by increased reliance on isotretinoin in addition to topical and systemic corticosteroids. Newer treatments were associated with superior improvement compared with antibiotic monotherapy, most notably dramatically reduced rates of scarring, though reduced rates of disease recurrence were not evident. Several patterns revealed through this review reinforce the classification of rosacea fulminans as a severe yet distinct variant of rosacea and highlight key distinguishing clinical features and treatment options for optimal management.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^111tJ7bY]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Blepharitis care management — treat patients initially with a regimen of warm compresses and eyelid cleansing. A topical antibiotic such as bacitracin or erythromycin can be prescribed to be applied one or more times daily or at bedtime on the eyelid margins for a few weeks. For patients with meibomian gland dysfunction whose chronic symptoms and signs are not adequately controlled with eyelid cleansing or meibomian gland expression, oral tetracyclines and topical antibiotics may be helpful. Topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline, and isotretinoin are effective treatments for patients with systemic rosacea. A brief course of topical corticosteroids may be helpful for eyelid or ocular surface inflammation; the minimal effective dose of corticosteroid should be utilized and long-term topical corticosteroid therapy should be avoided if possible. An eyelid tumor should be suspected in patients with atypical eyelid-margin inflammation or disease not responsive to medical therapy, and these patients should be carefully re-evaluated.

### Interventions for rosacea [^1138PPee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition affecting the face, characterised by flushing, redness, pimples, pustules, and dilated blood vessels. The eyes are often involved. Frequently it can be controlled, but it is not clear which treatments are most effective.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy and safety of treatments for rosacea.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Register (February 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2005), EMBASE (1980 to February 2005), BIOSIS (1970 to March 2002) and the Science Citation Index (1988 to February 2005). Reference lists of trials and key review articles were searched. Relevant manufacturers and experts were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea were included. Studies judged by the authors to have seriously flawed methodology were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and analysis were carried out by two independent authors. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

The evidence provided by twenty-nine included studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting. One of our primary outcome measures, 'quality of life', was not assessed in any of the studies. Only two studies of ocular rosacea were included. Pooled data from two trials involving 174 participants indicated that according to the participants, topical metronidazole is more effective than placebo (odds ratio (OR) 5.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.95 to 12.06). Data pooled from three between-patient trials showed a clear improvement in the azelaic acid group; the rates of treatment success were approximately 70 to 80% versus 50% to 55% (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.82 to 3.28). A within-patient trial of azelaic cream versus placebo could not be pooled with the other three studies, but also showed good evidence of efficacy. Data pooled from three studies of oral tetracycline versus placebo involving 152 participants showed that, according to physicians, tetracycline was effective (OR 6.06, 95% CI 2.96 to 12.42). Some evidence of efficacy of oral metronidazole was provided by one small study.

Authors' Conclusions

The quality of studies evaluating rosacea treatments was generally poor. There is evidence that topical metronidazole and azelaic acid are effective. There is some evidence that oral metronidazole and tetracycline are effective. There is insufficient evidence concerning the effectiveness of other treatments. Good RCTs looking at these treatments are urgently needed.

### Patient costs associated with rosacea [^11635N1b]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

The recalcitrance of rosacea to many treatment options may prompt patients to spend exorbitant amounts of money on unsubstantiated treatment regimens in an effort to achieve relief. The authors examine the relationship between disease severity and treatment cost across several demographic and socioeconomic strata. Familiarization of evidence-based clinical recommendations and consensus guidelines may equip physicians to educate patients about the most efficacious and cost-effective treatment options to assist patients in making cost-conscious decisions in the management of their rosacea.

### Tacrolimus ointment for the treatment of steroid-induced rosacea: a preliminary report [^1159hfsM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Excessive topical corticosteroid application to facial areas commonly leads to steroid-induced rosacea. This may be a recalcitrant problem that requires months of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy before it resolves.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the use of tacrolimus ointment, a macrolide anti-inflammatory ointment for the treatment of 3 patients with steroid-induced rosacea.

Methods

Three patients with steroid-induced rosacea applied tacrolimus ointment, 0.075% twice daily for 7 to 10 days. Patients were also instructed to avoid topical corticosteroid use and other rosacea-aggravating substances including caffeine, spicy foods, alcohol, hot fluids, and fluoride. Patients were observed for tenderness, erythema, and relief of pruritus.

Results

Pruritus, tenderness, and erythema were resolved in all 3 patients after 7 to 10 consecutive days' use of tacrolimus 0.075% ointment in conjunction with avoidance of topical steroids, caffeine, spicy food, alcohol, hot fluids, and fluoride.

Conclusion

This preliminary study demonstrates that tacrolimus 0.075% ointment may be effective for patients with steroid-induced rosacea, when combined with avoidance of topical steroid use, as well as avoidance of other agents known to aggravate rosacea (caffeine, spicy foods, alcohol, hot fluids, and fluoride).

### Interventions for rosacea [^117DfAQP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Rosacea is a common chronic skin condition affecting the face, characterised by flushing, redness, pimples, pustules and dilated blood vessels. The eyes are often involved and thickening of the skin with enlargement (phymas), especially of the nose, can occur in some people. A range of treatment options are available but it is unclear which are most effective.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of treatments for rosacea.

Search Methods

We updated our searches, to July 2014, of: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Science Citation Index (from 1988). We searched five trials registers and checked reference lists for further relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and analyses were carried out independently by two authors.

Main Results

We included 106 studies, comprising 13,631 participants. Sample sizes of 30–100 and study duration of two to three months were most common. More women than men were included, mean age of 48.6 years, and the majority had papulopustular rosacea, followed by erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. A wide range of comparisons (67) were evaluated. Topical interventions: metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin, brimonidine or other topical treatments. Systemic interventions: oral antibiotics, combinations with topical treatments or other systemic treatments, i.e. isotretinoin. Several studies evaluated laser or light-based treatment. The majority of studies (57/106) were assessed as 'unclear risk of bias', 37 'high risk ' and 12 'low risk'. Twenty-two studies provided no usable or retrievable data i.e. none of our outcomes were addressed, no separate data reported for rosacea or limited data in abstracts. Eleven studies assessed our primary outcome 'change in quality of life', 52 studies participant-assessed changes in rosacea severity and almost all studies addressed adverse events, although often only limited data were provided. In most comparisons there were no statistically significant differences in number of adverse events, most were mild and transient. Physician assessments including investigators' global assessments, lesion counts and erythema were evaluated in three-quarters of the studies, but time needed for improvement and duration of remission were incompletely or not reported. The quality of the body of evidence was rated moderate to high for most outcomes, but for some outcomes low to very low. Data for several outcomes could only be pooled for topical metronidazole and azelaic acid. Both were shown to be more effective than placebo in papulopustular rosacea (moderate quality evidence for metronidazole and high for azelaic acid). Pooled data from physician assessments in three trials demonstrated that metronidazole was more effective compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 3.02). Four trials provided data on participants' assessments, illustrating that azelaic acid was more effective than placebo (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.63). The results from three studies were contradictory on which of these two treatments was most effective. Two studies showed a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in favour of topical ivermectin when compared to placebo (high quality evidence). Participants' assessments in these studies showed a RR of 1.78 (95% CI 1.50 to 2.11) and RR of 1.92 (95% CI 1.59 to 2.32), which were supported by physicians' assessments. Topical ivermectin appeared to be slightly more effective than topical metronidazole for papulopustular rosacea, based on one study, for improving quality of life and participant and physician assessed outcomes (high quality evidence for these outcomes). Topical brimonidine in two studies was more effective than vehicle in reducing erythema in rosacea at all time points over 12 hours (high quality evidence). At three hours the participants' assessments had a RR of 2.21 (95% CI 1.52 to 3.22) and RR of 2.00 (95% CI 1.33 to 3.01) in favour of brimonidine. Physicians' assessments confirmed these data. There was no rebound or worsening of erythema after treatment cessation. Topical clindamycin phosphate combined with tretinoin was not considered to be effective compared to placebo (moderate quality evidence). Topical ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion demonstrated effectiveness and improved quality of life for people with ocular rosacea (low quality evidence). Of the comparisons assessing oral treatments for papulopustular rosacea there was moderate quality evidence that tetracycline was effective but this was based on two old studies of short duration. Physician-based assessments in two trials indicated that doxycycline appeared to be significantly more effective than placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.47 and RR 2.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.99) (high quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between 100 mg and 40 mg doxycycline, but there was evidence of fewer adverse effects with the lower dose (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.54) (low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence from one study (assessed at high risk of bias) that doxycycline 100 mg was as effective as azithromycin. Low dose minocycline (45 mg) was effective for papulopustular rosacea (low quality evidence). Oral tetracycline was compared with topical metronidazole in four studies and showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatments for any outcome (low to moderate quality evidence). Low dose isotretinoin was considered by both the participants (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.43) and physicians (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.36) to be slightly more effective than doxycycline 50–100 mg (high quality evidence). Pulsed dye laser was more effective than yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser based on one study, and it appeared to be as effective as intense pulsed light therapy (both low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There was high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline and isotretinoin for rosacea. Moderate quality evidence was available for topical metronidazole and oral tetracycline. There was low quality evidence for low dose minocycline, laser and intense pulsed light therapy and ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. Time needed to response and response duration should be addressed more completely, with more rigorous reporting of adverse events. Further studies on treatment of ocular rosacea are warranted.

### Glucocorticoids promote CCL20 expression in keratinocytes [^111YzFxB]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Studies of other diseases may provide clues as to why some inflammatory skin conditions are responsive to steroids, while others are not. Asthma is a respiratory disease characterized by hyper‐reactive airways and bronchial inflammation. A cornerstone of asthma therapy includes inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs), but a significant subset of individuals with asthma respond poorly to steroids. Studies of patient sputum and bronchial epithelial cells from steroid‐insensitive patients demonstrated the elevation of proinflammatory cytokines. In particular, the consistent elevation of CCL20 is characteristic of severe asthma in humans and mouse models.CCL20 is a chemoattractant for T helper (Th) 17 T lymphocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. In bronchial epithelia, GCs result in a paradoxical induction of CCL20, which may help to explain the molecular basis of steroid insensitivity in asthma.

CCL20 is also consistently elevated in the papulopustular forms of rosacea. While many clinical features of rosacea are characteristic of an exacerbated innate immune response, a dense lymphocytic infiltrate is often present, implicating a role for adaptive immunity. In the skin, CCL20 is expressed from keratinocytes and drives the Th17‐polarized T‐lymphocyte response observed in the inflammatory forms of rosacea. Sparked by observations made in bronchial epithelia, the objective of this study was to determine whether GCs induce CCL20 expression in keratinocytes, towards a long‐term goal of better understanding how steroids can worsen inflammation in skin conditions such as rosacea.

### Rosacea fulminans in pregnancy: case report and review of the literature [^116kNYYP]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Rosacea fulminans is a rare disease of unknown cause which occurs exclusively in women years after adolescence. Although the etiology is unknown, immunologic, hormonal, and vascular factors have been suggested. When rosacea fulminans occurs during pregnancy and in women taking oral contraceptive pills, hormonal factors may be a trigger. Rosacea fulminans is localized specifically to the face, with the chin, cheeks, and forehead bearing the brunt of the attack. A dull red, cyanotic erythema of all involved facial areas, extending beyond the inflammatory nodules, is typical. We present the case of a 31-year-old pregnant woman who had rosacea fulminans during the first trimester of her second pregnancy. She had multiple erythematous papules, pustules, nodules, and purulent discharging cysts on the face. Conventional therapeutic approaches with systemic corticosteroids were associated with clear improvement within 2 months, and subsequently only 0.75% metronidazole topical cream was used during the second trimester.

### Rosacea: II. therapy [^113V2Dy7]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Despite an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of rosacea, therapeutic modalities continue to expand. The principal subtypes of rosacea include erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, and ocular rosacea. These phenotypic expressions are probably caused by divergent pathogenic factors and consequently respond to different therapeutic regimens. A subtype-directed approach to therapy is discussed in part II of this review. We provide an overview of the available topical, oral, laser, and light therapies in the context of these cutaneous subtypes, review the evidence that supports their use, and outline their therapeutic approach. Suggestions for future areas of study also are provided. Learning objective At the completion of this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the subtype-directed approach to therapy for rosacea including available topical, oral, laser, and light therapies.

General:

Clobetasol propionate cream USP, 0.05% should not be used in the treatment of rosacea or perioral dermatitis, and should not be used on the face, groin, or axillae.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on therapy.

Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests. Patients receiving super-potent corticosteroids should not be treated for more than 2 weeks at a time, and only small areas should be treated at any one time due to the increased risk of HPA suppression.

Clobetasol propionate cream produced HPA axis suppression when used at doses as low as 2 g/day for 1 week in patients with eczema.

If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur that require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios (see PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use).

If irritation develops, clobetasol propionate cream should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.

If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of clobetasol propionate cream should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.

### Effective and evidence-based management strategies for rosacea: summary of a cochrane systematic review [^111Uzw9Z]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common chronic skin disease affecting the face. There are numerous treatment options, but it is unclear which are the most effective. The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for the efficacy and safety of treatments for rosacea. Searches included the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Ongoing Trials Registers (updated February 2011). Randomized controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea were included. Fifty-eight trials, including 27 from the original review, comprising 6633 participants were included in this updated review. Interventions included topical metronidazole, oral antibiotics, topical azelaic cream or gel, topical benzoyl peroxide and/or combined with topical antibiotics, sulphacetamide/sulphur, and others. There was some evidence that topical metronidazole and azelaic acid were more effective than placebo. Two trials indicated that doxycycline 40mg was more effective than placebo. There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between doxycycline 40mg and 100mg but there were fewer adverse effects. One study reported that ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion was significantly more effective than artificial tears for treating ocular rosacea. Although the majority of included studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias, there was some evidence to support the effectiveness of topical metronidazole, azelaic acid and doxycycline (40mg) in the treatment of moderate to severe rosacea, and ciclosporin 0.05% ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. Further well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials are required.

### Interventions for rosacea: abridged updated cochrane systematic review including GRADE assessments [^114idnQX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common chronic facial dermatosis. This update of our Cochrane review on interventions for rosacea summarizes the evidence, including Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group assessments, of the effects of the currently available treatments. Searches included the following: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Science Citation Index, and ongoing trials registries (July 2014). We included 106 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 13 631 participants, a more than 80% increase since the last update in 2011. Pooling of data was feasible for a few outcomes, for topical metronidazole and azelaic acid and both appeared to be more effective than placebo (moderate and high-quality evidence, respectively). Topical ivermectin was more effective than placebo based on two studies (high-quality evidence), and slightly more effective than metronidazole in one study. Brimonidine was more effective than vehicle in reducing erythema in rosacea (high-quality evidence). Ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion was effective for ocular rosacea (low-quality evidence). For oral treatments there was moderate-quality evidence for the effectiveness of tetracycline based on two old studies, and high-quality evidence for doxycycline 40 mg compared with placebo according to physician assessments. One study at high risk of bias demonstrated equivalent effectiveness for azithromycin and doxycycline 100 mg. Minocycline 45 mg may be effective for papulopustular rosacea (low-quality evidence). Low-dose isotretinoin appeared to be slightly more effective than doxycycline 50–100 mg (high-quality evidence). Laser and light-based therapies for erythema in rosacea were effective (low-quality evidence). Further RCTs are required for ocular rosacea.

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^113CxtSw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This updated systematic review conforms to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) statement, 10 and followed a prespecified protocol. 11

Inclusion criteria

The only inclusion criterion was that the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining all types of interventions in people with rosacea.

Outcome measures

Our primary outcomes were quality of life, participant‐assessed rosacea severity and proportion of participants reporting an adverse event. Secondary outcome measures were physician‐assessed rosacea severity, assessment of erythema and telangiectasia, lesion counts, time to improvement and duration of remission.

Search strategies

We searched several databases up to 6 March 2018: CENTRAL (in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and Science Citation Index (for the search strategies see Appendix S1). Furthermore, E.J.v.Z. and M.M.D.v.d.L searched trials registers on 13 March 2018 with the terms 'rosacea' and 'rhinophyma': metaRegister of Controlled Trials, U.S. National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform, the Ongoing Skin Trials Register. Two authors (E.J.v.Z. Z.F.) examined the bibliographies of included and excluded studies for further potentially eligible studies. We did not apply language restrictions and several articles were translated. Two authors independently assessed the titles and abstracts from the searches (E.J.v.Z. Z.F.). The same two authors independently assessed the obtained full‐text papers of all potentially eligible included studies. Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

Data extraction and risk‐of‐bias assessment

Study details and outcome data were collected independently by two authors (E.J.v.Z. and Z.F.) using a piloted data‐extraction form. Disagreements on data entry were resolved through discussion. The following details were extracted: design, year of publication, setting, country of origin, number, sex and age of participants, ocular involvement, dropouts and losses to follow‐up, intervention, outcomes, baseline data, funding and conflicts of interest. Two authors (E.J.v.Z. Z.F.) independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration's domain‐based assessment tool. 12

### Interventions for rosacea based on the phenotype approach: an updated systematic review including GRADE assessments [^115gvoHV]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This updated review, including 152 studies, focused on studies and comparisons that were likely to provide evidence‐based and reliable treatment options, within a phenotype approach.

For transient reduction of persistent erythema, there is high‐certainty evidence to support the efficacy and safety of brimonidine gel and moderate‐certainty evidence for oxymetazoline cream during 12 h after application. Both topical treatments probably result in little‐to‐no difference in number of participants experiencing an adverse event when compared with vehicle (moderate‐certainty evidence).

For persistent erythema and telangiectasia, there was low‐to‐moderate‐certainty evidence of the efficacy of (long) PDL, Nd:YAG laser and intense pulsed light therapy.

For papules/pustules of rosacea, there is high‐certainty evidence that topical azelaic acid and topical ivermectin reduce lesion counts, and moderate‐certainty evidence for topical metronidazole and topical minocycline. It still needs to be established whether topical azelaic acid is more effective than topical metronidazole, but topical ivermectin appeared to be slightly more effective than topical metronidazole (moderate‐certainty evidence).

### Interventions for rosacea [^113Q74Cw]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are associated with highest efficacy and fewest adverse events for treating rosacea?

Bottom Line

There is high-quality evidence that topical brimonidine, azelaic acid, and ivermectin, as well as oral doxycycline and isotretinoin, are associated with improvements in rosacea. Lower-quality evidence is available for topical metronidazole, oral tetracycline, laser and light-based therapy, and topical cyclosporine for ocular rosacea. Most treatments are not associated with higher adverse event rates than placebo.

### Rosacea: where are we now? [^117AKiFY]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Advances continue to be made in the classification and treatment of rosacea, a chronic dermatologic syndrome. A new empiric classification system identifies 4 rosacea subtypes (erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular) that may aid in more precise diagnosis. Several new therapies have recently been approved for treatment of rosacea. Azelaic acid 15% gel is a new first-tier topical agent proven effective in reducing inflammatory lesions and erythema. New formulations of metronidazole and sulfacetamide 10%/sulfur 5% that offer cosmetic or tolerability advantages are now available. Intense pulsed light therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing flushing, erythema, and telangiectases, with greater tolerability than existing laser systems. Other treatments under investigation include low-dose doxycycline hyclate (which may provide greater safety than existing oral antibiotics), benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin gel, and tacrolimus ointment (for steroid-induced rosacea). With this expanded armamentarium of medical and light-based therapies, clinicians can now implement a multifaceted approach to treatment, crafting new treatment combinations to address the unique and evolving features of rosacea in each individual patient.

### Recommendations for rosacea diagnosis, classification and management: update from the global ROSacea COnsensus 2019 panel [^1174shi4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

A transition from a subtyping to a phenotyping approach in rosacea is underway, allowing individual patient management according to presenting features instead of categorization by predefined subtypes. Theaceansensus 2017 recommendations further support this transition and align with guidance from other working groups.

Objectives

To update and extend previous globalrecommendations in line with the latest research and continue supporting uptake of the phenotype approach in rosacea through clinical tool development.

Methods

Nineteen dermatologists and two ophthalmologists used a modified Delphi approach to reach consensus on statements pertaining to critical aspects of rosacea diagnosis, classification and management. Voting was electronic and blinded.

Results

Delphi statements on which the panel achieved consensus of ≥ 75% voting 'Agree' or 'Strongly agree' are presented. The panel recommends discussing disease burden with patients during consultations, using four questions to assist conversations. The primary treatment objective should be achievement of complete clearance, owing to previously established clinical benefits for patients. Cutaneous and ocular features are defined. Treatments have been reassessed in line with recent evidence and the prior treatment algorithm updated. Combination therapy is recommended to benefit patients with multiple features. Ongoing monitoring and dialogue should take place between physician and patients, covering defined factors to maximize outcomes. A prototype clinical tool (Rosacea Tracker) and patient case studies have been developed from consensus statements.

Conclusions

The current survey updates previous recommendations as a basis for local guideline development and provides clinical tools to facilitate a phenotype approach in practice and improve rosacea patient management.

What's already known about this topic?

A transition to a phenotype approach in rosacea is underway and is being recommended by multiple working groups.
New research has become available since the previous ROSCO consensus, necessitating an update and extension of recommendations.

What does this study add?

We offer updated global recommendations for clinical practice that account for recent research, to continue supporting the transition to a phenotype approach in rosacea.
We present prototype clinical tools to facilitate use of the phenotype approach in practice and improve management of patients with rosacea.

### Rosacea: part II. topical and systemic therapies in the treatment of rosacea [^115NFh3j]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Although rosacea's impact on physical health is limited, it has profound effects on a person's psychological well-being. Therefore, treating rosacea can greatly affect a person's quality of life. Patient education regarding trigger avoidance and skin care techniques such as moisturizing and sun protection are important non-pharmacologic first steps in treating rosacea. Pharmacologic interventions range from topical to systemic medications, with the ideal medication choice dependent on the symptoms and severity of each individual patient. Despite this variety of therapeutic options, none of these therapies are completely curative, and therefore further research into the pathophysiology of rosacea is required in order to create more targeted and efficacious treatment options.

Brimonidine

Two studies (low risk of bias) showed, after 3 h, a two‐grade improvement in patient's self‐assessment of erythema (0–4, clear–severe) in 114 of 277 patients using topical brimonidine 3 mg g⁻¹ gel vs. 54 of 276 using vehicle [RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.60–2.78 (P < 0.001; I² = 0%); NNTB 5, 95% CI 3–7; high‐certainty evidence]. 139 In the brimonidine group adverse events were reported in 88 of 277 participants vs. 68 of 276 in the vehicle group [RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.98–1.69 (I² = 0%); moderate‐certainty evidence]. In both studies, adverse events were mild and transient. Most frequently reported were worsening of erythema, flushing, pruritus and skin irritation. During the 4‐week follow‐up, no rebound erythema was observed. Physicians' assessments were in accord with patients' assessments (high‐certainty evidence).

Oxymetazoline

In two studies (unclear risk of bias) participants' assessments using the subjective self‐assessment (0, no signs of unwanted redness; 4, severe redness) showed a two‐grade improvement after 3 h in 99 of 446 treated with oxymetazoline 1% cream and in 59 of 439 treated with vehicle [RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.23–2.21 (P < 0.001; I² = 0%); NNTB 11, 95% CI 7–27; moderate‐certainty evidence). 15, 30 In the oxymetazoline group 94 adverse events were reported in 446 participants vs. 70 in 439 participants in the vehicle group [RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.97–1.78 (I² = 13%); moderate‐certainty evidence]. Application‐site dermatitis, pruritus and erythema, worsening of inflammatory lesions and headache were the most reported adverse events and were considered mild or moderate in severity. During the 29‐day follow‐up period six patients in the oxymetazoline group experienced rebound erythema vs. two in the vehicle group. Physicians' assessments were in accord with patients' assessments (moderate‐certainty evidence).

Statistical analysis

We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and their associated 95% confidence interval (CI). When RRs were statistically significant, we calculated number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or number needed to treat for one additional harmful outcome (NNTH). In the absence of substantial heterogeneity (I² statistic < 60%), data reported for our outcomes were pooled using a random‐effects model and summarized with the I² statistic. All analyses were undertaken using RevMan 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark).

Certainty of evidence

We applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) to assess the certainty of evidence for the prespecified outcomes of the main comparisons using GRADEproGDT to generate summary‐of‐findings tables (see Appendix S1 for details on methods, results and 25 summary‐of‐findings tables). 13 See Table 1 for GRADE Working Group grades of evidence.

### Topical steroids as a cause of acne rosacea in children… [^114i1yF9]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Steroid-induced acne rosacea is usually treated with an antibiotic and continuation of a low-potency topical steroid. The time required for clearing of the lesions after institution of treatment is unknown. When topical metronidazole is used to treat steroid rosacea, eight to 14 weeks of therapy are required to clear the lesions. Weston and Morelli evaluated the clinical features of steroid rosacea and the response to treatment in 106 prepubertal children. Children in the retrospective study were less than 13 years of age and were seen during an eight-year period at a university-based ambulatory care center. There were 46 boys and 60 girls. The topical steroids were classified according to strength from class 1 to class 7, with class 7 being the weakest and including over-the-counter 1 percent hydrocorti-sone. Class 7 agents had been the steroid used in 54 percent of the children; only 3 percent used superpotent agents.

The authors believe that evidence does not support continuing use of topical steroids of any potency if steroid rosacea develops in a child. Thus, they recommended complete and abrupt discontinuation of these products. Acne rosacea was treated with oral erythromycin stearate, in a dosage of 30 mg per kg daily in two divided doses for four weeks, or with topical clindamycin twice daily for four weeks in patients with a history of erythromycin intolerance or allergy. The rosacea lesions had completely cleared within three weeks of abrupt withdrawal of the topical steroid and initiation of antibiotic therapy in 22 percent of the children. In 86 percent of the children, the lesions had resolved within four weeks. In all of the children, the lesions had completely cleared by eight weeks. The authors conclude that even topical steroids at the lowest potency can induce rosacea. Low-strength steroids were implicated in more than one half of the patients in their series.

The authors believe the findings support the abrupt withdrawal of steroids as one component of treatment rather than switching the patient to a lower steroid dosage, which is often the practice. They recommend the use of oral erythromycin as the treatment of choice in children with steroid-induced rosacea. They also recommend that topical steroids, including class 7 agents, be especially avoided in children who are susceptible to steroid-induced rosacea.

### Rosacea: clinical presentation and pathophysiology [^115DYMsK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Acne rosacea is one of the most common diagnoses seen in the clinical dermatologic practice. The classic presentation of rosacea, acneiform papules, and pustules on a background of telangiectasia, is often easily identified by primary care physicians, patients, or their similarly afflicted friends or family members. However, rosacea actually represents a spectrum of disease from chronic skin hypersensitivity and flushing to rhinophyma. Although the pathogenesis of rosacea remains unknown, it is important to understand its various presentations and possible etiologies prior to developing individualized treatment protocols.

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, March 2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to March 2002), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2002), Biosis (from 1970 to March 2002) and the Science Citation Index (from 1988 to March 2002). Reference lists of trials and key review articles were also searched. Relevant manufacturers and experts were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea were included. Studies judged by the reviewers to have seriously flawed methodology were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and analysis were carried out by two independent reviewers.

Main Results

The evidence provided by twenty-two included studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting. One of our primary outcome measures, 'quality of life', was not assessed in any of the studies. Only two studies of ocular rosacea could be included. Pooled data from two trials involving 174 participants indicated that topical metronidazole is more effective than placebo (odds ratio 5.96, 95% confidence interval 2.95 to 12.06). Data from a between-patient trial (114 patients) and a within-patient trial (33 patients) of azelaic cream versus placebo were not pooled, but both showed good evidence of efficacy. Data pooled from three studies of oral tetracycline versus placebo involving 152 participants showed that, according to physicians' ratings, tetracycline was effective (odds ratio 6.06, 95% confidence interval 2.96 to 12.42). Some evidence of efficacy of oral metronidazole was provided by one small study.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The quality of studies evaluating rosacea treatments was generally poor. There is evidence that topical metronidazole and azelaic acid cream have a therapeutic effect. There is some evidence that oral metronidazole and tetracycline are effective. There is insufficient evidence concerning the effectiveness of other treatments. As many of these treatments are used for rosacea, good RCTs are urgently needed.

### Topical steroid withdrawal treated with ruxolitinib cream [^112c3BTU]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is an adverse effect caused by prolonged inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids (TCS), causing erythematous edematous well-demarcated plaques and severe burning sensations upon TCS discontinuation. Other clinical features include diffuse desquamation and a rosacea-like pattern. Although descriptions of this disease continue to emerge, less is known about appropriate treatment. Current recommendations in literature include 1 or more of the following: discontinuation of TCS with a possible slow taper, oral antihistamines, oral antibiotics, ice/cool compresses, or psychological support. Some online recommendations (accessed December 10, 2023) suggest that healing is only possible through complete immediate cessation of TCS. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman with a multiyear history of burning, itching erythematous patches of the lips and cheeks who was diagnosed with TSW. The patient poorly tolerated tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and pimecrolimus 1% cream but her condition cleared with topical ruxolitinib 1.5% cream use.

### Use of an alternative method to evaluate erythema severity in a clinical trial: difference in vehicle response with evaluation of baseline and postdose photographs for effect of oxymetazoline cream 1. 0% for persistent erythema of rosacea in a phase IV study [^114MaMu8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this photographic study of topical once‐daily oxymetazoline 1.0% cream, investigators evaluated erythema severity in photographs from the REVEAL pivotal phase III trials, with reference to the baseline photograph. More than 60% of patients achieved at least a 1‐grade CEA improvement that persisted at least 12 h after application of oxymetazoline. Notably, the proportions of patients achieving the same outcome with vehicle were substantially lower when investigators were allowed to refer to the baseline photograph than in the phase III trials, in which live, static assessments were made (up to 43.2% lower). The introduction of a baseline photograph into the methodology for evaluating erythema severity resulted in an apparent mitigation of the vehicle effect, perhaps allowing better visualization of lack of improvement. At the same time, the use of photography in the CEA assessments did not distort the results for oxymetazoline; proportions of patients who achieved at least a 1‐grade improvement in CEA from baseline with oxymetazoline remained consistent between the trials.

The lack of access to the baseline photographs during the live patient assessments in the phase III trials may have inflated the results for vehicle. Improvements with vehicle treatment have been a documented limitation of randomized controlled clinical trials investigating new drugs for dermatological diseases, including rosacea. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 Raters, blinded to the study treatment, may seek out the expected effects of the active drug treatment from the vehicle treatment, artificially identifying a response to vehicle where none exists. 22 The vehicle control is inherent to the design of clinical trials to support new rosacea drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as is the live, static assessment of efficacy measures, i.e. assessment based on physical examination of patients at study visits with no reference to other time points in the study, such as baseline. 13, 14, 15 This study has demonstrated that the review of photography – in particular, reference to a baseline photograph – may enhance the evaluation of the efficacy of a topical treatment for persistent erythema of rosacea, potentially resulting in more accurate assessments for vehicle.

Regarding specific circumstances for rosacea, more specifically with respect to patients with ocular rosacea (nonpharmacologic management), BAD 2021 guidelines recommend to offer OTC ocular lubricants or liposomal sprays to alleviate symptoms in patients with ocular rosacea, ensuring preservative-free preparations are used if using > 6 times daily.

### Recommendations for rosacea diagnosis, classification and management: update from the global ROSacea COnsensus 2019 panel [^116LCY6E]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The ROSCO project continues to provide a global perspective on rosacea diagnosis, classification and management, and supports the transition to a phenotype approach. This updated consensus offers recommendations for assessing the burden of rosacea, aiming for clear as a treatment goal; diagnosing, classifying and describing disease features; managing patients using combination therapy; and disease monitoring. Further work is still needed, particularly education around ocular rosacea and continued development, refinement and validation of tools to facilitate both daily practice and clinical research. However, these recommendations can provide a basis for local guideline development and help to improve outcomes in all patients with rosacea by individualizing management.

### Facial rash… [^111A9w7x]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a six-month history of erythematous papules around the mouth. A physician had prescribed a topical steroid cream for this eruption three months ago with initial improvement in the rash. The patient had continued to use the steroid cream until two weeks before this appointment. The erythematous papules never resolved during treatment and quickly worsened after stopping the topical steroid. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Question Discussion The answer is A: perioral dermatitis. This patient's condition was exacerbated by prolonged topical steroid use, and rebound with discontinuation of the topical steroid is typical. Perioral dermatitis is a facial dermatosis most often affecting women.

It is characterized by erythematous papules classically located at the nasolabial folds, chin, and upper lip with sparing of the vermilion border. 1 The superimposed steroid withdrawal is a common problem seen in the clinic. Whenever the patient stops treatment, a rash flare results, usually worse than the initial rash. The patient then restarts the topical steroid not knowing it is perpetuating the problem. Discontinuance of the topical steroid is essential for successful treatment, and patients should be advised that a short flare of the rash may result, before improvement. 4 Oral antibiotics or topical antibiotics are typically used to facilitate clearance of the rash. This patient improved rapidly on tetracycline, 250 mg orally once daily, and the rash resolved in six weeks. Acne often affects the perioral area, but will typically have a generalized distribution on the face, back, forehead, and chin. Acne is usually most active at younger ages.

Lichen planus often presents with the sudden onset of a localized papular rash that initially responds to topical steroids. Pruritus is usually seen. White lacy lines on the buccal mucosa or on moistened lesions are diagnostic. Dermatomyositis usually presents as a periorbital, confluent, macular, violaceous erythema. Muscle pain and weakness are signs of more serious disease.
