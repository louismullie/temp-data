## Question

What can cause elevate lactate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause elevated lactate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of lactate production and clearance. Then, I should classify the major etiologies into type A (hypoxic) versus type B (non-hypoxic) causes. Next, I will review common clinical scenarios that raise lactate, including sepsis, medications, liver disease, malignancy, and exercise. After that, I need to consider special forms like D-lactic acidosis and CSF lactate. Finally, I will integrate how to interpret lactate trends and thresholds in practice, and close with a concise synthesis that distinguishes increased production from impaired clearance mechanisms.

> Let me first confirm the foundational physiology. Lactate is produced from pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase and is normally cleared primarily by the liver and kidneys; in stable states, production equals clearance with a normal venous lactate around 0.5–2.0 mmol/L, so any elevation reflects increased production, decreased clearance, or both, and I should keep both arms in mind as I proceed.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "lactic acidosis" implying lactate is the acid source. I should verify the modern view: lactate production actually consumes protons, so the acidosis in hypoperfusion is driven by ATP hydrolysis and proton generation rather than lactate itself; lactate accumulation is a marker of metabolic stress, not the direct cause of acidosis, which is why the term "lactate anion acidosis" is more accurate than "lactic acidosis" in many contexts [^1115rWWr].

> Next, I should review the classic type A versus type B framework. Type A reflects inadequate oxygen delivery with anaerobic glycolysis, whereas type B reflects non-hypoxic mechanisms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired clearance, or altered redox states; I need to ensure I categorize causes carefully because management diverges substantially between these buckets [^1134BsJv] [^116kvqZe].

> I will now examine type A causes. Sepsis and septic shock are prototypical, where both decreased oxygen delivery and microcirculatory shunting increase anaerobic glycolysis; cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, and traumatic shock similarly reduce perfusion and raise lactate, and even mild elevations correlate with worse outcomes, so I should confirm hemodynamics and perfusion when lactate is high in these settings [^114RPu15] [^116x4B8d] [^113se4Sq].

> Wait, let me verify the sepsis nuance. In sepsis, lactate elevation is not purely hypoxic; inflammatory signaling and catecholamine-driven aerobic glycolysis also contribute, and clearance may be impaired by hepatic dysfunction, so lactate trends must be interpreted alongside clinical perfusion and organ function rather than assumed to reflect only tissue hypoxia [^114RPu15] [^116KTdhp] [^11136oJx].

> Now, I should review type B causes. Medications are frequent culprits: beta-agonists like albuterol increase glycolysis and can cause clinically significant hyperlactatemia even without hypoxia, metformin can precipitate lactic acidosis especially with renal or hepatic dysfunction or hypoxia, and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors impair mitochondrial function; I need to check the medication list carefully before attributing lactate to hypoperfusion alone [^117Nhg3n] [^1151hYvf] [^1166HP6o] [^1166HP6o].

> Let me consider hepatic dysfunction next. The liver clears roughly 60% of lactate, so acute or chronic liver failure, ischemic hepatitis, and cirrhosis can elevate lactate even when production is modest; I should double-check liver enzymes, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters when lactate is high and perfusion seems adequate [^111suThw] [^111dAKuu].

> I should confirm malignancy-related mechanisms. Tumors, particularly high-grade lymphomas, can exhibit Warburg metabolism with aerobic glycolysis and overproduction of lactate; case-based literature highlights type B lactic acidosis in undiagnosed lymphoma, so if lactate is elevated and the patient is hemodynamically stable, I need to consider occult malignancy and evaluate accordingly [^113F3PGr] [^112ZQAdV].

> But wait, what if the patient is exercising or seizing. Strenuous exercise and generalized seizures transiently increase lactate via accelerated glycolysis and are classic non-pathologic causes; lactate typically normalizes within an hour, so I should correlate with recent activity and repeat testing if the clinical picture is discordant [^116KTdhp] [^116J8xGV].

> Next, I should review special forms. D-lactic acidosis occurs with short bowel syndrome and bacterial overgrowth producing D-lactate, which is not measured by standard L-lactate assays; I need to suspect it in patients with encephalopathy and metabolic acidosis after bowel surgery or in malabsorption states and order specific D-lactate testing if suspected [^113zcg6U] [^1143EUTA].

> I will now examine CSF lactate. Elevations in cerebrospinal fluid lactate accompany bacterial meningitis, mitochondrial encephalopathies, seizures, and ischemic stroke; in contrast to blood lactate, CSF lactate is less affected by systemic perfusion and more reflective of CNS metabolism, so I should interpret it in neurologic context and ensure samples are obtained without contamination from blood [^114X51qW] [^116EFuxB].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret lactate in practice. Serial measurements are more informative than a single value because they capture production and clearance dynamics; guidelines suggest measuring lactate in suspected sepsis and, if elevated, repeating within 2–4 hours to guide resuscitation, recognizing that lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific for sepsis and must be integrated with the clinical picture [^112oDUMj] [^114jA46a] [^112RqT9U].

> Let me reconsider thresholds. Although many programs use > 2.0 mmol/L as "elevated" and > 4.0 mmol/L as high risk, even relative hyperlactatemia around 1.5 mmol/L has been associated with increased mortality and microcirculatory abnormalities, so I should not dismiss modest elevations when the patient is ill; conversely, normal lactate does not exclude shock, especially in chronic disease or with impaired clearance [^114ugaki] [^1178L3xD] [^115TePB4].

> I should double-check confounders that can artifactually elevate lactate or mislead interpretation. Alkalosis, catecholamines, and high-dose beta-agonists increase glycolysis; renal replacement therapy with lactate-buffered fluids can raise measured lactate; and in liver failure, clearance is reduced, so trends and context are essential to avoid misattribution to ongoing hypoperfusion [^1166HP6o] [^116yU1AB] [^11136oJx].

> In summary, I need to ensure I distinguish increased production from impaired clearance. Elevated lactate arises from either increased production in hypoxia or stress states, or decreased clearance in liver disease, shock with hepatic hypoperfusion, or mitochondrial dysfunction, and many cases are mixed; accurate interpretation hinges on serial measurements, hemodynamic assessment, organ function evaluation, and a careful medication and comorbidity review rather than relying on a single value or a single mechanism [^116kvqZe] [^111suThw] [^115asmtM].

Elevated lactate reflects **increased production** or **decreased clearance** [^116kvqZe]. The most common causes are **tissue hypoperfusion** (shock, sepsis, ischemia) [^114RPu15] and **aerobic glycolysis** from stress, catecholamines, or beta-agonists [^116KTdhp] [^117Nhg3n]. Other causes include liver dysfunction [^111dAKuu], malignancy (e.g. lymphoma) [^113F3PGr], mitochondrial toxins (e.g. metformin, NRTIs) [^1166HP6o], thiamine deficiency [^112nzUo8], and D-lactic acidosis [^113zcg6U]. Even mild elevations (> 1.5 mmol/L) are linked to worse outcomes [^114ugaki], so **serial lactate and clinical context** are essential for interpretation and management [^116J8xGV] [^115G8oLL].

---

## Physiological production and clearance of lactate

Lactate is a normal byproduct of glycolysis; under aerobic conditions, most is oxidized or used for gluconeogenesis, maintaining a stable blood level of ~0.5–2.0 mmol/L [^114qWsXF]. The liver clears ~60% and the kidneys ~30% [^111suThw]; **impaired clearance or increased production** raises levels [^116kvqZe].

---

## Classification of hyperlactatemia

Hyperlactatemia is classified as **type A (hypoxic)** or **type B (non-hypoxic)** [^1134BsJv]:

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Type A | Tissue hypoperfusion/hypoxia | - Shock (septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic) [^114RPu15] <br/> - Severe anemia <br/> - CO poisoning <br/> - Ischemia [^1134BsJv] |
| Type B | Non-hypoxic mechanisms | - Liver dysfunction [^111dAKuu] <br/> - Malignancy (lymphoma) [^113F3PGr] <br/> - Mitochondrial toxins (metformin, NRTIs) [^115Dy7UF] <br/> - Thiamine deficiency [^112nzUo8] <br/> - D-lactic acidosis [^113zcg6U] <br/> - Aerobic glycolysis (stress, catecholamines, beta-agonists) [^116KTdhp] [^117Nhg3n] |

---

## Common causes of elevated lactate

### Type A hyperlactatemia (hypoxic)

- **Shock states**: Septic, cardiogenic, and hemorrhagic shock reduce oxygen delivery, driving anaerobic glycolysis [^114RPu15].
- **Severe anemia**: Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity increases anaerobic metabolism.
- **Carbon monoxide poisoning**: Impairs oxygen delivery and utilization.
- **Ischemia**: Localized or global ischemia increases anaerobic glycolysis [^1134BsJv].

---

### Type B hyperlactatemia (non-hypoxic)

- **Liver dysfunction**: Reduced clearance from cirrhosis, hepatitis, or ischemic hepatitis [^111dAKuu].
- **Malignancy**: Lymphoma and other tumors increase aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) [^113F3PGr].
- **Mitochondrial toxins**: Metformin, NRTIs, and propofol impair oxidative phosphorylation [^115Dy7UF].
- **Thiamine deficiency**: Impairs pyruvate dehydrogenase, increasing lactate [^112nzUo8].
- **D-lactic acidosis**: Bacterial overgrowth produces D-lactate, not measured by standard assays [^113zcg6U].
- **Aerobic glycolysis**: Stress, catecholamines, and beta-agonists increase lactate without hypoxia [^116KTdhp] [^117Nhg3n].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated lactate

Elevated lactate is a marker of illness severity and mortality across settings [^113se4Sq]. Even mild elevations (> 1.5 mmol/L) are associated with worse outcomes [^114ugaki], and **serial lactate trends** guide resuscitation and prognosis [^116J8xGV] [^115asmtM].

---

## Diagnostic approach to elevated lactate

A structured approach includes:

- **Confirm elevation**: Repeat measurement to exclude lab error.
- **Clinical context**: Assess perfusion, oxygenation, and organ function [^116x4B8d].
- **Classify**: Type A vs Type B based on hypoxia and contributing factors [^1134BsJv].
- **Targeted tests**: Liver function, renal function, glucose, thiamine, metformin levels, and consider D-lactate if indicated [^112nzUo8] [^113zcg6U].
- **Serial lactate**: Track trends to assess response and guide therapy [^116J8xGV].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Type A**: Restore perfusion with fluids, vasopressors, and source control [^notfound].
- **Type B**: Stop offending drugs, treat liver disease, malignancy, or thiamine deficiency, and consider dialysis for toxins [^115Dy7UF] [^112nzUo8].
- **Supportive care**: Correct acid-base disturbances and monitor organ function [^notfound].

---

Elevated lactate reflects **increased production or decreased clearance**; identifying the cause and tracking trends are key to management and prognosis [^116kvqZe] [^116J8xGV].

### Lactate elevation during and after major cardiac surgery in adults: a review of etiology, prognostic value, and management [^113GZuVc]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Elevated lactate is a common occurrence after cardiac surgery. This review summarizes the literature on the complex etiology of lactate elevation during and after cardiac surgery, including considerations of oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, increased metabolism, lactate clearance, medications and fluids, and postoperative complications. Second, the association between lactate and a variety of outcomes are described, and the prognostic role of lactate is critically assessed. Despite the fact that elevated lactate is strongly associated with many important outcomes, including postoperative complications, length of stay, and mortality, little is known about the optimal management of postoperative patients with lactate elevations. This review ends with an assessment of the limited literature on this subject.

### Effects of endotoxin on lactate metabolism in humans [^112L6T4n]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Endotoxin administration leads to increased plasma lactate concentrations.

- Resting energy expenditure increased significantly in response to endotoxin.

- This increase is caused by a stimulation of glucose and lactate production.

- This increased lactate production does not occur in the muscle.

### Utility of lactate levels in the diagnosis and prognosis of septic shock [^115pA8pd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Early recognition of septic shock and its treatment are key factors for limiting progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death. Lactate, a byproduct of metabolic pathways, is usually elevated in tissue hypoperfusion and shock and is associated with poor prognosis in sepsis. As a biomarker, it may help the clinician in risk stratification, and the identification and treatment of sepsis. In this article, we provide an update on lactate's pathophysiology and role in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in children with sepsis and septic shock.

### Hyperlactatemia in type 2 diabetes: can physical training help? [^111um4Bt]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetic patients often exhibit hyperlactatemia in association with a reduced aerobic-oxidative capacity and a restricted lactate transport. Studies suggest a link between increased lactate levels and the manifestation and progression of insulin resistance. However, the specificities of molecular mechanisms remain unclear, and it is not entirely clear whether elevated lactate levels are a cause or consequence of type 2 diabetes. This review focuses on lactate as a key molecule in diabetes and provides an overview of how regular physical activity can be helpful in normalizing elevated lactate levels in type 2 diabetic patients. Physical training may reduce lactate production and reinforce lactate transport and clearance among this particular patient group. We emphasize the crucial role physical training plays in the therapy of type 2 diabetes due to evidence that pharmacological treatment with metformin, which is commonly used in the first-line therapy of type 2 diabetes, does not help reducing lactate levels.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### Stress hyperlactataemia: present understanding and controversy [^116KTdhp]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

An increased blood lactate concentration is common during physiological (exercise) and pathophysiological stress (stress hyperlactataemia). In disease states, there is overwhelming evidence that stress hyperlactataemia is a strong independent predictor of mortality. However, the source, biochemistry, and physiology of exercise-induced and disease-associated stress hyperlactataemia are controversial. The dominant paradigm suggests that an increased lactate concentration is secondary to anaerobic glycolysis induced by tissue hypoperfusion, hypoxia, or both. However, in the past two decades, much evidence has shown that stress hyperlactataemia is actually due to increased aerobic lactate production, with or without decreased lactate clearance. Moreover, this lactate production is associated with and is probably secondary to adrenergic stimulation. Increased lactate production seems to be an evolutionarily preserved protective mechanism, which facilitates bioenergetic efficiency in muscle and other organs and provides necessary substrate for gluconeogenesis. Finally, lactate appears to act like a hormone that modifies the expression of various proteins, which themselves increase the efficiency of energy utilisation and metabolism. Clinicians need to be aware of these advances in our understanding of stress hyperlactataemia to approach patient management according to logical principles. We discuss the new insights and controversies about stress hyperlactataemia.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^112oDUMj]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of in-hospital death in the intensive care unit (ICU), with a short-term mortality rate ranging from 30 to 50%. Elevation as well as slow clearance of serum lactate levels has been reported to be associated with increased mortality in sepsis. As a product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate elevation can to some extent reflect poor tissue perfusion, though it can be affected by other factors. Thus, monitoring lactate levels may help clinicians understand the tissue perfusion situation and identify unrecognized shock, enabling them to adjust treatment in a timely fashion.

Because randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality with lactate-guided resuscitation, lactate measurement has been introduced into the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as an important component of the treatment bundles. The 2012 SSC bundle emphasized that an initial lactate level must be measured between 6 h before and 3 h after sepsis onset, followed by a repeated measurement within 6 h of sepsis presentation if the initial value is elevated. Levy et al. updated the SSC bundle to indicate that the initial lactate measurement should be performed within 1 h of onset and remeasured within 2–4 h to guide resuscitation if the initial lactate is > 2.0 mmol/L. However, there are limited studies focused on the timing of lactate measurement and remeasurement and its effect on outcomes. One study by Han et al. demonstrated that patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and initial lactate levels > 2.0 mmol/L had a 2% increase in the odds of death with each hour delay in lactate measurement. According to the analysis of 96 studies, Vincent et al. concluded that lactate measurement every 1–2 h is probably sufficient in most acute conditions, including sepsis. However, the optimal timing of the initial lactate measurement for septic patients remains controversial, and whether earlier initial and repeated lactate measurements could make a difference for septic patients with a higher lactate level remains unexplored.

Therefore, we designed this study to examine the relationship between early lactate measurement (within 1 h after ICU admission) and the outcomes of septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level (> 2.0 mmol/L), as well as to characterize the association of delays in initial lactate measurement and remeasurement with 28-day mortality to better understand the benefit of lactate monitoring in sepsis management.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^117DAB7u]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults notes that an elevated serum lactate is associated with sepsis and part of the definition of septic shock, but that "a serum lactate level alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnosing sepsis and should be interpreted based on the clinical context and with consideration for other causes of an elevated lactate level"; for these reasons, "a weak recommendation is made for measurement of serum lactate levels in adults suspected of having sepsis".

### Occurrence and adverse effect on outcome of hyperlactatemia in the critically ill [^113se4Sq]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hyperlactatemia occurs in approximately one-half of patients admitted to the ICU.

- Presentation with or development of hyperlactatemia after ICU admission is associated with increased mortality.

- Elevated admission lactate levels are step-wise associated with increased risk for death after controlling for severity of illness, age, and diagnosis.

### A review of bicarbonate use in common clinical scenarios [^1134BsJv]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Scenarios

Lactic Acidosis

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

### Endpoints of resuscitation [^115HSs6C]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the multiple causes of the shock state, all causes possess the common abnormality of oxygen supply not meeting tissue metabolic demands. Compensatory mechanisms may mask the severity of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, since catecholamines and extracellular fluid shifts initially compensate for the physiologic derangements associated with patients in shock. Despite the achievement of normal physiologic parameters after resuscitation, significant metabolic acidosis may continue to be present in the tissues, as evidenced by increased lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. This review discusses the major endpoints of resuscitation in clinical use.

### On the origins of lactate during sepsis [^111R12rC]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The origins of sepsis-induced hyperlactatemia are still imperfectly understood and probably multifactorial, resulting both from an increased production by various tissues through aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, and from a decreased lactate clearance. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Michaeli and colleagues showed that lactate elevation during mild endotoxemia is due to an increased aerobic production that does not take place in the muscle; other tissues/cells may thus be important contributors.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^112ncbPf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate and glucose metabolism

As lactate is a normal product of glucose and pyruvate metabolism, any increase in glucose metabolism or decrease in pyruvate metabolism will increase lactate generation and, in some cases, levels, even in the presence of adequate tissue oxygenation (as seen with epinephrine infusion). In sepsis, the inflammatory response appears associated with an increase in glycolysis and impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase (the enzyme critical for pyruvate entry into the Krebs cycle). Thus, cytoplasmic pyruvate increases with greater lactate formation but preserved pyruvate to lactate ratio, and lactate levels rise. In this way, the relationship of increased lactate production with tissue hypoxia as its possible source is confounded by the stress response that increases glucose metabolism and lactate generation. In addition, although lactate levels can be significantly decreased by improving its metabolism by the administration of dichloroacetate, this will not result in improved survival as it does not address the root cause. The same might apply to the correction of acidosis in the presence of increased lactate levels as the relationship between pH, anaerobic glycolysis, and lactate levels is not fully understood and is likely to be complex.

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^112cdM3e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Why has the tissue hypoxia paradigm emerged and dominated until now?

The clinical syndrome of lactic acidosis was popularized by Huckabee and Weil over five decades ago. These authors proposed that elevated blood lactate levels during experimental and clinical shock states served as a measure of the degree of oxygen deficit and the severity of injury. It became widely believed that, in critically ill patients, when oxygen delivery failed to meet oxygen demand an oxygen debt with global tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis would ensue. Furthermore, classic teaching describes type A lactic acidosis, which occurs due to inadequate oxygen delivery with the presence of anaerobic glycolysis, and type B lactic acidosis, which occurs in the absence of anaerobic glycolysis and is secondary to altered clearance, malignancy, or drugs. It is widely assumed that type A lactic acidosis is the cause of an elevated lactate concentration in the critically ill patient with an overt or occult hemodynamic disturbance. An increased blood lactate concentration is therefore regarded as evidence of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoxia. It follows from this reasoning that patients with an elevated blood lactate level should be treated by increasing oxygen delivery.

### Mildly elevated lactate levels are associated with microcirculatory flow abnormalities and increased mortality: a microSOAP post hoc analysis [^112fpaTb]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that even single-spot lactate levels within the usual reference range are associated with an unfavorable clinical course. However, the question remains how the clinician must incorporate these findings into an individualized approach to treating otherwise seemingly stable ICU patients. In vivo microscopy of the (sublingual) microcirculation may be helpful for detection of organ perfusion-related causes of mildly elevated lactate levels with potential consequences for a therapeutic strategy.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^112PWnJ9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Perfusion-guided resuscitation — For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest guiding resuscitation to decrease serum lactate in patients with elevated lactate level, over not using serum lactate (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and during acute resuscitation, serum lactate level should be interpreted considering the clinical context and other causes of elevated lactate. For adults with septic shock, we suggest using capillary refill time to guide resuscitation as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Lactate is a key mediator that links obesity to insulin resistance via modulating cytokine production from adipose tissue [^112pTDxP]. Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

Numerous evidence indicates that inflammation in adipose tissue is the primary cause of systemic insulin resistance induced by obesity. Obesity-associated changes in circulating LPS level and hypoxia/HIF-1α activation have been proposed to be involved in boosting obesity-induced inflammation. However, there is poor understanding of what triggers obesity-induced inflammation. In this study, we pinpoint lactate as a key trigger to mediate obesity-induced inflammation and systemic insulin resistance. Specific deletion of Slc16a1 that encodes MCT1, the primary lactate transporter in adipose tissues, robustly elevates blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines and aggravates systemic insulin resistance without alteration of adiposity in mice fed high-fat diet. Slc16a1 deletion in adipocytes elevates intracellular lactate level while reducing circulating lactate concentration. Mechanistically, lactate retention due to Slc16a1 deletion initiates adipocyte apoptosis and cytokine release. The locally recruited macrophages amplify the inflammation by release of proinflammatory cytokines to the circulation, leading to insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. This study, therefore, indicates that lactate within adipocytes has a key biological function linking obesity to insulin resistance, and harnessing lactate in adipocytes can be a promising strategy to break this link.

### Lactate dehydrogenase in dermatology practice [^11184BZf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is used in dermatology practice, particularly as a prognostic marker for cutaneous lymphoma. LDH is an intracellular enzyme involved in anaerobic glycolysis, and is found at low concentrations in the blood. LDH is produced in every tissue, thus cell damage releases LDH into the circulation, so the causes of elevated LDH levels are multiple. The utility of LDH in dermatology practice is reviewed, alongside current diagnostic and staging guidelines.

### Lactate homeostasis is maintained through regulation of glycolysis and lipolysis [^114sVthy]. Cell Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Lactate is among the highest flux circulating metabolites. It is made by glycolysis and cleared by both tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle oxidation and gluconeogenesis. Severe lactate elevations are life-threatening, and modest elevations predict future diabetes. How lactate homeostasis is maintained, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify, in mice, homeostatic circuits regulating lactate production and consumption. Insulin induces lactate production by upregulating glycolysis. We find that hyperlactatemia inhibits insulin-induced glycolysis, thereby suppressing excess lactate production. Unexpectedly, insulin also promotes lactate TCA cycle oxidation. The mechanism involves lowering circulating fatty acids, which compete with lactate for mitochondrial oxidation. Similarly, lactate can promote its own consumption by lowering circulating fatty acids via the adipocyte-expressed G-protein-coupled receptor hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1). Quantitative modeling suggests that these mechanisms suffice to produce lactate homeostasis, with robustness to noise and perturbation of individual regulatory mechanisms. Thus, through regulation of glycolysis and lipolysis, lactate homeostasis is maintained.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^116J8xGV]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

As for the blood levels of any substance, elevated lactate levels can be the result of increased production, reduced elimination, or both. A dynamic evaluation of serial lactate concentrations may thus be more informative than a single value. This concept of repeating blood lactate concentrations over time as an indicator of response to therapy was first proposed in 1983, based on an idea raised after a publication by Orringer et al. in 1977 showing that the decrease in lactate levels after cessation of grand mal seizures was actually quite rapid, with a half-life of about 50% in 1 hr. Many studies have since emphasized that changes in lactate over the first hrs of treatment may represent a valuable monitoring tool. Some studies have even proposed integrating changes in lactate concentrations as a target in therapeutic protocols or including them as one of the sepsis resuscitation "bundles". A number of investigators have used the term "lactate clearance" to describe decreasing lactate levels, but this is incorrect for two reasons. The first is that the changes in lactate concentrations over time reflect changes in production and in elimination. The decrease in lactate over time may reflect decreased (over)production more than increased clearance by the liver and other organs. The specific study of lactate clearance would require intravenous injection of radiolabeled lactate, as has been done in several studies. The second reason why use of the term is incorrect is that "clearance" or "elimination" implies a progressive normalization of blood lactate concentrations, which is too simplistic. Blood lactate concentrations can have a complex evolution and may even increase over time (Fig. 1), a situation that one should then call "negative lactate clearance".

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

### Lactate as a marker of energy failure in critically ill patients: hypothesis [^115R91tp]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lactate measurement in the critically ill has been traditionally used to stratify patients with poor outcome. However, plasma lactate levels are the result of a finely tuned interplay of factors that affect the balance between its production and its clearance. When the oxygen supply does not match its consumption, organisms such as man who are forced to produce ATP for their integrity adapt in many different ways up to the point when energy failure occurs. Lactate, being part of the adaptive response, may then be used to assess the severity of the supply/demand imbalance. In such a scenario, the time to intervention becomes relevant: early and effective treatment may allow the cell to revert to a normal state, as long as the oxygen machinery (i.e. mitochondria) is intact. Conversely, once the mitochondria are deranged, energy failure occurs even in the presence of normoxia. The lactate increase in critically ill patients may therefore be viewed as an early marker of a potentially reversible state.

### The riddle of hyperlactatemia [^116vGzPp]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

A recent observational study in a large cohort of critically ill patients confirms the association between hyperlactatemia and mortality. The mechanisms regulating the rates of lactate production and clearance in critical illness remain poorly understood. During exercise, hyperlactatemia clearly results from an imbalance between oxygen delivery and energy requirements. In critically ill patients, the genesis of hyperlactatemia is significantly more complex. Possible mechanisms include regional hypoperfusion, an inflammation-induced upregulation of the glycolitic flux, alterations in lactate-clearing mechanisms, and increases in the work of breathing. Understanding how these complex processes interact to produce elevations in lactate continues to be an important area of research.

### ATZUMI-dihydroergotamine mesylate powder… [^111TqjB2]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

In animal reproduction studies, adverse effects on development were observed following intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate during pregnancy in rats and rabbits or during pregnancy and lactation in rats at doses that were not associated with maternal toxicity. Clinical Considerations Data Animal Data Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to pregnant rats throughout the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and/or skeletal ossification at doses of 0. 16 mg/day and greater. A no-effect level for adverse effects on embryofetal development was not identified in rats. Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in decreased skeletal ossification at 3. 6 mg/day.

The no-effect dose for adverse effects on embryofetal development in rabbits was 1. 2 mg/day. Intranasal administration of dihydroergotamine mesylate to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased body weight and impaired reproductive function in the offspring at doses of 0. 16 mg/day or greater. A no-effect dose for adverse effects on pre- and postnatal development in rats was not established. Effects on offspring development occurred at doses below those that produced evidence of significant maternal toxicity in these studies. Dihydroergotamine-induced intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to reduced uteroplacental blood flow resulting from prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and/or increased myometrial tone.
8. 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of dihydroergotamine in human milk; however, ergotamine, a related drug, is present in human milk.

There are reports of diarrhea, vomiting, weak pulse, and unstable blood pressure in breastfed infants exposed to ergotamine. ATZUMI may reduce milk supply because it may decrease prolactin levels. 11 DESCRIPTION ATZUMI contains dihydroergotamine, an ergotamine derivative, as the mesylate salt. Dihydroergotamine mesylate is a white or almost white crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water and chloroform and sparingly soluble in methanol.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^11136oJx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate levels: production versus clearance

In clinical practice the change in lactate levels over time is thought to primarily reflect a change in production. As increased levels are generally associated with circulatory dysfunction, we often see a decrease in lactate levels as associated with an improvement in circulatory status and hypothesize (but cannot prove) decreased production. However, as true clearance in both stable septic patients and septic shock animals is significantly decreased in shock states, ongoing hyperlactatemia or even a rise in lactate levels may reflect decreased clearance rather than an increase in production of lactate. This is typically seen in the presence of shock with associated ischemic hepatitis. In addition, the complex inter- and intracellular metabolism of lactate makes our understanding of lactate physiology in shock extremely limited (see Sect. " Lactate as a substrate ").

### Occurrence and adverse effect on outcome of hyperlactatemia in the critically ill [^115xV97V]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we demonstrate that hyperlactatemia is common and associated with adverse outcome. Inclusion of hyperlactatemia adds to the prediction ability of the existing APACHE II score. Moreover, we defined and compared the admission and de novo development of hyperlactatemia directly between different patient groups, showing that diagnostic class and absolute level of lactate elevation are important parameters. Our data suggests that there is predictive merit in routine measurement of lactate at presentation to the ICU. These findings may be useful to administrators and may allow for more accurate adjustment of mortality risk for benchmarking purposes. Similarly, clinicians can use elevated lactate levels to identify patients for potentially targeted monitoring and intervention.

### Unlocking the metabolic and anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential of lactate in critically ill patients [^111LuCR2]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Current evidence calls for a reappraisal of lactates role in critical care — not merely as a biomarker, but as a potential therapeutic agent. Its metabolic, anti-inflammatory, and signaling properties offer promising avenues for organ support in critically ill patients. Importantly, clinical studies using hypertonic sodium lactate have consistently reported good safety profiles, despite transient elevations in pH, plasma osmolality, or serum sodium levels. This supports the tolerability of lactate-based therapies in diverse patient populations. A paradigm shift is therefore warranted: future research should move beyond lactate clearance to explore its targeted administration as an adjunct or alternative treatment strategy. Priority must be given to large-scale randomized trials and mechanistic studies to determine optimal dosing, timing, and patient selection. Harnessing lactate's full therapeutic potential may significantly broaden the current armamentarium in intensive care medicine.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

Serum lactate for suspected sepsis — The lactate cutoffs determining an elevated level ranged from 1.6–2.5 mmol/L, with sensitivities ranging from 66–83% and specificities ranging from 80–85%; pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios from the three studies are 4.75 and 0.29, respectively. Lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule-in or rule-out the diagnosis on its own, and we issued a weak recommendation favoring the use of serum lactate as an adjunctive test to modify the pretest probability of sepsis in patients with suspected but not confirmed sepsis.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^111suThw]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Since the early studies by Weil and others, blood lactate concentrations have been used widely as a marker of altered tissue perfusion in critically ill patients. In physiological conditions, about 1500 mmol of lactate is produced daily from various organs, including the muscle, the intestine, the red blood cells, the brain, and the skin. Lactate is metabolized by the liver (about 60%), the kidneys (about 30%), and other organs. The normal blood lactate concentration is around 1 mEq/l. Even minor increases in lactate concentrations to > 1.5 mEq/l are associated with higher mortality rates. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of hyperlactatemia have been much debated, because the condition does not always simply reflect the development of anaerobic metabolism. In sepsis in particular, metabolic alterations can contribute to elevated blood lactate concentrations, including increased glycolysis, catecholamine-stimulated Na–K pump activity, alterations in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and reduced lactate clearance primarily as a result of liver hypoperfusion. Regardless of these mechanisms, hyperlactatemia is a hallmark characteristic of shock states and the degree of increase in lactate concentrations is directly related to the severity of the shock state and to mortality rates.

### Perioperative cardiovascular monitoring of high-risk patients: a consensus of 12 [^114qWsXF]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Blood lactate concentrations

Lactate is a physiological substrate (carbohydrate) produced from pyruvate reduction during cytosolic glycolysis. In stable conditions, lactate production and elimination are equivalent (that is, 1,200 to 1,500 mmol per day), leading to a stable blood lactate concentration of 0.8 to 1.2 mmol/L. The net flux of lactate depends on the difference between release and uptake and varies among organs and with their energetic conditions. Hyperlactatemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Persistent hyperlactatemia is a more relevant indicator of poor outcome than an isolated elevated lactate value is. Hyperlactatemia is not always a consequence of tissue hypoxia; sometimes, it stems from an accelerated 'aerobic' glycolysis resulting from cytokine influence and catecholamine stimulation, a situation termed 'stress hyperlactatemia'. In practice, irrespective of the different metabolic modifications, an elevated lactate level indicates the presence of shock, and a decrease in lactate levels over time is a good indicator of effective treatment. Accordingly, repeated blood lactate measurements are recommended to monitor lactate production and clearance over time during surgery in high-risk patients.

### The ten pitfalls of lactate clearance in sepsis [^11173gbC]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lactate as a goal of what?

The complexity of lactate as a molecule, substrate, biomarker, energy source, component of some intravenous fluids, and major modulator of cellular bioenergetics during physiological stress is formidable. Such complexity makes it impossible to define what goal it should be a marker or target of. Seeking to lower lactate levels (by whatever means given the multiple events that regulate its blood levels) has no credibility and no logic in terms of hemodynamics, bioenergetics, or tissue protection. In fact, it could make more biological sense to assist the natural process of lactate utilization and generation during sepsis or during other physiological stress situations by administering lactate. Until we are able to define the goals that we wish to achieve by manipulating lactate and have the means of measuring whether we have achieved such goals or not, the idea of seeking to lower lactate by increasing its "clearance" in sepsis is both an illusion and a folly.

### Type A versus type B lactic acidosis in the context of undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma [^113F3PGr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis, characterised by an imbalance between lactate production and clearance, is classified into type A and type B. Type A is associated with tissue hypoxia and shock, while type B occurs without hypoxia, often due to metabolic disturbances, such as cancer-related metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect. This case series presents two patients with undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma who exhibited distinct forms of lactic acidosis. The first patient, with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, developed type A lactic acidosis, with escalating lactate levels despite aggressive resuscitation. The second patient, with stable haemodynamics but persistently elevated lactate, exhibited type B lactic acidosis, likely due to the Warburg effect of lymphoma. These cases underscore the importance of differentiating between type A and type B lactic acidosis, as the underlying aetiology guides treatment strategies. Early recognition of the cause is crucial for optimal management and patient outcomes, particularly in malignancy-associated metabolic disturbances.

After 5 days of nausea and vomiting, a man in his 60s with advanced, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving the abdomen presented to the emergency department. The patient noted chronic, left-sided abdominal pain related to his lymphoma and normal passage of stool and flatus. He reported no other illnesses and was taking only esomeprazole. He was afebrile and normotensive with a pulse rate of 104/minute. A large, firm, tender mass located near the umbilicus was palpable in his abdomen, but there was no rigidity or rebound tenderness. Laboratory studies showed an elevated lactate level of 6. 3 mmol/L. Chen M, Kim TY, Pessegueiro AM. Elevated Lactate Levels in a Non–Critically Ill Patient. JAMA. 2015; 313: 849–850.

### Early lactate measurement is associated with better outcomes in septic patients with an elevated serum lactate level [^113wRcTb]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, early lactate measurement (within 1 h after ICU admission) in septic patients with elevated serum lactate levels (> 2.0 mmol/L) is associated with a lower risk-adjusted 28-day mortality. The decrease in time to the administration of vasopressors may have mediated this effect. Repeating the measurement within 3 h after the initial measurement is appropriate for patients whose lactate was measured within 1 h of admission.

### Monitoring of perioperative tissue perfusion and impact on patient outcomes [^111ouMTf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The influence of metabolism and tissue perfusion on patient outcomes

Lactic acid is primarily produced in muscles, intestines, red blood cells, brain, and skin, and is metabolized by the liver and kidneys. As a metabolic marker, lactic acid, along with pH value, is widely used to reflect tissue hypoperfusion, particularly in critically ill patients. In septic shock, elevated lactate levels are closely linked to disease severity and mortality. Treatment strategies targeting lactate reduction have been shown to lower mortality rates in septic shock, cardiac surgery, and other shock states. This highlights the critical relationship between lactate levels, organ perfusion, and metabolism, and their impact on patient prognosis.

Compared with central venous oxygen saturation, lactate is a more specific indicator of anaerobic metabolism and tissue perfusion, as it is not affected by perfusion shunts or disorders in tissue oxygen utilization (Fig. 5). Lactate-directed early recovery strategies have significantly improved survival rates in sepsis patients.

Fig. 5
Lactic acid can better reflect the abnormal perfusion of tissue, compared with the central venous oxygen saturation

It is important to differentiate between the two main types of lactate acidosis: Type A lactate acidosis results from tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia, as seen in septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or severe trauma. Type B lactate acidosis is caused by metabolic dysfunction without hypoperfusion, as seen in liver failure, certain medications, or malignancies. This review primarily refers to type A lactate acidosis, which is directly related to tissue hypoperfusion and systemic outcomes. Understanding this distinction is critical for guiding appropriate treatment strategies.

Additionally, elevated lactate levels during the disease course can often be reduced with timely intervention. Recent studies have also demonstrated that dynamic changes in lactate levels over time provide a better indication of patient outcomes than a single measurement.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^114jA46a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^1148a65u]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

For the purposes of assessing sepsis at presentation, they recommend that the baseline SOFA score is zero unless a patient has known pre-existing organ dysfunction before the onset of current infection. They used the SOFA score as an indicator of organ dysfunction because it is familiar to most clinicians and because a change in SOFA score is more predictive of in-hospital mortality from sepsis than the presence of SIRS criteria. Patients with an increase of 2 or more in the SOFA score have an estimated in hospital mortality of 10% due to sepsis and a 2-fold to 25-fold increased risk of death compared with patients with a SOFA score of < 2. As a result, the task force recommended that patients with sepsis meeting this definition be observed in a location with a 'greater level of monitoring' than a routine inpatient floor environment.

Septic shock

Septic shock has been defined in a variety of ways depending on the clinical variables chosen to characterize its associated organ dysfunction and hypotension. The 2012 taskforce definition of septic shock is 'sepsis-induced hypotension' that persists despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion is defined as hypotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 70 mm Hg, or SBP decrease > 40 mm Hg or less than 2 SD below normal for age in the absence of other causes), elevated lactate (> 1 mmol/L) or oliguria (urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 2 hours despite fluid resuscitation) secondary to infection. In developing the 2016 guidelines, the taskforce emphasized cellular and metabolic dysfunction as critical factors that differentiate septic shock from sepsis. They explored a number of thresholds and criteria through an iterative Delphi process and came to the following definition of septic shock: 'sepsis with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg and having a serum lactate > 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation'. Both hypotension and elevated lactate were included because the presence of both variables results in higher risk-adjusted mortality than with either variable alone.

### The science and translation of lactate shuttle theory [^112i4Pxz]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Once thought to be a waste product of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now known to form continuously under aerobic conditions. Shuttling between producer and consumer cells fulfills at least three purposes for lactate: (1) a major energy source, (2) the major gluconeogenic precursor, and (3) a signaling molecule. "Lactate shuttle" (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a "strain" and not a "stress" biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine. The above, as well as historic and recent studies of lactate metabolism and shuttling, are discussed in the following review.

### The role of lactate metabolism in heart failure and cardiogenic shock: clinical insights and therapeutic implications [^114NYAFK]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis, especially when it progresses to cardiogenic shock (CS), where survival rates substantially decline. A key area of interest is the role of blood lactate as a biomarker in these conditions. Lactate is produced under normal physiological conditions but increases with impaired tissue perfusion, a hallmark of HF and CS. Elevated lactate levels result from increased production, reduced clearance or both and are often associated with worse outcomes. Traditionally considered a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, lactate is now recognized as an important energy substrate, particularly in myocardial tissue during periods of metabolic stress. Recent studies suggest that dynamic lactate monitoring, including lactate clearance (LC), may provide critical insights into patients' prognoses and responses to therapy. Serial measurements of lactate have been shown to predict survival in critically ill patients, including those with HF and CS. In CS, elevated lactate levels correlate with increased mortality risk, and LC is emerging as an important parameter in treatment protocols. Despite growing evidence of lactate's clinical relevance, research is needed to establish standardized thresholds and optimal monitoring timelines. Understanding the complexities of lactate metabolism and its role in HF and CS could lead to improved risk stratification and more personalized treatment approaches.

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^112erc92]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Severe sepsis and septic shock are a major health problem worldwide and among critically ill patients in particular. Beyond the identification of the likely focus of infection and of the organisms responsible, treatment with appropriate antibiotics, and drainage of the focus itself when possible, early and aggressive hemodynamic resuscitation is recommended for the treatment of septic patients. The identification of severe sepsis is based on clinical signs but also on laboratory findings. Among these, sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia (SAHL) has been recently promoted as a way of identifying patients with 'cryptic' shock who require focused, early goal-directed therapy.

In fact, SAHL is a common finding, reaching levels as high as 15.0 mmol/L in some patients. Plasma lactate levels and their trend over time are reliable markers of illness severity and mortality, being recently included in a multibiomarker-based outcome risk model for adult patients with septic shock. Even relative hyperlactatemia (blood lactate concentrations > 0.75 mmol/L) is independently associated with increased hospital mortality.

Raised blood lactate concentrations in the setting of sepsis are frequently viewed as evidence of tissue hypoxia and/or oxygen debt secondary to hypoperfusion. According to such paradigms, SAHL is due to anaerobic glycolysis induced by tissue hypoxia. Such tissue hypoxia in widely believed to be a major cause of organ failure and mortality. Moreover, changes in lactate concentration over time during intervention (for example, incorrectly labeled lactate 'clearance') have been proposed as end points in sepsis resuscitation, as means of determining the adequacy of oxygen delivery, and as indicators of resolution of global tissue hypoxia.

Despite such strongly and widely held views, the source, biochemistry, removal and metabolic functions of lactate in sepsis remain unclear. It is also uncertain whether SAHL represents a maladaptive or protective response. The sheer complexity of lactate, a ubiquitously produced and utilized metabolite that, like glucose, is central to almost every energy-related pathway in humans, is one of the main reasons for the lack of a clear understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical meaning.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^117XLtej]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Schematic showing some of the possible evolutions of blood lactate levels over time: decreasing (1), remaining stable (2), or increasing (3). Dashed lines represent an unfavorable course and suggest the need for treatment to be reviewed, if this has not already been done, because the current management is likely ineffective

We performed a literature search on this subject to address several questions. First, is the observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations a consistent finding in all types of critically ill patient? Second, although some studies have suggested that repeated lactate measurements may be particularly useful in sepsis, can similar observations be made in other acute disease states or even in heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients? Third, how fast should lactate concentrations decrease in optimal conditions and is there any particular time interval that could be recommended? Fourth, some studies in emergency medicine considered only patients with lactate values > 4 mEq/l as an at-risk population, but is this approach valid? In other words, is the study of lactate kinetics more useful when lactate concentrations exceed a given value?

### Lactic acidosis, metformin use, and dose-response association… [^1115rWWr]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor Lazarus and collegues, 1 both in the title and in the introduction of their article published in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, used the term lactic acidosis, which endorses the concept that lactic acidosis is a state of acidosis determined by an elevated plasma lactate concentration. This term, based on the old lactate paradigm, 2 does not consider that, since the 1980s, this paradigm has radically shifted, and lactate is not considered responsible for acidosis. The same lactic acidosis is deemed a misnomer and should be replaced by the term lactate anion acidosis. 3 Indeed, the intermediate acids — another misleading definition4 — of glycolysis have a low pKa; therefore, at body pH levels, they all exist in their base form, and in their production process, no molecules are ever in an acid form and do not function as sources of protons.

The acidosis associated with hypoxia is induced by the increased H+ production from the cytosolic adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. As a matter of fact, the production of lactate also consumes 2 protons and, by definition, retards acidosis. Although blood lactate accumulation is a good proxy of increased proton release, and the potential for decreased cellular and blood pH, such relationships should not be interpreted as cause and effect, but rather "guilt by association". 5 More explicitly, high levels of lactate are only a marker for the acidosis. As physiologist Robert A. Robergs put it, "The lactic acidosis explanation of metabolic acidosis is not supported by fundamental biochemistry, has no research base of support, and remains a negative trait of all clinical, basic, and applied science fields and professions that still accept this construct.

### Risk stratification of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated with sepsis using lactate trajectories [^115sStLZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated lactate levels are common in the setting of sepsis and usually represent an imbalance between increased production in the presence or absence of tissue hypoxia and changes in clearance. Given their well-established association with multiple organ dysfunction, blood lactate levels and their trend over time are increasingly recognized as reliable markers of illness severity and mortality. Border and Weil et al. observed that lactate levels ≥ 4 mmol/L were associated with a 50% mortality in patients with shock during a study period of 36 h. An increasing body of evidence suggests that lactate measurements represent a valuable and straightforward indicator for the early identification of severe sepsis and are associated with poor outcomes. Interestingly, current evidence suggests that compared with initial lactate levels at presentation or other single measured lactate values, serial blood lactate level measurements can better characterize the dynamic process of lactate production and elimination in vivo. Serial lactate levels can also help define the patient's trajectory and encourage a review of the therapeutic strategy. Over the years, the prognostic value of serial measurements of multiple types of lactate levels or calculations from lactate levels has been investigated, for example, the duration of hyperlactatemia, the area under the curve of serial lactate measurement (lactate AUC), and lactate clearance. Importantly, decreased lactate levels were associated with improved outcomes in almost all critically ill patients. Moreover, the later the lactate level is reduced, the worse the clinical prognosis is.

### Can elevated lactate and LDH produce a false positive enzymatic ethanol result in live patients presenting to the emergency department? [^117LmT3B]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There have been allegations in the courtroom that elevated serum lactic acid in trauma victims can yield a falsely elevated serum ethanol assay. Most hospitals utilize an indirect method of ethanol measurement where a serum sample is added to a mix of alcohol dehydrogenase and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This allows any ethanol in the patient's serum to be metabolized to acetaldehyde, and in the process results in the reduction of NAD+to NADH. NADH is then measured using spectrophotometry. The courtroom allegation stems from the concept that oxidation of lactate to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) results in the same molar-for-molar reduction of NAD+to NADH, and could therefore theoretically cause patients with elevated lactate and LDH to have a falsely elevated ethanol concentration.

Methods

Patients with elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations who presented to a university hospital from 20 April 2015 to 13 December 2015 were identified to provide possible test specimens. If a sufficient amount of serum was available, the sample was used to re-run the lactate and LDH concentration simultaneously with an enzymatic ethanol assay. Any samples that had elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations on this retesting, and also yielded a positive ethanol concentration, were sent for confirmatory gas chromatography testing of ethanol concentrations. A control group of 20 samples with normal lactate and LDH were included.

Results

A total of 37 samples were included in the final analysis. Only 4 patients had an elevated enzymatic ethanol concentration, and all 4 also had a measurable GC ethanol concentration. The lactate in this dataset ranged from 2.4 to 24.2mmol/L, with a mean of 6.53mmol/L (normal value 0.5–2.2). The LDH ranged from 242 to 8838U/L with a mean of 1695U/L (normal value 122-225U/L). Twenty control samples were run on patients with normal lactate and LDH, none of which yielded a positive enzymatic ethanol result.

Conclusions

This data does not support the contention that an elevated LDH and lactate can yield a false positive serum ethanol result as run by enzymatic ethanol assay in live patients presenting to the emergency department.

### Mildly elevated lactate levels are associated with microcirculatory flow abnormalities and increased mortality: a microSOAP post hoc analysis [^114HWsoW]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

An elevated lactate level, classically defined as an arterial lactate level > 2 mmol/L, is a well-known predictor of adverse outcome in terms of organ dysfunction and mortality in different subgroups of critically ill patients. Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines consider a threshold of 1 mmol/L as an indicator of tissue hypoperfusion, but they suggest resuscitation to normalize arterial lactate levels in patients with lactate levels > 4 mmol/L in order to improve outcome, based on the principles of early goal-directed therapy. Similarly, in nonseptic patients, the value of lactate levels in goal-directed resuscitation, as well as the additive value of serial lactate measurements, is recognized. Recent studies indicate that small increases in lactate levels are already associated with an unfavorable clinical course. This association has been demonstrated for "relative hyperlactatemia" with thresholds as low as 1.1 mmol/L. Although lactate is easily measured in daily practice, unraveling the underlying causative mechanism is often much more difficult. Organ hypoperfusion is regarded as an important cause of hyperlactatemia, although several other mechanisms also play a significant role, ranging from accelerated aerobic glycolysis to decreased lactate metabolism and mitochondrial and microcirculatory dysfunction. Sublingual direct in vivo microscopy is a suitable method of detecting microcirculatory derangements at the bedside. Several studies have demonstrated an association between lactate levels and microcirculatory alterations in subgroups of critically ill patients as well as in experimental settings. We previously demonstrated that both microcirculatory derangements and arterial lactate levels were independent predictors of mortality in selected high-risk patients.

The aforementioned studies were primarily focused on the early phase of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The significance of minimally elevated lactate levels as well as concomitant microcirculatory dysfunction at a later time point is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the significance of a single-spot arterial lactate measurement and simultaneous in vivo microscopy in a heterogeneous ICU population recruited from 36 ICUs worldwide.

### CSF lactate [^114X51qW]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lactate is produced from anaerobic glycolysis, which occurs in most tissues in the human body. Blood lactate is tested in most physiologically unwell patients in the Emergency Department and helps to guide treatment and prognosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate, however, is not often measured. Various central nervous system (CNS) conditions lead to a rise in CSF lactate, including acute neurological infection, stroke, seizures and mitochondrial pathologies. This article discusses the utility and limitations of CSF lactate, highlighting specific clinical situations where it can help in the diagnosis of CNS infections and unexplained encephalopathy.

### Metabolomics in cardiometabolic diseases: key biomarkers and therapeutic implications for insulin resistance and diabetes [^113vd3H4]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Lactate: from byproduct to key regulator of metabolism and insulin sensitivity

In addition to ketone bodies, lactate has emerged as an important regulator of metabolism. Although traditionally viewed as a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, lactate has emerged as a key metabolic intermediate involved in tissue‐to‐tissue energy exchange, regulation of redox balance, and signaling in various biological processes. This section delves into the mechanisms by which lactate affects glucose utilization and its contribution to the metabolic dysfunction seen in Type 2 diabetes. Lactate's role in insulin secretion and lipolysis inhibition through receptor activation is also highlighted, suggesting its complex effects on metabolic health. Elevated circulating lactate levels are considered a risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, potentially signaling early impairments in oxidative metabolism. Individuals with Type 2 diabetes who carry a polymorphism in the lactate transporter gene MCT1 — associated with enhanced lactate transport — display lower fasting plasma glucose compared to those with the wild‐type gene. This suggests that enhanced lactate clearance capacity may contribute to better glucose control.

In insulin‐resistant skeletal muscle, glycolysis and lactate production are markedly increased. Concomitantly, expression of the lactate transporter MCT1 is reduced in the skeletal muscle of individuals with Type 2 diabetes. MCT1 facilitates the transport of lactate from glycolytic fibers to oxidative fibers, where it is oxidized to pyruvate and enters the TCA cycle. Reduced MCT1 expression not only deprives oxidative muscle cells of a key fuel substrate but also contributes to the elevated circulating lactate levels. Lactate production is further elevated during hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamp studies, a condition that mimics the hyperinsulinemia characteristic of early stages of Type 2 diabetes.

Whether elevated lactate directly contributes to insulin resistance remains unclear, but evidence suggests it may play a role. In the liver, lactate is converted to glucose, and excessive blood lactate could exacerbate hyperglycemia in the context of hepatic insulin resistance. Furthermore, "lactate clamp" studies demonstrate that lactate reduces glucose oxidation, and ex vivo experiments indicate that lactate inhibits glycolytic enzyme activity. These observations suggest a feedback loop in which elevated lactate reduces glucose utilization and oxidation, potentially exacerbating metabolic dysfunction.

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^115VDvPz]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

There is overwhelming evidence that sepsis and septic shock are associated with hyperlactatemia (sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia (SAHL)). SAHL is a strong independent predictor of mortality and its presence and progression are widely appreciated by clinicians to define a very high-risk population. Until recently, the dominant paradigm has been that SAHL is a marker of tissue hypoxia. Accordingly, SAHL has been interpreted to indicate the presence of an 'oxygen debt' or 'hypoperfusion', which leads to increased lactate generation via anaerobic glycolysis. In light of such interpretation of the meaning of SAHL, maneuvers to increase oxygen delivery have been proposed as its treatment. Moreover, lactate levels have been proposed as a method to evaluate the adequacy of resuscitation and the nature of the response to the initial treatment for sepsis. However, a large body of evidence has accumulated that strongly challenges such notions. Much evidence now supports the view that SAHL is not due only to tissue hypoxia or anaerobic glycolysis. Experimental and human studies all consistently support the view that SAHL is more logically explained by increased aerobic glycolysis secondary to activation of the stress response (adrenergic stimulation). More importantly, new evidence suggests that SAHL may actually serve to facilitate bioenergetic efficiency through an increase in lactate oxidation. In this sense, the characteristics of lactate production best fit the notion of an adaptive survival response that grows in intensity as disease severity increases. Clinicians need to be aware of these developments in our understanding of SAHL in order to approach patient management according to biological principles and to interpret lactate concentrations during sepsis resuscitation according to current best knowledge.

### Occurrence and adverse effect on outcome of hyperlactatemia in the critically ill [^113nNuGX]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevations of blood lactate are common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and have been associated with adverse outcomes. Early studies suggested that venous lactate levels on admission to medical ICUs in patients with shock were associated with mortality rates of greater than 30% with associated correlation with the absolute lactate concentration. More recently, both the presence of hyperlactatemia on admission and subsequent development of hyperlactatemia have been reported to be associated with greater mortality in surgical ICU patients. Also, the rapid rate of clearance of lactate and earlier time to resolution of hyperlactatemia have been associated with increased survival probability.

Although it is recognized that hyperlactatemia is a common occurrence in critically ill patients and is associated with increased mortality, and that the resolution of hyperlactatemia is associated with increased survival, previous studies have focused on relatively small cohorts of selected critically ill populations. As a result, the occurrence, determinants, and effect on outcome of hyperlactatemia in critically ill populations at large have not been well defined. The objective of the present study was to assess the incidence of hyperlactatemia and the factors associated with it in a large population of critically ill adult medical and surgical patients, and assess the effect of hyperlactatemia on mortality.

### Blood lactate in mild and moderate ARDS secondary to SARS COV 2 [^117XVQWz]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Elevated blood lactate levels are associated with poor outcome in several critical conditions. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 rarely develop hyperlactatemia. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the trend of lactatemia in patients affected by mild/moderate SARS-Co V-2-ARDS and if it affected prognosis.

Methods

We analyzed blood lactate levels in thirty-eight patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to COVID Care Unit of Santa Maria delle Grazie Hospital, Pozzuoli.

Results

Twenty patients survived and were discharged at home and 18 patients died. Despite severe hypoxia that affected all patients enrolled, T0 lactate was within normal values. All survivors showed a significant increase in lactate concentration the day prior to clinical improvement. In not-survivors levels of lactate did not increase significantly.

Conclusion

In our study, patients who survive SARS CoV-2 ARDS have a fleeting increase in lactate, which precedes clinical improvement by one day.

### The role of lactate clearance in the resuscitation bundle [^1169W9Y1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The sepsis resuscitation bundle is the result of an effort on behalf of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to translate individual guideline recommendations into standardized, achievable goals for physicians caring for the critically ill patient. Implementation of this bundle is associated with decreased mortality. Many of the bundle items reflect components of therapy shown to improve mortality in the seminal early goal-directed therapy trial for severe sepsis and septic shock, including an initial lactate measurement. Elevations in serum lactate are associated with increased mortality, and may result from either increased lactate production or impaired lactate clearance. Lactate clearance may be an important addition to the monitoring and management bundles of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, However, specific mechanisms of lactate clearance, the relation of lactate clearance to traditional hemodynamic parameters, and the importance of lactate clearance as a therapeutic target or monitoring tool remain unclear.

### Initially elevated arterial lactate as an independent predictor of poor outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis [^115e8dXH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

We chose the arterial lactate level as a potential marker of poor prognosis in SAP for several reasons. First, lactate is a routine laboratory marker that can both reflect the degree of tissue hypoxia and the changes in intravascular volume status. Second, as a laboratory test, a lactate measurement can be accomplished quickly with the advantages of low cost and high reproducibility. Third, as we mentioned above, in many studies, high lactate concentration portended a bad outcome in cases of critical illness, including septic shock, severe sepsis, organ failure, trauma, AP and other disease. All of those observations suggest that initially elevated arterial lactate levels may be a simple marker to risk-stratify patients with SAP in the early stages of the disease.

An important finding in our study supports the conjecture that an initially elevated arterial lactate level portends a bad outcome in SAP (Tables 2, 3). There are several possible explanations for this outcome. First, it is well known that an important reason for the worsening of AP is that insufficient blood volume, due to various causes, increases hypoperfusion of the pancreas and other vital organs, leading to pancreatic necrosis and organ dysfunction. We believe that the admission arterial lactate level may reflect the underlying state of intravascular volume scarcity and vital organ perfusion (including kidney, gut, liver and even heart). Conversely, the damage to major organ functions further increases the level of arterial lactate through impaired lactate clearance and excessive production. Second, lactate has been regarded as a marker of tissue hypoxia in critically ill patients. The main function of the lung is to supply oxygen to tissues. Thus, lactate is likely to represent the degree of pulmonary failure. Persistent pulmonary failure is usually the direct cause of death in SAP. Third, lactate is also considered an early biomarker of the response to inflammatory mediators. Lactic acid may indicate the extent of the inflammatory response in SAP. Mofidi R et al. found that persistent SIRS is associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death in patients with acute pancreatitis and is an early indicator of the likely severity of acute pancreatitis. Fourth, patients with SAP have high energy metabolism, which may be achieved by increasing aerobic glycolysis. If the amount of pyruvic acid produced by aerobic glycolysis exceeds the metabolic capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, it will lead to the accumulation of lactate. Levy et al. revealed that elevated lactate may be associated with increasing Na + K + ATPase activity in septic shock patients. Therefore, lactate may also reflect the state of energy metabolism in SAP. Regardless of the specific mechanism involved, our research clearly showed that patients with elevated arterial lactate levels with early-stage SAP have an increased risk of mortality and of both mild and serious complications.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^115nsZBf]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Blood lactate — use of trends to guide resuscitation: We suggest using trends in blood lactate levels, in addition to clinical assessment, to guide resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In children with an elevated blood lactate, repeat testing that reveals a persistent elevation in blood lactate may indicate incomplete hemodynamic resuscitation and should prompt efforts to further promote hemodynamic stability. Pediatric evidence includes one observational study of lactate-guided resuscitation that included 77 children with sepsis in the ED, in which lactate normalization was associated with a decreased risk of persistent organ dysfunction (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73 and adjusted RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29–0.78); indirect adult evidence includes six RCTs with a total of 1,007 patients evaluating lactate-guided resuscitation of patients with septic shock.

### Consideration of alternative causes of lactic acidosis: thiamine deficiency in malignancy [^112nzUo8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common metabolic acidosis characterized by increased serum lactate and is usually associated with a decreased blood pH. Lactic acidosis has many different causes but has been differentiated into type A, hypoxic causes, and type B, non-hypoxic causes. Tissue hypoxia, type A, is the most common cause, usually secondary to processes such as sepsis and multi-organ failure. Type A must be differentiated from type B in the correct clinical setting as treatments are vastly different. Type B causes may include drug side-effects, toxins, enzymatic defects, inherited or acquired, any of which may lead to overproduction or underutilization of lactate. However, as most clinicians are more familiar, and likely more initially concerned with hypoxic etiologies, evaluation is directed toward finding the source of hypoperfusion or hypoxia, and thus generally leading to a delay in discovering a type B cause (or mixed type A and type B). Here we describe a case of lactic acidosis in the setting of thiamine deficiency thought to be secondary to advanced lung cancer. The purpose of this paper is to bring awareness to the clinician to consider other causes of lactic acidosis when evaluating a patient.

### Mildly elevated lactate levels are associated with microcirculatory flow abnormalities and increased mortality: a microSOAP post hoc analysis [^114Xq1Le]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Several mechanisms may be involved in the increase of lactate levels. One of these, microcirculatory flow abnormalities, was indeed associated with mildly elevated lactate levels in the present study. PVD, and therefore effective diffusion distance, did not differ between patients with and without mildly elevated lactate levels. Therefore, impaired convective oxygen transport, but not diffusion distance, might have contributed to anaerobic glycolysis. Several researchers have also observed an association between impairment of microvascular flow and elevations in arterial lactate, whereas others have been able to demonstrate associations between lactate levels and parameters of vessel density in a variety of disease states.

Alternatively, several non-flow-related factors may lead to increased nonanaerobic lactate formation under conditions of stress by promoting conversion of glucose to lactate via pyruvate instead of pyruvate entering the citric acid cycle. Indeed, lactate formation in endotoxemia results predominantly from increased aerobic lactate formation. On top of that, exogenous adrenergic stress resulting from β-adrenergic drugs can also increase aerobic lactate formation.

### Inhaled β-agonist therapy and respiratory muscle fatigue as under-recognised causes of lactic acidosis [^117Nhg3n]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 49-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with significant tachypnoea, fevers, productive cough and increased work of breathing for the previous 4 days. Laboratory data showed elevated lactate of 3.2 mEq/L. Continuous inhaled ipratropium and albuterol nebuliser treatments were administered. Lactate levels increased to 5.5 and 3.9 mEq/L, at 6 and 12 h, respectively. No infectious source was found and the lactic acidosis cleared as the patient improved. The lactic acidosis was determined to be secondary to respiratory muscle fatigue and inhaled β-agonist therapy, two under-recognised causes of lactic acidosis in patients presenting with respiratory distress. Lactic acidosis is commonly used as a clinical marker for sepsis and shock, but in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion and severe hypoxia, alternative aetiologies for elevated levels should be sought to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful medical interventions.

### Identification of human D lactate dehydrogenase deficiency [^113zcg6U]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Phenotypic and biochemical categorization of humans with detrimental variants can provide valuable information on gene function. We illustrate this with the identification of two different homozygous variants resulting in enzymatic loss-of-function in LDHD, encoding lactate dehydrogenase D, in two unrelated patients with elevated D-lactate urinary excretion and plasma concentrations. We establish the role of LDHD by demonstrating that LDHD loss-of-function in zebrafish results in increased concentrations of D-lactate. D-lactate levels are rescued by wildtype LDHD but not by patients' variant LDHD, confirming these variants' loss-of-function effect. This work provides the first in vivo evidence that LDHD is responsible for human D-lactate metabolism. This broadens the differential diagnosis of D-lactic acidosis, an increasingly recognized complication of short bowel syndrome with unpredictable onset and severity. With the expanding incidence of intestinal resection for disease or obesity, the elucidation of this metabolic pathway may have relevance for those patients with D-lactic acidosis.

### Relative hyperlactatemia and hospital mortality in critically ill patients: a retrospective multi-centre study [^113Ho28h]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Blood lactate concentration is increasingly being measured in the critically ill.

- Higher intensive care unit blood lactate concentrations above the current normal range (absolute hyperlactatemia) are associated with increased hospital mortality.

- Higher intensive care unit admission blood lactate concentrations within the current normal range (relative hyperlactatemia) are associated with increased hospital mortality.

- Higher time weighted intensive care unit blood lactate concentrations within the current normal range (relative hyperlactatemia) are associated with increased hospital mortality.

- Higher blood lactate concentrations within the current normal range can be used to identify patients at high risk of death; possibly suggesting that we need to revise the current definition of normal blood lactate concentration in the critically ill.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^1151hYvf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and elevated lactate levels, prompting a comprehensive differential diagnosis to determine the underlying cause of lactic acidosis. Sepsis was initially suspected due to elevated lactate, but negative blood and urine cultures, normal inflammatory markers and haemodynamic stability ruled it out. Acute heart failure exacerbation was considered given the history of congestive heart failure, but the absence of pulmonary oedema, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea reduced this likelihood. Pulmonary embolism was another concern due to the patient's atrial fibrillation history; however, a CT angiogram was negative. COPD exacerbation-induced hypoxia was evaluated, but oxygen saturation improved with supplemental oxygen, mitigating severe tissue hypoxia as the primary cause. Metabolic disorders and drug toxicity were excluded based on normal metabolic panels and the absence of evidence for overdose. Ultimately, the elevated lactate was linked to frequent albuterol administration.

Treatment

The patient was diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation and initially received an hour-long nebulised albuterol treatment in the emergency department, along with intravenous fluid boluses and broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. Upon hospital admission, he was treated with intravenous steroids, supplemental oxygen and scheduled albuterol/ipratropium treatments. After excluding common causes of lactic acidosis, albuterol-induced lactic acidosis was diagnosed. The frequency of albuterol nebuliser treatments was reduced from every 4 to 8 hours. Over the next 48 hours, his lactate level decreased to 2.1 mmol/L (figure 3).

### Mildly elevated lactate levels are associated with microcirculatory flow abnormalities and increased mortality: a microSOAP post hoc analysis [^1178L3xD]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Mildly elevated lactate levels (i.e., 1–2 mmol/L) are increasingly recognized as a prognostic finding in critically ill patients. One of several possible underlying mechanisms, microcirculatory dysfunction, can be assessed at the bedside using sublingual direct in vivo microscopy. We aimed to evaluate the association between relative hyperlactatemia, microcirculatory flow, and outcome.

Methods

This study was a predefined subanalysis of a multicenter international point prevalence study on microcirculatory flow abnormalities, the Microcirculatory Shock Occurrence in Acutely ill Patients (microSOAP). Microcirculatory flow abnormalities were assessed with sidestream dark-field imaging. Abnormal microcirculatory flow was defined as a microvascular flow index (MFI) < 2.6. MFI is a semiquantitative score ranging from 0 (no flow) to 3 (continuous flow). Associations between microcirculatory flow abnormalities, single-spot lactate measurements, and outcome were analyzed.

Results

In 338 of 501 patients, lactate levels were available. For this substudy, all 257 patients with lactate levels ≤ 2 mmol/L (median [IQR] 1.04 [0.80–1.40] mmol/L) were included. Crude ICU mortality increased with each lactate quartile. In a multivariable analysis, a lactate level > 1.5 mmol/L was independently associated with a MFI < 2.6 (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.7, P = 0.027).

Conclusions

In a heterogeneous ICU population, a single-spot mildly elevated lactate level (even within the reference range) was independently associated with increased mortality and microvascular flow abnormalities. In vivo microscopy of the microcirculation may be helpful in discriminating between flow- and non-flow-related causes of mildly elevated lactate levels.

### Elevated intraoperative serum lactate during craniotomy is associated with new neurological deficit and longer length of stay [^111wSkUy]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hundreds of thousands of craniotomies are performed annually in the United States. During craniotomy, elevated serum lactate is a concerning and not infrequent occurrence. Elevated intraoperative serum lactate may occur as a result of global hypoperfusion or localized intracerebral ischemia from surgical retraction or inadequate blood supply. The distinction between systemic and hypoperfusion confined to the brain is important because the treatment differs. For example, fluid resuscitation may be indicated in the former but not the latter.

Methods

To address whether elevated intraoperative serum lactate is associated with hypoperfusion confined to the brain or systemic hypoperfusion, we performed a retrospective cohort study of elective adult (age above 18) craniotomy cases. These included 436 surgeries which were performed at our institution under general anesthesia between May 2011 and August 2013.

Results

Elevated intraoperative serum lactate in craniotomy patients is associated with new neurological deficits (odds ratio, 2.11) and longer length of stay (20% less likely to be discharged on a given day). Elevated lactate was not associated with systemic complications such as myocardial infarction or mortality.

Conclusions

Our findings highlight the importance of conducting a definitive prospective study analyzing the clinical impact and mechanism behind hyperlactatemia in the craniotomy population. Knowledge of the serum lactate level may be of value in guiding intraoperative anesthetic and surgical decision-making.

### Longitudinal monitoring of lactate in hospitalized and ambulatory COVID-19 patients [^11665Lbs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Lactate levels associated with COVID-19 clinical phenotype (hospitalized patients vs. outpatients). The nonparametric Friedman test was used to detect differences in the analysis of variance with repeated measurements. Figures were created using ggplot2 package version 3.2.1 supported on R program software version 3.5.0.

Lactate levels in our hospitalized patients were moderately elevated compared with pneumonia caused by non–SARS-CoV-2 infections, where more severe disease (CURB-65 ≥ 4) had a median lactate level of around 4 mmol/L. In severe systemic infections such as malaria, admission lactate levels are also elevated with cutoffs > 5 mmol/L associated with severe disease and fatal outcomes, particularly if sustained for hours. The time course of decreases in lactate levels in COVID-19 reflects a longer course of illness. In some patients, the lactate level increased at D28, perhaps reflecting increased activity when diffusion defects in lungs may not have recovered fully. Elevations in lactate levels reflect different pathophysiological processes with decreased oxygen diffusion in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, perhaps with adequate tissue oxygenation being maintained in many patients until the disease progresses in severity ("silent hypoxia"), whereas in malaria, tissue hypoxia caused by microvascular obstruction increases lactate production in the host tissues.

A total of 10% of hospitalized patients could only be recruited, as many of the hospitalized patients do not fulfill the inclusion criteria, that includes denial of informed written consent. This is acknowledged as a major limitation in this study. Although age and concurrent comorbidities of COVID-19 patients largely determine the COVID-19 clinical course, elevated lactate levels equally facilitate the assessment of disease course.

### Too much lactate or too little liver? [^116AHXWd]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a 67-year-old woman with cholangiocarcinoma who was scheduled for cholecystectomy, trisegmentectomy, bile duct resection, and regional lymphadenectomy. Her case was complicated by hyperlactatemia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure. The discussion reviews the possible causes of the hyperlactatemia and reviews measures that could be used to reduce this risk.

### Does intravenous lactated Ringer's solution raise serum lactate? [^116yU1AB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Serum lactate increases in states of severe sepsis and shock, but its interpretation may be subject to confounders. Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) is used in the resuscitation of septic patients and contains 28 mmol/L of sodium lactate.

Objectives

We sought to determine if a bolus of 30 mL/kg of LR increases serum lactate levels.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 30 volunteers were assigned to receive either 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR or normal saline (NS). Serum lactate was measured before and after the fluid bolus. The primary outcome was the difference in the change in lactate between the LR and NS groups. Secondarily, we assessed the change in pH, bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride in each group.

Results

After 30 mL/kg of intravenous LR, the mean serum lactate level increased by 0.93 mmol/L (95% confidence interval 0.42–1.44 mmol/L). However, there was also a small increase in the mean serum lactate level in the NS group of 0.37 mmol/L (95% confidence interval -0.26 mmol/L to 1.00 mmol/L), such that there was not a statistically significant difference in the change in lactate when comparing the LR group to the NS group (p = 0.2). The NS group saw larger declines in pH and bicarbonate and greater increases in chloride compared with the LR group.

Conclusion

In healthy individuals, a modest but significant rise in mean serum lactate was seen after a 30 cc/kg LR bolus. There was no difference in mean serum lactate when comparing a 30 mL/kg bolus of NS to LR.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^116Hhk4f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

When I first started experiencing shortness of breath, I assumed it was just my COPD acting up. I had been using my albuterol inhaler more frequently, thinking it would help, but things only got worse. I ended up in the emergency room, and that's when they noticed my elevated lactate levels. At first, I was really scared, I didn't know what was causing it, and I feared the worst, like sepsis. The doctors ran so many tests, and I'm grateful they finally figured out that it was the albuterol causing the problem. Once they adjusted my treatment, I started feeling better almost immediately. Looking back, I wish I had known that using my inhaler too much could cause something like this. It's been a relief to recover, and now I'm much more careful with my medication. I'm thankful for the care I received and the thoroughness of the doctors in figuring this out.

Learning points

Recognise albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with elevated lactate levels without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection; it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Adjusting the frequency of albuterol administration may effectively resolve the acidosis, preventing unnecessary diagnostic investigations and avoiding the need to discontinue bronchodilator therapy.
Early identification of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis can streamline patient care by avoiding extensive workups and treatments aimed at sepsis or other causes, ensuring more efficient and targeted management.

### Elevated lactate during psychogenic hyperventilation [^113JALFb]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Elevated arterial lactate levels are closely related to morbidity and mortality in various patient categories. In the present retrospective study, the relation between arterial lactate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(2)) and pH was systematically investigated in patients who visited the emergency department (ED) with psychogenic hyperventilation.

Methods

Over a 5-month period, all the patients who visited the ED of a university hospital with presumed psychogenic hyperventilation were evaluated. Psychogenic hyperventilation was presumed to be present when an increased respiratory rate (> 20 min) was documented at or before the ED visit and when somatic causes explaining the hyperventilation were absent. Arterial blood gas and lactate levels (reference values 0.5–1.5 mmol/l) were immediately measured by a point-of-care analyser that was managed and calibrated by the central laboratory.

Results

During the study period, 46 patients were diagnosed as having psychogenic hyperventilation. The median (range) Pco(2) for this group was 4.3 (2.0–5.5) kPa, the pH was 7.47 (7.40–7.68) and the lactate level was 1.2 (0.5–4.4) mmol/l. 14 participants (30%) had a lactate level above the reference value of 1.5 mmol/l. Pco(2) was the most important predictor of lactate in multivariate analysis. None of the participants underwent any medical treatment other than observation at the ED or had been hospitalised after their ED visit.

Conclusions

In patients with psychogenic hyperventilation, lactate levels are frequently elevated. Whereas high lactates are usually associated with acidosis and an increased risk of poor outcome, in patients with psychogenic hyperventilation, high lactates are associated with hypocapnia and alkalosis. In this context, elevated arterial lactate levels should not be regarded as an adverse sign.

### Tissue ischemia microdialysis assessments following severe traumatic haemorrhagic shock: lactate / pyruvate ratio as a new resuscitation end point? [^114RuJqF]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Additionally, fluid administration, which is a core treatment for shock and hypovolemia for preserving effective haemodynamic functions and tissue perfusion, has limits and adverse effects. Excessive fluid amounts lead to diluted coagulation factors, hypothermia and endothelial glycocalyx damage. Hypervolemia and fluid overload also lead to interstitium expansion. These influence the transcapillary gas and substrate exchange and decrease oxygen transport to tissues. Hypovolemia leads to vasoconstriction and microvasculatory blood flow restriction, which cause ischemia due to low oxygen and substrate delivery. Tissue perfusion could be altered with the administration of vasoactive agents, and knowledge of metabolic tissue conditions (i.e. LPR) during haemostatic resuscitation could help guide treatment.

Lactataemia evaluation in shock is typically difficult in practice; elevated arterial lactate levels are associated with increased mortality and morbidity, and lactate normalisation is one of most frequent resuscitation targets. Arterial lactate could be elevated without clinical signs of shock but could also be an indication of on-going ischemia. In contrast, during a shock state, lactate could accumulate in low or non-perfused tissues, and serum levels could be falsely determined to be low. After tissue perfusion is restored, lactate levels increase as a sign of reperfusion, and high lactate levels could be connected with normal aerobic metabolism. The normalisation of lactate values depends on the hepatic clearance of lactate or its consumption in tissues, which could also decrease during shock. It is expected that lactate levels will follow the oxygen debt, but in some clinical conditions, lactate levels may normalise without the resolution of tissue oxygen debt. There are also a number of non-ischemic factors that elevate lactate levels (e.g. stress and catecholamines). Arterial lactate levels should, therefore, be critically evaluated because assessment of the lactate levels alone fails to discriminate between ischemia and aerobiosis.

### Consensus on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring. task force of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^114jCT4Q]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of lactate levels exceeds that of blood pressure. While hyperlactatemia is associated with worse outcome in any type of shock, a correct interpretation also depends on the type of shock, i.e. septic shock versus hemorrhagic shock.

From a metabolic perspective, elevations in blood lactate concentration may be due to increased production, a decreased clearance or a combination of the two. As elevated plasma lactate forms part of the definition of shock, the argument to measure it as a diagnostic marker of shock is circular. Many studies have confirmed the association between initial serum lactate level and mortality independently of clinical signs of organ dysfunction in patients not only with severe sepsis, but also those in cardiogenic shock.

An early decrease in blood lactate levels may indicate the resolution of global tissue hypoxia and has been associated with a decreased mortality rate. Two studies proposed 'lactate-based management' of ICU patients. Jones et al. studied 300 patients, of whom more than 80% had septic shock, who were treated to normalize central venous pressure (CVP) and MAP; additional management to normalize lactate clearance compared with management to normalize ScvO 2 did not result in different rates of hospital mortality. Jansen et al. showed, in patients with hyperlactatemia (> 3.0 mEq/L) on ICU admission, that lactate-guided therapy (with the aim of decreasing lactate by ≥ 20% every 2 h for the initial 8 h) in comparison with no lactate-guided therapy (in which the treatment team had no knowledge of lactate levels other than the admission level) reduced hospital mortality when predefined risk factors were adjusted (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.87; P = 0.006). These authors demonstrated a reduced rate of organ failure — but no reduced mortality — in the lactate group compared with the control group in the early observation period (between 9 and 72 h). Lactate levels between the control and lactate groups were similar over a 3-day period. In clinical practice, we suggest serial measurements of lactates and/or base deficit to evaluate not only the outcome and prognosis but also to guide therapy; lactate measurements can be performed every 2 h in the first 8 h and every 8–12 h thereafter.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111xdtrT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — most patients admitted with heart failure (HF) have clinical evidence of congestion without apparent hypoperfusion, and although right- and left-sided cardiac filling pressures are usually proportional in decompensation of chronic HF with low EF, up to 1 in 4 patients have a mismatch between right- and left-sided filling pressures. Elevated natriuretic peptides can help identify HF in the urgent care setting but with less utility in certain situations, including decreased sensitivity with obesity and HFpEF and decreased specificity in the setting of sepsis. Elevated serum lactate levels may indicate hypoperfusion and impending cardiogenic shock.

### Identification of human D lactate dehydrogenase deficiency [^1143EUTA]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Metabolic analysis reveals elevated D-lactate of two patients. The levels of D-lactate in a urine and b plasma are elevated in our patients compared to controls. Increased levels of D-2-hydroxyisovaleric acid (c, d) and D-2-hydroxyisocaproic acid (e, f) are also observed in urine and plasma, respectively. Separate metabolic measurements for Patient 1 and 2 in urine (n = 3; n = 2) and plasma (n = 1; n = 2) are shown. Mean and standard deviation shown

The unique biochemical phenotype of this patient prompted us to examine new patients for elevated D-lactate concentrations and we identified a second patient with a clinical diagnosis of West syndrome and elevated D-lactate in urine and plasma, as well as increased levels of both D-2-hydroxyacids (Fig. 2). As increased D-lactate excretion is not a known feature of either a 11p13 deletion or West syndrome, we investigated if this perturbation could be due to a different genetic cause, particularly as studies in neurometabolic patient cohorts have reported a high rate (13–14%) of patients with multiple molecular diagnoses.

### The value of blood lactate kinetics in critically ill patients: a systematic review [^117X3sZH]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our systematic literature review has provided the following answers to our initial questions. First, observation of a better prognosis with decreasing lactate concentrations is consistent throughout the literature. Second, these observations are not specific to septic patients, but apply to all common situations of hyperlactatemia and in heterogeneous patient populations. Third, the changes are relatively slow, and it is difficult to provide recommendations about the speed of decrease in lactate concentrations in the best conditions. Clearly repeating measurements every 12 hrs can generally separate those who will do well from those who are likely to die, but shorter time intervals may be helpful. On the basis of our observations, we would recommend checking blood lactate concentrations as often as every 1–2 hrs in acute conditions. Fourth, the study of lactate kinetics appears to be valid regardless of the initial value and not only in patients with severe hyperlactatemia.

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^114ugaki]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill patients with lactate levels within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 m M), we found lactate of 1.35 m M to be the best cutoff threshold that discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors. Relative hyperlactatemia was an independent predictor of hospital and ICU mortality.

The first demonstration of lactate in human blood was in shock patients, by Johann Joseph Scherer in 1843. Subsequent work led to the demonstration that tissue hypoxia was associated with increased lactate level. Elevated lactate is frequently seen in critically ill patients and is primarily a consequence of inadequate oxygen delivery, usually associated with significant cardiopulmonary compromise, as seen in cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic shock.

In an unstressed individual, the basal lactate concentration is 1.0 ± 0.5 m M. In critically ill patients, a lactate level of ≤ 2 m M is considered to be within the reference range, and therefore, hyperlactatemia is defined as lactate of > 2 m M. A wealth of literature exists on hyperlactatemia (> 2 m M) but not on lactate within the reference range.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^117KjtkU]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In cases of suspected albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, the primary management involves reducing the frequency of beta-adrenergic agonist administration. In most cases, lactate levels normalise within 24 to 72 hours after adjusting the albuterol dose or frequency. Supportive care, including intravenous fluids and monitoring of metabolic parameters, is typically sufficient to manage these patients. Discontinuation of beta-adrenergic agonists is rarely necessary, as reducing the frequency of administration is usually effective in resolving acidosis.

We considered metformin-associated lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in our case. However, since our patient was not on metformin or any biguanide medications, this aetiology was effectively ruled out. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an extremely rare event, with an estimated incidence of 0.03 to 0.06 per 1000 patient-years. Evidence suggests that metformin alone rarely causes lactic acidosis and, when it does, it is typically in the presence of underlying risk factors such as renal impairment, sepsis or tissue hypoxia. A systematic review from the Cochrane Library, analysing 347 comparative trials and cohort studies, found no cases of fatal or non-fatal lactic acidosis and no significant difference in plasma lactate levels between metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated groups.

The case presented here illustrates the importance of recognising albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis. The patient, who was treated with frequent albuterol nebulisations for a COPD exacerbation, developed significant lactic acidosis in the absence of tissue hypoxia. After ruling out sepsis and other causes of lactic acidosis, we reduced the frequency of albuterol treatments, leading to the normalisation of the patient's lactate levels. Clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, particularly in patients who develop hyperlactataemia without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection.

In clinical practice, elevated lactate levels often trigger concerns for sepsis, prompting extensive investigations. This case emphasises the need for clinicians to consider albuterol-induced lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving high doses of beta-adrenergic agonists, especially when other causes of lactic acidosis have been ruled out. Recognising this condition can prevent unnecessary investigations for sepsis and treatments, such as empirical antibiotics or aggressive fluid resuscitation, which may not be warranted.

### Lactic acidosis and severe septic shock in metformin users: a cohort study [^1136Xc5t]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis, defined as plasma lactate concentration greater than 5 mM and blood pH lower than 7.35, is common among emergency room (ER) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Lactic acidosis generally results from marked tissue hypoperfusion in shock or follows cardiopulmonary arrest; and as such, serves as an indicator of increased mortality risk. Elevated serum lactate is associated with increased mortality, independent of organ failure and shock. Metformin, which is currently considered the first choice for oral treatment of type 2 diabetes, may interfere with lactate metabolism. However, the prognosis among metformin users, compared to nonusers, of severe sepsis, with highly elevated lactate, is unclear.

The causes of lactic acidosis can be divided into those associated with obviously impaired tissue oxygenation (type A) and those in which systemic impairment in oxygenation does not exist or is not readily apparent (type B). The accumulation of lactate is usually due to enhanced pyruvate production; reduced pyruvate conversion to carbon dioxide and water, or to glucose; and an altered redox state within the cell, in which the pyruvate/lactate ratio shifts toward lactate. Lactic acidosis induced by metformin is typical, but a rare form of type B lactic acidosis, termed metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA). When lactic acidosis is diagnosed in a patient treated with metformin, but metformin overdose is not detected, the term metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) better describes the condition. The exact cellular mechanism responsible for lactate accumulation under metformin treatment was unclear for many years, but a recent trial revealed that metformin selectively inhibits the mitochondrial isoform of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glycerophosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). As a result, cytosolic DHAP is reduced and the cytosolic NAD–NADH ratio is increased. Cellular accumulation of NAD inhibits the conversion of lactate to pyruvate (limits the use of lactate as gluconeogenic precursors) and culminates in increased plasma concentration of lactate. Metformin also interacts in a dose-dependent manner with hepatic and extrahepatic mitochondrial enzymes, and this inhibits global oxygen consumption.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^113ToUzS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition often associated with tissue hypoxia or sepsis, but it can also be caused by beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol. This report describes a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a male patient in his 70s with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and increased albuterol use. During the initial evaluation, an elevated lactate level was observed, which further increased after albuterol treatment in the emergency room. A thorough sepsis workup was performed, yielding negative results, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis. After reducing the frequency of albuterol treatments, the patient's lactate levels normalised. This case underscores the importance of considering medication-induced causes of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with respiratory conditions who are frequently administered beta-adrenergic agonists. Recognising this under-reported phenomenon can help clinicians avoid unnecessary sepsis workups and ensure more accurate treatment plans.

### Clinical characteristics of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in China: a multicenter retrospective study [^112vqXFd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Lactate and lactate clearance were associated with patient outcomes. The arterial blood lactate level, a reflection of the body's metabolic level, has a strong correlation with prognosis and is known to be associated with mortality in sepsis and other forms of critical illness. Lactate clearance reflects the change in lactate concentration at different times and represents an accessible method for assessing tissue oxygen delivery. The increase in lactic acid levels is mainly due to ischemia and hypoxia, and once this situation is corrected, lactic acid levels begin to decrease. A 20% reduction in lactic acid concentration had been proved to improve patient outcomes. Moreover, lactate levels can be elevated by other factors, such as liver dysfunction, which can seriously affect patient outcomes. An increase in blood lactate after several hours of ECMO support could be indicative of a severe complication (e.g. mesenteric ischemia) to be addressed immediately.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: metformin toxicities [^115Dy7UF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin toxicity is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of metformin toxicity, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Metformin is a common medication used for treatment of diabetes mellitus. Metformin toxicity is a spectrum of conditions that may be differentiated into three subgroups: metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA), and metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis (MULA). MILA is a condition found predominantly in patients chronically taking metformin or those with large acute overdoses. Conversely, MULA occurs in patients on metformin but with a critical illness stemming from a separate cause. MALA is rare but the most severe form, with mortality rates that reach 50%. Differentiating these entities is difficult in the ED setting without obtaining metformin levels. Patients with metformin toxicity present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and vital sign abnormalities. Laboratory analysis will reveal a high lactate with anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients presenting with elevated lactate levels in the setting of metformin use should be considered at risk for the most severe form, MALA. Patients with MALA require aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, treatment of any concomitant condition, and early consideration of hemodialysis, along with specialist consultation such as nephrology and toxicology.

Conclusions

An understanding of metformin toxicity can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Elevated brain lactate responses to neural activation in panic disorder: a dynamic 1H-MRS study [^111Gu2Qk]. Molecular Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Converging evidence suggests that patients with panic disorder have a metabolic disturbance that may influence the regulation of arousal systems and confer vulnerability to 'spontaneous' panic attacks. The consistent finding of elevated brain lactate responses to various metabolic challenges in panic disorder appears to support this model, although the mechanism of this effect is not understood. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for elevated brain lactate responses in panic disorder, including (1) brain hypoxia due to excessive cerebral vasoconstriction, and (2) a metabolic disturbance affecting lactate metabolism. Recent studies have shown that neural activation (for example, sensory stimulation) causes local lactate accumulation in the presence of increased oxygen availability. The current study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic measures of visual cortex lactate changes during visual stimulation in 15 untreated patients with panic disorder and 15 matched volunteers to critically test these two proposed mechanisms of elevated brain lactate responses in panic disorder. Visual cortex lactate/N-acetylaspartate increased during visual stimulation in both groups. The increase was significantly greater in the panic patients than in the comparison group. There were no group differences in end-tidal pCO(2). The finding that visual stimulation leads to significantly greater visual cortex lactate responses in panic patients is not predicted by the hypoxia model. These results suggest that a metabolic disturbance affecting the production or clearance of lactate is the cause of the elevated brain lactate responses consistently observed in panic disorder and provide further support for metabolic models of vulnerability to this illness.

### Lactate dynamics in paediatric patients with severe sepsis: insights from a prospective cohort study [^114jfxSd]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe sepsis and septic shock in pediatric patients can cause an inappropriate immunological response, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death during their stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Septic shock is one of the most serious medical emergencies, causing high lactate levels. Even in high-income countries, it contributes to a 10% mortality rate.

Lactate produced in the human body is excreted through the liver and kidneys. Hyperlactatemia may be caused by decreased clearance, excessive production, or both. Elevated lactate levels occur in patients with shock, renal or hepatic failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, some inborn errors of metabolism, severe hypoxemia, and cardiac arrest. Monitoring lactate levels during severe sepsis and septic shock is vital for influencing clinical outcomes.

Critically ill patients may remain in compensated septic shock with normal blood pressure and urine output. Therefore, relying solely on maintaining normal physiological parameters such as vital signs and urinary output may be insufficient in these patients, as prompt detection and treatment of inadequate blood supply are crucial for their treatment. The plasma lactate value serves as one of the biological variables evaluated, and it can be employed to identify hypoperfusion and assess the effectiveness of resuscitation.

According to previous studies, single lactate measurements are not consistently correlated with death and have been used as markers of hypoperfusion; however, their sensitivities and specificities are unclear. Additionally, lactate clearance is an approximate percentage of the reduction in lactate levels following early resuscitation and is a plausible method for predicting mortality. Increased lactate levels correlate with poor outcomes, and survival can be predicted in critically ill adults with septic shock through early lactate clearance. However, the predictive accuracy of lactate clearance in children with severe sepsis has not been fully investigated. Additionally, there are inadequate data available for predicting mortality during hospitalisation using lactate measurements. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prognostic value of plasma lactate levels in children with severe sepsis or septic shock.

### Effects of endotoxin on lactate metabolism in humans [^114XC3cY]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis and inflammation elicit a whole set of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and systemic responses that belong to the organism's defense mechanisms. However, when excessive, these responses may also exert deleterious effects. Hyperlactatemia represents one prominent component of the metabolic stress response but shows marked inter-individual variations. In critically ill patients, hyperlactatemia has been shown to be related to both the severity of the underlying condition and in-hospital mortality.

The mechanisms underlying the development of hyperlactatemia in sepsis remain poorly understood: increased production or decreased clearance or a combination of both are possible. A rise in plasma lactate concentrations may result from a decreased lactate clearance secondary to low tissue oxygen delivery or from an increase in lactate production secondary to anaerobic metabolism in under-perfused tissues or to stimulation of aerobic glycolysis in response to inflammatory mediators. The relative importance of these two processes, as well as the major tissues where lactate metabolism is altered by sepsis, remains incompletely understood.

The impact of inflammation on the different metabolic pathways can be investigated by using a reproducible model of acute inflammation, consisting of endotoxin administration (lipopolysaccharide = LPS), which closely mimics some important aspects of sepsis and has the advantage of being short-lived. LPS elicits the release of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (ILs) and reproduces most of the neuroendocrine and metabolic alterations.

The present study aimed at investigating the relationship between inflammation and lactate metabolism and comparing local muscle responses and systemic metabolism. The objectives were to investigate the effect of endotoxin on the muscle lactate production in a first set of studies (trial 1) and on whole-body endogenous lactate production and lactate clearance in a second set of studies (trial 2). Since lactate is a major gluconeogenic precursor, an additional aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an increased lactate supply on glucose production and glycemic control during endotoxin-induced sepsis-like conditions.
