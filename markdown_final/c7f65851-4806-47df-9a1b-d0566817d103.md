## Question

What is an RSR pattern on ECG?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an RSR/rSr' pattern on the ECG is, how to define it morphologically, how to distinguish its major etiologies (including fragmented QRS, right bundle branch block, Brugada syndrome, and other substrates), what prognostic implications it carries, and what pitfalls like lead misplacement can mimic it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the strict morphological definition and when an RSR/rSr' truly qualifies as fragmentation. Then, I should verify the main clinical contexts where rSr' appears and how to differentiate among them. Next, I will review the prognostic data, being careful not to overgeneralize. Finally, I need to check for common artifacts and misplacements that can create pseudo–rSr' and outline a practical approach to workup and risk stratification.

> Let me first confirm the morphology. An RSR/rSr' pattern is a triphasic QRS complex with an initial R, a subsequent S, and a terminal R' that may be a notch, slur, or distinct second R wave; when this reflects conduction heterogeneity, it is considered a form of QRS fragmentation, typically defined as RSR'-type changes in at least two contiguous leads in the same anatomic territory (inferior, lateral, or anterior) to be clinically meaningful [^116UQBA6] [^1141ELcC] [^114GRUHj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; rSr' in the right precordial leads is not synonymous with disease. I need to check physiologic and benign contexts versus true conduction block. Incomplete right bundle branch block–like rSr' patterns in V1–V2 can be common in healthy athletes and may be a normal variant, whereas in atrial septal defect or related shunts, rsR'/rSr' can reflect right ventricular volume overload rather than intrinsic right bundle conduction delay, reinforcing that mechanism matters as much as morphology [^115K4wCn] [^113iu9T2].

> Next, I should review Brugada syndrome because type 2 or 3 Brugada patterns can look like rSr' in V1–V3; but wait, I need to confirm the required ST-segment features. Brugada diagnosis hinges on the type 1 coved ST elevation pattern, which may be unmasked from a type 2/3 morphology by a sodium-channel blocker challenge or by high intercostal lead placement, and the count of diagnostic right precordial leads has nuanced implications for specificity and risk assessment [^111G5dbc] [^113GKSpf] [^1151Pb8M].

> Now, I will examine fragmented QRS as a marker of myocardial scar. Let me verify the sensitivity and territory rules. fQRS encompassing RSR' morphologies, when present in two contiguous leads corresponding to a coronary territory and not due to bundle-branch block, is strongly associated with prior myocardial scar and has markedly higher sensitivity than Q waves alone for detecting perfusion-defined scar on nuclear imaging, supporting its use as a scar surrogate on the surface ECG [^114GRUHj] [^116UQBA6] [^1141ELcC].

> I should confirm prognostic implications, but wait, what if I overgeneralize risk from fQRS to everyone? Initially, I thought any fQRS confers excess mortality; however, I need to double-check population-level data. In a large middle-aged cohort, fQRS — especially in inferior leads — was common and not linked to excess mortality in those without known cardiac disease, whereas lateral-lead fQRS in patients with established cardiac disease was associated with higher all-cause, cardiac, and arrhythmic mortality, so context and lead location modify risk substantially [^1141ELcC] [^116UQBA6].

> But wait, what if the rSr' is simply an artifact? I need to ensure lead placement is correct before assigning pathology. High placement or misplacement of V1–V2 can generate pseudo–incomplete RBBB, anterior T-wave inversion, and even Brugada-like patterns, and general electrode misconnection/misplacement can produce spurious rSr'-like morphologies; repeating the ECG with standardized positioning per AHA recommendations is an essential verification step before further workup [^116R1XtR] [^112ouMyP].

> Let me think about a pragmatic differentiation pathway. I should first confirm the territory and QRS width, scrutinize ST-T morphology in V1–V3 for Brugada features, and correlate with clinical context; benign athletic rSr' typically shows isolated right precordial involvement without worrisome repolarization changes, whereas suspected Brugada warrants high intercostal leads and, if appropriate, sodium-channel blocker testing under guideline-directed protocols; suspected scar-related fQRS should prompt ischemic evaluation, and when rSr' coexists with concerning repolarization features or family history suggestive of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, guidelines support adjunctive tools such as signal-averaged ECG, electrophysiologic testing in selected cases, and family screening with ECG and imaging, with longitudinal follow-up tailored to the phenotype [^113GKSpf] [^111SVFrK] [^113WFGnB] [^116PtcSm].

The RSR' pattern on ECG is a triphasic QRS with a small initial R, deep S, and terminal R' in V1–V2, typically with QRS 100–120 ms and no significant axis or ST-T changes. It most often reflects **incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB)** [^115K4wCn], a benign variant in healthy individuals, but can also indicate right ventricular overload [^113e9n7w], atrial septal defect [^113iu9T2], or early right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Clinical context and **QRS duration** are key to distinguish IRBBB from complete RBBB or other pathologies, and further evaluation is warranted if symptoms, RV strain, or structural heart disease are suspected [^notfound].

---

## Electrocardiographic characteristics of RSR' pattern

The RSR' pattern has the following **ECG features**:

- **Leads**: Most commonly observed in the right precordial leads (V1 and V2).

- **Morphology**: Triphasic QRS complex with a small initial R wave, a deep S wave, and a terminal R' wave.

- **QRS duration**: Typically between 100 and 120 ms, indicating incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB).

- **Axis and ST-T**: No significant axis deviation or ST-T wave abnormalities.

---

## Clinical significance of RSR' pattern

The RSR' pattern is most commonly associated with **incomplete right bundle branch block (IRBBB)**, a benign variant in healthy individuals. It can also indicate **underlying cardiac conditions**, including:

- **Right ventricular overload**: Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, or chronic lung disease [^113e9n7w].

- **Atrial septal defect (ASD)**: Incomplete RBBB is frequently observed in ASD due to right ventricular volume overload [^113iu9T2].

- **Early right ventricular cardiomyopathy**: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) may present with RSR' pattern in early stages [^111SVFrK].

---

## Differentiation from other ECG patterns

It is **essential to differentiate** the RSR' pattern from other ECG abnormalities, including:

- **Complete right bundle branch block (RBBB)**: QRS duration ≥ 120 ms, broad terminal R' wave in V1, and slurred S wave in lateral leads.

- **Brugada syndrome**: Characterized by coved-type ST-segment elevation in V1-V3, distinct from the RSR' pattern [^111G5dbc].

- **Fragmented QRS (fQRS)**: Multiple RSR' patterns in contiguous leads, indicating myocardial scar or conduction delay [^1141ELcC] [^114GRUHj].

---

## Clinical implications and management

An RSR' pattern on ECG is generally benign in healthy individuals, but **further evaluation is warranted** when symptoms (e.g. syncope, palpitations, or chest pain) are present, there is evidence of right ventricular strain or overload, or structural heart disease is suspected. In such cases, **additional diagnostic testing** — echocardiography, cardiac MRI, or electrophysiological studies — may be necessary to identify underlying cardiac conditions [^113TPwXH] [^113WFGnB].

---

## Prognostic significance

The prognostic significance of the RSR' pattern **depends on the underlying cardiac condition**. In healthy individuals, it is **generally benign** [^115K4wCn]; in patients with underlying cardiac disease, such as pulmonary hypertension or ARVC, it may indicate **increased risk of adverse cardiac events**.

---

The RSR' pattern on ECG is a triphasic QRS complex commonly associated with incomplete right bundle branch block. It is **generally benign** but may indicate underlying cardiac conditions such as right ventricular overload or early cardiomyopathy. Clinical context and **QRS duration** [^115M3BxX] are essential for accurate interpretation and management.

### Findings from 12-lead electrocardiography that predict circulatory shock from pulmonary embolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113e9n7w]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) recommend risk stratifying patients to assess PE severity, as those at higher risk should be considered for therapy in addition to standard anticoagulation to prevent right ventricular (RV) failure, which can cause hemodynamic collapse. The hypothesis was that 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) can aid in this determination. The objective of this study was to measure the prognostic value of specific ECG findings (the Daniel score, which includes heart rate > 100 beats/min, presence of the S1Q3T3 pattern, incomplete and complete right bundle branch block [RBBB], and T-wave inversion in leads V1-V4, plus ST elevation in lead aVR and atrial fibrillation suggestive of RV strain from acute pulmonary hypertension) in patients with acute PE.

- **Methods**: Studies were identified by a structured search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scopus, and bibliographies in October 2014. Case reports, non-English papers, and those that lacked either patient outcomes or ECG findings were excluded. Papers with evidence of a predefined reference standard for PE and the results of 12-lead ECG, stratified by outcome (hemodynamic collapse, defined as circulatory shock requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital or death within 30 days) were included. Papers were assessed for selection and publication bias. The authors also assessed heterogeneity (I²) and calculated the odds ratios (OR) for each ECG sign from the random effects model if I² > 24% and fixed effects if I² < 25%.

### Prevalence and prognostic significance of fragmented QRS complex in middle-aged subjects with and without clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac disease [^1141ELcC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

We wanted to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of the fragmented QRS (fQRS) complex, defined as changes in QRS morphology with various RSR'-patterns in a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in a middle-aged general population. We evaluated the 12-lead ECGs of 10,904 Finnish middle-aged subjects (52% men, mean age 44 ± 8.5 years) with (n = 2,543) and without (n = 8,361) evidence of cardiac disease drawn from the general population and followed them for an average of 30 ± 11 years.

Fragmentation of the QRS complex was defined as various RSR'-patterns in at least 2 consecutive leads within the same territory: inferior (II, III, aVF), lateral (I, aVL, V4 to V6), and anterior (V1 to V3). Primary endpoints were death from any cause, cardiac, and arrhythmic deaths. In the total population, fQRS was present in 19.7% (n = 2,147) of subjects, including 15.7% (n = 1,714) in inferior leads, 0.8% (n = 84) in lateral leads, and 2.9% (n = 314) in anterior leads.

Fragmentation was not associated with increased mortality in subjects without a known cardiac disease. However, fQRS observed in lateral leads in subjects with evidence of cardiac disease was associated with an increased risk of all-cause (p = 0.001), cardiac (p = 0.001), and arrhythmic (p = 0.004) mortalities. In conclusion, fQRS reflecting minor intraventricular conduction defect is a common finding, especially in the inferior leads, but it is not a sign of increased risk of mortality in subjects without a known cardiac disease. Lateral fQRS, which is less commonly observed in the ECG, is associated with a worse outcome in patients with a known cardiac disease.

### The predictive value of abnormal electrocardiogram for patent foramen ovale: A retrospective study [^113iu9T2]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

In addition to the crochetage R wave, right bundle branch block (RBBB) was considered a marker for atrial septal defect (ASD). It was reported that the observed rsR′ or rSr′ patterns in patients with ASD are related to right ventricular overload, rather than true propagation delay. A prospective study included 87 adult patients with suspicion of ASD, showing that patent foramen ovale (PFO) was significantly more prevalent in patients with RBBB (39.02% vs. 4.3%, p < 0.001). Another study included 61 patients diagnosed with ASD, showing that incomplete RBBB (56% vs. 5%) was more frequent in ASD patients compared to the control group and was related to ASD (OR: 26, 95% CI: 7–94).

- **Possible mechanisms**: The mechanisms responsible for this relationship between RBBB and ASD may include an abnormal delay in right ventricular activation due to enlarged right ventricular cavity size, progressive chronic endocardial fibrosis caused by turbulence in the interruption region of the atrial septum that could directly damage the conduction system, and right ventricular overload and stretch of the conduction system. However, there was no significant association between RBBB and PFO in our study. Although we were unable to precisely explain the relationship, combined crochetage R wave and RBBB might improve the accuracy for diagnosing PFO.

Otherwise, a defective T wave (DTW) on an electrocardiogram (ECG) was considered a marker for ASD. DTW is a double-peaked T wave with a prominent second summit and a delayed Q–T peak interval in V2 compared to the interval in V6. It has been reported in a study that DTW alone had 87.9% sensitivity and 97.0% specificity for the diagnosis of ASD.

### Qrs axis validation in clinical electrocardiography [^1147WJCi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

QRS axis is a key electrocardiographic (ECG) datum in establishing normality and particular diagnoses, and is of special concern at the borders of axis ranges for numerous ECG interpretations. Thus, interpreters must be able to recognize gross and small errors in axis determination. This involves the occasional and often inexplicable gross deviation by computers, which should be correct most of the time.

This study was undertaken to compare three methods of QRS axis calculation and computer interpretation:

- **Bipolar limb leads**: Axes were determined from the bipolar limb leads.
- **Unipolar limb leads**: Axes were determined from the unipolar limb leads.
- **Combination of lead I and lead aVF**: Axes were determined from the combination of lead I and lead aVF, which are orthogonal in the Einthoven hexaxial system.

In 100 consecutive patients, of whom 87 electrocardiograms were technically clear, there was excellent intermethod agreement for the means, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges, leaving little to choose from on average. The combination of lead I and lead aVF was best correlated with all the other methods.

Because a computer can measure the areas of ECG waves, while interpreters necessarily use their amplitudes, hypothetically, the computer is always more accurate. However, computer interpretations are not always available, and physicians regularly interpreting electrocardiograms are aware of axis ranges almost on inspection, especially any algebraically zero, i.e. orthogonal, representation of any lead. They can therefore recognize any serious computer deviations.

In conclusion, this investigation indicated that axes calculated from leads I and aVF should be standard to approach precision.

### An unusual cause of ST elevation [^115yRM7o]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

An interesting case of a patient presenting to the emergency department with chest pain and an electrocardiogram (ECG) revealing ST elevation is presented. On closer examination, another explanation for this ECG appearance is discussed, indicating that emergency revascularization was not necessary.

### Prevalence of abnormal electrocardiograms in a large, unselected population undergoing pre-participation cardiovascular screening [^115K4wCn]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The implementation of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) in the pre-participation screening of young athletes is still controversial. A number of issues are largely debated, including the prevalence and spectrum of ECG abnormalities found in individuals undergoing such screening.

- **Methods and results**: We assessed a large, unselected population of 32,652 subjects [26,050 (80%) males], prospectively examined in 19 clinics associated with the Italian Sports Medicine Federation. Most participants were young amateur athletes, aged 8–78 years (median 17), predominantly students (68%). The sports activities most engaged in were soccer (39%), volleyball or basketball (8% each), athletics (6%), cycling (5%), and swimming (4%). The ECG patterns were evaluated according to commonly used clinical criteria. The 12-lead ECG patterns were considered normal in 28,799 of the 32,652 athletes (88.2%) and abnormal in 3,853 (11.8%).

- **Common and distinct abnormalities**: The most frequent abnormalities included prolonged PR interval, incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB), and early repolarization pattern (total 2280, 7.0%). Distinct ECG abnormalities included deeply inverted T-waves in more than two precordial and/or standard leads (751, 2.3%), increased R/S wave voltages suggestive of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (247, 0.8%), and conduction disorders such as RBBB (351, 1.0%), left anterior fascicular block (162, 0.5%), and left bundle branch block (19, 0.1%). Rarely, cardiac pre-excitation pattern (42, 0.1%) and prolonged QTc interval (1, 0.03%) were found.

In conclusion, in a large unselected population of young athletes undergoing pre-participation screening, the prevalence of markedly abnormal ECG patterns was examined.

### Electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with sickle cell disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122HWFj]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Previous studies have documented that electrocardiography (ECG) can reveal a range of abnormalities, offering valuable insights into the cardiac evaluation of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). The objective of this study is to assess the patterns of ECG abnormalities observed in these patients with SCD and to determine their prevalence.

- **Method**: We systematically reviewed the literature using online databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar to identify original studies that reported findings of standard ECG assessments in patients with SCD. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model. Additional analyses, including sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis, were also conducted.

- **Results**: Analysis of data from 59 studies involving 897,920 individuals with SCD revealed that 75% of these patients had abnormal ECG findings (67%-81%), which were predominantly nonspecific ST-T changes, left ventricular hypertrophy, T-wave changes, prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, and ischemic changes. It was shown that these patients had significantly higher odds of having any ECG abnormalities (OR of 17.50, 4.68–65.49), right atrial enlargement (6.09, 1.48–25.09), left ventricular hypertrophy (3.45, 1.73–6.89), right ventricular hypertrophy (7.18, 2.28–22.57), biventricular hypertrophy (10.11, 1.99–51.38), prolonged QTc interval (5.54, 2.44–12.59), ST depression (3.34, 1.87–5.97), and T-wave changes (5.41, 1.43–20.56). Moreover, the mean QTc interval was significantly higher among those with SCD.

### Recommendations for the standardization and interpretation of the electrocardiogram. Part I: The electrocardiogram and its technology. A scientific statement from the American Heart Association Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee, Council on Clinical Cardiology; the American College of Cardiology Foundation; and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115M3BxX]. Heart Rhythm (2007). High credibility.

This statement examines the relation of the resting ECG to its technology. Its purpose is to foster understanding of how the modern ECG is derived and displayed, and to establish standards that will improve the accuracy and usefulness of the ECG in practice. Derivation of representative waveforms and measurements based on global intervals are described. Special emphasis is placed on digital signal acquisition and computer-based signal processing, which provide automated measurements that lead to computer-generated diagnostic statements. Lead placement, recording methods, and waveform presentation are reviewed. Throughout the statement, recommendations for ECG standards are placed in the context of the clinical implications of evolving ECG technology.

### A negative T-wave in electrocardiogram at 50 years predicted lifetime mortality in a random population-based cohort [^117Eu9Rw]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

A negative T-wave in ECG registered at 50 years of age in asymptomatic individuals from a randomized observational cohort carried an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death during lifetime follow-up. The enhanced risk remained after adjustment for other ECG abnormalities and other CV risk factors. A major T-wave inversion conveyed a higher risk than minor, and a negative T-wave carried enhanced risk also in the absence of other risk factors.

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to ECG, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend considering obtaining signal-averaged ECG for diagnosis and risk stratification in patients with suspected ARVC.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: From risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^116hiAtn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

A major limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of the input data due to differences in methodology, population, and ethnicity. Variabilities in the ascertainment of ECG markers and adjudication of the outcomes may affect the quality of the overall data.

Our systematic review considered the overall data of the published series. We didn't go into detail about specific issues regarding subgroups such as women and children, who have a very challenging risk profile. In addition, many of the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in these studies are hypothetical, not based on experimental data. Therefore, further rigorous studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.

### Elevated resting heart rate is associated with the metabolic syndrome [^113X77Vs]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2009). Low credibility.

There is emerging evidence suggesting that resting heart rate (RHR) is associated with both the presence of and risk for developing cardiovascular disease. We have analyzed the association between RHR and the metabolic syndrome (MetS), a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A significant association may, at least in part, elucidate the observed connection between RHR and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, it raises the possibility of currently unknown shared pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Inappropriate and confusing electrocardiographic terms: J-wave syndromes and early repolarization [^11484bcn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

A plea is made to refrain from using the terms J-wave syndromes and early repolarization in publications until such terms are properly defined by appropriate task forces established by recognized authorities. The currently used electrographic terminology, including J-point elevation, meets our needs.

### What is the etiology of the tall initial R wave in V-V [^116a8pa1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

We present an electrocardiogram that may initially appear to show a simple right bundle branch block. However, for the vigilant interpreter, a posterior infarction could be easily identified from the presence of a tall initial R wave in V1-V2.

### Predictive value of T-wave abnormalities at the time of emergency department presentation in patients with potential acute coronary syndromes [^117M7Him]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiograms (ECGs) are common, but their ability to predict 30-day cardiovascular outcomes at the time of emergency department (ED) presentation is unknown. This study determines the association between T-wave abnormalities on the presenting ECG and cardiovascular outcomes within 30 days of presentation in patients with potential acute coronary syndromes (ACSs).

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of ED patients who presented with potential ACS. Patients were excluded if they had a prior myocardial infarction, ST-segment elevation or depressions, right or left bundle branch block, or Q-waves on the initial ECG. Data included demographics, medical and cardiac history, and ECG findings, including the presence or absence of T-wave flattening, inversions of 1–5 mm, and inversions > 5 mm. Investigators followed the hospital course for admitted patients, and 30-day follow-up was performed on all patients. The main outcome was a composite of death, acute myocardial infarction, revascularization, coronary stenosis greater than 50%, or a stress test with reversible ischemia.

- **Results**: Of 8,298 patient visits, 5,582 met criteria for inclusion: 4,166 (74.6%) had no T-wave abnormalities, 721 (12.9%) had T-wave flattening in two or more leads, 659 (11.8%) had T-wave inversions of 1–5 mm, and 36 (0.64%) had T-wave inversions > 5 mm. The composite endpoint was more common in patients with T-wave flattening (8.2% vs. 5.7%; p = 0.0001; relative risk [RR] = 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 1.9).

### Mayzent [^1175k4RP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **First dose monitoring in patients with certain preexisting cardiac conditions**: Because initiation of Mayzent treatment results in a decrease in heart rate (HR), first-dose 6-hour monitoring is recommended for patients with sinus bradycardia (HR less than 55 beats per minute), first- or second-degree (Mobitz type I) AV block, or a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **First dose 6-hour monitoring**: Administer the first dose of Mayzent in a setting where resources to appropriately manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor patients for 6 hours after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and blood pressure measurement. Obtain an ECG in these patients at the end of the Day 1 observation period.

- **Additional monitoring after 6-hour monitoring**: If any of the following abnormalities are present after 6 hours (even in the absence of symptoms), continue monitoring until the abnormality resolves:

	- The heart rate 6 hours postdose is less than 45 bpm
	- The heart rate 6 hours postdose is at the lowest value postdose, suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not have occurred
	- The ECG 6 hours postdose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block

If post-dose symptomatic bradycardia, bradyarrhythmia, or conduction-related symptoms occur, or if ECG 6 hours post-dose shows new onset second-degree or higher AV block or QTc greater than or equal to 500 msec, initiate appropriate management.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: From risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^115oktjX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article and its supplementary files.

- **Search strategy**: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses guidelines. Two reviewers, A.B. and F.V., developed the search strategy in November 2019. The search terms used were as follows: (ECG OR EKG OR electrocardiogram OR electrocardiographic) AND (sign OR predictor OR marker) AND Brugada AND (sudden death OR death OR syncope OR arrhythmia OR ventricular fibrillation OR ventricular tachycardia). The databases analyzed were PubMed and EMBASE. Only articles published in English and in peer‐reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion. A total of three independent reviewers, A.B. F.V., and M.S., analyzed the records to identify those warranting full‐text analysis. These reviewers also independently analyzed references of all evaluated articles to identify other relevant articles not found through the database search. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The protocol of this systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO international prospective register for systematic reviews (registration number CRD42019123794).

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were eligible for selection only if they 1) were an observational or interventional trial in patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS) and 2) contained data on ECG signs and arrhythmic events, syncope, cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death (SCD), and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interventions during follow-up.

### Fragmented QRS complex: A novel marker of cardiovascular disease [^116UQBA6]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

QRS complex fragmentation, defined as changes in QRS morphology with different RSR' patterns such as additional R waves, a notched S wave, or more than one R' wave, has recently been linked with various cardiac conditions and is postulated to be predictive of outcomes in certain pathologies. The article aims to consolidate the available information about this morphological ECG abnormality and its predictive value.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, specifically with respect to electrocardiography, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines recommend eliciting any of the following in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with pre-excitation to identify those at low risk of developing rapid conduction over the pathway:

- **Abrupt loss of conduction**: This can be noted over the pathway during exercise testing in sinus rhythm.

- **Intermittent loss of pre-excitation**: It should be observed during ECG or ambulatory monitoring.

### Electrocardiogram in pneumonia [^1155F8WY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Findings on electrocardiograms may hint that pulmonary embolism (PE) is present when interpreted in the proper context, leading to definitive imaging tests. However, it would be useful to know if electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities also occur in patients with pneumonia and whether these are similar to ECG changes associated with PE. The purpose of this investigation was to determine ECG findings in patients with pneumonia. We retrospectively evaluated 62 adults discharged with a diagnosis of pneumonia who had no previous cardiopulmonary disease and had electrocardiograms obtained during hospitalization.

- **Electrocardiographic abnormalities**: The most prevalent ECG abnormality, other than sinus tachycardia, was minor nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes, occurring in 13 of 62 (21%). Right atrial enlargement occurred in 4 of 62 (6.5%). QRS abnormalities were observed in 24 of 62 (39%). Right-axis deviation and S(1)S(2)S(3) were the most prevalent QRS abnormalities, which occurred in 6 of 62 (9.7%). Complete right bundle branch block and S(1)Q(3)T(3) patterns occurred in 3 of 62 (4.8%).

- **Dynamic changes**: ECG abnormalities that were not present within 1 month previously or that disappeared within 1 month included left-axis deviation, right-axis deviation, right atrial enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy, S(1)S(2)S(3), S(1)Q(3)T(3), low-voltage QRS complexes, and nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities.

In conclusion, electrocardiograms in patients with pneumonia often show QRS abnormalities or nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes. ECG findings are similar to ECG abnormalities in PE.

### A diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG is associated with a high cardiovascular risk: Findings from a 40- to 69-year-old cohort in general practice [^112XVLQ2]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in both sexes. This study examined whether a diagnosis of LVH on electrocardiogram (ECG) was associated with a 'high CV risk condition' among 40- to 69-year-old individuals cared for by general practitioners (GPs).

We studied 4,250 individuals, 5.4% of whom had LVH. Cross-sectional frequencies and age- and gender-adjusted statistical differences were calculated. All the study variables were significantly worse for individuals with 'LVH' than for those with 'non-LVH', except for smoking. The 'LVH' group had both a mean '5-year CV risk' significantly greater than those in the 'non-LVH' group (27.0% versus 8.6%), and a significantly higher prevalence of a '5-year CV risk > 15%' (89% versus 15%).

A diagnosis of LVH on ECG among adult individuals from an opportunistic cohort in general practice was associated with a six-fold greater prevalence of a 'high CV risk condition'.

### Prognostic value of right ventricular strain pattern on ECG in COVID-19 patients [^11186ufm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide, causing severe morbidity and mortality, a process that continues to this day. This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of right ventricular (RV) strain in patients with COVID-19.

Consecutive adult patients admitted to the emergency room for COVID-19 between April 1 and April 30 were included in this study. An ECG was performed upon hospital admission and evaluated in a blinded manner. RV strain was defined as the presence of one or more of the following ECG findings: complete or incomplete right ventricular branch block (RBBB), a negative T wave in V1-V4, and the presence of S1Q3T3. The main outcome measure was death during hospitalization, with the relationship of variables to the main outcome evaluated by multivariable Cox regression analysis.

A total of 324 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study; the majority were male (187, 58%), with a mean age of 64.2 ± 14.1 years. Ninety-five patients (29%) exhibited right ventricular strain according to ECG, and 66 patients (20%) died. After a multivariable survival analysis, the presence of RV strain on ECG (OR: 4.385, 95% CI: 2.226–8.638, p < 0.001), along with high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), d-dimer levels, and age, were identified as independent predictors of mortality.

The presence of a right ventricular strain pattern on ECG is associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.

### Number of electrocardiogram leads displaying the diagnostic coved-type pattern in Brugada syndrome: a diagnostic consensus criterion to be revised [^1151Pb8M]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aims: According to the diagnostic consensus criteria, the electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis of Brugada syndrome requires coved-type ≥ 2 mm ST-segment elevation in > 1 right precordial lead (RPL) V1-V3, in the presence or absence of a sodium-channel blocker. However, this consensus has not been evaluated. We aimed to assess the distribution of coved-type ST-segment elevation on RPLs in a large patient cohort to reevaluate the appropriateness of the diagnostic consensus criteria.

Methods and results: We included 186 individuals with spontaneous and/or drug-induced ECGs showing coved-type ≥ 2 mm ST-segment elevation in at least one RPL. A total of 376 ECGs were analyzed for the number, distribution, and maximal J-point elevation of diagnostic RPLs. Among all ECGs, 27 (7%) showed a coved-type pattern in 3 RPLs, 205 (55%) in 2 RPLs, and 144 (38%) in only 1 RPL. Leads V1 and V2 were diagnostic in 99% of all ECGs with two diagnostic RPLs. Lead V3 alone was not diagnostic in any ECG. Maximal J-point elevation was significantly higher in lead V2 than V1. Sixty case subjects (32%) had only ECGs with one RPL displaying a coved-type ST-segment elevation. There was no significant difference in clinical presentation and outcome compared with the 126 Brugada patients with ECGs displaying > 1 diagnostic RPL. Major arrhythmic events occurred at the same rate (8%) in both groups during a follow-up period of over 5 years.

Conclusion: Lead V3 does not yield diagnostic information in Brugada syndrome. Individuals with ECGs displaying only one diagnostic RPL have a similar clinical profile and arrhythmic risks compared to those with ECGs displaying more than one diagnostic RPL.

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for dilated cardiomyopathy, specifically in the context of electrophysiology study, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend considering ICD placement or obtaining electrophysiologic testing for risk stratification for sudden cardiac death in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy who have experienced syncope presumed to be due to ventricular arrhythmia. This recommendation applies when such patients do not meet indications for a primary prevention ICD, provided that the expected meaningful survival is greater than one year.

### Standard ECG in Brugada syndrome as a marker of prognosis: From risk stratification to pathophysiological insights [^115p3gUK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

In this systematic review of the literature on Brugada ECG pattern (BrS type 1 ECG), we quantitatively evaluated the incremental risk related to a spectrum of ECG features and provide some insights into the pathophysiology of BrS. Before discussing the different ECG signs and their relative prognostic implications, the following general points need to be considered:

- **Brugada syndrome prognosis**: Unlike other channelopathies in which the extent of the primary pathogenetic alteration is directly related to the prognosis (typically the length of QT in long QT syndromes), in the case of BrS, the severity of the ST‐T alterations of the type 1 pattern does not have a defined role for the prognosis.

- **Standard ECG diagnosis**: The diagnosis of BrS is based on a single element of standard ECG, the so‐called type 1 pattern. However, a very broad spectrum of ECG changes is present, with variable frequency and clinical significance. This makes the disease — which still lacks precise nosographic boundaries — even more challenging and intriguing.

- **ECG manifestations**: To explain such a broad spectrum of ECG manifestations, it is necessary to hypothesize other mechanisms besides the main mechanism underlying the type 1 ECG Brugada pattern, such as the epi‐endocardial gradient in myocells of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) attributed to loss of function of the sodium current.

### Misplacing V1 and V2 can have clinical consequences [^116R1XtR]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The precordial electrocardiogram (ECG) leads V1 and V2 are often misplaced, usually involving placement too high on the chest. The resulting ECG may generate erroneous patterns, such as incomplete right bundle branch block, anterior T wave inversion, septal Q waves, and ST-segment elevation. These features may falsely suggest conditions like acute or old cardiac ischemia, pulmonary embolism, or a type-2 Brugada pattern. On rare occasions, high placement of V1 and V2 may actually reveal a true type-1 Brugada pattern. Emergency clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of lead misplacement and should know how to suspect it based on unusual P wave morphology in V1 and V2.

### Body mapping of sweating patterns in athletes: A sex comparison [^11531MoM]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2012). Low credibility.

Limited regional sweat rate (RSR) data are available for females, with only a small number of sites measured across the body. Similarly, sex differences in sweating concentrate on whole body values, with limited RSR data available.

- **Methods**: A modified absorbent technique was used to collect sweat at two exercise intensities (60% (I1) and 75% (I2) V˙O2max) in 13 aerobically trained females (21 ± 1 yr, 59.5 ± 10 mL·min·kg V˙O2max) in moderately warm conditions (25°C, 45% relative humidity, 2 m·s air velocity). Females were compared with nine aerobically trained males (23 ± 3 yr, 70.2 ± 13 mL·min·kg V˙O2max) tested under the same conditions.

- **Results**: Female I1 RSR was highest at the central upper back, heels, and dorsal foot and between the breasts (223, 161, 139, and 139 g·m·h, respectively). Lowest values were over the breasts and the middle and lower outer back (< 16 g·m·h). At I2, the central upper back, bra triangle, and lower back showed the highest RSR (723, 470, and 333 g·m·h, respectively). Regions of the breasts and palms had the lowest RSR at I2 (< 82 g·m·h). Significantly greater gross sweat loss and thus RSR were observed in males versus females at both exercise intensities. For the same metabolic heat production (male I1 vs. female I2), absolute and normalized RSR showed a significant region-sex interaction (P < 0.001), with a greater distribution toward the arms and hands in females versus males.

- **Conclusions**: Despite some differences in distribution, both sexes showed highest RSR on the central upper back and the lowest toward the extremities.

### Electrocardiogram standards for children and young adults using-scores [^112T9zUT]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Low credibility.

Normative ECG values for children are based on relatively few subjects and are not standardized, resulting in interpersonal variability of interpretation. Recent advances in digital technology allow a more quantitative, reproducible assessment of ECG variables. Our objective was to create the foundation of normative ECG standards in the young utilizing Z-scores.

Methods: One hundred two ECG variables were collected from a retrospective cohort of 27,085 study subjects with no known heart condition, ages 0 to 39 years. The cohort was divided into 16 age groups by sex. Median, interquartile range, and range were calculated for each variable adjusted to body surface area.

Results: Normative standards were developed for all 102 ECG variables, including heart rate; P, R, and T axis; R-T axis deviation; PR interval, QRS duration, QT, and QTc interval; P, Q, R, S, and T amplitudes in 12 leads; as well as QRS and T wave integrals. Incremental Z-score values between -2.5 and 2.5 were calculated to establish upper and lower limits of normal. Historical ECG interpretative concepts were reassessed and new concepts observed.

Conclusions: Electronically acquired ECG values based on the largest pediatric and young adult cohort ever compiled provide the first detailed, standardized, quantitative foundation of traditional and novel ECG variables. Expression of ECG variables by Z-scores lends an objective and reproducible evaluation without interpreter bias that can lead to more confident establishment of ECG-disease correlations and improved automated ECG readings in high-volume settings.

### Electrocardiogram-based deep learning improves outcome prediction following cardiac resynchronization therapy [^112RXmvd]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Explainable deep learning through factor visualization: Electrocardiogram factors that were significantly associated with outcome and non-response are summarized in Figure 4. Exact HRs for outcome and the ORs for non-response are summarized in Supplementary Material online, Tables S5 and S10, respectively. Visualizations of the most important ECG factors, using factor traversals, are shown in Figure 5, whereas Supplementary Material online, Figure S1 displays a complete 12-lead visualization of all factors.

Factors associated with both non-response and poor outcomes were interpreted as follows: F 1 (absent QRS notching and ST-segment deviation, but lateral T-wave inversion), F 9 (transition from LBBB morphology to more right bundle branch block morphology with smaller right precordial S-wave amplitudes), F 10 (increased ventricular rate), and F 19 (decreased anterior QS amplitude and lateral notched R). Importantly, F 8 and F 15 (increased PR interval and P-wave duration) were only associated with worse outcomes, whereas F 5 (decreased QRS duration and JTc interval) and F 26 (decreased QRS duration and amplitude of LBBB morphology) were only associated with non-response.

Similar factors (F 1, F 9, and F 19), mostly representing reduced QRS and T-wave voltage with increased QT duration, were found to be predictive for HF hospitalization when compared with the model for the primary outcome alone. However, F 25, which represents reduced QRS duration, was also predictive for HF hospitalization.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^1115e4MF]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, more specifically concerning chest X-rays (CXR), the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a CXR in patients with:

- **Signs and symptoms suggestive of heart failure**:
	- This includes any symptoms or indications that may point towards heart failure.

- **Suspected acute pulmonary disease**:
	- Consider a CXR if there are suspicions of any acute conditions affecting the lungs.

- **Suspected aortic, non-coronary cardiac, or other thoracic causes of chest pain**:
	- A CXR may help identify issues related to the aorta, non-coronary heart conditions, or other chest-related pain not linked to coronary issues.

### How to interpret right ventricular remodeling in athletes [^113gcB2n]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Assessment of the ECG**: The ECG is one of the most important tools for the screening of athletes and for identifying inherited cardiac conditions at risk of sudden cardiac death. A recently published international panel of experts released new criteria for ECG interpretation in athletes. A correct definition of which ECG changes are physiological (common and training-related ECG abnormalities) and which are pathological (uncommon and training-unrelated ECG abnormalities) is essential for an accurate cardiovascular evaluation. This prevents false positive diagnoses and facilitates cost savings.

T wave inversion (TWI) in precordial leads (V1-V3) and beyond, in the absence of complete right bundle branch block (RBBB), is a major diagnostic criterion for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) based on the 2010 Task Force Criteria (TFC) document. However, anterior TWI can occur in adolescent athletes (< 16 years; "juvenile pattern of repolarization") and is more common in women than in men (4.3% vs 1.4%, respectively; P < 0.001). In specific cases, anterior TWI may also be a manifestation of physiological electrical changes induced by the exercise stimulus, as it is present in up to 7% of endurance Caucasian athletes and in up to 13% of African/afro-Caribbean athletes.

In athletes, anterior TWI is commonly accompanied by other athlete's ECG features such as sinus bradycardia, J-point elevation, or voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. This is in accordance with the 2017 International ECG recommendations for interpretation.

### Spatiotemporal characteristics of QRS complexes enable the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome regardless of the appearance of a type 1 ECG [^111LNANG]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Brugada syndrome based on the ECG is hampered by the dynamic nature of its ECG manifestations. Brugada syndrome patients are only 25% likely to present a type 1 ECG. The objective of this study is to provide an ECG diagnostic criterion for Brugada syndrome patients that can be applied consistently even in the absence of a type 1 ECG.

- **Methods and results**: We recorded 67-lead body surface potential maps from 94 Brugada syndrome patients and 82 controls, including right bundle branch block patients and healthy individuals. The spatial propagation direction during the last r' wave and the slope at the end of the QRS complex were measured and compared between patient groups. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed for half of the database to identify optimal cutoff values; sensitivity and specificity for these cutoff values were measured in the other half of the database. A spontaneous type 1 ECG was present in only 30% of BrS patients. An orientation in the sagittal plane < 101º during the last r' wave and a descending slope < 9.65 mV/s enables the diagnosis of the syndrome with a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 97% in non-type 1 Brugada syndrome patients.

- **Conclusion**: Spatiotemporal characteristics of surface ECG recordings can enable a robust identification of BrS even without the presence of a type 1 ECG.

### The athlete's electrocardiogram [^112ZhH1K]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram performed in competitive athletes may manifest abnormal electrocardiographic findings. These findings may indicate either normal variant syndromes or true cardiac pathology. Normal variant syndromes include ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, and intraventricular conduction delay. It must be stressed that these electrocardiographic findings are, in fact, normal variants and not indicative of underlying pathology.

Other presentations in these same competitive athletes describe significant cardiac pathology, including syndromes predisposing the patient to sudden cardiac death and other potentially dangerous dysrhythmias, as well as diagnostic indications of acute coronary syndrome. This article reviews the various findings in this group of patients.

### Prediction of episode of hemodynamic instability using an electrocardiogram based analytic: a retrospective cohort study [^1115cpQE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

The study focuses on the prevalence of AHI-PI high-risk indications in the hours before the onset of the first episode of hemodynamic instability (EHI) among all patients who were monitored using non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and intra-arterial pressure (IAP).

- **Distribution of AHI-PI high risk indication**: There were four groups of patients, including those with and without EHI. Patients were monitored with IAP and NIBP. The central mark (red) on each box plot indicates the median. The bottom and top edges of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data points that are not more than 50% beyond the interquartile range.

### How to evaluate premature ventricular beats in the athlete: Critical review and proposal of a diagnostic algorithm [^112xewzr]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential part of the evaluation of athletes with premature ventricular beats (PVBs) because concomitant repolarization/depolarization abnormalities may provide important information on a possible underlying cardiomyopathy or channelopathy.

- **Relevant ECG abnormalities**: The most relevant ECG abnormalities, which are consistent with an at-risk heart muscle disorder, include repolarization abnormalities such as T-wave inversion and ST segment depression, pathological Q-waves, intraventricular conduction disturbances, ventricular pre-excitation, and a long QT interval. These ECG abnormalities are classified by recommendations for interpretation of the athlete's ECG as abnormal and training-unrelated findings that warrant additional investigation to exclude myocardial disease.
- **PVB with LBBB morphology**: The association between a PVB with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology and other ECG abnormalities such as T-wave inversion, prolonged S-wave upstroke (≥ 55 ms from the nadir of the S-wave to the end of the QRS complex in leads V1–V3), or an epsilon wave (a small positive deflection or notch between the end of the QRS complex and onset of the T-wave in leads V1–V3) in the non-ectopic beats is highly suggestive of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.
- **PVB with RBBB pattern**: On the other hand, PVBs with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern > 130 ms and negative T-waves in the left precordial leads (V5–V6) in the non-ectopic beats should raise the suspicion of left ventricular (LV) myocardial disease, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, non-ischemic LV scar, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse.

### How to evaluate premature ventricular beats in the athlete: Critical review and proposal of a diagnostic algorithm [^111zRL8E]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The assessment of the morphology of the ectopic QRS complex on the ECG helps to identify the anatomical origin of the ventricular arrhythmia (VA). Idiopathic premature ventricular beats (PVBs) are characterized by the absence of an underlying structural heart disease and a favorable prognosis and exhibit distinctive ECG patterns.

The most common form of idiopathic PVBs shows an ECG pattern of left bundle branch block (LBBB) with an inferior QRS axis, also referred to as an 'infundibular' pattern. An LBBB pattern is recognized by a negative QRS complex in lead V1, while a negative QRS complex in lead aVL and positive QRS in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF) denote an inferior axis. When the ectopic QRS becomes positive beyond V3, the origin of the arrhythmia is usually the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract. A similar morphology but with small R-waves in V1 and earlier precordial transition (the ectopic QRS complex becomes positive by V2 or V3) often indicates the PVB origin from the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract.

On Holter monitoring, the ectopic beats usually manifest as frequent isolated PVBs and rare couplets, but occasionally triplets or runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) may also occur. The ventricular ectopy is usually more frequent during the day than at night or following a period of exercise and is transiently suppressed by sinus tachycardia. Characteristically, during stress testing, idiopathic PVBs from the RV or LV outflow tract decrease or disappear.

### The prehospital electrocardiogram [^114Lrspe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although widely used in Europe, the prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) has seen only limited use in this country. Reported benefits of the 12-lead EKG include shortening the door-to-needle time, accelerating the initiation of reperfusion therapy, and overall improving the prehospital and hospital management and outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction. The field EKG also provides the basis for prehospital fibrinolysis.

Concerns still exist, however, regarding the best means of providing real-time field interpretation of the prehospital EKG and the potential for inappropriate field time delay, triage, and treatment of patients. Moreover, questions remain about the overall clinical and cost benefit of expanding this resource universally. The following article reviews the role of prehospital EKG in caring for patients with acute coronary syndromes.

### Natural history of the electrocardiographic pattern of early repolarization in ambulatory patients [^117TUTxW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Although it is known that the electrocardiographic pattern of early repolarization (ER) occurs most commonly in healthy young bradycardic men, its natural history is uncertain. We considered initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) at rest from 29,281 ambulatory patients recorded from 1987 through 1999 at Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Hospital. With the PR interval as the isoelectric line and the amplitude criterion as > 0.1 mV, ER was identified when any of the following fulfilled the amplitude criterion: ST-segment elevation at the end of the QRS duration, J waves as an upward deflection, and slurs as delay on the R wave downstroke. The first 250 ECGs with the greatest ER increase were selected, and the database was searched for an ECG > 5 months later.

Of the 250 patients selected with the greatest amplitude of ER, 6 were excluded for electrocardiographic abnormalities, leaving 244 subjects, of whom 122 had another ECG ≥ 5 months later. Their average age was 42 ± 10 years, and the average time from the first to second ECG was 10 years. Of the 122 patients, 47 (38%) retained ER, whereas most (62%) no longer fulfilled the amplitude criterion. There were no significant differences in heart rate or time interval between ECGs.

In conclusion, the electrocardiographic pattern of ER was lost over 10 years in more than half of this young clinical cohort, and the loss was not caused by higher heart rate, longer time between ECGs, decrease in R-wave amplitude, death, acute disease, or alterations in electrocardiographic diagnostic characteristics.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^114XttW9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

- **EKG during SVT**: EKGs recorded during episodes of SVT were classified as showing either (1) no visible P waves, (2) an rSr' pattern (VA interval 80 msec), or (4) a long RP interval (RP > PR, Figure 2A–D). Mid-RP tachycardias (RP = PR) were classified as short RP. SVT was considered irregular if the shortest RR interval was less than 85% of the longest RR interval.

- **Response to adenosine or vagal maneuvers**: Adenosine-responsive patients had at least one documented episode when SVT terminated abruptly when given IV adenosine. Transient slowing of the tachycardia, delayed termination, and gradual termination were not considered positive responses. Adenosine nonresponsive patients had at least one documented episode when adenosine failed and had never had a successful termination with adenosine. Patients whose tachycardia resolved with IV diltiazem, verapamil, metoprolol, procainamide, amiodarone, or electrical cardioversion were not considered adenosine-responsive.

Vagal-responsive and nonresponsive patients were defined in the same way as for adenosine. Abrupt termination of either tachycardia or symptoms was considered a positive response. Successful vagal maneuvers included Valsalva, exhaling against resistance, deep breathing, coughing, carotid sinus massage, sudden exposure to cold stimuli, raising the legs, squatting, and placement of an IV catheter.

- **Monitor recordings**: Monitor recordings included those from ambulatory event monitors and implanted devices.

Heart Rhythm (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented substantial challenges to patient care and impacted healthcare delivery, including cardiac electrophysiology practice throughout the globe. Based upon the undetermined course and regional variability of the pandemic, there is uncertainty as to how and when to resume and deliver electrophysiology services for arrhythmia patients. This joint document from representatives of the Heart Rhythm Society, American Heart Association, and American College of Cardiology seeks to provide guidance for clinicians and institutions reestablishing safe electrophysiological care.

To achieve this aim, we address regional and local COVID-19 disease status, the role of viral screening and serologic testing, return-to-work considerations for exposed or infected healthcare workers, risk stratification and management strategies based on COVID-19 disease burden, institutional preparedness for resumption of elective procedures, patient preparation and communication, prioritization of procedures, and development of outpatient and periprocedural care pathways.

### Electrocardiographic electrode misplacement, misconnection, and artifact [^112ouMyP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are performed by humans and, thus, are subject to human error. An underappreciated source of electrocardiographic abnormality is electrode misconnection, both limb and precordial, and improper placement, which is principally an issue with the precordial electrodes due to anatomic variation. Patterns of abnormality exist; recognition allows the emergency physician to avoid mistaking the resulting electrocardiographic findings for true pathology.

The purpose of this clinical review is to describe the patterns of electrocardiographic electrode reversal, misplacement, and artifact, making them recognizable to the emergency physician.

- **Discussion**:
	- Common limb electrode reversals feature distinctive patterns manifesting as unexpected morphologic and frontal plane axis changes in the QRS complexes in the limb and augmented leads. Precordial electrode misplacement (improper positioning of the electrodes on the chest) is common and may mimic a pseudoinfarction pattern, or ST-segment/T-wave changes, which must be recognized as the result of the misplacement rather than true cardiac ischemia. Precordial electrode reversal should be suspected when the normal R/S wave amplitude transition is violated. Electrocardiographic artifact must be distinguished from dysrhythmia to avoid a potentially hazardous progression to unnecessary diagnostics and therapeutics.

- **Conclusions**:
	- The hallmarks of electrode misconnection, misplacement, and electrocardiographic artifact can be easily mastered by the emergency physician. Recognition of these factors is essential to prevent misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatments.

### Heart rate, gender differences, and presence versus absence of diagnostic ST elevation as determinants of spatial QRS|T angle widening in acute coronary syndrome [^114xhrFz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

We explored the directions of the repolarization sequence (RS) and excitation sequence (ES) as determinants of QRS|T angle widening in 126 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with and 658 patients without diagnostic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and in a reference group of 5,376 normal subjects. The initial and terminal RS and ES directions were derived from the initial and terminal T and QRS vectors from quintiles 1 to 3 and 5 of time-normalized QRS and T. In addition to the QRS|T angle, we evaluated the RS and ES deviation angles from the normal RS and ES directions. The normal zones for the ES and RS directions in the reference group were used to classify the ES and RS in the group with and without ST-segment myocardial infarction as normal or deviant.

The initial and terminal QRS|T angles were rate invariant in the normal group but correlated with the heart rate (r = 0.33) in the ACS group. Adjusted for a heart rate of 70 beats/min, the initial QRS|T angle increased progressively in the ACS group from 41° among those with normal RS and ES directions to 121° when both were deviant. This apparently ischemia-induced initial QRS|T angle increase was associated with an initial RS direction from the anterior-right to the posterior-left, producing a progressively greater peak TV1 amplitude.

The terminal ES orientation in the ACS group was toward the right ventricular outflow tract with a QRS|T angle of 124° in 48% and leftward and posterior, with the QRS|T angle decreasing to 59°, in the remaining 52%. In conclusion, the initial and terminal RS and ES orientation…

### 2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^111ifj8D]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Low credibility.

- **Resting 12-lead electrocardiogram**:

A 12-lead ECG during tachycardia is the first diagnostic test that should be performed for any patient with a stable, wide QRS complex tachycardia to differentiate ventricular tachycardia (VT) from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) prior to attempts to terminate the tachycardia.

Criteria that support a diagnosis of VT include:

- **AV dissociation**: A QRS complex > 0.14 seconds, monophasic R wave in aVR, positively or negatively concordant QRS complexes in the precordial leads, the absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads, and an RS interval > 100 ms in at least one precordial lead.

For patients with preexisting bundle branch block, comparison of the QRS morphology during sinus rhythm with QRS morphology during wide complex tachycardia is important. Various QRS morphologies, such as a bundle branch block pattern, strongly support the diagnosis of VT. However, an identical QRS complex during sinus rhythm and broad QRS tachycardia does not rule out the presence of bundle branch reentry (BBR) tachycardia.

Patients without structural heart disease (SHD) can present with idiopathic VT, such as fascicular VT, which can be easily recognized by a 12-lead ECG. For nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or nonsustained VT, the 12-lead QRS morphology is critical to allow for identification of the site of origin (SOO).

Idiopathic VAs, such as right and left outflow tract (OT) VAs, PVCs from the aortic sinus of Valsalva (SV), and papillary muscle VAs, can be recognized because they exhibit characteristic ECG patterns (see Section 5.2).

A 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm is helpful to evaluate the presence of underlying heart disease.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^116PtcSm]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, especially in screening of family relatives (follow-up), the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend conducting an initial clinical evaluation using a multiparametric approach. This includes ECG and cardiac imaging in first-degree relatives when no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant is identified in the proband, or genetic testing is not performed.

### Significance of a fragmented QRS complex versus a Q wave in patients with coronary artery disease [^114GRUHj]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Q waves on a 12-lead ECG are markers of a prior myocardial infarction (MI). However, they may regress or even disappear over time, and there is no specific ECG sign of a non-Q-wave MI. Fragmented QRS complexes (fQRSs), which include various RSR' patterns without a typical bundle-branch block, are markers of altered ventricular depolarization owing to a prior myocardial scar. We postulated that the presence of an fQRS might improve the ability to detect a prior MI compared with Q waves alone by ECG.

- **Methods and results**: A cohort of 479 consecutive patients (mean ± SD age, 58.2 ± 13.2 years; 283 males) who were referred for nuclear stress tests was studied. The fQRS included various morphologies of the QRS (1 R' fragmentation) in 2 contiguous leads, corresponding to a major coronary artery territory. The Q wave was present in 71 (14.8%) patients, an fQRS was present in 191 (34.9%) patients, and an fQRS and/or a Q wave was present in 203 (42.3%) patients. Sensitivity, specificity, and the negative predictive value for myocardial scar as detected by single photon emission computed tomography analysis were 36.3%, 99.2%, and 70.8%, respectively, for the Q wave alone; 85.6%, 89%, and 92.7%, respectively, for the fQRS; and 91.4%, 89%, and 94.2%, respectively, for the Q wave and/or fQRS.

- **Conclusions**: The fQRS on a 12-lead ECG is a marker of a prior MI, defined by regional perfusion abnormalities, which has a substantially higher sensitivity and negative predictive value compared to the Q wave alone.

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring/telemetry [^115jDghq]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Ambulatory ECG (AECG) is commonly employed in various clinical contexts to detect cardiac arrhythmias or arrhythmia patterns that are not readily obtained from the standard ECG. Accurate and timely characterization of arrhythmias is crucial to directing therapies that can significantly impact diagnosis, prognosis, or patient symptom status. The rhythm information derived from the diverse AECG recording systems can often lead to appropriate and patient-specific medical and interventional management. This document provides background and a framework to apply AECG techniques in clinical practice and research.

### Frequency of acute coronary syndrome in patients with normal electrocardiogram performed during presence or absence of chest pain [^112Ne7Kf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The authors hypothesized that patients with active chest pain at the time of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) have a lower frequency of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) than patients being evaluated for chest pain but with no active chest pain at the time of a normal ECG. The study objective was to describe the association between chest pain in patients with a normal ECG and the diagnosis of ACS.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study of emergency department (ED) patients with a chief complaint of chest pain and an initial normal ECG admitted to the hospital for chest pain evaluation over a 1-year period. Two groups were identified: patients with chest pain during the ECG and patients without chest pain during the ECG. Normal ECG criteria were as follows: 1) normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 55–105 beats/min, 2) normal QRS interval and ST segment, and 3) normal T-wave morphology or T-wave flattening. "Normal" excludes pathologic Q waves, left ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities, any ST depression, and discrepancies in the axis between the T wave and the QRS. Patients' initial ED ECGs were interpreted as normal or abnormal by two emergency physicians (EPs); differences in interpretation were resolved by a cardiologist. ACS was defined as follows: 1) elevation and characteristic evolution of troponin I level, 2) coronary angiography demonstrating > 70% stenosis in a major coronary artery, or 3) positive noninvasive cardiac stress test. Chi-square analysis was performed, and odds ratios (ORs) are presented.

### Methodologies to characterize the QT/corrected QT interval in the presence of drug-induced heart rate changes or other autonomic effects [^1139yBNt]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

This white paper, written collaboratively by members of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies, discusses different methods to characterize the QT effects for drugs that have a substantial, direct, or indirect effect on heart rate. Descriptions and applications are provided for individualized QT-R-R correction, Holter bin, dynamic QT beat-to-beat, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, and QT assessment at a constant heart rate. Most of these techniques are optimally performed using continuous electrocardiogram data obtained in clinical studies designed to characterize a drug's effect on the QT interval.

An important study design element is the collection of drug-free data over a range of heart rates observed on treatment. The range of heart rates is increased at baseline by using ambulatory electrocardiogram recordings in addition to those collected under semisupine, resting conditions. Discussions in this study summarize areas of emerging consensus and other areas in which consensus remains elusive and provide suggestions for additional research to further increase our knowledge and understanding of this topic.

### Genome-wide association study for resting electrocardiogram in the Qatari population identifies 6 novel genes and validates novel polygenic risk scores [^116r4ZCg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Electrocardiography is arguably the most valuable noninvasive diagnostic tool for heart disease, given its wide availability and utility in diagnosing many cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathies. ECG shows several interval measurements such as QT interval, PR interval, and QRS duration. These intervals reflect various cardiac mechanisms. For instance, the PR interval reflects conduction from the atria to ventricles, and variation in the PR interval may indicate heart block, which can lead to sudden death. The QT interval is a measure of the combination of cardiac depolarization and repolarization and can indicate long or short QT syndrome. Over the years, numerous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 400 genetic loci for ECG intervals. However, the identified loci do not explain all ECG heritability, which is estimated in individuals of European descent for QT interval, PR interval, and QRS duration as 29.3%, 18.2%, and 15%, respectively.

Most of the existing GWASs have been performed in cohorts of predominantly European descent. Other ancestries have been considered but with relatively smaller sample sizes; for example, African/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Japanese individuals. Middle Eastern populations are underrepresented in genomic medicine for many complex traits. A recent study performed a GWAS on 45 quantitative traits using the Qatar Biobank data set. Another study conducted a GWAS on coronary heart disease and validated several polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in the Qatar Biobank.

### Large Q and S waves in lead III on the electrocardiogram distinguish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from athletes [^114xRbzB]. Heart (2018).

The research's objective was to identify electrocardiographic findings, particularly deep Q and S waves in lead III, that differentiate athletes from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

- **Methods**: Digital ECGs of athletes and patients with HCM followed at the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease were studied retrospectively. All patients with HCM had an echocardiogram performed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for various demographic and ECG characteristics. Linear regression was employed to correlate ECG characteristics with echocardiogram findings.

- **Results**: The study included 1,124 athletes and 240 patients with HCM. The average Q+S wave amplitude in lead III was significantly higher in patients with HCM compared to athletes (0.71 ± 0.69 mV vs. 0.21 ± 0.17 mV). Adding a threshold of > 1.0 mV as an abnormal finding to the International Criteria for athletic ECG interpretation improved sensitivity from 64.2% to 70.4%, with a minimal decrease in specificity.

- **Conclusion**: Large Q and S waves in lead III effectively distinguished athletes from patients with HCM.

### Global R-wave peak time for diagnosis of left bundle branch capture [^113zfc9w]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Low credibility.

QRS axis deviation and rS configuration in V6 affect the ability of V6 R-wave peak time (RWPT) criterion to discriminate capture type during left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP).

- **Objective**: We hypothesized that combining RWPTs from lateral leads: I, aVL, V5, and V6 may better reflect left ventricular activation time and that such a global RWPT may be insensitive to changes in QRS configuration.

- **Methods**: The analysis included 519 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with nonselective left bundle branch pacing (nsLBBP) and 176 ECGs with left ventricular septal pacing (LVSP). Optimal RWPT cutoffs and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were determined for each lead and combinations of leads to find the best RWPT criterion for discriminating nsLBBP from LVSP. Values were reported separately for healthy and diseased left conduction system groups.

- **Results**: The highest AUC of 97.1/89.2% was obtained for the global RWPT, which combined leads I and V6. The AUC for single-lead RWPT was highest for lead I, followed by V6, V5, and aVL with AUCs of 95.1/87.4%, 93.6/87.1%, 93.0/86.5%, and 84.8/74.6%, respectively. The global RWPT criterion was not affected by variations in QRS configuration, as V6 and I RWPTs often showed opposite responses to changes in axis. In contrast, all single-lead RWPT criteria were sensitive to axis deviation and QRS configuration. Diagnostically optimal RWPT cutoffs for global RWPT and lead I RWPT were 162.5/187.5 ms and 81.5/90.5 ms, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The global RWPT criterion allows a more accurate diagnosis of LBBAP capture type.

### HRS/EHRA/APHRS expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of patients with inherited primary arrhythmia syndromes: Document endorsed by HRS, EHRA, and APHRS in May 2013 and by ACCF, AHA, PACES, and AEPC in June 2013 [^111G5dbc]. Heart Rhythm (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Brugada syndrome, the APHRS/EHRA/HRS 2013 guidelines recommend diagnosing Brugada syndrome in patients with type 2 or type 3 ST-segment elevation in ≥ 1 lead among the right precordial leads V1, V2 positioned in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th intercostal space, when a provocative drug test with IV administration of class I antiarrhythmic drugs induces a type I ECG morphology.

### Prognostic implications of prominent R wave in electrocardiographic leads V1 or V2 in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^1129utDx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although the adverse prognosis of Q-waves on electrocardiogram (ECG) has been demonstrated, the prognostic significance of prominent R wave (PRW) in V1 or V2 across a broad spectrum of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been specifically studied. In the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and the Canadian ACS Registry I ECG substudies, admission ECGs were analyzed in an independent core ECG laboratory. PRW was defined as R wave > 40 to 50 ms in V1 or V2, R/S ≥ 1 in V1, or R/S ≥ 1.5 in V2.

Among 11,895 patients with ACS, 495 (4.2%) had PRW; they were less likely to have a history of hypertension or heart failure and had lower GRACE risk scores but a higher incidence of ST-segment depression (all p ≤ 0.001). Patients with PRW had similar rates of in-hospital death (2.8% vs 4.1%, respectively, p = 0.15) but lower rates of in-hospital heart failure (8.5% vs 15.2%, respectively, p = 0.02) and 6-month mortality (4.6% vs 8.4%, respectively, p = 0.004).

In multivariable analyses, PRW was not a significant independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.8) or 6-month mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.15). Among 4,418 patients who underwent coronary angiography, those with PRW had a higher prevalence of left circumflex artery disease (62.5% vs 49.5%, respectively, p = 0.01).

In conclusion, across the broad spectrum of patients with ACS, PRW provides no significant additional prognostic utility beyond comprehensive risk assessment using the GRACE risk score.

### Quantitative electrocardiographic measures and long-term mortality in exercise test patients with clinically normal resting electrocardiograms [^111SmY2U]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Currently, the only function of the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients referred for exercise testing is to determine whether imaging is mandated. It is unknown if subtle ECG findings in those patients with clinically normal resting ECGs have prognostic significance.

- **Methods**: We performed a single-center cohort study of 18,964 patients without known cardiovascular disease who had a clinically normal resting ECG and underwent treadmill exercise testing for evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease. Eleven quantitative ECG measures relating to heart rate, conduction, left ventricular mass, or repolarization were collected digitally. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The prognostic importance of a composite ECG score was assessed by measuring its impact on the c-index (analogous to area under receiver operating characteristic curve) and by measures of reclassification.

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 10.7 years, 1,585 patients died. The four most predictive digital ECG variables were higher ventricular rate, more leftward QRS axis, more downward ST-segment deviation, and longer QT interval. The ECG score was independently associated with mortality (75th vs. 25th percentile hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.25–1.49, P < .0001). The ECG score had a modest impact on discrimination (change in c-index 0.04) and reclassification of risk (3.0% decrease of relative integrated discrimination improvement, P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Subtle ECG findings relating to heart rate, conduction, left ventricular mass, or repolarization in patients with clinically normal resting ECGs may have prognostic significance.
