## Question

Is prednisone effective in treating sciatica pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prednisone is effective in treating sciatica pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and mechanism of sciatica. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized trial evidence for oral prednisone. Next, I will review systematic reviews and meta-analyses to gauge consistency and effect sizes. After that, I need to check guideline positions and weigh benefits versus harms. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats about timing, patient selection, and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. Sciatica is typically a radicular pain syndrome from nerve root inflammation and compression, often due to lumbar disc herniation, so anti-inflammatory therapy might theoretically reduce pain, but I should confirm whether systemic steroids translate into clinically meaningful benefit in trials.

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized trial. The JAMA RCT in 269 patients with acute radiculopathy from a herniated disk found that a 15-day taper of oral prednisone improved function modestly at 3 weeks and 52 weeks, but did not improve leg pain at either time point, with substantially more adverse events in the prednisone arm, which tempers enthusiasm for routine use [^662d786b] [^a7f6aceb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify consistency across syntheses. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs found a small, statistically significant reduction in pain and disability with systemic steroids, but the certainty of evidence was very low and the effect sizes were weak, reinforcing that any benefit is modest and uncertain [^f8c75b66]. Earlier systematic reviews similarly concluded that oral steroids show at best small, short-term benefits and carry more adverse effects than placebo, which aligns with the JAMA findings [^4382c3c8] [^be2252bd].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The VA/DoD guideline recommends against systemic corticosteroids for low back pain with or without radiculopathy, citing low-quality evidence and lack of consistent benefit, which supports a conservative stance on oral steroids for sciatica [^69bd0317]. The Spine Journal guideline likewise concludes that oral or IV steroids are not effective for low back pain, including radicular presentations, in emergency department settings, again underscoring limited utility [^notfound].

> Let me consider the risk–benefit balance carefully. The JAMA trial showed a 6.4-point improvement on the Oswestry Disability Index at 3 weeks, which is below commonly cited minimal clinically important differences, while adverse events were about twice as frequent with prednisone, including insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite, so the functional gain is small and may not outweigh harms for most patients [^662d786b]. I should double-check that this pattern holds across reviews; yes, pooled analyses consistently show higher adverse event rates with steroids and only small, uncertain benefits, reinforcing a cautious approach [^f8c75b66] [^4382c3c8].

> But wait, what if timing or patient selection changes outcomes. A small early trial suggested faster improvement in pain and disability with a 9-day prednisone taper, though the differences were subtle and the study was underpowered, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting it [^5eb002ce]. Mechanistically, steroids target inflammation, which is most plausible early in acute radiculopathy, yet even the JAMA trial's functional benefits waned and did not translate into pain relief, so I should avoid assuming that earlier administration would reliably improve pain outcomes [^662d786b].

> Next, I should review alternatives to contextualize where prednisone fits. Epidural steroid injections offer small, short-term improvements in leg pain and disability and may help some patients avoid surgery, though effects are modest and not guaranteed, and procedural risks must be weighed, especially with particulate steroids and transforaminal approaches [^8074e303] [^1fc11c61]. NSAIDs have limited benefit for sciatica and carry gastrointestinal risks, while many patients improve with conservative care over time, so prednisone should not be used as a substitute for standard nonpharmacologic and analgesic management [^49304aeb] [^5745a379].

> I will now examine practical prescribing details if, despite these limitations, a clinician considers a short prednisone trial. Typical regimens studied use about 60 mg daily with a taper over 12–15 days, and any trial should be time-limited with clear stop criteria if there is no meaningful improvement, given the adverse effect burden and lack of durable pain benefit [^662d786b]. I should confirm that no guideline endorses routine repeat courses; indeed, major guidelines recommend against systemic steroids for radicular pain, so repeated or chronic use is not supported [^69bd0317].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and synthesize. Prednisone is not effective for reducing sciatica pain in a clinically meaningful way, although it may produce a small, short-term improvement in function in some patients with acute radiculopathy, and this limited benefit must be balanced against a higher rate of adverse effects and the lack of long-term advantages, so routine use is not recommended [^662d786b] [^f8c75b66]. I should confirm that this aligns with guidelines; yes, VA/DoD and specialty guidance advise against systemic steroids for radicular low back pain, reserving them, if at all, for carefully selected cases after shared decision-making and with close monitoring for side effects [^69bd0317].

> Final clinical take: Prednisone should generally be avoided for sciatica pain. If considered, limit to a short, single taper in acute radiculopathy when pain is severe and other conservative measures have failed, set expectations that any functional gain is modest and pain relief is unlikely, monitor for adverse effects, and pivot promptly to evidence-based alternatives if there is no clear benefit [^662d786b] [^f8c75b66] [^69bd0317].

Prednisone is **not effective for sciatica pain** [^662d786b]. High-quality evidence shows no meaningful reduction in leg pain versus placebo at 3 weeks or 1 year, though there is a small, clinically modest improvement in function at 3 weeks that does not persist [^662d786b]. Systemic corticosteroids increase adverse effects such as insomnia, anxiety, and hyperglycemia [^662d786b], and guidelines recommend against routine use for sciatica [^69bd0317]. Prednisone may be considered only for severe acute radicular pain after other conservative measures fail, and even then, benefits are limited and transient [^f8c75b66].

## Clinical evidence on prednisone for sciatica

### Randomized controlled trials

- **JAMA 2015 trial**: 269 patients with acute radiculopathy from herniated disk; prednisone (15-day taper) vs placebo. No significant pain reduction at 3 weeks or 1 year, but a modest 6.4-point ODI improvement at 3 weeks (not sustained) and more adverse events (49.2% vs 23.9%) [^662d786b].

- **Small 2008 trial**: 27 patients; prednisone vs placebo. Faster improvement in pain, mental well-being, and disability, but no significant differences in physical findings, NSAID/narcotic use, or return to work; small sample limits conclusions [^5eb002ce].

- **Emergency department trial**: single IM methylprednisolone 160 mg vs placebo. No significant pain reduction at 1 month, though secondary outcomes suggested less analgesic use and disability; underpowered and not definitive [^3038ae77].

---

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

- **2023 meta-analysis**: 10 RCTs, 1,017 patients. Small, short-term improvements in pain and function (SMD −0.42 and −0.30), but very low certainty; no sustained benefit and higher adverse event risk (RR 2.00) [^f8c75b66].

- **Cochrane 2022**: 13 trials, 1,047 patients. Moderate-certainty evidence of small, short-term pain and function benefits, but no reduction in surgery risk; adverse events are more common with steroids [^ac326097].

- **BMJ 2012**: pooled two trials showed a short-term pain reduction of about 12 points on a 0–100 scale, but evidence quality is low and effects are small and transient [^8b183c46].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines consistently **advise against routine prednisone** for sciatica:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| VA/DoD 2022 | Weak against systemic corticosteroids for low back pain with or without radiculopathy [^69bd0317] |
| AAFP 2018 | No significant benefit; avoid routine use |
| North American Spine Society | No recommendation for systemic steroids in acute radiculopathy |

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Prednisone carries **meaningful adverse effects**, especially with short courses:

- **Common effects**: insomnia, anxiety, irritability, hyperglycemia, increased appetite, weight gain, hypertension, and gastrointestinal upset [^662d786b].

- **Serious risks**: immunosuppression, adrenal suppression, and psychiatric effects, though less common with brief courses.

- **Risk–benefit**: given minimal benefit, the adverse effect burden argues against routine use [^f8c75b66].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Prednisone is **less effective than epidural steroid injections**, which provide small, short-term pain and disability benefits [^8074e303] [^0663443b], and is inferior to surgery for rapid relief in selected patients, though surgical benefits wane over time [^27cb1e69] [^23564f2f]. NSAIDs offer limited benefit and may be inferior to prednisone in some analyses, but evidence quality is low and heterogeneity is high [^49304aeb] [^8b183c46].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Prednisone may be considered only in **severe acute radicular pain** after other conservative measures fail, and even then, benefits are limited and transient. It is not recommended for chronic sciatica or as first-line therapy.

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Prednisone is **not effective for sciatica pain**; any benefits are small, short-term, and largely limited to function rather than pain, with a higher risk of adverse effects. Routine use is not supported by evidence or guidelines. Reserve prednisone for select severe cases after other conservative options fail, and counsel patients about limited and transient benefits.

### Oral steroids in initial treatment of acute sciatica [^5eb002ce]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Many physicians use prednisone to treat acute sciatica with the hope of speeding recovery. There is little clinical evidence to support this practice. Our objective was to determine whether early administration of oral prednisone affects parameters related to recovery from acute sciatica.

Methods

In this double-blind, controlled clinical trial, 27 patients were sequentially assigned to receive either a 9-day tapering course of prednisone (n = 13) or placebo (n = 14) within 1 week of developing sciatic symptoms. Patients and investigators were blinded to the drug administered. Follow-up assessment was done weekly for 1 month and then monthly for 5 months.

Results

Prednisone and control groups showed no statistically significant differences in physical findings, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or narcotic medications, or rates of patients returning to work at any time interval studied. Compared with controls, patients who received prednisone had more rapid rates of improvement from baseline in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. These changes were subtle but statistically significant. Patients who received prednisone tended to receive fewer epidural injections for pain.

Conclusions

Early administration of oral steroid medication in patients with acute sciatica had no significant effect on most parameters studied. It did, however, lead to slightly more rapid rates of improvement in pain, mental well-being, and disability scores. The impact of oral steroids on other outcomes is suggested by this study, but its small sample size limited its statistical power.

### The role of systemic steroids in sciatica due to herniated lumbar disc: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f8c75b66]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objective

Evaluate the role of systemic steroids in treating patients with sciatica due to lumbar disk herniation (LDH).

Summary Of Background Data

The association between LDH and sciatica has been well described. The use of steroids seems logical in this context; however, their efficacy is not well described, and their use remains controversial.

Methods

A comprehensive search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases (up to February 15, 2022) was performed to identify randomized clinical trials that included patients with symptoms of sciatica due to LDH that were treated with systemic steroids. The risk of bias was judged using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias2 tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to estimate the between-group effect size for pain and functional outcomes. The risk of developing adverse events (AE) was computed using relative risks. All pooled results are reported with their 95% confidence interval (CI) and certainty of evidence analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework.

Results

Ten studies met inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 1017 participants: 540 in the treatment group and 477 in the control group. Steroid treatment was associated with a significant superior reduction of pain (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.08, weak effect, very-low certainty) and reduction in disability (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.10, weak effect, very-low certainty). Corticosteroid administration was associated with a significant increased risk of developing an AE (relative risks = 2.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.85, low certainty).

Conclusion

The use of systemic steroids in the treatment of sciatica due to LDH seems reasonable despite a 2-fold higher risk of developing mild AEs. However, the effect size is small for reducing pain in the short term and improving functional outcomes at long-term follow-up.

### Oral steroids for acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk: a randomized clinical trial [^662d786b]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Oral steroids are commonly used to treat acute sciatica due to a herniated disk but have not been evaluated in an appropriately powered clinical trial.

Objective

To determine if oral prednisone is more effective than placebo in improving function and pain among patients with acute sciatica.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted from 2008 to 2013 in a large integrated health care delivery system in Northern California. Adults (n = 269) with radicular pain for 3 months or less, an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of 30 or higher (range, 0–100; higher scores indicate greater dysfunction), and a herniated disk confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging were eligible.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive a tapering 15-day course of oral prednisone (5 days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, and 20 mg; total cumulative dose = 600 mg; n = 181) or matching placebo (n = 88).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was ODI change at 3 weeks; secondary outcomes were ODI change at 1 year, change in lower extremity pain (measured on a 0–10 scale; higher scores indicate more pain), spine surgery, and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (0–100 scale; higher scores better).

Results

Observed baseline and 3-week mean ODI scores were 51.2 and 32.2 for the prednisone group and 51.1 and 37.5 for the placebo group, respectively. The prednisone-treated group showed an adjusted mean 6.4-point (95% CI, 1.9–10.9; P = 0.006) greater improvement in ODI scores at 3 weeks than the placebo group and a mean 7.4-point (95% CI, 2.2–12.5; P = 0.005) greater improvement at 52 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 0.3-point (95% CI, -0.4 to 1.0; P = 0.34) greater reduction in pain at 3 weeks and a mean 0.6-point (95% CI, -0.2 to 1.3; P = 0.15) greater reduction at 52 weeks. The prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 3.3-point (95% CI, 1.3–5.2; P = 0.001) greater improvement in the SF-36 PCS score at 3 weeks, no difference in the SF-36 PCS score at 52 weeks (mean, 2.5; 95% CI, -0.3 to 5.4; P = 0.08), no change in the SF-36 MCS score at 3 weeks (mean, 2.2; 95% CI, -0.4 to 4.8; P = 0.10), and an adjusted 3.6-point (95% CI, 0.6–6.7; P = 0.02) greater improvement in the SF-36 MCS score at 52 weeks. There were no differences in surgery rates at 52-week follow-up. Having 1 or more adverse events at 3-week follow-up was more common in the prednisone group than in the placebo group (49.2% vs 23.9%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute radiculopathy due to a herniated lumbar disk, a short course of oral steroids, compared with placebo, resulted in modestly improved function and no improvement in pain.

### Efficacy and tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4382c3c8]. Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The efficacy of pharmacological interventions in sciatica is limited and the use of systemic steroids is still controversial. We aimed at evaluating the efficacy and tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases until February 2010. Randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and the tolerance of systemic steroids in sciatica were included. Efficacy and tolerance were assessed using the relative risk (RR) and 95% CI with the inverse variance method (RR > 1 means that the event is more likely to occur in the steroid group). We explored the heterogeneity between the studies using subgroup analysis.

Results

Seven studies (383 patients) were included. The difference in the rate of responders between both groups was not statistically significant (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.96, 1.56). The rate of adverse events was 13.3% for the patients in the steroid group and 6.6% for the placebo group (RR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.06, 3.80). The number needed to harm was 20 (95% CI 10, ∞). Twenty (15.3%) patients in the steroid group and seven (5.7%) patients in the placebo group underwent surgery. A trend towards a higher requirement for spinal surgery was observed in the steroid group (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.74, 1.75). The methodological quality slightly influenced the results. We did not find any publication bias.

Conclusion

Steroid efficacy is not superior to the placebo in sciatica, but it has more side effects. The tolerance:efficacy ratio indicates against the use of systemic steroids in sciatica.

### Short-term efficacy of intravenous pulse glucocorticoids in acute discogenic sciatica. A randomized controlled trial [^009e6af4]. Spine (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Objective

To test the short-term efficacy of a single intravenous (IV) pulse of glucocorticoids on the symptoms of acute discogenic sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of acute discogenic sciatica is controversial. A potential advantage of the IV pulse therapy is the ability to distribute high glucocorticoid concentrations to the area surrounding the prolapsed disc without the risks and inconveniences of an epidural injection.

Methods

Patients with acute sciatica (< 6-week duration) of radiologically confirmed discogenic origin were randomized to receive either a single IV bolus of 500 mg of methylprednisolone or placebo. Clinical evaluation was performed in a double-blind manner on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, and 30. The primary outcome was reduction in sciatic leg pain during the first 3 days following the infusion; secondary outcomes were reduction in low back pain, global pain, functional disability, and signs of radicular irritation. The analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis using a longitudinal regression model for repeated measures.

Results

A total of 65 patients were randomized, and 60 completed the treatment and the follow-up assessments. A single IV bolus of glucocorticoids provided significant improvement in sciatic leg pain (P = 0.04) within the first 3 days. However, the effect size was small, and the improvement did not persist. IV glucocorticoids had no effect on functional disability or clinical signs of radicular irritation.

Conclusions

Although an IV bolus of glucocorticoids provides a short-term improvement in leg pain in patients with acute discogenic sciatica, its effects are transient and have small magnitude.

Strengths and limitations of review

The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a prespecified protocol, inclusion of trials published in languages other than English, and the use of a highly sensitive search strategy to identify trials for sciatica coupled with search terms related to the nine classes of drugs of interest. We assessed methodological quality with the PEDro scale rather than the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool because the PEDro scale has been shown to have acceptable reliabilityand validity, whereas two studies have reported reliability limitations with the Cochrane tool. One limitation of our study is the possibility of publication bias as we did not attempt to identify unpublished trials that could be found in clinical trials registries and conference proceedings. Another limitation is that we could accommodate trials in only four languages other than English.

A strength of our review over past reviews is that we located 24 randomised clinical trials relevant to our question compared with six, three, and twotrials included in the four previous reviews. Accordingly we provide more precise estimates of treatment effects, specifically for NSAIDs and corticosteroids, and a better description about tolerability of all classes of drug. Including more trials has allowed us to provide a more in-depth evaluation of the pharmacological treatments that have been tested for sciatica in primary care. For example, we have provided information on the efficacy of antidepressants and opioid analgesics whereas previous reviews did not cover these classes of drugs. Another strength of this review is that we quantitatively pooled trials where possible. This allowed us to explore the size of the treatment effect, which is not possible in a qualitative summary. In addition, we were able to assess the overall quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach. Although conclusions of previous reviews were based on a surprising paucity of evidence, our findings are likely to inform the direction of future research in this topic. In pharmacological trials for sciatica, we consider the priorities to include consideration of duration of symptoms, recruitment of large samples, and collection of outcomes relevant to patients. For instance, regarding duration of symptoms it would be reasonable to test corticosteroids and NSAIDs in trials in patients with acute sciatica, whereas given that chronic sciatica includes a neuropathic pain component, anticonvulsant and antidepressants might need to be tested in patients with a chronic condition.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1cc6b0ba]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

There is at best only low quality evidence to judge the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care. The available evidence does not clearly show favourable effects of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, or opioid analgesics in the immediate term, even compared with placebo. Evidence from a single trial and one meta-analysis with two trials provides some limited support ("low quality" and "moderate quality" evidence) for the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids to relieve pain in the short term in patients with acute sciatica. In one small sample trial there was also limited support ("low quality" evidence) for the short term relief of pain in chronic sciatica with an anticonvulsant drug. At present these data provide a lack of conclusive and high quality evidence to guide the prescription of these drugs for patients with sciatica in primary care.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8b183c46]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Corticosteroids

Three trials in patients with acute sciatica tested the effect of corticosteroids compared with placebo. The individual studies provided imprecise estimates of treatment effect (fig 2). For the immediate term, pooling showed no effect of steroids on leg pain (mean difference −1.8, −11.1 to 7.5; P = 0.71) with a GRADE classification of "moderate quality" of evidence (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3). For the short term, pooling showed a significant effect of steroids on pain (overall and leg pain) (mean difference −12.2, −20.9 to −3.4; P < 0.01) and "moderate quality" of evidence according to the GRADE approach (downgraded for imprecision) (fig 3).

Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics

Three trials investigated the efficacy of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioid analgesics (fig 2). As these were single trials that investigated different classes of drugs or time points of assessment, pooling was not possible. Hence, the quality of evidence for all these medications was considered "low quality" (single studies)or "very low quality" (single study downgraded for limitation of study design)according to the GRADE approach.

Two trials investigated the effect of anticonvulsants in patients with chronic symptoms of sciatica. In one crossover trial, topiramate (50–400 mg/day) showed no better immediate effects than placebo for disability and leg or back pain. In contrast, data from another trialshowed significant overall pain relieving effect with the anticonvulsant gabapentin (900–3600 mg) in the short term (mean difference −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9; P < 0.001) compared with placebo.

One crossover study with four periods investigated the relative efficacy of opioid analgesics (sustained release morphine 15 mg/day), antidepressants (nortriptyline 25 mg/day), and a combination of both and placebo in patients with chronic sciatica. In this trial, antidepressants, opioid analgesics, and a combination of both had no significant effect compared with placebo in the immediate term for disability or leg or back pain.

### Effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for patients with acute and subacute sciatica: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^18707fb1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for adults with acute and subacute sciatica. DESIGN: Intervention systematic review with network meta-analysis LITERATURE SEARCH: Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched up to June 7, 2024. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of nonsurgical interventions in adults (aged 18 years or older) with acute or subacute sciatica (less than 3 months) were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and physical function at different follow-up time points. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, mental health, and low back pain intensity. Two reviewers independently conducted screening, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment. Random-effects network meta-analysis was conducted, and confidence was evaluated by the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) method. RESULTS: Forty randomized controlled trials (5381 participants) were included. At short-term follow-up, compared to sham treatment/placebo, the most efficacious interventions for leg pain intensity were NSAIDs + physical therapy modalities, antibiotics, and antidepressants. Music therapy was effective for improving physical function at short-term follow-up. At long-term follow-up, steroids had a significant effect in reducing leg pain and improving physical function. No intervention showed a significant increase in adverse events compared with sham-treatment/placebo. All the evidence was based on very low confidence, primarily due to within-study bias and imprecision in effect estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Very low-confidence evidence supported some nonsurgical interventions for improving leg pain intensity and physical function in people with acute and subacute sciatica.

### How effective are physiotherapy interventions in treating people with sciatica? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^5745a379]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review, including 18 studies and 2699 participants with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica suggests that physiotherapy interventions are only better than minimal interventions in reducing pain at long-term time points. Physiotherapy interventions are less effective than substantial interventions (e.g. surgery) in reducing pain at medium term and disability at short- and medium-term time points. However, heterogeneity was considerable in most meta-analyses, and confidence intervals were large, indicating substantial uncertainly surrounding the precision of these estimates. The favourable results for substantial intervention for pain in medium term and disability in short term did not persist following sensitivity analyses removing studies with high risk of bias. The currently available literature therefore provides insufficient evidence to support strong recommendations for physiotherapy interventions in the treatment of people with sciatica.

This systematic review reflects a wider collective inability to show significant benefit of non-surgical treatments for people with sciatica. Pharmacological options fail to demonstrate effects beyond placebo, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, anti-convulsants, anti-depressants or opioids. Epidural cortisone injections have small effect sizes and short-term benefits. These findings are disappointing given the clear need for effective conservative interventions voiced by patients.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^11b42a6c]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The clinical syndrome of sciatica has been recognised since ancient times. Currently believed to arise from a disorder of the nerve root, the syndrome is known by a range of synonyms such as lumbosacral radicular syndrome, nerve root compromise, nerve root pain, and nerve root entrapment or irritation. Sciatica is considered to be a prognostic indicator of poor outcome among patients with low back painwith a substantial proportion continuing to have persistent pain for two years or longer. The annual prevalence of sciatica is estimated to be between 14%and 2%. While there are a range of definitions of sciatica, the key clinical features that can help clinicians to distinguish it from non-specific low back pain include unilateral leg pain that is worse than the low back pain, pain radiating below the knee, presence of numbness or pins and needles in a dermatomal distribution, positive results on a straight leg raise test, and weakness or reflex changes, or both, in a myotomal distribution.

Analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs are often prescribed for patients with sciatica. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of sciatica are about five times more likely to take drugs than those with low back pain only. Drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), skeletal muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. While guidelines provide clear and generally consistent recommendations for the prescription of drugs for non-specific low back pain, this is not the case for sciatica.

At present the efficacy and tolerability of commonly prescribed analgesic and adjuvant drugs for the management of patients with sciatica has not been established. The problem is that there are no reviews that specifically focus on these drugs that are used in primary care to manage sciatica. Because most guidelines recommend a course of conservative care before surgery is considered, it is imperative to understand what best practice conservative care should entail. In this systematic review we determined the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care (orally, topically, or parentally) in the management of patients with sciatica when compared with other treatment options or no treatment.

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and… [^b8126712]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The best evidence comes from several well-designed and adequately powered randomized trials. In the first, 565 children in the United Kingdom with mild to moderate sore throat were randomized to oral dexamethasone, 10 mg, or placebo. 5 The only benefit was a small reduction in symptoms at two days, but no improvements at other times or for other outcomes. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction. This was true even for patients with wheezing on initial presentation.

Regarding back pain, a study randomized 269 adults with sciatica to a 15-day course of prednisone, 60 mg once daily tapering to 20 mg once daily, or placebo, and found no reduction in pain, function, or other outcomes. 7 However, adverse effects such as insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite were more common in the prednisone group. Thus, the best evidence to date does not support a significant benefit for corticosteroids in patients with cough, sore throat, or back pain. However, there may be harms. A recent study identified 1. 5 million U. S. adults who had been continuously enrolled in a health insurance plan for two years. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone.

The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies. A short course of oral corticosteroids is appropriate for many patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and for selected patients with peritonsillar abscess, 8 severe pharyngitis, 9 and community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 10, 11 However, widespread use of corticosteroids in patients with non-pneumonia lower respiratory tract infection, nonsevere sore throat, or low back pain is inappropriate and not worth the risk of rare but potentially serious harms.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections in the management of sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2c459eeb]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Existing guidelines and systematic reviews provide inconsistent recommendations on epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica. Key limitations of existing reviews are the inclusion of trials with active controls of unknown efficacy and failure to provide an estimate of the size of the treatment effect.

Purpose

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica compared with placebo.

Data Sources

International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections in participants with sciatica.

Data Extraction

Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Leg pain, back pain, and disability were converted to common scales from 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst possible pain or disability). Thresholds for clinically important change in the range of 10 to 30 have been proposed for these outcomes. Effects were calculated for short-term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) follow-up.

Data Synthesis

Data were pooled with a random-effects model, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used in summary conclusions. Twenty-five published reports (23 trials) were included. The pooled results showed a significant, although small, effect of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo for leg pain in the short term (mean difference, -6.2 [95% CI, -9.4 to -3.0]) and also for disability in the short term (mean difference, -3.1 [CI, -5.0 to -1.2]). The long-term pooled effects were smaller and not statistically significant. The overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE classification was rated as high.

Limitation

The review included only English-language trials and could not incorporate dichotomous outcome measures into the analysis.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests that epidural corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica. The small size of the treatment effects, however, raises questions about the clinical utility of this procedure in the target population.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### The efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of acute sciatica… [^80e9c684]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that the use of oral steroids to treat acute sciatica will speed patients' recovery as measured by: changes in physical findings, rates of return to work and activities of daily living, pain and disability assessment scores, and decreases in the use of narcotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and in the need for epidural injection or surgical intervention. Randomization and Blinding Once the diagnosis of acute sciatica had been confirmed, subjects were randomized to receive either a nine day tapering course of prednisone or placebo capsules. The principle investigator and research nurse were blinded as to group assignment. All subjects received current standard therapy for sciatica, including: a NSAID, narcotics if needed, activity as tolerated, and a referral for physical therapy.

All patients received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication and narcotic medication if needed for pain control. Patients randomized to the study group received tapering course of prednisone: 60 mg for three days, 40 mg for three days, and 20 mg for three days. Patients randomized to the control group received capsules identical in appearance to the prednisone capsules but containing an inert filler substance. Patients were questioned at each visit to determine whether they were taking their study medication and whether they were still taking non-steroidal or narcotic medication. A separate analysis of pain level ratings, narcotic and NSAID use, and return to work rates, was performed for this subgroup with the thought that they probably represented patients with the most severe nerve root inflammation and that the effects of oral prednisone might be more or less obvious in this group. Statistical power analysis.

Statistical power analysis was performed with the primary outcome of return to work within 14 days of the intervention. The proportion of the control group returning to work was hypothesized to be 50%. Oral prednisone was hypothesized to have a 50% treatment effect, resulting in a 75% rate of return to work within 14 days. Using chi square with continuity correction, statistical power analysis found that a sample size of 80 per subgroup would have a power of 88% to find this difference statistically significant at p <. 05.

Objective To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of analgesic and adjuvant pain drugs typically administered in primary care for the management of patients with sciatica.

Design Systematic review.

Data source International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and LILACS.

Study selection Randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and tolerability of drugs versus placebo or other treatment for sciatica.

Data extraction Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the PEDro scale. Pain and disability outcomes were converted to a common 0 to 100 scale. Data were pooled with a random effects model, and the GRADE approach was used in summary conclusions.

Results Twenty three published reports met the inclusion criteria. The evidence to judge the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and opioid analgesics ranged from moderate to low quality. Most of the pooled estimates did not favour the active treatment over placebo. The pooled results of two trials of corticosteroids (mean difference in overall and leg pain −12.2, 95% confidence interval −20.9 to −3.4) and a single trial of the anticonvulsant gabapentin for chronic sciatica (mean difference in overall pain relief −26.6, −38.3 to −14.9) showed some benefits but only in the short term. The median rate of adverse events was 17% (interquartile range 10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. Trial limitations included failure to use validated outcome measures, lack of long term follow-up, and small sample size.

Conclusions As the existing evidence from clinical trials is of low quality, the efficacy and tolerability of drugs commonly prescribed for the management of sciatica in primary care is unclear.

### Acupuncture therapy for sciatica: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis [^bd2e52b8]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica is a neuropathic pain syndrome resulting from inflammatory injury or mechanical compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots (L4–S1). It typically presents as radiating pain from the buttocks down the leg along nerve distribution and may be accompanied by sensory disturbances and motor dysfunction. Although symptoms may resolve spontaneously in some cases, only 55% of individuals with sciatica experience meaningful clinical improvement within 1 year of onset. Approximately 34% of affected individuals develop chronic pain lasting beyond 2 years, which may lead to neurological deficits or motor impairments and severely reduce patients' quality of life. In addition, the financial burden of long-term treatment further complicates disease management.

Conservative therapies, such as functional exercises and spinal manipulation, remain the first-line approach for managing sciatica symptoms. However, the effectiveness of conservative treatment remains controversial, as several meta-analyses have reported no significant improvement in sciatica symptoms. Commonly prescribed analgesics — including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, and corticosteroids — are frequently associated with adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, and palpitations, which often compromise treatment adherence. Moreover, several studies have found that these medications offer limited benefits in reducing pain or disability. Given these limitations, there is a pressing need to identify safe, effective, and affordable adjunctive therapies.

Acupuncture, a core modality in traditional Chinese medicine, involves the insertion of fine needles into specific acupoints to elicit the "Deqi" sensation, to contribute to therapeutic effects. Its potential efficacy in sciatica has been preliminarily demonstrated in several clinical studies. A recent high-quality trial reported that, compared with sham acupuncture, acupuncture significantly improved treatment effectiveness, reduced pain intensity, increased pain threshold, and enhanced functional outcomes in patients with sciatica. Despite growing evidence supporting acupuncture, inconsistencies across studies highlight the need to comprehensively evaluate its reliability, limitations, and methodological shortcomings to inform future research. A prior evidence review conducted in 2015lacked methodological depth due to the limited use of evaluation tools. Since the emergence of new studies, an updated and more rigorous synthesis is warranted.

Therefore, this overview aims to evaluate the current body of evidence on acupuncture for sciatica from a multidimensional perspective, incorporating assessment of methodological quality, reporting standards, and study overlap. A secondary meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize efficacy outcomes. The goal is to identify limitations in existing research and provide clearer guidance for future studies and clinical decision-making.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: an abridged cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^0663443b]. Spine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic with meta-analysis OBJECTIVES.: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection in reducing leg pain and disability in patients with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Conservative treatments, including pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, are typically the first treatment options for sciatica but the evidence to support their use is limited. The overall quality of evidence found by previous systematic reviews varies between moderate and high, which suggests that future trials may change the conclusions. New placebo-controlled randomized trials have been published recently which highlights the importance of an updated systematic review.

Methods

The searches were performed without language restrictions in the following databases from 2012 to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and trial registers. We included placebo-controlled randomized trials investigating epidural corticosteroid injections in patients with sciatica. The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and disability. The secondary outcomes were adverse events, overall pain, and back pain intensity. We grouped similar trials according to outcome measures and their respective follow-up time points. Short-term follow-up (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months) was considered the primary follow-up time point due to the expected mechanism of action of epidural corticosteroid injection. Weighted mean differences (MDs) and risk ratios (RRs) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach and conducted the analyses using random effects.

Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) providing data for a total of 2470 participants with sciatica, an increase of six trials when compared to the previous review. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably more effective than placebo in reducing short-term leg pain (MD -4.93, 95% CI -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0–100 scale), short-term disability (MD -4.18, 95% CI: -6.04 to -2.17 on a 0–100 scale) and may be slightly more effective in reducing short-term overall pain (MD -9.35, 95% CI -14.05 to -4.65 on a 0–100 scale). There were mostly minor adverse events (i.e., without hospitalization) after epidural corticosteroid injections and placebo injections without difference between groups (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 0.91–1.42). The quality of evidence was at best moderate mostly due to problems with trial design and inconsistency.

Conclusion

A review of 25 placebo-controlled trials provides moderate-quality evidence that epidural corticosteroid injections are effective, although the effects are small and short-term. There is uncertainty on safety due to very low-quality evidence.

### Periradicular infiltration for sciatica: a randomized controlled trial [^cbe4f4b7]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind trial was conducted.

Objectives

To test the efficacy of periradicular corticosteroid injection for sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

The efficacy of epidural corticosteroids for sciatica is controversial. Periradicular infiltration is a targeted technique, but there are no randomized controlled trials of its efficacy.

Methods

In this study 160 consecutive, eligible patients with sciatica who had unilateral symptoms of 1 to 6 months duration, and who never underwent surgery were randomized for double-blind injection with methylprednisolone bupivacaine combination or saline. Objective and self-reported outcome parameters and costs were recorded at baseline, at 2 and 4 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and at 1 year.

Results

Recovery was better in the steroid group at 2 weeks for leg pain (P = 0.02), straight leg raising (P = 0.03), lumbar flexion (P = 0.05), and patient satisfaction (P = 0.03). Back pain was significantly lower in the saline group at 3 and 6 months (P = 0.03 and 0.002, respectively), and leg pain at 6 months (13.5, P = 0.02). Sick leaves and medical costs were similar for both treatments, except for cost of therapy visits and drugs at 4 weeks, which were in favor of the steroid injection (P = 0.05 and 0.005, respectively). By 1 year, 18 patients in the steroid group and 15 in the saline group underwent surgery.

Conclusions

Improvement during the follow-up period was found in both the methylprednisolone and saline groups. The combination of methylprednisolone and bupivacaine seems to have a short-term effect, but at 3 and 6 months, the steroid group seems to experience a "rebound" phenomenon.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: a randomised, double blind, controlled clinical trial [^7660a3dd]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica.

Methods

Three epidural injections (two day intervals) of 2 mL prednisolone acetate (50 mg) or 2 mL isotonic saline were administered to patients with sciatica presumably due to a disk herniation lasting 15–180 days. Self evaluation was the main judgment criterion at day 20. Patients who recovered or showed marked improvement were considered as success. Pain measured by VAS, the SLR test, Schober's test, Dallas pain questionnaire, and the Roland-Morris index were evaluated at days 0, 5, 20, and 35. Only analgesics were authorised, patients requiring non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before day 20 were considered as failure.

Results

42 patients were included in the control group (CG), 43 in the steroid group (SG). On an intention to treat analysis 15/42 (36%) in the CG and 22/43 (51%) in the SG (p = 0.15) were considered as success (difference 15.5%, 95% CI (-5.4 to 36.3)). Among the 48 failures, 14 patients (6 CG, 8 SG) required NSAIDs, 3 (2 CG, 1 SG) required surgery, and 7 (3 CG, 4 SG) other treatments. On analysis according to protocol, in 74 remaining patients 12/35 (34%) in the CG and 22/39 (56%) in the SG (p = 0.057) were considered as success (difference 22.1%, 95% CI (0.0 to 44.2)). For all secondary end points intragroup improvement with time was significant, but intergroup differences were not.

Conclusion

The efficacy of isotonic saline administered epidurally for sciatica cannot be excluded, but epidural steroid injections provide no additional improvement.

### Do MRI findings identify patients with low back pain or sciatica who respond better to particular interventions? A systematic review [^3176962c]. European Spine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can reveal a range of degenerative findings and anatomical abnormalities; however, the clinical importance of these remains uncertain and controversial. We aimed to investigate if the presence of MRI findings identifies patients with low back pain (LBP) or sciatica who respond better to particular interventions.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched. We included RCTs investigating MRI findings as treatment effect modifiers for patients with LBP or sciatica. We excluded studies with specific diseases as the cause of LBP. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria of the Cochrane Back Review Group. Each MRI finding was examined for its individual capacity for effect modification.

Results

Eight published trials met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of trials was inconsistent. Substantial variability in MRI findings, treatments and outcomes across the eight trials prevented pooling of data. Patients with Modic type 1 when compared with patients with Modic type 2 had greater improvements in function when treated by Diprospan (steroid) injection, compared with saline. Patients with central disc herniation when compared with patients without central disc herniation had greater improvements in pain when treated by surgery, compared with rehabilitation.

Conclusions

Although individual trials suggested that some MRI findings might be effect modifiers for specific interventions, none of these interactions were investigated in more than a single trial. High quality, adequately powered trials investigating MRI findings as effect modifiers are essential to determine the clinical importance of MRI findings in LBP and sciatica (

### The efficacy of oral steroids in the treatment of acute sciatica… [^e73fe7ac]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

We hypothesize that the use of oral steroids to treat acute sciatica will speed patients' recovery as measured by: changes in physical findings, rates of return to work and activities of daily living, pain and disability assessment scores, and decreases in the use of narcotic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and in the need for epidural injection or surgical intervention.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain [^8074e303]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lumbosacral radicular pain (commonly called sciatica) is a syndrome involving patients who report radiating leg pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections deliver a corticosteroid dose into the epidural space, with the aim of reducing the local inflammatory process and, consequently, relieving the symptoms of lumbosacral radicular pain. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review published in Annals of Internal Medicine in 2012. Some placebo-controlled trials have been published recently, which highlights the importance of updating the previous review.

Objectives

To investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injection on pain and disability in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases without language limitations up to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Back and Neck group trial register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and two trial registers. We also performed citation tracking of included studies and relevant systematic reviews in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included studies that compared epidural corticosteroid injections of any corticosteroid drug to placebo injections in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. We accepted all three anatomical approaches (caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal) to delivering corticosteroids into the epidural space. We considered trials that included a placebo treatment as delivery of an inert substance (i.e. one with no pharmacologic activity), an innocuous substance (e.g. normal saline solution), or a pharmacologically active substance but not one considered to provide sustained benefit (e.g. local anaesthetic), either into the epidural space (i.e. to mimic epidural corticosteroid injection) or adjacent spinal tissue (i.e. subcutaneous, intramuscular, or interspinous tissue). We also included trials in which a local anaesthetic with a short duration of action was used as a placebo and injected together with corticosteroid in the intervention group.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed the screening, data extraction, and 'Risk of bias' assessments. In case of insufficient information, we contacted the authors of the original studies or estimated the data. We grouped the outcome data into four time points of assessment: immediate (≤ 2 weeks), short term (> 2 weeks but ≤ 3 months), intermediate term (> 3 months but < 12 months), and long term (≥ 12 months). We assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome and time point using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 clinical trials (from 29 publications) investigating the effects of epidural corticosteroid injections compared to placebo in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. The included studies provided data for a total of 2470 participants with a mean age ranging from 37.3 to 52.8 years. Seventeen studies included participants with lumbosacral radicular pain with a diagnosis based on clinical assessment and 15 studies included participants with mixed duration of symptoms. The included studies were conducted mainly in North America and Europe. Fifteen studies did not report funding sources, five studies reported not receiving funding, and five reported receiving funding from a non-profit or government source. Eight trials reported data on pain intensity, 12 reported data on disability, and eight studies reported data on adverse events. The duration of the follow-up assessments ranged from 12 hours to 1 year. We considered eight trials to be of high quality because we judged them as having low risk of bias in four out of the five bias domains. We identified one ongoing trial in a trial registry. Epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing leg pain at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -4.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.77 to -1.09 on a 0 to 100 scale; 8 trials, n = 949; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). For disability, epidural corticosteroid injections were probably slightly more effective compared to placebo in reducing disability at short-term follow-up (MD -4.18, 95% CI -6.04 to -2.17, on a 0 to 100 scale; 12 trials, n = 1367; moderate-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias)). The treatment effects are small, however, and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. MD lower than 10%). Most trials provided insufficient information on how or when adverse events were assessed (immediate or short-term follow-up) and only reported adverse drug reactions - that is, adverse events that the trialists attributed to the study treatment. We are very uncertain that epidural corticosteroid injections make no difference compared to placebo injection in the frequency of minor adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.42; 8 trials, n = 877; very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision)). Minor adverse events included increased pain during or after the injection, non-specific headache, post-dural puncture headache, irregular periods, accidental dural puncture, thoracic pain, non-local rash, sinusitis, vasovagal response, hypotension, nausea, and tinnitus. One study reported a major drug reaction for one patient on anticoagulant therapy who had a retroperitoneal haematoma as a complication of the corticosteroid injection.

Authors' Conclusions

This study found that epidural corticosteroid injections probably slightly reduced leg pain and disability at short-term follow-up in people with lumbosacral radicular pain. In addition, no minor or major adverse events were reported at short-term follow-up after epidural corticosteroid injections or placebo injection. Although the current review identified additional clinical trials, the available evidence still provides only limited support for the use of epidural corticosteroid injections in people with lumbosacral radicular pain as the treatment effects are small, mainly evident at short-term follow-up and may not be considered clinically important by patients and clinicians (i.e. mean difference lower than 10%). According to GRADE, the quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, suggesting that further studies are likely to play an important role in clarifying the efficacy and tolerability of this treatment. We recommend that further trials should attend to methodological features such as appropriate allocation concealment and blinding of care providers to minimise the potential for biased estimates of treatment and harmful effects.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^95c1891b]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Limitations

This review has limitations. Although we included a larger number of trials compared with previous reviews, the certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. High crossover rates from the non-surgical arm to the surgical arm (ranged from 30% to 54%) occurred in many trials, which means the effects of surgery on clinical outcomes could have been underestimated, particularly in the later time points. As mentioned previously, the included trials are underpowered and inappropriately designed to effectively evaluate adverse event occurrence.

Reporting of non-surgical comparators was generally poor, with most trials not describing what types of treatments participants received, who provided these treatments, how they were provided, and how much treatment they received. For example, the SPORT trial reported the type of non-surgical treatment received by participants (physical therapy (73% of patients), epidural injections (50%), and medical treatments (eg, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; > 50%) without specifying other details. Similarly Bailey and colleagues' trial only reported that education, activity and exercise, oral analgesics, physiotherapy, and epidural glucocorticoid injection were used in the non-surgical group, without providing specific data on the proportion of patients receiving each of these non-surgical treatments. Furthermore, non-surgical treatments varied considerably within and between countries. For example, the use of epidural steroid injections varies widely among different US states, as do referrals to physiotherapy between Denmark and the Netherlands. The two included Chinese trials used traditional Chinese medicine in the non-surgical group, which lacks evidence supporting its effectiveness. In our review, we grouped all non-surgical interventions together, however, these interventions were not only poorly detailed but also highly heterogeneous. Therefore, questions remain as to whether non-surgical treatment provided in the control arms of many trials represents a suboptimal approach to treating sciatica, in addition to the ramifications that this uncertainty would have on its comparison to discectomy. However, evidence is scarce in supporting many non-surgical treatments for sciatica.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^a0427140]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results

Figure 1 outlines the flow of trials through the review. The initial electronic database search identified 2460 potential studies of interest. After screening citations by title and abstract, we considered 197 potentially eligible articles for inclusion and retrieved full articles. We included 23 published reports(reporting 24 different clinical trials, as onereported on two trials). Three trials reported in previous systematic reviewswere not included in this review because of unclear randomisation.

Fig 1 Selection process of trials examining pain relief in patients with sciatica

The included trials investigated six different classes of drugs: NSAIDs, antidepressants, corticosteroids, opioid analgesics, muscle relaxants, and anticonvulsants. The drugs investigated in the included trials were administered orally in 16 trialsand parenterally in five trials (four trialsinvestigated intramuscular injections and one trialinvestigated intravenous infusions). Three other trialsused mixed administration of a starting intramuscular dose and subsequent oral doses. One study compared oral versus parenteral administration. Table 2shows the characteristics of the included trials, and table 3presents details of methodological quality.

*Dreisser et al 28 reported on two clinical trials.

Duration of symptoms varied a lot across studies (table 2). Six trials specifically investigated patients with chronic symptomsand eight trials included patients with acute symptoms. In six trials, however, patients had mixed duration of symptoms; in two trials duration was not specified; and in two trials patients were reported to have acute symptoms but no information regarding duration was provided. Regarding the definition of sciatica, 15 trials used a definition based on clinical assessment alone, whereas nine trials also required concordant imaging evidence. Pooling of data via meta-analysis was possible only for comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo in pain intensity at immediate follow-up and for corticosteroids versus placebo in pain intensity at immediate and short term follow-up. Table 2 also presents the number of studies comparing each class of drug and control.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^6090c109]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits over non-surgical care reduced over time. Discectomy might be an option for people who require rapid leg pain relief and disability improvement, when the benefits outweigh the risks and costs related to surgery.

### Role of neuraxial steroids in interventional pain management [^cea7263c]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical introduction of cortisone in 1949 revolutionized medical care of patients with a host of diseases. Soon after that, the first use of steroids in epidural injections was described in 1952 and 1953. A variety of corticosteroid agents (hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone, betamethasone) have been applied neuraxially to treat spinal pain and other types of painful conditions. The utilization of neuraxial steroids had its empirical beginning in the 1950s and 60's. When steroid administration seemingly was effective for management of low back pain and sciatica, the concept was adapted for other types of neural blockade, including facet joint injections. It is postulated that corticosteroids reduce inflammation by inhibiting either the synthesis or release of a number of pro-inflammatory substances and by causing a reversible local anesthetic effect. Multiple complications of corticosteroid administration are two-fold: those resulting from withdrawal of steroids and those resulting from continued use of large doses. These include neural toxicity, separation of pituitary-adrenal axis, weight gain, osteoporosis, as well as many other complications. However, a review of the literature on epidural steroids or other types of neuraxial blockade mentions very few complications that can be directly attributed either to the chemistry or the pharmacology of the steroids, except for reports of adrenal suppression. This review describes various aspects of neuraxial steroids including historical concepts, mechanism of action, pharmacological aspects, side effects, complications and their role in treatment.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^9b1727d9]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — comparative effectiveness of epidural injections for sciatica and chronic pain: A network meta-analysis of management strategies for sciatica reviewing 122 relevant studies and 21 treatment strategies showed a statistically significant improvement with epidural injections, and a comparative network meta-analysis found that epidural steroid with local anesthetic was superior to epidural steroid without local anesthetic and to intramuscular steroid; subcutaneous antitumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to epidural local spinal anesthetic at reducing pain, but epidural steroids produced superior reductions in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores compared to subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported after review of 73 trials that adding corticosteroids to local anesthetic had only small benefits with a potential for harm and no meaningful improvement in pain scores or duration of pain relief, and the authors recommended that clinical decisions should consider the potential for harm with steroids and the therapeutic benefit by the local anesthetic alone; additionally, a prior systematic review of 4 randomized trials was rated very low in methodologic quality, and despite numerous systematic reviews there have not been guidelines systematically developed to assess clinical and cost effectiveness of epidural injections, including percutaneous adhesiolysis, in managing spinal pain.

### Early surgery for sciatica [^18bc6f3e]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for sciatica recommend a stepped care approach starting with conservative management (ie, physiotherapy and medication), escalating to steroid injections, then surgery when non-surgical treatment has failed or when major radicular weakness is present. Unfortunately, evidence on the effectiveness of both non-surgicaland surgical options is uncertain.

In a linked paper, Liu and colleagues (doi:) report a methodologically sound and balanced systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 randomised clinical trials evaluating the evidence of surgical care for people with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation. Their meta-analysis suggests that discectomy is statistically significantly superior to non-surgical treatment in reducing leg pain and disability. However, effects were moderate at best (10–20 point reduction on a 100 point scale), but mostly small (5–10 point reduction). The benefits of discectomy were only evident in the short to medium term, with no clinically meaningful effects beyond 12 months.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^d455c47a]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — intravenous glucocorticoids: VAS sciatic leg improvement of 5.7 cm occurred on day one, but no durable benefit was observed at day 30 with a single intravenous bolus of glucocorticoids for any outcome, and a glucocorticoid bolus had no effect on functioning or objective signs of radicular irritation. This study provides Level I therapeutic evidence that a single intravenous infusion of glucocorticoids provides only temporary (three days) relief of pain, with the authors concluding that a single intravenous pulse of glucocorticoid provides a small and transient improvement in sciatic leg pain.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for sciatica [^49304aeb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of sciatica. A previous Cochrane review on the efficacy of NSAIDs summarised findings for acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and sciatica. This is an update of the original review (2008) focusing on people suffering from sciatica.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of NSAIDs in pain reduction, overall improvement, and reported side effects in people with sciatica.

Search Methods

We performed electronic searches up to 24 June 2015 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and two trials registers. We searched reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews on the topics for additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (double-blind, single-blind, and open-label) that assessed the efficacy of NSAIDs in sciatica. We included all trials that compared NSAIDs to placebo, to other NSAIDs, or to other medication. Additional interventions were allowed if there was a clear contrast for the treatment with NSAIDs in the trial.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. Where feasible we calculated pooled results using Review Manager 5.3. We reported pain relief outcomes using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI to report global improvement of treatment, adverse effects, and additional medication. We performed a meta-analysis if possible. We assessed level of evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 10 trials reported in 9 publications (N = 1651). Only one trial out of 10 was assessed at low risk of bias. Five trials used the currently recommended daily dose for the drug, and two trials used lower daily doses available over the counter. Three trials investigated NSAIDs no longer approved for human use. The follow-up duration was short in all studies but one. Three trials (n = 918) compared the effects of NSAIDs to those of placebo on pain reduction. The pooled mean difference showed comparable pain reduction (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100) in the NSAIDs and placebo groups (MD -4.56, 95% CI -11.11 to 1.99). Heterogeneity was high (I² = 82%), and the quality of the evidence was very low. When we excluded one trial with a short follow-up of eight hours, the mean difference further decreased (MD -0.09, 95% CI -9.89 to 9.71). Three trials (n = 753) compared NSAIDs to placebo regarding global improvement. We found low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are more effective than placebo with a risk ratio of 1.14 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). One trial (n = 214) studied the effect of NSAIDs on disability, finding very low-quality evidence that NSAIDs are no more effective than placebo on disability. Four trials (n = 967) comparing NSAIDs to placebo reported adverse effects, with low-quality evidence that the risk for adverse effects is higher in the NSAID group than in the placebo group (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.93). The adverse effects reported in this review are consistent with those previously reported in the literature.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated systematic review including 10 trials evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs versus placebo or other drugs in people with sciatica reports low- to very low-level evidence using the GRADE criteria. The efficacy of NSAIDs for pain reduction was not significant. NSAIDs showed a better global improvement compared to placebo. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the level of evidence according to the GRADE classification was very low for the outcome pain reduction and low for global improvement due to small study samples, inconsistent results, imprecision, and a high risk of bias in the included trials. While the trials included in the analysis were not powered to detect potential rare side effects, we found an increased risk for side effects in the short-term NSAIDs use. As NSAIDs are frequently prescribed, the risk-benefit ratio of prescribing the drug needs to be considered.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^69bd0317]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — systemic corticosteroids (Recommendation 28): For patients with low back pain, with or without radicular symptoms, we suggest against systemic corticosteroids (oral or intramuscular injection) (Weak against | Not reviewed, Amended). The discussion notes that systemic corticosteroids for acute or chronic LBP with or without radiculopathy are not recommended and that most trials in a systematic review showed no significant improvements in pain or function across dosing regimens. One randomized controlled trial using a 15 day course of oral prednisone (five days each of 60 mg, 40 mg, 20 mg) versus placebo showed a statistically significant improvement in disability and favored prednisone for the mental health component of an SF-36, with no difference for the physical component; study quality was determined to be low, and there is inconclusive evidence that corticosteroids decrease healthcare utilization.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of lumbar transforaminal epidural injection with particulate and nonparticulate corticosteroids in lumbar radiating pain [^79f7cf77]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections are procedures often utilized in the treatment of low back pain associated with radicular pain. Particulate steroids have been known to play a role in embolism. It is, unknown whether nonparticulate steroids are as effective as particulate steroids. To investigate the effect of an epidural steroid injection on back pain, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial comparing nonparticulate steroid with particulate steroid to treat lumbar disc herniation.

Design

One hundred-six patients were randomized to receive lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections (N = 53) with either dexamethasone 7.5 mg, or with triamcinolone acetate 40 mg (N = 53). Measurement were taken before treatment and one month after treatment using a visual analog scale, short McGill pain questionnaire, and revised Oswertry Back Disability Index.

Results

There was a statistically significant difference in the visual analog score between those treated with dexamethasone and those given triamcinolone. The two groups did not differ significantly on the McGill Pain Questionnaire, or the Oswestry Disability Index before and after treatment.

Conclusion

In this study, dexamethasone and triamcinolone treatments were shown to have different effects on low back pain with sciatica, with triamcinolone being more effective than dexamethsone in lumbar radiculopathy.

### Role of caudal epidural injections in the management of chronic low back pain [^7b4a61c5]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Caudal epidural administration of corticosteroids is one of the commonly used interventions in managing chronic low back pain. Reports of the effectiveness of all types of epidural steroids have varied from 18% to 90%. Sicard, a radiologist, was the first to describe injection of dilute solutions of cocaine through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space in 1901, to treat patients suffering from severe, intractable sciatic pain or lumbago. This was followed by an explosion of reports and evolving interest in caudal epidural steroids with two additional reports in 1901 and numerous other reports over the years. The philosophy of epidural steroid injections is based on the premise that the corticosteroid delivered into the epidural space attains higher local concentrations over an inflamed nerve root and will be more effective than a steroid administered either orally or by intramuscular injection. The clinical effectiveness evaluations fill the literature with various types of reports including randomized clinical trials, prospective trials, retrospective studies, case reports, and meta-analyses. Evidence from all types of evaluations with regards to the clinical and cost-effectiveness of caudal epidural injections is encouraging. This review discusses various aspects of the role of caudal epidural injections in the management of chronic low back pain, including pathophysiology of low back pain, indications, clinical effectiveness and complications.

### Systematic review of therapeutic lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections [^9a9e9b6f]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Epidural injection of corticosteroids is one of the most commonly used interventions in managing chronic spinal pain. The transforaminal route to the lumbar epidural space for steroid injection has gained rapid and widespread acceptance for the treatment of lumbar and leg pain. However, there are few well-designed randomized, controlled studies to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections. The role and value of transforaminal lumbar epidural steroid injections is still questioned.

Study Design

A systematic review of transforaminal epidural injection therapy for low back and lower extremity pain.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of transforaminal lumbar epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar (low-back) and sciatica (leg) pain.

Methods

The available literature of lumbar transforaminal epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain was reviewed. The quality assessment and clinical relevance criteria utilized were the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group criteria as utilized for interventional techniques for randomized trials and the criteria developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria for observational studies. The level of evidence was classified as Level I, II, or III based on the quality of evidence developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Data sources included relevant literature of the English language identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to November 2008, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was pain relief (short-term relief = up to 6 months and long-term > 6 months). Secondary outcome measures were improvement in functional status, psychological status, return to work, and reduction in opioid intake.

Results

The indicated evidence is Level II-1 for short-term relief and Level II-2 for long-term relief in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain.

Limitations

The limitations of this systematic review include the paucity of literature.

Conclusion

The indicated evidence for transforaminal lumbar epidural steroid injections is Level II-1 for short-term relief and Level II-2 for long-term improvement in the management of lumbar nerve root and low back pain.

### Efficacy and safety of acupuncture and acupuncture-combined therapies in the treatment of sciatica caused by lumbar disc herniation: a network meta-analysis [^0d6a7cb1]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a prevalent spinal disorder primarily featuring radicular pain, sensory disturbances, and weakness in one or more lumbosacral nerve root distributions. Sciatica, among the most common complications of LDH, typically refers to pain radiating from the buttock down the lower limb as a result of sciatic nerve irritation. Among its various etiologies, approximately 90% of sciatica cases are attributed to nerve root compression caused by herniated lumbar discs. The lifetime prevalence of sciatica is estimated to range between 13% and 30%, with annual incidence peaking around the age of 40 and rarely occurring before the age of 20. Sciatica can lead to significant pain and disability, placing a substantial burden on both affected individuals and society. Conservative treatment remains the first-line approach for most patients, with symptom relief commonly achieved through non-invasive measures such as simple analgesics and physical therapy, while only 5% to 10% of patients with intractable sciatica ultimately require surgical intervention.

At present, non-surgical treatment remains the first-line approach for managing this condition. Among pharmacologic interventions, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide short-term symptomatic relief. Glucocorticoids are also employed. Nevertheless, their mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood and are often accompanied by significant adverse effects. Gabapentin and pregabalin are also commonly prescribed for LDH-associated pain. However, gabapentin has a short half-life (5–7 hours), carries a risk of misuse, and demonstrates dose-dependent efficacy. Pregabalin, while effective in short-term analgesia, shows limited benefit in long-term pain control and is associated with neurological side effects. Therefore, there is a pressing need for therapeutic modalities that are minimally resource-intensive, have fewer side effects, and yield a sustained total effective rate. Acupuncture, as a non-surgical therapeutic modality, has shown considerable promise in alleviating both acute and chronic symptoms of sciatica. It is increasingly recognized for its potential advantages, including minimal invasiveness, a favorable safety profile, and sustained efficacy. Moreover, certain studies suggest that acupuncture may even surpass conventional pharmacotherapy in terms of total effective rate.

### Efficacy of steroid and nonsteroid caudal epidural injections for low back pain and sciatica: a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^319c76c5]. Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, double-blind, randomized, case-control study.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of caudal epidural injections (CEI) containing steroid versus nonsteroid preparations when treating patients suffering from low back pain (LBP) and sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

Literature seems to be deprived of well-designed randomized, controlled studies that evaluate the effectiveness of CEI in the treatment of chronic LBP; hence the value of CEI remains still the subject of controversy.

Methods

Patients suffering from severe chronic LBP and sciatica were randomly allocated into 2 groups. Steroid-group's patients (n = 93) underwent CEI containing 12 mL of xylocaine 2% and 1 mL of betamethasone dipropionate and betamethasone phosphate (2 + 5) mg/dL. Water for Injection (WFI)-group's patients (n = 90) underwent CEI containing 12 mL of xylocaine 2% and 8 mL of WFI. Both groups were statistically comparable as far as their demographic data and the cause and duration of symptoms were concerned. Patients answered the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire and underwent physical examination, before and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year following the CEI.

Results

Symptoms improved in 132 patients (72.1%) following CEI. The mean Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire score of steroid-group's patients was statistically significant lower than that of the WFI-group at all postinjection re-evaluations. Patients receiving steroid CEI experienced faster relief during the first postinjection week. The Straight Leg Rising test improved in both groups following CEI; this improvement was faster among steroid-group's patients. Fifty-one patients (27.8%), noticed no improvement 1 week post-CEI and underwent a second CEI (with the same preparation) 7 to 14 days later. Nineteen of them reported improvement; 32 (steroid-group:13, WFI-group:19) did not respond well and underwent operative decompression (n = 15) or spinal fusion (n = 17).

Conclusion

CEI containing local anesthetic and steroids or WFI seems to be effective when treating patients with LBP and sciatica. CEI containing steroid preparations demonstrated better and faster efficacy.

### A multicentre randomized controlled trial of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica: the WEST study [^19b660ac]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and predictors of response to lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections (ESI) in patients with sciatica. We performed a 12-month, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in four secondary pain-care clinics in the Wessex Region.

Methods

Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral sciatica of 1–18 months' duration were randomized to either three lumbar ESIs of triamcinolone acetonide or interligamentous saline injections at intervals of 3 weeks. The main outcome measure was the Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire (ODQ).

Results

At 3 weeks, the ESI group demonstrated a transient benefit over the placebo group (patients achieving a 75% improvement in ODQ, 12.5 vs 3.7%; number needed to treat, 11.4). No benefit was demonstrated from 6 to 52 weeks. ESIs did not improve physical function, hasten return to work or reduce the need for surgery. There was no benefit of repeated ESIs over single injection. No clinical predictors of response were found. At the end of the study the majority of patients still had significant pain and disability regardless of intervention.

Conclusions

In this pragmatic study, ESIs offered transient benefit in symptoms at 3 weeks in patients with sciatica, but no sustained benefits in terms of pain, function or need for surgery. Sciatica is a chronic condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach. To fully investigate the value of ESIs, they need to be evaluated as part of a multidisciplinary approach.

### Cost effectiveness of periradicular infiltration for sciatica: subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^72ee4b24]. Spine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

A subgroup analysis of a prospective, randomized controlled trial was performed.

Objective

To describe the cost effectiveness of periradicular infiltration with steroid in subgroups of patients with sciatica.

Summary Of Background Data

A recent trial on periradicular infiltration indicated that a methylprednisolone-bupivacaine combination had a short-term effect, as compared with that of saline. This report describes the efficacy and cost effectiveness of steroid in subgroups of patients with sciatic.

Methods

This study involved 160 patients with unilateral sciatica. Outcome assessments were leg pain (100-mm visual analog scale), disability on the Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire, and the Nottingham Health Profile. Data on medical costs and sick leaves also were gathered. Patients were randomized for periradicular infiltration with either methylprednisolone-bupivacaine or saline. The adjusted between-group treatment differences at each follow-up assessment, the number of patients free of leg pain (responders, cutoff 75%), and efficacy by the area-under-the-curve method were calculated. For the cost-effectiveness estimate, the total costs were divided by the number of responders. The rate of operations in different subgroups was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.

Results

In the case of contained herniations, the steroid injection produced significant treatment effects and short-term efficacy in leg pain and in Nottingham Health Profile emotional reactions. For symptomatic lesions at L3-L4-L5, steroid was superior to saline for leg pain, disability, and straight leg raising in the short term. By 1 year, steroid seemed to have prevented operations for contained herniations, costing $12,666 less per responder in the steroid group (P < 0.01). For extrusions, steroid seemed to increase the operation rate, and the steroid infiltration was more expensive, costing $4445 per responder (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

In addition to short-term effectiveness for contained herniations and lesions at L3-L4-L5, steroid treatment also prevented surgery for contained herniations. However, steroid was countereffective for extrusions. The results of the subgroup analyses call for a verification study.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference -12.1 (95% confidence interval -23.6 to -0.5)) and short term (-11.7 (-18.6 to -4.7)), and small at medium term (-6.5 (-11.0 to -2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (-2.3 (-4.5 to -0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections. For disability, a moderate effect was found at short term, but no effect was observed at medium and long term. The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^88327ad9]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

Outcome data were extracted for immediate term (two or fewer weeks after randomisation), short term (more than two weeks but less than three months), intermediate term (more than three months but less than12 months), and long term (12 months or more) follow-up evaluations. When multiple time points fell within the same category, we used the one closest to one week for the immediate term, eight weeks for the short term, six months for the intermediate term, and 12 months for the long term. Scores for pain intensity and disability were converted to a scale from 0 to 100. When more than one outcome measure was used to assess intensity of pain, disability, or work status, we included the outcome measure described as the primary outcome measure for the trial. Descriptive statistics were used to describe adverse events reported in each trial.

Trials that we considered clinically homogeneous were grouped according to class of drugs, comparison group, dose, outcomes (pain, disability, etc), and outcome assessment time points (immediate term, short term, intermediate term, and long term). Pooled estimates were obtained with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, version 2.2.04 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Pooled effects were calculated with a random effects model. For calculation of effect size (see appendix tables A and B on bmj.com), we pooled leg pain and overall pain, as leg pain is usually worse than pain in the back. When trials were not sufficiently homogeneous, pooling of data via meta-analysis was not performed and outcome measures of the individual studies were reported. We decided a priori that a sensitivity analysis would be conducted to investigate definitions of sciatica as possible sources of heterogeneity in effect size among included studies. The limited number of trials in the meta-analysis, however, prevented further investigation.

### Oral steroids for acute sciatica due to herniated lumbar disk… [^a7f6aceb]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results Observed baseline and 3-week mean ODI scores were 51. 2 and
32. 2 for the prednisone group and 51. 1 and
37. 5 for the placebo group, respectively. The prednisone-treated group showed an adjusted mean 6. 4-point greater improvement in ODI scores at 3 weeks than the placebo group and a mean
7. 4-point greater improvement at 52 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the prednisone group showed an adjusted mean 0. 3-point greater reduction in pain at 3 weeks and a mean
0. 6-point greater reduction at 52 weeks. At 3 weeks, participants in the prednisone-treated group showed an unadjusted mean 5. 6-point greater reduction in ODI scores compared with participants in the placebo group. At 52 weeks, the mean between-group difference was 7. 6 points.

The global patient assessment outcome, an exploratory outcome, was measured with a dynamic perceived change in leg pain score. Between-group differences favored the prednisone group, in whom the change was significantly greater at the 3-week visit. Subgroup analyses revealed no statistically significant interactions at either the 3-week or 52-week time points in the between-group changes in the ODI or pain NRS with baseline age, sex, race, ethnicity, elapsed time between onset of symptoms and randomization, lower extremity motor weakness, or presence of a positive straight-leg raise test result. Quiz Ref IDIn this trial of oral prednisone for patients with acute lumbar radiculopathy, we found a small, statistically significant improvement in function at both 3 weeks and 52 weeks favoring the prednisone-treated group but no difference in lower extremity pain scores at any time point.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of long-acting dexamethasone viscous gel delivered by transforaminal injection for lumbosacral radicular pain [^1fc11c61]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Lumbosacral radicular pain (LRP), "sciatica", is a common debilitating disorder associated with persistent morbidity and impact on daily function. It can lead to short-term and long-term disability, increased healthcare costs, and is a leading cause of work-related disability in the Western World. Lumbosacral radicular pain has an annual incidence and prevalence of 1% to 5% and 9.8%, respectively, accounting for a lifetime incidence of 13% to 40%. There are several conservative treatments used initially, with few regimens shown to be effective. These therapeutic approaches include oral corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acupuncture, spinal manipulations, traction therapy, physical therapy, and psychological treatments. When conservative treatments fail, patients are often referred by their primary care physicians for further interventions including epidural steroid injections (ESIs) and eventually surgery. In systematic reviews, ESIs have been shown to prevent surgery in selected patients for up to 1 year, suggesting that longer-lasting formulations might further prevent need for surgery.

There are no pharmaceutical products, oral or parenteral, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of LRP. Whereas corticosteroid injectables are often used off-label to treat LRP, currently available corticosteroids have not demonstrated safety or efficacy in well-controlled clinical trials and may confer neurologic risks including death, as listed on the product labels.,

Based on an analysis from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and reports in the medical literature of serious neurologic AEs associated with ESIs, FDA issued a warning on April 23, 2014, that the injection of corticosteroids into the epidural space of the spine "may result in rare, serious adverse events (SAEs) including the loss of vision, stroke, paralysis, and death. "As a result of the FDA warning, a multidisciplinary working group from 13 societies formulated safety guidelines for ESIs and recommended the use of nonparticulate steroid products for transforaminal (TF) ESI. The rationale for the latter was that rare but severe neurological complications with ESI are more often associated with TF injections of particulate corticosteroids (suspension products).

### Epidural steroids, etanercept, or saline in subacute sciatica: a multicenter, randomized trial [^2ad8e64e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Perineural inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor have recently generated intense interest as an alternative to epidural steroid injections for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Objective

To evaluate whether epidural steroids, etanercept, or saline better improves pain and function in adults with lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Design

A multicenter, 3-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 2008 to 2011. Randomization was computer-generated and stratified by site. Pharmacists prepared the syringes. Patients, treating physicians, and nurses assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00733096)

Setting

Military and civilian treatment centers.

Patients

84 adults with lumbosacral radiculopathy of less than 6 months' duration.

Intervention

2 epidural injections of steroids, etanercept, or saline, mixed with bupivacaine and separated by 2 weeks.

Measurements

The primary outcome measure was leg pain 1 month after the second injection. All patients had 1-month follow-up visits; patients whose condition improved remained blinded for the 6-month study period.

Results

The group that received epidural steroids had greater reductions in the primary outcome measure than those who received saline (mean difference, -1.26 [95% CI, -2.79 to 0.27]; P = 0.11) or etanercept (mean difference, -1.01 [CI, -2.60 to 0.58]; P = 0.21). For back pain, smaller differences favoring steroids compared with saline (mean difference, -0.52 [CI, -1.85 to 0.81]; P = 0.44) and etanercept (mean difference, -0.92 [CI,-2.28 to 0.44]; P = 0.18) were observed. The largest differences were noted for functional capacity, in which etanercept fared worse than the other treatments: steroids vs. etanercept (mean difference, -16.16 [CI, -26.05 to -6.27]; P = 0.002), steroids vs. saline (mean difference, -5.87 [CI, -15.59 to 3.85]; P = 0.23), and etanercept vs. saline (mean difference, 10.29 [CI, 0.55 to 20.04]; P = 0.04). More patients treated with epidural steroids (75%) reported 50% or greater leg pain relief and a positive global perceived effect at 1 month than those who received saline (50%) or etanercept (42%) (P = 0.09).

Limitation

Short-term follow-up, small sample size, and a possibly subtherapeutic dose of etanercept.

Conclusion

Epidural steroid injections may provide modest short-term pain relief for some adults with lumbosacral radiculopathy, but larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to confirm their benefits.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^3ec557f0]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two trained independent raters assessed the quality of the trials' methods using the PEDro scale. Disagreements were resolved by a third rater. Methodological quality was not an inclusion criterion.

Two independent reviewers extracted means (final scores or change score), standard deviations, and sample sizes from studies using a standardised data extraction form. When there was insufficient information in trial reports, we contacted authors or estimated data using methods recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Briefly, when the mean was not reported we used the median; when standard deviations could not be estimated, we adopted the standard deviation from the most similar study.

To evaluate the overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendation, we used the GRADE approach. We used an adapted version of the criteria advocated by the Cochrane Back Review Group. The quality of the evidence was downgraded by one level for each of four factors we encountered: limitations in the design (for instance, > 25% of participants from studies with low quality methods — PEDro score < 7 points); inconsistency of results (for instance, ≤ 75% of the participants report findings in the same direction); and imprecision (for instance, total number of participants < 300 for each outcome). We did not assess publication bias with funnel plots as too few studies were included in the meta-analysis. We also did not assess indirectness as this review encompasses a specific population. Two reviewers judged whether these factors were present for each outcome. Single randomised studies (with under 300 participants) were considered inconsistent and imprecise (that is, sparse data) and provided "low quality evidence". This could be further downgraded to "very low quality evidence" if there were also limitations in design. We applied the following definitions of quality of the evidence:

High quality — further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. There are no known or suspected reporting biases; all domains fulfilled
Moderate quality — further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and might change the estimate; one of the domains was not fulfilled
Low quality — further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; two of the domains were not fulfilled
Very low quality — we are uncertain about the estimate; three of the domains were not fulfilled.

A GRADE profile was completed for each pooled estimate and for single trials comparing drugs versus placebo.

### The use of lumbar epidural / transforaminal steroids for managing spinal disease [^8ef667e7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Lumbar epidural steroid injections are used to manage low back and leg pain (ie, sciatica). Utilization of the procedure is increasing, with Medicare spending for lumbar epidural procedures topping $175 million annually. Few prospective randomized controlled trials have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of epidural steroid injections; many have shown conflicting results. Several studies show favorable short-term outcomes with epidural steroid injection for radicular pain, but less conclusive results are achieved > 6 months. Methodologic flaws limit interpretation of results from most scientific studies. As a tool for predicting surgical outcome, epidural spinal injection has been found to have a sensitivity between 65% and 100%, a specificity between 71% and 95%, and a positive predictive value as high as 95% for 1-year surgical outcome. Despite inconclusive evidence, when weighing the surgical alternatives and associated risk, cost, and outcomes, lumbar epidural steroid injections are a reasonable nonsurgical option in select patients.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^fc5e186c]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Interlaminar epidural injections — evidence from systematic reviews and guidelines indicates mixed or limited benefit for lumbar interlaminar epidural steroid injections. Multiple systematic reviews provided negative opinions, and prior reviews reported evidence ranging from indeterminate to moderate. In 1995 Koes et al reviewed 12 trials of lumbar and caudal epidural steroid injections and reported positive results from only 6 studies, and their updated review with 15 trials again found no evidence that epidural steroid injections are effective in patients with chronic back pain without sciatica. Watts and Silagy's meta-analysis utilized 11 studies involving a total of 907 patients and concluded that pooled randomized data supported epidural corticosteroids as effective for lumbosacral radicular pain. Armon et al concluded that epidural steroid injections for radicular lumbosacral pain do not impact average functional status or provide long-term pain relief beyond 3 months and issued a negative recommendation. Parr et al found the available interlaminar literature comprised only blind injections without fluoroscopy and determined the evidence as poor, and the APS and ACOEM guidelines reported negative results or evidence for interlaminar injections except for short-term benefit in radicular pain. Rho and Tang reported strong evidence for transforaminal injections but only short-term efficacy for interlaminar and caudal approaches, while concluding that lumbar epidural steroids can be an effective tool in the conservative management of low back pain with radicular symptoms.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^4ab8f0e7]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of surgery compared with non-surgical treatment for sciatica.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from database inception to June 2022.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies

Randomised controlled trials comparing any surgical treatment with non-surgical treatment, epidural steroid injections, or placebo or sham surgery, in people with sciatica of any duration due to lumbar disc herniation (diagnosed by radiological imaging).

Data extraction and synthesis

Two independent reviewers extracted data. Leg pain and disability were the primary outcomes. Adverse events, back pain, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment were the secondary outcomes. Pain and disability scores were converted to a scale of 0 (no pain or disability) to 100 (worst pain or disability). Data were pooled using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and certainty of evidence with the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) framework. Follow-up times were into immediate term (≤ six weeks), short term (> six weeks and ≤ three months), medium term (> three and < 12 months), and long term (at 12 months).

Results

24 trials were included, half of these investigated the effectiveness of discectomy compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections (1711 participants). Very low to low certainty evidence showed that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain: the effect size was moderate at immediate term (mean difference −12.1 (95% confidence interval −23.6 to −0.5)) and short term (−11.7 (−18.6 to −4.7)), and small at medium term (−6.5 (−11.0 to −2.1)). Negligible effects were noted at long term (−2.3 (−4.5 to −0.2)). For disability, small, negligible, or no effects were found. A similar effect on leg pain was found when comparing discectomy with epidural steroid injections.

The risk of any adverse events was similar between discectomy and non-surgical treatment (risk ratio 1.34 (95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.98)).

Conclusion

Very low to low certainty evidence suggests that discectomy was superior to non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections in reducing leg pain and disability in people with sciatica with a surgical indication, but the benefits declined over time. Discectomy might be an option for people with sciatica who feel that the rapid relief offered by discectomy outweighs the risks and costs associated with surgery.

### Epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica: a comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review [^5a2f8833]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are one of the commonly performed procedures in managing low back and lower extremity pain. In the past, Pinto et al and Chou et al performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar radiculopathy. In contrast, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the efficacy and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopic guidance.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy of 3 categories of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica performed utilizing saline with steroids, local anesthetic alone, or steroids with local anesthetic.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, RCTs with a placebo control or an active control design, performed under fluoroscopic guidance, with at least 6 months of followed-up were included. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Literature search was performed through January 2021. Methodological quality assessments were performed. Evidence was summarized utilizing principles of best evidence synthesis.

Results

In this analysis, a total of 21 RCTs were utilized with at least 6 months of follow-up and performed under fluoroscopic guidance. However, only 6 of 25 trials from Cochrane review met inclusion criteria for this review. Based on qualitative analysis, of the 21 trials included in the present analysis, there was only one placebo-controlled trial found to be negative. With conventional meta-analysis, there was no significant difference among the studies because all of the studies were active control with local anesthetic or local anesthetic and steroids. Further, with single-arm analysis, of the 5 trials included in that portion of the study, significant improvement was seen with local anesthetic alone compared to local anesthetic and steroids. There was a tendency for better improvement with steroids in terms of both pain relief and functional status. The level of evidence is Level I or strong for local anesthetic with steroids and Level I to II or moderate to strong for local anesthetic as a single agent based on multiple relevant high quality RCTs.

Limitations

Despite multiple trials available, there is a paucity of true RCTs performed under fluoroscopic guidance with any of the approaches.

Conclusion

Epidural injections with or without steroids for radiculopathy showed significant effectiveness with Level I or strong evidence for local anesthetic with steroids and Level II to I or moderate to strong evidence with local anesthetic alone.

### Epidural steroid compared to placebo injection in sciatica: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^efbd8d66]. European Spine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether epidural steroid injections (ESI) are superior to epidural or non-epidural placebo injections in sciatica patients.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched for trials comparing ESI to epidural or non-epidural placebo. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome measures were pooled using a random-effects model for 6-week, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were described qualitatively. Quality of evidence was graded using GRADE classification.

Results

Seventeen out of 732 articles were included. ESI was superior compared to epidural placebo at 6 weeks (-8.6 [-13.4; -3.9]) and 3 months (-5.2 [-10.1; -0.2]) for leg pain and at 6 weeks for functional status (-4.1 [-6.5; -1.6]), though the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) was not met. There was no difference in ESI and placebo for back pain, except for non-epidural placebo at 3 months (6.9 [1.3; 12.5]). Proportions of treatment success were not different. ESI reduced analgesic intake in some studies and complication rates are low.

Conclusion

The literature indicates that ESI induces larger improvements in pain and disability on the short term compared to epidural placebo, though evidence is of low to moderate quality and MCID is not met. Strong conclusions for longer follow-up or for comparisons with non-epidural placebo cannot be drawn due to general low quality of evidence and limited number of studies. Epidural injections can be considered a safe therapy.

### Predictive factors of efficacy of periradicular corticosteroid injections for lumbar radiculopathy [^02c5574b]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Steroid periradicular infiltration is a common nonsurgical sciatic pain treatment of inconsistent efficacy. The purpose of this study was to identify factors for predicting the efficacy or failure of this procedure.

Methods

Two hundred twenty-nine patients with lumbar radiculopathy were prospectively followed up at 2 weeks and 1 year after percutaneous periradicular steroid infiltration. The intensity of radicular pain was scored on the visual analog scale (VAS). Pain relief was classified as "excellent" when the pain was completely resolved or had diminished by 75% or more, "good" for a diminution of 50% to 74%, "fair" for a diminution of 25% to 49%, or "poor" for a diminution of less than 25% or an increase in pain.

Results

The mean VAS scores were 6.5 (range, 3.1–9.5) before and 4.2 (range, 0–9.5) 2 weeks after the procedure. Pain relief was graded as excellent in 45 patients (19.7%), good in 48 patients (21%), fair in 45 patients (19.7%), and poor in 91 patients (39.7%). Cause of pain, conflict location, and pain intensity were not predictive factors of radicular pain relief, whereas the symptom duration before the procedure was highly correlated with the pain relief outcome. Patients with excellent results 2 weeks after the procedure had a mean duration of symptoms of 3.04 months (SD 3.28) versus 7.96 months (DS 9.04) in the group with poor pain relief.

Conclusions

Periradicular infiltration is a simple, safe, and effective nonsurgical procedure that should be performed quite early in the course of the illness to provide radicular pain relief, because corticosteroid infiltration is less beneficial for patients with more chronic radicular pain.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^ade19c4f]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Low back pain (LBP) — oral or IV steroids (Grade B) is suggested to be not effective; trials in emergency department (ED) patients found no benefit with prednisone 50 mg (n = 39) versus placebo (n = 40) and no differences with methylprednisolone acetate 160 mg (n = 44) versus placebo (n = 43). Adults aged 18–55 years with LBP intensity ≥ 5 out of 10 on a VAS had no statistically-significant difference in 3‑point verbal rating scale pain at 5 days, and authors concluded oral corticosteroids did not provide a benefit and that oral steroid (prednisone) is no more effective than placebo; in nonradicular LBP, subjects assessed at one week and one month on an 11‑point numerical rating scale (NRS) and 4‑point descriptive scale had no between‑group differences, and authors concluded parenteral corticosteroids did not provide any benefit and that intravenous steroids are not more effective than placebo.

### Comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of cochrane review of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica [^edd32746]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidural injections are among the most commonly performed procedures for managing low back and lower extremity pain. Pinto et al and Chou et al previously performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which, along with a recent update from Oliveira et al showing the lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy. In contrast to these papers, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the effectiveness and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopically guided techniques. A major flaw in the review can be related to attributing active-controlled trials to placebo-controlled trials. The assumption that local anesthetics do not provide sustained benefit, despite extensive evidence that local anesthetics provide long-term relief, similar to a combination of local anesthetic with steroids is flawed.

Study Design

The Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy were reanalyzed using systematic methodology and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To re-evaluate Cochrane data on RCTs of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy utilizing qualitative and quantitative techniques with dual-arm and single-arm analysis.

Methods

In this systematic review, we have used the same RCTs from the Cochrane Review of a minimum of 20% change in pain scale or significant pain relief of ≥ 50%. The outcome measures were pain relief and functional status improvement. Significant improvement was defined as 50% or greater pain relief and functional status improvement. Our review was performed utilizing the Cochrane Review methodologic quality assessment and the Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB). Evidence was summarized utilizing the principles of best evidence synthesis and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. Clinical relevance of the pragmatic nature of each study was assessed.

Results

In evaluating the RCTs in the Cochrane Review, 10 trials were performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Utilizing conventional dual-arm and single-arm meta-analysis, the evidence is vastly different from the interpretation of the data within the Cochrane Review. The overall combined evidence is Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months, and Level II, or moderate evidence, at 6 and 12 months.

Limitations

The limitation of this study is that only data contained in the Cochrane Review were analyzed.

Conclusion

A comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy yielded different results. This review, based on the evidence derived from placebo-controlled trials and active-controlled trials showed Level I, or strong evidence, at one and 3 months and Level II at 6 and 12 months. This review once again emphasizes the importance of the allocation of studies to placebo-control and active-control groups, utilizing standards of practice with inclusion of only the studies performed under fluoroscopic guidance.

### Corticosteroids for pain of spinal origin: epidural and intraarticular administration [^6ef330fb]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Targeted interventional delivery of corticosteroids remains a mainstay of treatment for spinal pain syndromes because this approach has a wider therapeutic index than other approaches. The best evidence for analgesic efficacy is in subacute radicular syndromes associated with new-onset or recurrent lumbar radiculitis. Complications often relate to drug delivery technique as much as actions of the steroid itself and require careful consideration and vigilance by the administering physician. Considerable uncertainty persists concerning which patients with chronic pain are most likely to benefit from corticosteroid injections. Matching this treatment option with specific spinal pain syndromes remains a major challenge.

### Epidural interventions in the management of chronic spinal pain: American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) comprehensive evidence-based guidelines [^c6562f7e]. Pain Physician (2021). High credibility.

ASIPP Epidural Guidelines — corticosteroid mechanisms and experimental effects: Earlier studies observed a consistent reduction in swelling of involved nerve roots coincidental with improvement in sciatic symptoms with steroid administration, and it is postulated that corticosteroids reduce inflammation either by inhibiting the synthesis or release of a number of pro-inflammatory substances or by causing a reversible local anesthetic effect. Described modes of action include membrane stabilization, inhibition of neural peptide synthesis or action, blockade of phospholipase A2 activity, prolonged suppression of ongoing neuronal discharge, and suppression of ectopic discharges from focally demyelinated axons. In experimental models, epidural betamethasone showed a significant effect on thermal hyperalgesia, intravenous methylprednisolone significantly reduced nerve root injury in a pig model of epidural autologous nucleus pulposus application, and lipopolysaccharide accelerated disc resorption whereas high-dose steroids suppressed this process. Local methylprednisolone depressed heat hyperalgesia and mechano-allodynia but not mechano-hyperalgesia, with effects remaining during the 11 day test period, and chronic steroid treatment prevented neuropathic edema and completely blocked neurogenic extravasation while not affecting nociceptive thresholds in normal or neuropathic hyperalgesic rats.

### Short-term efficiency and tolerance of ketoprofen and methylprednisolone in acute sciatica: a randomized trial [^e09bad33]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Although anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used in acute discogenic sciatica, data regarding their efficacy are scarce and controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of intravenous ketoprofen and methylprednisolone with placebo in sciatica.

Design

Multicenter, double-blinded randomized controlled trial.

Subjects

Patients with confirmed discogenic acute sciatica, without neurologic deficit, were randomized into three arms.

Methods

Besides standard-of-care analgesic therapy, they received intravenous injections of methylprednisolone (60mg/d) or ketoprofen (200mg/d) or placebo for five days. The primary outcome was leg pain over five days. Secondary outcomes were clinical responses at days 3 and 5, lumbar pain, Straight Leg Raise Test and lumbar flexion index, analgesic consumption, realization of lumbar spine injections, and surgery during the study period.

Results

Fifty-four patients were randomized, and 50 completed the study. In patients admitted to the hospital for pain control with acute lumbar radicular pain due to intervertebral disc herniation and receiving an oral analgesic protocol including paracetamol, nefopam, tramadol, and morphine, there was no additional analgesic effect seen between groups. There was no significant difference in leg pain between the three groups over the study period. In the methylprednisolone group, however, we observed a higher rate of clinically relevant responses at day 3. No difference was observed on other secondary efficacy outcomes and safety.

Conclusion

No significant difference in leg pain was observed between groups. However, there was a higher proportion of patients relieved with intravenous methylprednisolone at day 3, compared with ketoprofen or placebo.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^7cae5905]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) for lumbosacral radicular pain — evidence from systematic reviews indicates variable certainty and outcomes. Benny and Azari examined 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and concluded there was strong evidence for transforaminal injections in the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain for both short-term and long-term relief, and another radiology review concluded there was moderate to strong evidence supporting transforaminal therapeutic epidural injections for lumbar nerve-root compression. Roberts et al concluded there was fair evidence supporting transforaminal epidural injections as superior to placebo for treating radicular symptoms and good evidence that they should be used as a surgery-sparing intervention. Rho and Tang concluded there was strong evidence to support the use of transforaminal injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic in patients with acute to subacute unilateral radicular pain caused by a herniated nucleus pulposus or spinal stenosis, and that a lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injection is an effective surgery-sparing procedure that should be a part of conservative care. Quraishi concluded that when appropriately performed, transforaminal epidural steroid injections should result in an improvement in pain, but not disability, and three RCTs followed patients for 3 months with results illustrating no benefit from adding steroids. Manchikanti et al identified 70 studies of which 25 met inclusion criteria, with 15 randomized trials and 10 nonrandomized studies, with 2 duplicate publications and 3 studies failing to meet inclusion criteria; they reported the evidence for lumbar disc herniation is good for transforaminal epidural with local anesthetic and steroids, fair for local anesthetics alone and the ability to prevent surgery, fair for local anesthetic and steroids in spinal stenosis, and poor, inadequate, limited, or unavailable for axial low back pain and post lumbar surgery syndrome. Macvicar et al assessed 39 publications and reported that for disc herniation lumbar transforaminal epidural injection of steroids is not universally effective but benefits a substantial portion of patients and is not a placebo, whereas for other conditions the available evidence was limited and neither compelling nor conclusive. Pinto et al concluded corticosteroid injections offer only short-term relief of leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica, with long-term effects that were positive but smaller and not statistically significant.

### Epidural steroids for sciatica minimally effective in the… [^11d13e27]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are epidural corticosteroid injections effective in decreasing pain and improving function in patients with sciatica. Bottom Line Epidural corticosteroid treatment produces a small and not clinically relevant decrease in leg pain and disability in the short term in patients with sciatica; any difference is gone after one year. Synopsis These researchers searched six databases, including Cochrane CENTRAL, and identified 23 randomized controlled studies comparing epidural corticosteroid with placebo. Two reviewers independently screened the studies, extracted the data, and graded the evidence. The study quality was generally high, although most studies did not conceal allocation or use intention-to-treat analysis, which could have biased the results in favor of treatment. There was no evidence of publication bias, and heterogeneity was low to absent. Epidural corticosteroid treatment resulted in a small difference for leg pain and disability and no difference in back pain scores. Results did not differ by injection approach. There was no difference among treatments after one year.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b007acff]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Although the knowledge of evidence about surgery has changed in the past decade, we still do not know much about a simpler conservative treatment such as pharmacological interventions for sciatica. A recent clinical practice guideline from the American Pain Societyrecommends that surgery should be considered as a treatment option for persistent and disabling radicular pain caused by a herniated lumbar disc. This recommendation relies on moderate short term benefits from large randomised clinical trials such as those by Peul et aland Weinstein et al, with 283 and 501 patients randomised, respectively. At present, there is a limited number of mainly small trials of pharmacological interventions with typically short term follow-up. For example, the evidence to support the use of anticonvulsants in chronic sciatica arises from a single trial with only 50 participants.

Our principal finding is that there is insufficient evidence to confidently guide the use of any analgesic or adjuvant pain medicine for the effective management of pain and disability in patients with sciatica. Until this changes, we would advise clinicians treating such patients who exhibit clinical features of neuropathic pain to consider evidence based guidelines for neuropathic painand for other patients with sciatica to consider therapeutic recommendations from current guidelines for the management of non-specific low back pain.

### YouTube as a source of information on epidural steroid injection [^840abf8d]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lower back pain (LBP) and sciatica are common complaints of patients and affect a major proportion of the population. Because LBP and sciatica cause disability and decrease quality of life, appropriate management of those symptoms is important. For management of LBP and sciatica, various conservative treatments, including oral pain medication, physical therapy, exercise, and interventions, are being applied. Of these treatment modalities, epidural steroid injection (ESI) has been applied widely in patients with LBP or sciatica. The anti-inflammatory property of steroids reduces inflammation around the sinuvertebral nerve and spinal nerve roots. Additionally, steroids have a function to inhibit neural transmission within the nociceptive C-fibers. These actions of steroids can reduce pain following ESI.

Recently, ESI has become one of the most frequently applied procedures in pain clinics; therefore, patients' interest in this procedure is increasing and they require accurate information, such as indication, effect, and adverse effect, on the procedure. With the advance of the Internet, people can easily obtain health information online, making it the most prominent source of health information. Patients also seek information on medical procedures in social media, in which experiences of real patients and opinions of several medical experts are provided. However, online multimedia platforms can contain inaccurate medical information, which can hinder patients from making informed decisions on the treatment of disorders. YouTube is the most popular and largest media-sharing platform online, and it is considered an important platform for dissemination of medical information. Therefore, in the current study, we evaluated the reliability, quality, and usefulness of the most-viewed YouTube videos about ESI.

### Repeat epidural injections of SP-102 (dexamethasone sodium phosphate injectable gel) in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy [^372a250a]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbosacral radicular pain (also known as sciatica) has an estimated lifetime incidence of 13%–40% and annual incidence of 1%–5%. Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are commonly used for lumbosacral radicular pain when more conservative treatments, including analgesic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy, have been ineffective.ESI use has been associated with positive outcomes for patients in prospective randomized trials and retrospective studies, including reduced leg and back pain and avoidance of surgery.

In 2014 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a requirement that all injectable glucocorticoid product labels carry a warning, due to reports of serious and sometimes fatal neurological events with epidural administration. All recorded events that resulted in permanent disability or death were associated with injection of particulates containing (suspension) steroid formulations. In contrast, use of soluble glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, has been associated with fewer adverse reactions, resulting in their recommendation as first-choice steroid for ESIs by an expert panel. However, studies on dexamethasone ESIs have suggested that their analgesic effect has a shorter duration than particulate steroids. Given the safety concerns with particulate-containing ESIs, there is a clear need to extend the duration of the analgesic effect of dexamethasone.

SP-102 is a novel formulation of dexamethasone consisting of dexamethasone sodium phosphate equivalent to 10 mg dexamethasone in 2 mL injectable viscous gel designed to prolong residence at the site of injection. Data from a phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) bridging study indicate that this has been achieved, with epidural injections of SP-102 resulting in lower maximum plasma concentration and longer time to maximum plasma concentration of dexamethasone than intravenous administration of standard dexamethasone sodium phosphate solution (manuscript in preparation).

In clinical practice, it is common to administer repeat ESIs. However, prolonged systemic absorption of corticosteroids and associated suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis can result in susceptibility to infection, Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, and loss of bone density. The duration of HPA suppression of any extended-release steroid formulation, such as SP-102, needs to be considered. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to characterize the repeat-dose PDs of epidural SP-102 with respect to HPA suppression in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy. Secondary objectives of the study were to determine the safety profile and assess the analgesic effects of single and repeat-dose epidural SP-102.

NSAIDs v NSAIDs

Five studies compared one type of NSAID with other NSAIDs. Figure 4shows all the comparisons involving different types of NSAIDs. None of these studies showed one NSAID to be better than the other. One study found no difference in overall pain between oral and parenteral administration of meloxicam 15 mg a day.

In three separate trials the NSAID diclofenac (50–75 mg/day) showed no difference in outcomes compared with antidepressantor electroacupuncturebut did worse than caudal epidural injections of corticosteroidsfor pain and disability, specifically in the immediate follow-up (fig 3). In one trial the NSAID ketoprofen (200 mg/day) was no better than a combination of corticosteroids for pain in the immediate follow-up.

Adverse events

Adverse events were investigated in 75% (18/24) of the included trials (table 4); the median number of adverse events (interquartile range) was 17% (10–30%) for the active drugs and 11% (3–23%) for placebo. The rate and type of adverse events reported varied substantially between drugs and between trials for the same medicine.

### Systemic corticosteroids for radicular and non-radicular low back pain [^ac326097]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids are medications with anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant properties. Systemic corticosteroids administered through the oral, intravenous, or intramuscular routes have been used to treat various types of low back pain, including radicular back pain (not due to spinal stenosis), non-radicular back pain, and spinal stenosis. However, there is uncertainty about the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid for radicular low back pain, non-radicular low back pain, and symptomatic spinal stenosis in adults.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was September 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized and quasi-randomized trials in adults of systematic corticosteroids versus placebo or no corticosteroid.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. The major outcomes were pain, function, need for surgery, serious adverse effect, and presence of hyperglycemia. The minor outcomes were quality of life, successful outcomes, non-serious adverse events, and withdrawal due to adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Thirteen trials (1047 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Nine trials included participants with radicular low back pain, two trial with low back pain, and two trials with spinal stenosis. All trials blinded participants to receipt of systemic corticosteroids. Seven trials were at low risk of bias, five at unclear risk, and one at high risk of selection bias. Two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Doses and duration of systemic corticosteroid therapy varied. Radicular low back pain For radicular low back pain, moderate-certainty evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly decrease pain versus placebo at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) 0.56 points better, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 0.04 on a 0 to 10 scale) and may slightly increase the likelihood of experiencing improvement in pain at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.66; absolute effect 5% better (95% CI 5% worse to 15% better). Systemic corticosteroids may not improve function at short-term follow-up (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.14 better; range 0.49 better to 0.21 worse) and probably increase the likelihood of improvement in function at short-term follow-up (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.91; absolute effect 19% better, 95% CI 8% better to 30% better). Systemic corticosteroids were associated with greater improvement in function versus placebo at long-term follow-up (MD -7.40, 95% CI -12.55 to -2.25 on the 0 to 100 Oswestry Disability Index) and greater likelihood of functional improvement (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.56), based on a single trial. There was no difference in likelihood of surgery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47). Evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids (administered as a single dose or as a short course of therapy) are not associated with increased risk of any adverse event, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, or hyperglycemia, but estimates were imprecise as some trials did not report harms, and harms reporting was suboptimal in trials that did provide data. Limitations included variability across trials in interventions (e.g. corticosteroid used, dose and duration of treatment), clinical settings, and participants (e.g. duration of symptoms, methods for diagnosis); limited utility of subgroup analyses due to small numbers of trials; methodologic limitations or suboptimal reporting of methods by some trials; and too few trials to formally assess for publication bias using graphical or statistical tests for small sample effects. Non-radicular low back pain Evidence on systemic corticosteroids versus placebo for non-radicular pain was limited and suggested that systemic corticosteroids may be associated with slightly worse short-term pain but slightly better function. Spinal stenosis For spinal stenosis, limited evidence indicated that systemic corticosteroids are probably no more effective than placebo for short-term pain or function.

Authors' Conclusions

Systemic corticosteroids appear to be slightly effective at improving short-term pain and function in people with radicular low back pain not due to spinal stenosis, and might slightly improve long-term function. The effects of systemic corticosteroids in people with non-radicular low back pain are unclear and systemic corticosteroids are probably ineffective for spinal stenosis. A single dose or short course of systemic corticosteroids for low back pain does not appear to cause serious harms, but evidence is limited.

### Drugs for relief of pain in patients with sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c009298c]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We used the review methods advocated by the editorial board of the Cochrane Back Review Group. This study searched the following databases from the earliest records to 15 March 2010: International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, CINAHL, and LILACS. Key words related to randomised controlled trial, sciatica, and drugs terms in addition to subject subheadings and word truncations specific for each database were used (see appendix on bmj.com). Electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching reference lists of eligible clinical trials. Our search was restricted to trials published in English, German, Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish. One reviewer screened all relevant titles and abstracts and excluded clearly irrelevant papers, leaving 173 potentially relevant papers. Two reviewers independently evaluated the full reports for eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Study selection

Studies were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials evaluating single or any combination of analgesic or adjuvant pain drugs. For the purposes of this review, we focused on pharmacological interventions that could be administered in primary care settings, which include drugs administered via oral, topical, or parental route (that is, intramuscular injection and intravenous bolus). We excluded trials evaluating procedures that require imaging assistance and the monitoring of anaesthesia monitoring capabilities (for example, epidural, extradural, and intradiscal injections) or that require an extended period of time to be administered with monitoring of the patient's vital signs (for example, intravenous infusion). Eligible comparisons included no treatment, placebo, or other treatment options (for example, other pharmacological treatment, surgery, epidural injections, or other conservative treatment).

Observational evaluations of caudal epidural injections — In a high quality study, Sayegh et al evaluated caudal epidural injections containing steroid versus nonsteroid preparations in low back pain and sciatica and concluded that caudal epidural injections containing local anesthetic and steroids or water seem to be effective, with steroid preparations demonstrating better and faster efficacy. The review also notes positive results assessing 183 patients for short-term and long-term relief, while another evaluation by Mathews et al had a small number of patients confounding results.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^3261a568]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We grouped the studies by surgical procedures. Then, within each surgical procedure, comparators were grouped as non-surgical (non-pharmacological or pharmacological) treatment, epidural steroid injections, and placebo or sham surgery (eg, intradiscal injection of saline solution). We presented discectomy as the primary surgical procedure because this procedure is most widely used for sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation.

Where appropriate, we converted continuous pain and disability outcomes to a common 0–100 scale (0 represents no pain or disability, 100 represents worst pain or disability) (supplemental files 3–5). We pooled data where possible, reported continuous outcomes as mean difference and 95% confidence intervals, and reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I² test. A random effects model was used for all pooled comparisons.

Rather than selecting an arbitrary minimum clinically important threshold, we adopted a system of reporting consistent with the recommendations from the American College of Physicians' 2017 guidelines for low back pain. For pain and disability measured on a 0–100 point scale, an effect size of 5–10 points was considered small, 10–20 points moderate, and more than 20 points large. After reviewing the data, we considered effect size below 5 to be negligible.

Subgroup and exploratory meta-regression

We conducted preplanned subgroup analyses of our estimates of treatment effect (leg pain and disability) at each follow-up time to explore the influence of mean duration of symptom (< 3 months or > 3 months), approach of discectomy (micro or open). We also did post hoc subgroup analyses to explore the influence of analgesics in the comparator group (yes or no), small study effects (< 100 participants in each arm), and unsuccessful non-surgical treatment (yes or no).

We performed univariate meta-regression analyses of difference of means (leg pain and disability) on year of publication, duration of symptom, and sample size as continuous variables, in the comparison of discectomy versus non-surgical treatment across all time points.

Patient and public involvement

Due to the lack of funding, patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, or reporting of this study.

### Cost effectiveness of epidural steroid injections to manage chronic lower back pain [^56d8f17c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Combining all this information, there appear good grounds for suspecting the presence of a placebo effect within ESI's overall treatment effect. Patient-reported outcomes in both the PINE study and our own indicated that ESI produced significant patient-reported short-term health gains, on average. However, both the sciatica study and our own suggested that the marginal impact of the active ingredient in the injection might have been small. The sciatica study detected only modest gains from an active injection compared with a saline placebo, and others have reported similarly. We identified no significant differences in utilities following ESIs with different dosages. Identifying the magnitude of the placebo effect itself could prove difficult. It would require a trial with two randomisations rather than one, namely, between injection and "no treatment" and between active and placebo ingredients. In fact, such a design has already been rejected in the studies cited, although with different objections. Whilst the sciatica investigators deemed it unethical to include a "no treatment" arm, the PINE investigators considered a placebo arm to be unethical. Ethical considerations aside, such a trial might fail to recruit, on the expectation that few patients would risk randomisation away from a well-established (if not well-proven) treatment.

This study has demonstrated cost effective quality of life gains from two ESI episodes over a six month period. How this practice might fit into a longer term management scenario remains unclear, both from this study and from others. In the absence of further injections, for example, patients' symptoms could eventually stabilise at or above the pre-injection baseline or, alternatively, deteriorate to poorer states of health. Both results have been reported. Were injections to be repeated regularly over the longer term, it is unclear whether each subsequent ESI would produce the same effect as its predecessor or whether diminishing returns would prevail. It is probable that a belief in a repeated benefit influences contemporary practice; a survey of US anaesthesiologists revealed that the average maximal number of ESIs per patient was in excess of four per year. In spite of the popularity of serial injection, however, a review found only limited, and contradictory, evidence for offering patients repeated ESIs.

### A comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of the treatments for sciatica: a network meta-analysis [^5dfbc7d2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

There remains a lack of a systematic summary of the efficacy and safety of various medicines for sciatica, and discrepancies among these exist.

Objective

The aim of this study is to comprehensively assess the efficacy of and tolerance to several medical options for the treatment of sciatica.

Methods

We performed a network meta-analysis and illustrated the results by the mean difference or odds ratio. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used for indicating the preferable treatments. All data analyses and graphs were achieved via R 3.3.2 and Stata 13.0.

Results

The subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) was superior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic in reducing lumbar pain in both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. The epidural steroid demonstrated a better ability regarding the Oswestry disability score (ODI) compared to the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α. In addition, for total pain relief, the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was inferior to the epidural steroid + anesthetic. The epidural anesthetic and epidural steroid + anesthetic both demonstrated superiority over the epidural steroid and intramuscular steroid. The intravenous anti-TNF-α ranked first in leg pain relief, while the subcutaneous anti-TNF-α ranked first in lumbar pain relief, and the epidural steroid ranked first in the ODI on the basis of SUCRA. In addition, their safety outcome (withdrawal) rankings were all medium to high.

Conclusions

Intravenous and subcutaneous anti-TNF-α were identified as the optimal treatments for both acute + chronic sciatica patients and acute sciatica patients. In addition, the epidural steroid was also recommended as a good intervention due to its superiority in reducing ODI.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^1f124db6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

### Epidural steroid injections compared with gabapentin for lumbosacral radicular pain: multicenter randomized double blind comparative efficacy study [^28a51ed8]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The physical, socioeconomic, and psychological impact of low back pain is enormous. Low back pain has been the leading cause of years lost to disability over the past several decades, with a lifetime prevalence that ranges between 50% and 90%. The economic cost is estimated to exceed $100bn a year in the United States (£67bn, €93bn), over half of which can be attributed to lost productivity. Efforts to deal with the worldwide burden posed by low back pain have become an international priority.

The classification of back pain is perhaps the most important distinction for clinicians to make as it influences investigation and treatment decisions at all levels of care. Since the development of validated instruments to categorize low back pain, studies have determined that the proportion of chronic cases that are predominantly neuropathic (that is, sciatica, radicular pain from a herniated disc, or neurogenic claudication from spinal stenosis) ranges between 17% and 55%, with one review finding a median prevalence rate of 41%. Whereas the presence of neuropathic symptoms portends a more negative prognosis for acute episodes, lumbosacral radicular pain might be more responsive to procedural interventions than non-specific back pain.

### Prognostic factors associated with outcome following an epidural steroid injection for disc-related sciatica: a systematic review and narrative synthesis [^98a145ca]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical guidelines recommend epidural steroid injection (ESI) as a treatment option for severe disc-related sciatica, but there is considerable uncertainty about its effectiveness. Currently, we know very little about factors that might be associated with good or poor outcomes from ESI. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise and appraise the evidence investigating prognostic factors associated with outcomes following ESI for patients with imaging confirmed disc-related sciatica.

Methods

The search strategy involved the electronic databases Medline, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO and reference lists of eligible studies. Selected papers were quality appraised independently by two reviewers using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Between-study heterogeneity precluded statistical pooling of results.

Results

3094 citations were identified; 15 studies were eligible. Overall study quality was low with all judged to have moderate or high risk of bias. Forty-two prognostic factors were identified but were measured inconsistently. The most commonly assessed prognostic factors were related to pain and function (n = 10 studies), imaging features (n = 8 studies), patient socio-demographics (n = 7 studies), health and lifestyle (n = 6 studies), clinical assessment findings (n = 4 studies) and injection level (n = 4 studies). No prognostic factor was found to be consistently associated with outcomes following ESI. Most studies found no association or results that conflicted with other studies.

Conclusions

There is little, and low quality, evidence to guide practice in terms of factors that predict outcomes in patients following ESI for disc-related sciatica. The results can help inform some of the decisions about potential prognostic factors that should be assessed in future well-designed prospective cohort studies.

Caudal epidural injections for lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis — evidence synthesis and randomized outcomes: Several systematic reviews have evaluated the effectiveness of epidural steroids including caudal epidural injections, but the majority, including Cochrane reviews, have arrived at erroneous conclusions, whereas Abdi et al, Boswell et al, Bogduk et al, Conn et al, and Parr et al evaluated caudal epidural injections as separate procedures for various pathologies, illustrating the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections in managing low back and lower extremity pain. Parr et al reaffirmed prior conclusions with review of 73 available studies and included randomized trials and fluoroscopic observational studies, and due to the availability of 7 randomized trials, only randomized trials were utilized; our literature search yielded 2 additional trials. As shown for disc herniation and radiculitis, there were a total of 7 randomized trials with one trial with 3 publications, and only 4 used fluoroscopy. In another randomized study of 102 patients comparing conservative treatment versus blind caudal epidural steroid injection with follow-up at 6 months, complete relief at 6 months was 86% in the caudal epidural steroid group and 24% in the conservative management group, while no relief was seen in 28% of the conservative management group and 2% of the caudal epidural injection group. A separate meta-analysis by Pinto et al included all types of studies with inappropriate analysis and concluded that corticosteroid injections offer only small short-term, but not long-term, benefit for leg pain and disability for patients with sciatica, and noted that the long-term effects were also positive; however, they were smaller size and not statistically significant.

### Analgesia for non-specific low back pain [^cb4a76bc]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

What you need to know

Analgesics have limited effect on low back pain and some, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, have substantial risks
Oral and, less certainly, topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have small benefits that may not be outweighed by risks (particularly gastrointestinal) for short term use for low back pain
Acute low back pain typically improves within a few weeks without treatment; for chronic low back pain, the focus of management should be on non-pharmacological treatments to improve function and address the broader determinates of pain

Low back pain is the world's leading cause of disability. At any time, half a billion (9%) adults are affected. Many are prescribed, or use, analgesics for pain relief. In this article, we review what is known about common analgesics for treating non-specific low back pain (defined as pain without an identifiable structural or disease cause). We focus on adults aged 18–60 years. A previous BMJ education paper describes the management of low back pain in people aged 60 and over, in whom the likelihood of there being a specific cause is greater and the risk-benefit balance of analgesics differs. The treatment of radicular low back pain (such as sciatica) has been detailed elsewhereand is not addressed here.

Discussion

Summary of main findings

We found very low to low certainty evidence that discectomy, compared with non-surgical treatment, reduced leg pain and disability. The effect sizes of leg pain reduction declined from moderate at immediate and short term, to negligible effect over a year. The extent of the benefit on disability was smaller, with small effect sizes observed up to the medium term follow-up only. No benefits on pain or disability were noted at or after 12 months. Discectomy was also superior to epidural steroid injections, but the size of the effects also reduced over time from large at immediate term to small at long term. Data for disability was equivocal, because a moderate effect size was only observed at short term, but no other benefits were observed at any other time point. Evidence supported plasma disc decompression and chemonucleolysis with condoliase at some time points but was of low certainty.

We did not find an increased risk of adverse events when discectomy was compared with non-surgical treatment. But the reporting might have been inconsistent: the included trials had a high crossover rate between groups and were likely underpowered to detect adverse events. However, one example in a review of observational studies of discectomy complication rates (n = 42 studies; > 4000 participants)showed 12.5–13.3% people had an adverse event. Reoperation, recurrent disc complications, dural tear, nerve root injury, and wound complications were the most common adverse events in open or micro discectomy. These data provide further context and insights into the safety profile of discectomy for sciatica.

Strengths of this review

This review provides the most comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on surgical procedures for sciatica to date. Different from recent reviews, we included trials of a homogeneous population, surgical procedure, comparator, studies published in English and other languages, and new robust trials, making this review the most comprehensive update on the evidence for the surgical management of sciatica.

### Evaluation of the effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic pain of lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^19f33d9a]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of lumbar radicular pain is the subject of ongoing research, with a reported prevalence of sciatica or radiculitis ranging from 1.2% to 43%. Among the numerous non-surgical interventions available, epidural injections are the most commonly performed interventions in the United States in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.

Setting

An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, a private practice setting in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with local anesthetic, with or without steroids, in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to disc herniation or radiculitis in providing effective and long-lasting pain relief.

Methods

Patients were assigned to one of 2 groups with local anesthetic only or with local anesthetic mixed with non-particulate betamethasone. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocations sequence by simple randomization. Seventy patients were included in this analysis.

Outcomes Assessment

Patient outcomes were measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake. Decrease of ≥ 50% of NRS scores and Oswestry scores were considered significant.

Results

Significant pain relief (≥ 50%) was seen at 12 months in 74% of patients in Group I and 86% in Group II, and 69% and 83% in ODI scores respectively. Significant differences were noted in pain relief characteristics at 6 months between Group I and Group II (p = 0.001) and functional status improvement was significantly better in Group II at 6 months and 12 months (p = 0.019 and 0.045). The overall average procedures per year were 4.3 in Group I and 4.2 in Group II with an average total relief per year of 42.2 ± 10.5 weeks in Group I and 41.4 ± 11.0 weeks in Group II over a period of 52 weeks in the successful group.

Limitations

The study limitations include the lack of a placebo group and the fact that this is a preliminary report of 35 patients in each group.

Conclusion

Overall, 74% of patients in Group I without steroids and 86% in Group II with steroids with lumbar disc herniation or radiculitis might benefit from lumbar interlaminar epidural injections.

Risk of bias and certainty of evidence

Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting bias) of included trials using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed funding and conflict of interest statements as part of assessing other bias (eg, industry funded trials without declaration of investigator autonomy was judged to be at high risk; supplemental file 11). We rated the certainty of evidence for each of the outcomes by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. For each GRADE domain, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one level if a serious flaw was present, that is: risk of bias (> 25% of participants in this comparison were from studies at high risk of bias (supplemental file 3), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I² > 50), imprecision (95% confidence interval were 20 points different to the point estimates), and, and small study effects (> 25% of participants were from small studies (< 100 participants per arm)). Certainty of evidence was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low. Any discrepancies between the evaluation of risk of bias and certainty of evidence were resolved through consensus, or, when required, by arbitration with a third reviewer.

### Surgical microdiscectomy versus transforaminal epidural steroid injection in patients with sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc (NERVES): a phase 3, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation [^3162e8d2]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

There is considerable uncertainty about the clinical effectiveness of epidurals in sciatica compared with surgery for treatment of herniated lumbar disc. However, transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), a newer and more precise treatment option, offered promise given that it can deliver the drug in a closer proximity to the site of pathology. We searched PubMed using the term "sciatica epidural steroid" immediately before the initial development of the NERVES protocol in 2013–14 and found that previous evidence supporting TFESI had come from cohort studies or single-centre studies, without clear specification of the non-surgical treatments provided. A meta-analysis from 2015 suggested that non-opioid analgesia, TFESI, and surgery were effective management options for sciatica secondary to uncomplicated herniated lumbar disc. However, the effectiveness of TFESI compared with surgery for herniated lumbar disc was uncertain, leading to wide variation in management guidelines for this common condition.

Added value of this study

NERVES is the first multicentre randomised trial directly comparing surgical microdiscectomy with TFESI on a 1:1 allocation basis as initial invasive treatment for sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc. There was no significant difference between TFESI and surgery pathways in clinical outcome, and surgery is unlikely to be a cost-effective alternative to TFESI. Complications of surgery were significant, offsetting any benefits of surgery as an early treatment, whereas only minor adverse events were seen with TFESI.

Implications of all the available evidence

NERVES provides high-quality evidence for a stepwise treatment framework of uncomplicated sciatica secondary to herniated lumbar disc with symptom duration of up to 12 months. TFESI would be less costly as an initial alternative to surgery for this condition, while achieving similar levels of improved outcomes.

### The efficacy of therapeutic selective nerve block in treating lumbar radiculopathy and avoiding surgery [^47cfd154]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar radiculopathy is defined as pain in the lower back, radiating to the lower limb along the course of a certain lumbar nerve caused by a pathological process such as inflammation or mechanical compression of that nerve root. It can affect the quality of life and limit the activities of affected patients. It is mostly caused by lumbar disc prolapse (LDP) compressing the nerve root or nerve root foraminal stenosis. Sciatica is a pain in the distribution of the sciatic nerve. Radicular pain can be associated with numbness, paresthesia, tingling, muscle weakness, and loss of specific reflexes, but even without the presence of these symptoms, we cannot exclude the diagnosis.

The compression of the nerve root is mostly caused by herniated discs in approximately 90% of cases. Additionally, foraminal stenosis and, less often, tumors, cysts, inflammation, and/or nerve root injury are other possible causes.

Most sciatica cases can be treated conservatively with rest, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. Failure of conservative management is usually considered in the case of continuity of the pain for at least six weeks. On the other hand, the exact timing needed for the patient to stay on the conservative care before switching to another treatment method has not been appropriately evaluated. Meanwhile, an immediate surgical intervention is required in acute settings, especially in those with acute drop foot or bladder incontinence. In the absence of these red flags, there is much disagreement about surgery's effectiveness in chronic sciatica. Moreover, many patients might be reluctant to undergo surgery or may not be fit for general anesthesia, making it crucial to search for alternative management like Selective Nerve Root Block.

Selective nerve root block (SNRB) is a procedure that can be used as a diagnostic and therapeutic method. SNRB can be used in multiple sites, including cervical and lumbar. Steroids are usually injected near the spinal nerve as it exits from the intervertebral foramen. The use of steroids is due to their ability to reduce inflammation and induce numbness to the pain transmission through the nerve. The procedure can be done under fluoroscopy or CT guidance. The use of SNRB in patients with severe pain can reduce their pain and thus reduce their need for surgery. The objective of our study is to investigate the effectiveness of the use of fluoroscopy-guided therapeutic SNRB as a non-surgical option for patients with sciatica due to lumbar disc herniation and/or foraminal stenosis.

Mechanism of Action of Corticosteroid Injections

Of the pharmacologic treatments available for lower back pain, corticosteroids are commonly recommended to counter inflammatory insults. Corticosteroids are a group of molecules resembling the hormone cortisol that have anti-inflammatory effects, and they can be administered in multiple ways, most commonly orally or through injection. Common corticosteroids used clinically consist of prednisone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone, to name a few. Each corticosteroid has different potencies and action duration that should be considered for each patient, depending on the severity of the pathology. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and compression of affected nerves related to lower back pain. At the molecular level, corticosteroids bind to receptors expressed in almost all cell types that act as transcription factors that modulate gene expression, downregulate inflammatory genes, and upregulate anti-inflammatory genes. Some limitations and common adverse events to the use of corticosteroids are hyperglycemia and immune system depression, which would prevent diabetic patients from using these medications and also immunocompromised patients whom would be at an increased risk of infection.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of single-dose IM corticosteroid for radicular low back pain [^3038ae77]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients with radicular low back pain who present to an emergency department (ED) within 1 week of pain onset.

Objective

We hypothesized that a single intramuscular 160 mg dose of methylprednisolone acetate would improve pain and functional outcomes 1 month after ED discharge if the corticosteroid were administered early in disease symptomotology.

Summary Of Background Data

Parenteral corticosteroids are not recommended for acute, radicular low back pain, though their role in this disease process is ill-defined. To date, this medication class has only been studied in a highly selected group of patients requiring hospitalization. METHODS.: Adults between the ages of 21 and 50 who presented to an ED with low back pain and a positive straight leg raise test were enrolled. The primary outcome was change in pain intensity on an 11 point numerical rating scale 1 month after ED visit. Secondary outcomes 1 month after ED discharge included analgesic use, functional disability, and adverse medication effects.

Results

Six hundred thirty-seven patients were approached for participation, 133 were eligible, and 82 were randomized. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The primary outcome, a comparison of the mean improvement in pain intensity, favored methylprednisolone by 1.3 (P = 0.10). Some secondary outcomes favored methylprednisolone, such as use of analgesic medication within the previous 24 hours (22% vs. 43%, 95% CI for difference of 20%: 0%-40%) and functional disability (19% vs. 49%, 95% CI for difference of 29%: 9%-49%). Adverse medication effects 1 week after ED discharge were reported by 32% of methylprednisolone and 24% of placebo patients (95% CI for difference of 9%: -12% to 30%).

Conclusion

This study was a negative study, though there was a suggestion of benefit of methylprednisolone acetate in a population of young adults with acute radicular low back pain. Further work with a larger sample of patients is needed.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^b3e899c9]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discectomy versus epidural steroid injections

Two trials compared the effectiveness of discectomy with epidural steroid injections. Very low to low certainty of evidence showed that discectomy reduced leg pain at all time points. The effect was large at immediate term (medium difference −27.0 (95% confidence interval −34.8 to −19.2)), moderate at short term (−15.1 (−23.5 to −6.7)) and medium term (−14.8 (−28.3 to −1.3)), and small at long term (−7.3 (−14.4 to −0.3)).

Compared with epidural steroid injections, discectomy provided moderate effects on disability at short term, but had no effects at medium and long term. For back pain, small effects were observed at short and medium term and no effect at long term (table 3 and supplemental file 13). No trials reported outcomes for quality of life and treatment satisfaction.

Other surgical procedures

Three trials compared plasma disc decompression with non-surgical treatment. Very low to low certainty evidence showed that plasma disc decompression reduced leg pain at the immediate and long term (moderate effects), but had no effect at short term (supplemental files 6, 14a); and reduced disability at immediate, short, and long term (moderate to large effects; supplemental files 7, 14b). Compared with epidural steroid injections, plasma disc decompression resulted in moderate to large effects on leg pain and disability at the immediate, short, and medium term (low certainty evidence; supplemental files 6, 7, and 15). Outcomes for quality of life and treatment satisfaction are presented in supplemental file 8.

Chemonucleolysis

Two trials compared chemonucleolysis using condoliase with placebo. Low certainty evidence indicated moderate effects on leg pain at all time points, and small effects on disability at short and long term (supplemental file 16).

Five trials investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of chemonucleolysis with chymopapain compared with placebo (n = 4)or manipulative therapy (n = 1). Very low to low certainty evidence indicated (except for chemonucleolysis with chymopapain versus placebo at immediate term) that this treatment combination did not reduce leg pain, disability, and back pain in any time points specified (supplemental files 17 and 18). Other outcomes are presented in supplemental file 8.

### Predictors of outcome following an epidural steroid injection for disc-related sciatica: a Delphi consensus study [^a0e9f786]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Trial data shows modest reductions in leg pain, disability and surgery avoidance following epidural steroid injections (ESI) for severe sciatica. Despite their common use, there is no clear evidence about which patients are more likely to benefit from ESI. The aim of this study was to generate consensus on potential predictors of outcome following ESI for disc-related sciatica.

Methods

A list of potential predictors of outcome was generated during a consensus meeting of seven experts. The items were subsequently presented in a two round on-line Delphi study to generate consensus among experts on which items are potential predictors of outcome. Consensus was defined as 70% agreement among participants.

Results

Sixty-one items were generated during the consensus meeting. Of ninety experts invited to participate in the on-line Delphi study, 44 (48%) and 33 (73%) took part in rounds one and two respectively. Twenty-eight additional items suggested by participants in round one were included in round two. Overall, 14 items reached consensus reflecting domains of health, medication use, pain intensity, psychosocial factors, imaging findings and type of injection.

Conclusion

Based on expert consensus, items that can be routinely collected in clinical practice were identified as potential predictors of outcomes following ESI.

### Factors predicting outcomes from chronic pain management interventions [^06c18648]. BMJ Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Disease burden

Although it seems reasonable that a greater disease burden should produce a higher degree of pain, and that patients with greater pain severity should feel more benefits from interventional procedures, neither premise is proven. Data are mixed about whether a greater severity of lesions or symptoms correlates with outcomes from interventional pain procedures, and an inverse relation is frequently found. In a recent systematic review of 15 studies (median 73 participants per study), no individual prognostic factor (including baseline pain severity, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or electromyography findings) was significantly associated with outcomes after epidural steroid injections. In a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial conducted in 350 patients undergoing epidural steroid injections, the radiological severity of the lumbar stenosis was not significantly associated with postprocedural outcomes. In a retrospective study in > 1200 patients receiving epidural steroid injections for sciatica, lower baseline pain scores, lower opioid doses, and unilateral (v bilateral) symptoms were correlated with positive outcomes. A prospective study in 346 patients who received injection or radiofrequency ablation for low back pain found inverse relations between baseline pain score, duration of symptoms, and treatment outcomes.

### Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for sciatica: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f0ff782d]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Other than radiographical evidence of disc herniation and corresponding signs or symptoms, the included studies varied in their method of identifying patients who would be considered for surgery. Differences were apparent in the requirement of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment, having incapacitating sciatica, or having persistent (> four months) sciatica. Seven (58.3%) of 12 trials did not specify how they identified patients. Thus, the study populations might vary across included trials. Also, participants were not typical patients with sciatica from the community because they were assessed for eligibility by surgeons.

Evidence update and meaning of the study

Compared with the most recent review, which only pooled data for disability within 24 months, our review provides results on leg pain, disability, back pain, and adverse events from the immediate term to five years after randomisation. Thus, unlike the equivocal benefits previously reported, we found that discectomy was initially beneficial but the effect declined over time, compared with either non-surgical care or epidural steroid injections. Generally, discectomy resulted in faster relief in pain and disability, but only up to 12 months. We also investigated the optimal timing of surgery for sciatica by conducting a subgroup analysis by symptom duration (less or greater than three months). Greater reductions in leg pain were reported in people with symptoms for less than three months at immediate and medium term, however, the differences were not significant. A post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of unsuccessful non-surgical treatment suggests that trials without specifying the non-surgical treatment in the inclusion criteria reported higher effects in reducing leg pain (immediate term) and improving disability (short term) than did trials with unsuccessful non-surgical treatment.

We presented discectomy primarily because this surgical treatment is the most widely used for lumbar disc herniation. Nevertheless, the choice of surgical treatment by surgeon varies between countries. Thus, in our review, we presented results for a broader range of surgical procedures. Plasma disc decompression showed a moderate effect on leg pain and disability when compared with non-surgical treatment or epidural steroid injections. Similarly, chemonucleolysis with condoliase was shown to have moderate effects on leg pain and slight effects on disability.

### The effectiveness of lumbar transforaminal injection of steroids: a comprehensive review with systematic analysis of the published data [^860de7cf]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of lumbar transforaminal injection of steroids in the treatment of radicular pain.

Design

Comprehensive review of the literature with systematic analysis of all published data.

Interventions

Four reviewers independently assessed 39 publications on the effectiveness of lumbar transforaminal injection of steroids. Each reviewer determined if a publication provided any valid information on effectiveness. Assessments were compared, and the data of each publication were evaluated in terms of the rigor with which they were produced and the evidence they provided of effectiveness.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome sought was the success rate for relief of pain. Improvement in secondary outcomes was noted if reported.

Results

For miscellaneous conditions, the available evidence is limited and is neither compelling nor conclusive. For disc herniation, the evidence is sufficiently abundant to show that lumbar transforaminal injection of steroids is not universally effective but, nevertheless, benefits a substantial proportion of patients, and is not a placebo. Success rates are higher in patients with contained herniations that cause only low-grade compression of the nerve.

Conclusion

In a substantial proportion of patients with lumbar radicular pain caused by contained disc herniations, lumbar transforaminal injection of corticosteroids is effective in reducing pain, restoring function, reducing the need for other health care, and avoiding surgery. The evidence supporting this conclusion was revealed by comprehensive review of all published data and found to be much more compelling than it would have been if the literature review had been of the limited scope of a traditional "systematic review" of randomized, controlled trials only.

Indications and frequency limits for injections — the document states these decisions have often relied on non-evidence-based assumptions. Over the years, some authors have recommended one injection for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes; others have preached 3 injections in a series irrespective of a patient's progress or lack thereof; others suggest 3 injections followed by a repeat course of 3 injections after 3-, 6-, or 12-month intervals; and some propose an unlimited number of injections. Dose caps such as a limitation of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid or 210 mg per year in an average person and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid also have been advocated; however, with no scientific basis.

Considering that acupuncture is more effective in treating sciatica than traditional treatments; we investigated the dose effect of acupuncture and observed the impact of pain chronicity. We hypothesized that, if acupuncture therapy is effective for pain relief in chronic sciatica, the number of acupoints (ie, dosage) may have a crucial role in pain relief. We also investigated the efficacy of acupuncture in treating sciatica and the impact of pain duration on treatment outcome.

### Trial of pregabalin for acute and chronic sciatica [^88cb9d9c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study PRECISE was published by Stephanie Mathieson and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Low back pain and Sciatica. In the PRECISE study, the trial question was: what is the role of pregabalin in patients with acute and chronic sciatica? In the PRECISE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PRECISE study, the population was: 207 patients (115 female, 92 male). The inclusion criteria were outpatients with moderate-to-severe sciatica. The key exclusion criteria were known or suspected serious pathologic condition of the spine; pregnancy; considering or planning spinal surgery for sciatica during the first 8 weeks of the trial; contraindications to pregabalin. In the PRECISE study, the interventions were: n = 106 pregabalin (at a dose of 150 mg/day, adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg/day, for up to 8 weeks) n = 101 placebo (matching placebo for up to 8 weeks). In the PRECISE study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in leg pain intensity score at week 8 (3.7 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 0.5, 95% CI -0.2 to 1.2). In the PRECISE study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in leg pain intensity score at week 52 (3.4 points vs. 3 points; MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.5 to 1) No significant difference in extent of disability score on the Roland Disability Questionnaire for Sciatica at week 8 (9.1 points vs. 8.5 points; MD 0.1, 95% CI -1.8 to 2) No significant difference in back pain intensity score at week 8 (3.5 points vs. 3.1 points; MD 0.2, 95% CI -0.6 to 1). In the PRECISE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events and suicidal thoughts. significant differences in adverse events (64.2% vs. 42.6%), dizziness (39.6% vs. 12.9%). In the PRECISE study, the conclusion was: in outpatients with moderate-to-severe sciatica, pregabalin was not superior to placebo with respect to leg pain intensity score at week 8.

### A pilot study for effectiveness of non-pharmacological versus pharmacological treatment strategies for lumbar disc herniation: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial [^fe9ecc9c]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most common causes of low back pain (LBP) and radiating leg pain (sciatica). The prevalence of sciatica vary from 1.6% in the general population to 43% in specific working populations. Most cases of sciatica caused by acute LDH show favorable outcomes and resolve within 2 weeks to 3 months. However, in some cases, LDH becomes a chronic condition of lifelong experience with LBP.

Conservative treatment should be the first-line therapy for sciatica; nonetheless, the best method of conservative treatment remains unclear, with guidelines differing in their recommendations. The American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that non-pharmacological treatments, such as superficial heat treatment, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation, should be selected for patients with LBP with or without sciatica. Among these various non-pharmacological treatments, there are many differences between guidelines for acupuncture and manual therapy. Korea guidelinesrecommend acupuncture and spinal manual therapy with high grade level of evidence. It suggested that acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and spinal manual therapy are helpful in improving pain and overall symptoms in patients with LDH. However, the United Kingdom (UK) guidelinesrecommend manual therapy only alongside an exercise program and against acupuncture. The Danish guidelinesalso state that acupuncture has low-quality evidence.

On the other hand, harms and serious adverse events for these non-pharmacological therapies have not been reported. In an RCT study on manual therapy for the neck, adverse events related to the musculoskeletal system and nervous system were observed in 5 patients (9.3%) in the intervention group, but all were mild or moderate side effects. In a systemic review of acupuncture treatment for a LDH patient, adverse events were reported in two trials, one reported no adverse events, and one reported local haematoma.

The recommendations for invasive treatment also vary widely depending on guidelines. Some recent guidelines, do not recommend epidural injections or facet joint injections, whereas the UK guidelinesrecommend epidural injections for patients with severe sciatica. The United States (US) guidelinesalso strongly recommend epidural injections for the management of sciatica or LDH. It suggested that transforaminal epidural steroid injections provide short-term (2–4 weeks) pain relief in LDH patients. Epidural injection is associated with serious adverse events such as plegia, spinal cord injury, dural hemorrhage, paralysis, stroke, and dural punctures, although the incidence rate is low.

The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herniated lumbar disc resulting in back and leg pain travelling below the knee, sciatica, or radiculopathy is a worldwide burden to society. The condition affects an estimated 11% of patients presenting to their primary-care provider worldwide, with an annual prevalence estimated to be 2.2%. Generally, outcomes are favourable and 80% of patients improve with conservative care within 12–24 months. However, given that patients affected by this condition are typically aged 40–45 years, there is a risk of loss of livelihood if it is not managed promptly.

Treatment options have been considered by various expert-led guidelines, but no consensus exists for transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) due to a scarcity of class I evidence. Generally, once analgesia and lifestyle-modifying treatments have failed, steroid nerve root injections and surgical microdiscectomy are recommended for severe persistent cases. Stepwise care approaches based on treatment with non-opioids have been identified as likely to represent a more cost-effective approach than strategies involving direct referral for disc surgery; however, evidence for a stepwise treatment progression involving TFESI is scarce. Following various randomised trials comparing surgical treatments with non-surgical therapy, surgery is often deemed the most successful treatment option, leading to more than 10 000 discectomy procedures per year in the UK and 190 000 such procedures in the USA. The costs to the UK's National Health Service (NHS) for microdiscectomy (requiring patients to be hospitalised for 2 nights, on average) are approximately £4500 compared with £700 for TFESI.

Surgery versus epidural steroid injections

One trial (n = 100) with a high risk of bias was identified that compared results following microdiscectomy with results after epidural steroid injection. Patients undergoing discectomy had the most rapid decrease in their symptoms. The decrease in leg pain in the discectomy group was significantly greater than in the epidural steroid injection group at 3- and 6-month follow-up intervals, but not beyond 1 year. There were no significant differences between groups for back pain throughout the follow-up. Of the 50 patients, 27 who received a steroid injection had a subsequent microdiscectomy. Outcomes in this cross-over group were similar to those of the surgery group. In conclusion, there is very low quality evidence (high risk of bias) that discectomy was beneficial over epidural steroid injections for the short term only.

Facet joint intraarticular corticosteroid injections for low back pain — evidence syntheses report that randomized trials showed no significant advantage over placebo and only moderate evidence overall; specifically, two trials including 210 patients found facet joint injections with corticosteroids were not significantly different from placebo for short-term pain relief and disability. A separate review considered 5 randomized trials and 15 observational studies but concluded none met inclusion criteria with appropriate diagnosis and follow-up. Another analysis using 2 randomized trials and 6 nonrandomized studies showed limited evidence; among the 6 nonrandomized studies meeting inclusion criteria, 5 reported positive results and one negative. A narrative review concluded that intraarticular steroids have no attributable effect for low back pain without a diagnosis of lumbar zygapophysial joint pain and that any benefit is indistinguishable from sham injection. In the only study assessing patients diagnosed with lumbar zygapophysial joint pain, eligibility required at least 50% pain relief with anesthetization of the targeted joint, and the study was judged negative.
