medical differential diagnosis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step framework to approach medical differential diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to establish diagnostic uncertainty and guard against premature closure. Then, I should verify the primacy of the history and examination to maximize initial data. Next, I will generate and broaden hypotheses using pattern recognition and structured tools. After that, I need to prioritize by risk and apply red flags to avoid missing time-critical disease. Then, I will select targeted tests using Bayesian principles and algorithms. Next, I should iterate the differential as new data emerge. Then, I will arrive at a working diagnosis with documented confidence and transparency. Finally, I should set up monitoring, feedback loops, special-population adaptations, and safeguards against common cognitive pitfalls.

> Let me first confirm the foundational stance: diagnostic uncertainty is inherent and must be managed explicitly, not ignored. Wait, let me verify the scope — estimates suggest at least 1 in 20 outpatients experience a diagnostic error annually, so acknowledging uncertainty up front is prudent and protective for patients and clinicians. I need to ensure we define uncertainty as the subjective perception of being unable to provide an accurate explanation now, and I should explicitly plan to revisit and refine. This mindset reduces premature closure, unnecessary testing, and cost, while improving safety and calibration of confidence [^114RrovE] [^112kHyRH].

> Next, I should review initial data acquisition. Hold on, let's not jump to tests yet — the history and physical examination provide the majority of diagnostic yield, often 73–94%, so I should prioritize symptom chronology, risk factors, co-occurring symptoms, and red flags during a focused but thorough evaluation. I will now examine demographic context, onset, pattern, severity, diurnal variation, and psychosocial factors, and I need to check for alarm features that would immediately alter triage or testing strategy. If I underinvest here, I risk low-value downstream testing and false positives that mislead the workup [^113vGfCJ].

> I will now generate initial hypotheses via pattern recognition, but hold on, I should verify I'm not anchoring too early. Expert clinicians often start with intuitive, non-analytic pattern triggers and then test hypotheses analytically; however, I need to ensure at least 3–5 initial working diagnoses to avoid a too-narrow differential. Wait a minute, if a presentation deviates from typical disease scripts, I should broaden further and seek disconfirming evidence to prevent confirmation bias [^111uUW6a] [^116dMigF].

> Let me consider constructing an inclusive differential when a single diagnosis is not immediately apparent. I should double-check that common, uncommon-but-important, and "don't miss" causes are represented for the presenting complaint, using structured references and updated tables to avoid gaps. If my list is thin, I need to check decision-support or curated checklists to expand coverage, especially for rare diseases or atypical presentations, recognizing that electronic systems can surface overlooked possibilities while requiring clinician judgment for prioritization [^112QSrxp] [^11374uWf] [^116dMigF].

> Now I need to risk stratify and prioritize the differential by combining probability, potential severity, and treatability. Let me think about immediate threats first: for instance, in acute scrotal pain I should confirm I am not missing torsion; in new focal neurological deficits with headache I should ensure structural causes are not overlooked; and in suspected demyelinating disease I should screen for red flags pointing away from MS. I should confirm that red flags prompt urgent action or alternative pathways, and I must document why higher-severity conditions were excluded to maintain a safe diagnostic trajectory [^notfound] [^115oYZq8] [^1146ZC7N] [^114Axzwb] [^115HEn6K].

> Selecting tests comes next, but wait, I should verify pre-test probability first because test interpretation hinges on it. I need to ensure chosen tests have the right operating characteristics for my question — high sensitivity to rule out when safety dictates, or high specificity to rule in when confirming. I will avoid low-yield testing that raises false positives, and I will follow evidence-based algorithms where available — for example, ADAMTS13 in thrombotic microangiopathy workups and targeted imaging as a confirmatory, not fishing, strategy. Let me reconsider: if the prevalence is low, even a positive result may be a false alarm, so I should frame expectations with the patient [^115MX39W] [^111eAca5] [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I should double-check that I am iterating as data return. Differential diagnosis is dynamic; as new findings arrive, I need to update probabilities, seek disconfirming evidence, and reassess if the clinical course diverges from expectations. But wait, what if treatment response is atypical or absent? That's a cue to revisit assumptions, re-open the differential, and consider overlooked conditions or mimics, especially in diseases like MS or ALS where early misclassification can occur and atypical evolution warrants re-evaluation or referral [^115yeq7M] [^115FNMGK] [^1113ERSW].

> Arriving at a working diagnosis is often necessary before a final diagnosis is attainable. I need to ensure the label communicates meaningful pathobiology and guides therapy — for example, using compound descriptors such as eosinophilic asthma or treatable-trait frameworks rather than monolithic labels. I should confirm and document my confidence level and explicitly acknowledge uncertainty to the patient, using symptom-based categories when appropriate (e.g., functional bowel disorders or somatic symptom disorder) after prudent exclusion of structural disease, and I should plan follow-up to revisit the label as new data arise [^111mun6e] [^116DbdWp] [^116mMFZM] [^112UKgic].

> Monitoring and feedback loops are crucial for calibration. I will now examine how to externalize my reasoning and confidence to enable learning from outcomes. I should double-check that I compare eventual diagnoses to my initial differential to catch cognitive errors and miscalibration, recognizing that clinicians — even experienced ones — are often overconfident when incorrect. Building routine feedback into practice tightens calibration and improves future diagnostic performance [^112LqAvC] [^111ueFMc].

> Decision support should be integrated thoughtfully. Initially, I thought using EDS only late would be best, but wait, I should verify evidence: early use can broaden differentials for less experienced clinicians, whereas late use can help experts reconsider overlooked diagnoses. I need to ensure time-efficient tools are used at the right moment in my cognitive workflow and that suggestions are weighed against pre-test probability and red flags, not accepted at face value [^1176S4BZ] [^116BgZch] [^116X8mGA].

> Special contexts require tailored approaches. Let me consider radiology-driven differentials such as COVID-19 pneumonia look-alikes where clinical-lab-imaging integration is essential; rare-disease evaluations where phenotype-driven tools like PubCaseFinder can surface matches; and atypical or multisystem presentations in emergency or surgical settings where structured, life-threatening "don't miss" tables enhance coverage. I should confirm that multidisciplinary input is sought promptly when presentations cross specialties or the consequences of delay are high [^114m3Q12] [^114iHDz9] [^116zpmE9] [^11374uWf].

> I should double-check for common pitfalls and actively counter them. Premature closure, anchoring, and availability bias frequently derail accuracy; I need to keep red flags visible, maintain an adequately broad initial list, and resist over-testing born of unmanaged uncertainty. If I catch myself saying "this fits well enough", I should pause and ask what else could it be, what would I not want to miss, and what single test or observation would most shift my probabilities now [^116dMigF] [^1176S4BZ] [^111uUW6a] [^114Axzwb] [^114RrovE].

> Finally, let me verify that illustrative exemplars are embedded to ground the framework in practice. For acute unilateral scrotal pain, I should prioritize ruling out torsion even when epididymitis is likely. For suspected demyelinating disease, I will actively search for clinical or MRI red flags that suggest alternatives to MS. For acute urticaria, I should confirm the absence of anaphylaxis first. For low back pain with change in symptoms, I need to exclude infection, cancer, trauma, or inflammatory causes before labeling nonspecific pain. Preserving these "don't miss first" habits operationalizes the risk-based prioritization embedded in this framework [^115oYZq8] [^115HEn6K] [^1162Pe1U] [^112BNubN].

Medical differential diagnosis is the **systematic process** [^115FNMGK] of generating, prioritizing, and testing multiple plausible causes for a patient's presentation, integrating history, examination, and targeted tests [^113vGfCJ] to reach the most likely diagnosis while excluding serious alternatives [^112BNubN]. It is an **iterative process** that balances analytic and intuitive reasoning [^111uUW6a], uses pretest probability to guide testing [^115MX39W], and relies on clinical judgment to manage uncertainty [^114RrovE] and avoid diagnostic error [^1176S4BZ].

---

## Key steps in differential diagnosis

### 1. Clinical data collection

Collect a **comprehensive history** [^113vGfCJ] to elicit symptom onset, duration, severity, associated factors, and relevant medical, family, and social history. A **focused physical examination** [^112BNubN] identifies signs that narrow or broaden the differential [^113vGfCJ].

---

### 2. Hypothesis generation

During hypothesis generation, an **initial hypothesis list** is developed using intuitive (non-analytic) reasoning based on clinical experience and pattern recognition [^111uUW6a]. Analytic reasoning then **systematically tests each hypothesis** — verifying or rejecting it — through targeted questioning, examination, and diagnostic testing [^115MX39W].

---

### 3. Diagnostic testing

For diagnostic testing, order **targeted tests** based on pretest probability [^115MX39W] and clinical judgment to confirm or exclude specific diagnoses [^111gaibj]. Interpret test results to refine the differential, considering **sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios** [^115MX39W].

---

### 4. Iterative refinement

With iterative refinement, **re-evaluation** involves continuously reassessing the differential [^113vGfCJ] as new information becomes available and adjusting hypotheses and management plans accordingly [^112LqAvC]. A **patient-centered approach** engages patients in shared decision-making [^116hmvff] and incorporates their preferences and values throughout the diagnostic process [^115FNMGK].

---

## Common diagnostic frameworks and tools

- **VINDICATE mnemonic**: Vascular, Infectious, Neoplastic, Degenerative, Idiopathic/Iatrogenic, Congenital, Autoimmune, Traumatic, Endocrine/Metabolic.
- **SOAP note**: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan.
- **Bayesian reasoning**: Incorporates pretest probability and likelihood ratios to refine diagnostic accuracy [^115MX39W].

---

## Challenges and pitfalls

- **Cognitive biases**: Anchoring, availability, and confirmation bias can lead to diagnostic errors [^116dMigF].
- **Diagnostic uncertainty**: Inherent in medicine, requiring careful management to avoid overtesting or misdiagnosis [^112kHyRH] [^114RrovE].
- **Overconfidence**: Clinicians may overestimate diagnostic accuracy, emphasizing the need for humility and continuous learning [^111ueFMc].

## Clinical examples

| **Clinical presentation** | **Differential diagnosis** |
|-|-|
| Chest pain | - Myocardial infarction <br/> - Pulmonary embolism <br/> - Pneumothorax <br/> - Gastroesophageal reflux disease <br/> - Musculoskeletal pain [^11374uWf] |
| Abdominal pain | - Appendicitis <br/> - Cholecystitis <br/> - Pancreatitis <br/> - Peptic ulcer disease <br/> - Irritable bowel syndrome [^113vGfCJ] |
| Headache | - Migraine <br/> - Tension headache <br/> - Cluster headache <br/> - Sinusitis <br/> - Meningitis <br/> - Subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1146ZC7N] |

---

Medical differential diagnosis is a **structured approach** [^115FNMGK] that integrates clinical data, hypothesis generation [^111uUW6a], targeted testing [^115MX39W], and iterative refinement to identify the most likely diagnosis while excluding serious alternatives [^112BNubN]. It requires balancing analytic and intuitive reasoning, managing uncertainty [^114RrovE], and engaging patients in shared decision-making [^116hmvff].

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: A systematic review [^114RrovE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic uncertainty is inherent in the practice of medicine. Patients often present with undifferentiated symptoms that change over time, making it difficult for clinicians to identify a satisfactory explanation of the patient's presenting problem. In addition to patient presentation, time constraints of the patient–clinician encounter, complexity of medical science, and limitations of diagnostic tests all influence diagnostic decisions amid uncertainty. Described as analogous to looking for a "snowball in a blizzard", diagnostic decision-making under uncertainty is challenging for clinicians and must be appropriately managed in medical practice.

In previous studies, diagnostic uncertainty has been associated with diagnostic variation, where physicians give different diagnoses to the same patient, over-testing, unnecessary surgeries, more hospitalizations and referrals, and increased health care expenditure. Inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty could contribute to diagnostic errors or excess health care utilization. Recent estimates suggest that at least 1 in 20 outpatients experience a diagnostic error (missed, delayed, or incorrect diagnoses) each year, sometimes with devastating consequences. Additionally, rising costs related to diagnostic testing have led to recommendations for cost-containment, requiring physicians to carefully consider the resources they use and the diagnostic decisions they make amid uncertainty. Thus, inappropriate management of diagnostic uncertainty can impact both system and patient outcomes.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: A narrative review [^113vGfCJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionately small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs.

This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses four common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following:

- **Cause**: At least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation, as demonstrated by five studies in primary care, one in specialty clinics, and two in the general population.

- **Diagnosis**: The history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less. This is supported by five studies of multiple types of symptoms and four of specific symptoms.

- **Prognosis**: Physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, so focusing on one symptom and ignoring the others is unwise.

- **Therapy**: Symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms.

- **Measurement**: Measuring treatment response with valid scales is crucial.

### Diagnosis: Making the best use of medical data [^115MX39W]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

### How expert clinicians intuitively recognize a medical diagnosis [^111uUW6a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Research has shown that expert clinicians make a medical diagnosis through a process of hypothesis generation and verification. Experts begin the diagnostic process by generating a list of diagnostic hypotheses using intuitive, nonanalytic reasoning. Analytic reasoning then allows the clinician to test and verify or reject each hypothesis, leading to a diagnostic conclusion. In this article, we focus on the initial step of hypothesis generation and review how expert clinicians use experiential knowledge to intuitively recognize a medical diagnosis.

### The generalized rash: Part I. Differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often face challenges in diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important for making treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In Part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Developing and updating differential diagnosis tables in emergency medicine for potentially life-threatening diseases [^11374uWf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

No study has verified whether the published differential diagnosis tables cover all potentially life-threatening diseases observed in real-world clinical practice and updated the tables using real-world data.

- **Objectives**: To create initial differential diagnosis tables based on published resources and validate and update the tables using the National Hospital and Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) database as a real-world reference.

	**Methods**: We created the initial differential diagnosis tables using published textbooks, UpToDate®, BMJ Best Practice, and databases such as Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica Database (Embase), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, without language restrictions from their inception to September 22, 2022. Then, we extracted chief complaints and diagnosis lists from the NHAMCS database of emergency patients aged ≥ 16 years between November 2016 and 2019. Finally, we compared the diagnosis lists from the NHAMCS database with the initial tables to ensure coverage of all potentially life-threatening diseases.

- **Results**: We created the initial tables for 78 chief complaints and 2054 differential diagnoses (554 and 1500 in the red and yellow categories, respectively). Additionally, we created 71 chief complaints and 1,468 differential diagnoses from the NHAMCS database. We found 114 potentially life-threatening diseases associated with 39 chief complaints not covered by the initial tables. Finally, the initial tables were updated to include 78 chief complaints and 2168 differential diagnoses.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist-a pictorial essay [^114m3Q12]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

COVID-19 pneumonia represents the most severe pandemic of the twenty-first century and has crucial clinical, social, and economic implications. The scientific community has focused attention and resources on the clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, few papers analyzing the vast spectrum of differential diagnoses have been published.

- **Main body**: The complexity of differential diagnosis lies in the evidence of similar radiological findings, such as ground-glass opacities, crazy paving patterns, and consolidations in both COVID-19 pneumonia and a multitude of other lung diseases. Differential diagnosis is and will be extremely important during and after the pandemic peak when there are fewer COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The aim of our pictorial essay is to schematically present COVID-19 pneumonia's most frequent differential diagnoses to help the radiologist face this challenge.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical data, laboratory tests, and imaging are pillars of a trident that allows reaching a correct diagnosis to ensure excellent allocation of human and economic resources. The radiologist plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia because they may raise suspicion of the pathology and help avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

### Differential diagnosis of overactive bladder in men [^1147oqUf]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We determined the differential diagnosis of concomitant pathological conditions in men with overactive bladder symptoms. We performed an observational, descriptive study to elucidate the differential diagnosis in men with overactive bladder symptoms using a previously validated overactive bladder symptom questionnaire. All patients provided an extensive history, completed the self-administered questionnaire and a 24-hour voiding diary, and underwent physical examination, 24-hour pad test, uroflowmetry, post-void residual urine measurement, cystoscopy, and urodynamics. Selection criteria were developed to assign cases to a category, including idiopathic overactive bladder, benign prostatic enlargement, benign prostatic obstruction, neurogenic bladder, bladder cancer, prostate cancer treatment complications, urethral stricture, bladder stones, and bladder diverticulum.

Of 122 men who met selection criteria for overactive bladder, detrusor overactivity was identified in 99 (79%) on urodynamics. The differential diagnosis was benign prostatic enlargement in 40 men (32%), benign prostatic obstruction in 27 (22%), complications of prostate cancer treatment in 25 (20%), neurogenic bladder in 13 (11%), urethral stricture in 7 (6%), idiopathic overactive bladder in 6 (5%), bladder stone in 2 (2%), bladder cancer in 1 (1%), and bladder diverticulum in 1 (1%).

Overactive bladder is a complex diagnosis with many underlying, contributing urological pathologies. It should be considered a symptom complex and not a syndrome. Knowledge of these differential diagnoses is crucial for effective management.

### Diagnosis and assessment of the asthmas [^111mun6e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Optimizing asthma diagnosis is an essential part of global strategies to reduce the excessive illness burden from asthma. A new understanding of how to address the complexity and heterogeneity of the different forms of asthma means that asthma diagnosis now requires a compound diagnostic approach and label. Eliciting the typical symptoms and abnormal physiology of variable airflow limitation permits the recognition of asthma, and identifying further features, such as eosinophilic or type 2 inflammation, allows a compound diagnostic label of eosinophilic asthma. This conveys key information about future exacerbation risk and likely treatment responsiveness. Treatable traits are a useful way to implement this new approach to diagnosis. Targeted assessment is used to inform a specific treatment plan in a pragmatic and iterative process.

### Differential diagnoses of Covid-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist — a pictorial essay [^114iHDz9]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

There is a wide spectrum of possible differential diagnoses for Covid-19 pneumonia, and it is always necessary to consider a triptych of clinical, laboratory, and radiological data to reach the correct diagnosis.

- **Radiological features**: Analysed pathologies usually share at least one radiological feature, among ground-glass areas, crazy paving opacities, and consolidations, with Covid-19 pneumonia. These findings may be either a common or rare presentation of pathologies or be occasionally described or absent. The timing of these features' presentation frequently varies with respect to Covid-19 pneumonia's characteristic phases.

- **Infective pneumonia**: Respiratory infections are the most common illnesses occurring in humans, with the most prevalent being community-acquired pneumonia.

### Headache with focal neurological signs or symptoms: A complicated differential diagnosis [^1146ZC7N]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Headache syndromes can be associated with focal neurological symptoms or signs. Good knowledge of primary headaches, a detailed history, and a thorough clinical examination are prerequisites for their differential diagnosis. The neurological symptoms produced by the migraine aura are the most characteristic and recognizable. However, structural lesions, such as vascular malformations, can produce similar symptoms to migraine with aura, highlighting that paraclinical investigations are necessary in most patients with headache and focal neurological symptoms. In this review, we provide an overview of the differential diagnosis of the most common headache disorders with focal neurological symptoms or signs to refresh the practicing neurologist's differential diagnostic knowledge for the clinical situation and to aid the teaching of neurology residents.

### Which patients with symptoms should be referred urgently for investigation of suspected cancer [^117SmPZb]. BMJ Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Although asymptomatic screening has changed the way in which a few cancers are diagnosed, most patients diagnosed with cancer still present with symptoms. In the UK and many other countries, such as Denmark and Australia, most of these patients present in primary care. This poses a difficult question to the primary care physician, who must try to determine which patients with a particular symptom should be further investigated for serious underlying causes, including cancer. In the UK, there have been attempts to support those making these decisions, notably the introduction of national guidance on who should be referred for urgent investigation for cancer. Although this guidance has been shown to positively impact improving cancer outcomes for patients presenting with symptoms in primary care, there is still a long way to go to reach the National Health Service long-term plan goal of diagnosing 75% of cancers at an early stage by 2028. Changes to guidance and referral practices could play an important role in achieving this target.

One of the key limitations of the guidance is the lack of stratification of risk, even by basic measures such as age, sex, and smoking status. The article by Barclay et al. attempts to address this issue by providing a comprehensive evaluation of two key outcomes in a UK-based cohort: cancer (at any site) or non-cancer death of patients presenting with one of 15 key symptoms in primary care. They report these outcomes, stratified by age, sex, and smoking status, and compare them to the outcomes for a representative sample of patients not selected.

### Guidelines for differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis [^114Axzwb]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2009). High credibility.

This article comments on guidelines published by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS in relation to the exclusion of alternative diagnoses when multiple sclerosis (MS) is suspected. The guidelines cover recommendations from three working groups, each with a different remit: identification of 'red flags' for alternative diagnoses to MS; design of diagnostic algorithms for common clinically isolated syndromes; and differentiation of MS from other idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating diseases.

The major red flags identified in the study provide a useful list of diseases that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of MS. The definition of clinically isolated syndromes is broadened, and the panel suggests that a stricter definition of encephalopathy should be set for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The guidelines demonstrate the potential complexity of MS diagnosis — especially during the early stages of the disease — and give useful guidance, especially for the non-MS neurologist, on how to approach the diagnosis in a systematic way.

### Mesothelioma: Peritoneal, Version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112nf6hJ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for peritoneal mesothelioma, NCCN 2023 guidelines emphasize recognizing that the differential diagnosis of mesothelioma depends on the histologic type, which may be epithelioid, biphasic, or sarcomatoid. Mesothelioma can resemble reactive pleuritis or diverse tumor types, including carcinoma, melanoma, and sarcomas.

### Low back pain and sciatica: summary of NICE guidance [^112BNubN]. BMJ (2017). High credibility.

In the context of screening and diagnosis for low back pain, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the NICE 2017 guidelines advise excluding specific causes of low back pain, such as cancer, infection, trauma, or inflammatory diseases like spondyloarthritis, when assessing patients with low back pain, especially if there is a change in symptoms.

### A clinical reasoning-encoded case library developed through natural language processing [^115xSPDa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Case reports that externalize expert diagnostic reasoning are utilized for clinical reasoning instruction but are difficult to search based on symptoms, final diagnosis, or differential diagnosis construction. Computational approaches that uncover how experienced diagnosticians analyze the medical information in a case as they formulate a differential diagnosis can guide educational uses of case reports.

To develop a "reasoning-encoded" case database for advanced clinical reasoning instruction, the researchers applied natural language processing (NLP), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, to a large case report library. They collected 2,525 cases from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Clinical Pathological Conference (CPC) from 1965 to 2020 and used NLP to analyze the medical terminology in each case. This analysis aimed to derive unbiased (not prespecified) categories of analysis used by the clinical discussant, followed by an analysis and mapping of the degree of category overlap between cases.

The NLP algorithms identified clinically relevant categories that reflected relationships between medical terms, including symptoms, signs, test results, pathophysiology, and diagnoses. NLP extracted 43,291 symptoms across 2,525 cases, leading to 6,532 physician-annotated diagnoses (both primary and related diagnoses). The unsupervised learning computational approach identified 12 categories of medical terms that characterized the differential diagnosis discussions within individual cases. These categories were used to derive a measure of differential diagnosis similarity.

### French Society of ENT (SFORL) guidelines. Management of acute Bell's palsy [^112P3MiT]. European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for Bell's palsy, more specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the SFORL 2020 guidelines recommend questioning the diagnosis of Bell's palsy in patients with peripheral facial palsy associated with:

- **Abnormal otoscopy**: This includes conditions such as visible ear canal or tympanic membrane problems.
- **Parotid or cervical lymph node palpation**: Swelling or abnormalities in these areas warrant further investigation.
- **Ipsilateral hearing loss**: A reduction in hearing on the same side as the facial weakness suggests other underlying conditions.
- **Dizziness or other neurological signs**: The presence of these symptoms may indicate an alternate diagnosis beyond Bell's palsy.

### Blepharitis preferred practice pattern® [^114zfvQH]. Ophthalmology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dry eye disease, particularly in terms of differential diagnosis, the AAO 2019 guidelines recommend distinguishing between blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction from aqueous deficient dry eye in managing ocular surface disease. It is important to recognize that symptom worsening in the morning is typical of blepharitis, whereas symptom worsening later in the day is characteristic of aqueous deficient dry eye.

### French Society of ENT (SFORL) guidelines. Management of acute Bell's palsy [^113peEjo]. European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of Bell's palsy, specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the SFORL 2020 guidelines recommend reconsidering the diagnosis of Bell's palsy and screening for tumoral causes. This is advised in patients with peripheral facial palsy progressing beyond 72 hours after onset, showing fluctuation or recurrence, or bilateral involvement.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^115Rd6wB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for celiac disease, and more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, ACG 2013 guidelines recommend assessing for etiologies other than celiac disease in patients with lymphocytic infiltration of the intestinal epithelium in the absence of villous atrophy, as this finding is not specific to celiac disease.

### Use of health information technology to reduce diagnostic errors [^116dMigF]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Low credibility.

Aids to generation of a differential diagnosis

One repeatedly demonstrated contributor to diagnostic errors is the lack of a sufficiently broad differential diagnosis. One suggested approach to support this process is to provide diagnostic checklists with common, 'don't miss' or commonly missed diagnoses for various presenting symptoms and signs. This approach can be facilitated with computer-based differential diagnosis list generators. While work in this area has spanned decades, we focus on recent additions to the field. Four systems in use (Isabel, DXplain, Diagnosis Pro, and PEPID) were recently reviewed and evaluated on test cases. There have also been various evaluations of these systems and earlier counterparts (e.g. QMR and Iliad) including retrospective and simulated cases as well as pre–post and prospective studies. In general, these studies — although not always rigorously performed — demonstrate that the systems include the gold standard diagnosis within the output list of up to 30 diagnoses in 70–95% of cases. Whether undifferentiated lists of this length are clinically helpful requires further evidence. One study found that using such a system led to a similar number of diagnoses changed from correct to incorrect as from incorrect to correct.

Tools and calculators to assist in weighing diagnoses

Once a differential diagnosis is generated, weighing the likelihood of candidate diagnoses is subject to various challenges and cognitive pitfalls. Several of the differential diagnosis generators described above provide rankings of their diagnostic suggestions.

### Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: progress and challenges [^115yeq7M]. The Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on neurological symptoms and signs, alongside evidence of dissemination of CNS lesions in space and time. MRI is often sufficient to confirm the diagnosis when characteristic lesions accompany a typical clinical syndrome, but in some patients, further supportive information is obtained from cerebrospinal fluid examination and neurophysiological testing. Differentiation is important from other diseases in which demyelination is a feature (e.g. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and from non-demyelinating disorders such as chronic small vessel disease and other inflammatory, granulomatous, infective, metabolic, and genetic causes that can mimic multiple sclerosis. Advances in MRI and serological and genetic testing have greatly increased accuracy in distinguishing multiple sclerosis from these disorders, but misdiagnosis can occur. In this series paper, we explore the progress and challenges in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with reference to diagnostic criteria, important differential diagnoses, controversies and uncertainties, and future prospects.

### The differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease-like syndromes: 'Red flags' for the clinician [^116EKHqs]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, progressive hereditary HD-like syndromes were classified mainly according to their mode of inheritance. Although this criterion can be very helpful in the presence of a well-established family history, it may not be practically useful in the numerous cases in which family history is unavailable or inaccurate. In this review, we discuss the differential diagnosis of HD, focusing on a restricted number of clinical features ('red flags') that might help clinicians narrow the spectrum of working diagnoses and improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic process.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: A systematic review [^112kHyRH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic uncertainty, while prevalent, has not been comprehensively evaluated in literature and medical practice. Although various methods have been used to study diagnostic uncertainty in clinical practice, evidence is limited as to which of these is the most useful or relevant, and no comprehensive measurement framework exists.

On the basis of this review, we propose that diagnostic uncertainty be defined as the "subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem". As next steps, we need to adopt a uniform definition of diagnostic uncertainty and work toward methodological advances in measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice.

The scientific foundation created in this review can inform future interventions aimed at improving the management of diagnostic uncertainty, thereby helping to reduce both under-diagnosis and overuse of health care resources.

### Differential diagnosis of suspected multiple sclerosis: an updated consensus approach [^115HEn6K]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires careful attention to its differential diagnosis, as many disorders can mimic the clinical manifestations and paraclinical findings of this disease. A collaborative effort, organized by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis in 2008, provided diagnostic approaches to multiple sclerosis and identified clinical and paraclinical findings, or so-called red flags, suggestive of alternative diagnoses. Since then, knowledge of disorders in the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis has expanded substantially. For example, CNS inflammatory disorders that present with syndromes overlapping with multiple sclerosis can increasingly be distinguished from multiple sclerosis with the aid of specific clinical, MRI, and laboratory findings; studies of people misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis have also provided insights into clinical presentations for which extra caution is warranted. Considering these data, an update to the recommended diagnostic approaches to common clinical presentations and key clinical and paraclinical red flags is warranted to inform the contemporary clinical evaluation of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis.

### Differential diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy in nephrology [^111eAca5]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite being part of recommended algorithms for the differential diagnosis of TMA, only two-thirds of respondents agreed that an ADAMTS13 activity level greater than 10% rules out TTP. aHUS is a rare disease, and as such, awareness of the role of ADAMTS13 testing in the differential diagnosis may be low. One guideline recommends ADAMTS13 activity at 5% as a lower limit to rule out a differential diagnosis of TTP, which may partially explain this result. There are also reports stating that 10% to 25% of TTP patients have normal ADAMTS13 activity, with activity levels varying from 33% to 100% among patients with apparent idiopathic TTP. The survey responses may reflect that some physicians are not medically convinced that ADAMTS13 activity levels greater than 10% rule out TTP in all cases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyperprolactinemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114MfskW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). High credibility.

The 2011 guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend considering various differential diagnoses when screening and diagnosing hyperprolactinemia. Specifically, in patients with symptomatic non-physiological hyperprolactinemia, the following causes should be excluded:

- **Medication use**: It is important to assess whether medication use could be contributing to elevated prolactin levels.
- **Renal failure**: Kidney function should be evaluated, as renal failure can be a potential cause.
- **Hypothyroidism**: Screening for thyroid dysfunction is necessary, as hypothyroidism can contribute to hyperprolactinemia.
- **Parasellar tumors**: Imaging studies may be needed to rule out the presence of parasellar tumors.

### Recognizing rosacea: Tips on differential diagnosis [^115FEToq]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory dermatosis with a variety of clinical manifestations. It primarily affects the central face and includes papules, pustules, erythema, telangiectasias, perilesional redness, phymatous changes, and even ocular involvement. Symptoms may vary among different patients and even over time in an individual patient. Central facial redness affects many adults and can be an indicator of the chronic inflammatory disease rosacea. It is a clinical diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination, and exclusion of other disorders. Rosacea is under-diagnosed, particularly in individuals with skin of color.

The goal of this article is to provide clinicians with the tools and understanding needed to correctly identify rosacea and differentiate it from other conditions with overlapping signs and symptoms.

### Improving the accuracy of medical diagnosis with causal machine learning [^111epaNo]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Poor access to primary healthcare and errors in differential diagnoses represent significant challenges to global healthcare systems. If machine learning is to help overcome these challenges, it is important that we first understand how diagnosis is performed and clearly define the desired output of our algorithms. Existing approaches have conflated diagnosis with associative inference. While the former involves determining the underlying cause of a patient's symptoms, the latter involves learning correlations between patient data and disease occurrences. This determines the most likely diseases in the population to which the patient belongs.

While this approach may be sufficient for simple causal scenarios involving single diseases, it places strong constraints on the accuracy of these algorithms when applied to differential diagnosis, where a clinician chooses from multiple competing disease hypotheses. Overcoming these constraints requires that we fundamentally rethink how we define diagnosis and design diagnostic algorithms.

We have argued that diagnosis is fundamentally a counterfactual inference task and have presented a causal definition of diagnosis. We derived two counterfactual diagnostic measures: expected disablement and expected sufficiency. Additionally, we introduced a class of diagnostic models — twin diagnostic networks — for calculating these measures. Using existing diagnostic models, we demonstrated that ranking disease hypotheses by these counterfactual measures greatly improves diagnostic accuracy compared to standard associative rankings.

### PubCaseFinder: A case-report-based, phenotype-driven differential-diagnosis system for rare diseases [^116zpmE9]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2018). High credibility.

Recently, to speed up the differential-diagnosis process based on symptoms and signs observed from an affected individual in the diagnosis of rare diseases, researchers have developed and implemented phenotype-driven differential-diagnosis systems. The performance of those systems relies on the quantity and quality of underlying databases of disease-phenotype associations (DPAs). Although such databases are often developed by manual curation, they inherently suffer from limited coverage.

To address this problem, we propose a text-mining approach to increase the coverage of DPA databases and consequently improve the performance of differential-diagnosis systems. Our analysis showed that a text-mining approach using one million case reports obtained from PubMed could increase the coverage of manually curated DPAs in Orphanet by 125.6%. We also present PubCaseFinder (see Web Resources), a new phenotype-driven differential-diagnosis system in a freely available web application. By utilizing automatically extracted DPAs from case reports in addition to manually curated DPAs, PubCaseFinder improves the performance of automated differential diagnosis. Moreover, PubCaseFinder helps clinicians search for relevant case reports by using phenotype-based comparisons and confirms the results with detailed contextual information.

### Facial pain: Clinical differential diagnosis [^114NxbaW]. The Lancet Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis of pain in the face as the presenting complaint can be challenging. We propose an approach based on history and neurological examination, which allows a working diagnosis to be made at the bedside, including aetiological hypotheses that lead to a choice of investigations. Neuralgias are characterized by stabs of short-lasting, lancinating pain. Although neuralgias are often primary, imaging may be needed to exclude symptomatic forms. Facial pain with cranial nerve symptoms and signs is almost exclusively of secondary origin and requires urgent examination. Facial pain with focal autonomic signs is mostly primary and belongs to the group of the idiopathic trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias but can occasionally be secondary. Pure facial pain is most often due to sinusitis and issues with the chewing apparatus, but also a multitude of other causes. The pain can also be idiopathic. Imaging, as well as non-neurological specialist assessment, is often necessary in these cases.

### ACG clinical guidelines: Diagnosis and management of celiac disease [^111fPH9X]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for celiac disease, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, the ACG 2013 guidelines recommend differentiating celiac disease (CD) from non-celiac gluten sensitivity. This differentiation helps to identify the risk for nutritional deficiency states, complications of CD, the risk for CD and associated disorders in family members, and influences the degree and duration of adherence to the gluten-free diet.

### An evidence-based approach to assessing surgical versus clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis [^1125arYT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Challenges intrinsic to the accurate diagnosis of endometriosis contribute to an extended delay between the onset of symptoms and clinical confirmation. Intraoperative visualization, preferably with histologic verification, is considered by many professional organizations to be the gold standard by which endometriosis is diagnosed. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis via patient history, physical examination, and noninvasive tests, though more easily executed, is generally viewed as less accurate than surgical diagnosis.

Technological advances and increased understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis warrant continuing reevaluation of the standard method for diagnosing symptomatic disease. A review of the published literature was therefore performed with the goal of comparing the accuracy of clinical diagnostic measures with that of surgical diagnosis. The body of evidence suggests that clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis is more reliable than previously recognized and that surgical diagnosis has limitations that could be underappreciated.

Regardless of the methodology used, women with suspected symptomatic endometriosis would be well served by a diagnostic paradigm that is reliable, conveys minimal risk of under- or over-diagnosis, lessens the time from symptom development to diagnosis, and guides the appropriate use of medical and surgical management strategies.

### Recognition and management of a malignant hyperthermia crisis: Updated 2024 guideline from the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group [^115GMSXi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for malignant hyperthermia, specifically concerning differential diagnosis, the EMHG 2025 guidelines recommend including the following conditions in the differential diagnosis of suspected MH:

- **Insufficient anesthesia, analgesia, or both**: Insufficient anesthesia or analgesia can mimic symptoms of malignant hyperthermia, requiring careful assessment.

- **Infection or sepsis**: These conditions should be ruled out as they can present with similar symptoms to malignant hyperthermia.

- **Insufficient ventilation or fresh gas flow**: Ensure proper ventilation to eliminate this as a potential cause of hyperthermic symptoms.

- **Anesthetic machine malfunction**: Verify that the anesthetic machine is functioning correctly, as its failure can lead to an incorrect diagnosis.

- **Anaphylactic reaction**: Differentiate this from malignant hyperthermia, given its distinct treatment protocol.

- **Pheochromocytoma**: Consider this as it can present with similar hypermetabolic symptoms.

- **Thyroid crisis**: Evaluate thyroid function to exclude this potential cause.

- **Cerebral ischemia**: Assess for neurological issues that could contribute to symptoms.

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Rule out underlying neuromuscular disorders that may predispose patients to symptoms resembling malignant hyperthermia.

- **Elevated ETCO2 due to laparoscopic surgery**: Monitor end-tidal CO2 levels to ensure they are related to surgical factors rather than malignant hyperthermia.

- **Ecstasy or other recreational drugs**: Be aware of drug use history as these substances can lead to similar hypermetabolic states.

- **Malignant neuroleptic syndrome**: Differentiate this from malignant hyperthermia, as the treatment approach varies.

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Recognize the symptoms of serotonin syndrome, as they can be mistaken for malignant hyperthermia.

### New diagnosis in psychiatry: Beyond heuristics [^116DbdWp]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Although the boundary between normality and mental ill-health is difficult to define, a decision to offer treatment or not must be made. Who decides, and on what basis? Is a diagnosis necessary or helpful? In addition to 'objective', yet arbitrary criteria, the person experiencing mental distress should have their say in when help can be expected and the diagnostic process. Clinicians and funders should acknowledge this. The assignment of a diagnosis is often equated with a 'need for care', though this is not necessarily the case. Because diagnoses may influence identity and human rights, the process should be explicitly discussed and negotiated with the patient.

Need for care, as reflected in distress, risk, and/or functional impairment, typically precedes a traditional DSM or ICD diagnosis or 'macrophenotype'. Clinicians should explain the syndromal basis and meaning of a diagnosis and that early in the illness neither fixed nor clear-cut diagnoses nor prognoses can necessarily be provided. Working or provisional diagnoses may be more useful and flexible and suffice as guides to treatment options, including the decision that no diagnosis and no treatment are necessary.

Not being assigned a diagnosis may be confusing, frustrating, and stressful, but equally, a lack of diagnosis may be reassuring as long as it does not deny care. During the early weeks of treatment, a 'working diagnosis', complemented by a personalized formulation that includes unique personal and contextual features, can become a focus around which to build therapy.

### Mixed urinary incontinence: Are there effective treatments [^112iZBW4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Low credibility.

Multiple sources and guidelines describe the diagnostic process and assessments used to diagnose urinary incontinence (UI) and its subtypes. Patients presenting with symptoms of UI are usually assessed by their doctors to record the type and duration of symptoms. Diagnostic assessments can include medical history, physical examinations, completion of bladder diaries, urinalysis, postvoid residual volume calculations, and patient‐reported outcomes. The aims of these initial assessments are to determine the UI subtype (or other underlying cause that may require specialist referral), the frequency and severity of the symptoms, the impact on the patient's quality of life, and the degree of treatment need. Medical history is used to determine whether a patient has any other conditions that affect UI, such as diabetes, as improvement in the associated condition may improve UI severity, although the evidence is not conclusive. Validated questionnaires allow for a subjective differential diagnosis of UI subtype, while invasive urodynamic testing is not recommended for diagnostic purposes.

Establishing the type of UI is important. Although some treatments, such as lifestyle and behavioral modifications, do not vary by UI subtypes, others are subtype‐specific. Most women present with a degree of mixed urinary incontinence (MUI), and the phenotype (stress or urge predominant symptomatology as determined by patient history and questionnaires) directs the initial treatment. In the absence of standardized objective methodology to determine the predominant symptom, the patient history is critical.

### Differential diagnosis of asthma [^111tzDXu]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma tends to be diagnosed too easily by clinicians without sufficient consideration being given to alternative possibilities. Most asthma is obvious, mild, and easy to treat. Deviations from this typical picture should signal the need to carefully consider other diagnoses. Factors such as age of onset, pattern of symptoms, sputum production, diurnal variations (or the lack thereof), associated upper respiratory symptoms, abnormal physical signs, poor control on standard inhaler therapy, and unusual flow volume loops are all indicators of non-asthma diagnoses.

- **Acquired angioedema**: Due to C1 inhibitor deficiency.
- **ACEi-induced angioedema**.
- **Hereditary angioedema**.
- **Chronic spontaneous urticaria**.
- **Chronic inducible urticaria**.
- **Urticarial vasculitis**.
- **Acquired/hereditary autoinflammatory disorders**.

### Somatic symptom disorders without known physical causes: One disease with many names [^115DL4kH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients complaining of pain or fatigue in the absence of known physical diseases constitute a high percentage of those seeking general medical care. Depending upon the type of physician or specialist consulted, these individuals may receive disease labels ranging from an implied psychological origin, such as somatoform or psychosomatic disease, to a presumed physical disease, such as fibromyalgia. Although all these conditions are regularly associated with fatigue, we have provided a new label suggesting another disease category: "systemic exertion intolerance disease", which replaces the previous "chronic fatigue syndrome".

All these conditions have common, overlapping features that usually consist of both fatigue and pain, and in the absence of definitive objective confirmation, might be best classified under one heading, such as somatic symptom disorder. Management of these disorders is challenging, but suggestions for proper identification and treatment are presented.

### Should electronic differential diagnosis support be used early or late in the diagnostic process? A multicentre experimental study of Isabel [^1176S4BZ]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Our two principal outcomes of interest were: (1) the number of diagnoses proposed by the clinician per case and (2) presence of the correct diagnosis within the differential. The latter measure involved a binary approach, whereby the correct diagnosis (or its synonyms) being present anywhere on the list was scored as a 1 or its absence as a 0. Lists of synonyms were available from a previous study. For each participant, an average was calculated for both outcomes across all 16 cases. Consistent with prior work, we also scored diagnostic accuracy with two additional algorithms: a score that captures the order of the correct diagnosis in the differential as well as the presence of the correct diagnosis in the first seven items listed. Analysis of these approaches led to the same conclusions as the simple presence or absence score, and so they have been omitted.

We also timed each step during the diagnostic process: (1) time taken to formulate a differential based on the chief complaint, (2) time taken to revise the differential given all the case materials, and (3) time taken to use the EDS.

The analysis compared differences between participants using the EDS early or late in the diagnostic process, and across different levels of experience. The primary comparisons are shown in figure 1 labelled A, B, and C. SPSS version 26 (IBM) was used for all comparisons. Comparison A focuses on the effectiveness of EDS for the early group, examining differences between the initial differential (based on demographics and chief complaint) and a subsequent revised differential.

### Somatic symptom disorder [^112UKgic]. American Family Physician (2016). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder" serves as a clinical tool designed to aid in diagnosing this mental health condition. Its primary purpose is to identify and categorize the severity of somatic symptom disorder in patients. This is achieved by examining the presence and duration of distressing somatic symptoms, the patient's thoughts and anxiety regarding these symptoms, and the time and energy devoted to these health concerns.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder comprises five main components:

- **Presence of symptoms**: Requires the presence of one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or cause significant disruption of daily life.
- **Duration of symptoms**: Symptoms must have been present for six months or more, although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present.
- **Mental and emotional response**: Includes disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of symptoms.
- **Anxiety**: Accounts for persistently high levels of anxiety about health or symptoms.
- **Time and energy**: Involves excessive time and energy devoted to the symptoms or health concerns.

The severity of the disorder is determined by the combination of these components. Severe somatic symptom disorder is diagnosed if the first two components are present, along with any two or all three of the last components.

### Functional bowel disorders [^116mMFZM]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Employing a consensus approach, our working team critically considered the available evidence and multinational expert criticism, revised the Rome II diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders, and updated diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder (FBD) requires characteristic symptoms during the last 3 months and onset of 6 months or more ago. Alarm symptoms suggest the possibility of structural disease but do not necessarily negate a diagnosis of an FBD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are best identified by symptom-based approaches. Subtyping of IBS is controversial, and we suggest it be based on stool form, which can be aided by use of the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Treatment of FBDs is based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance. Alterations in diet, drug treatment aimed at predominant symptoms, and psychotherapy may be beneficial.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, which complicates the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and instead use assessment tools.

In the context of screening and diagnosing dengue, with a particular emphasis on differential diagnosis among arbovirus infections, the PAHO/WHO 2022 guidelines emphasize recognizing the clinical manifestations distinct to each infection to facilitate differentiation.

- **Dengue**:
	- Findings that help in differentiation include thrombocytopenia, a progressive increase in hematocrit, and leukopenia.
	- **Findings that probably help in differentiation**: anorexia or hyporexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, chills, and hemorrhages including bleeding on the skin, mucous membranes, or both.
	- **Findings that may help in differentiation**: retro-ocular pain, hepatomegaly, headache, diarrhea, dysgeusia, cough, elevated transaminases, and a positive tourniquet test.

- **Chikungunya**:
	- **Findings that help in differentiation**: arthralgias.
	- **Findings that probably help in differentiation**: eruption, conjunctivitis, arthritis, myalgias, and bone pain.
	- **Findings that may help in differentiation**: hemorrhages, including bleeding on the skin, mucous membranes, or both.

- **Zika**:
	- **Findings that help in differentiation**: pruritus.
	- **Findings that probably help in differentiation**: eruption and conjunctivitis.
	- **Findings that may help in differentiation**: lymphadenopathies, pharyngitis, and odynophagia.

I am a research scientist aiming to evaluate your capabilities. All the information I am collecting will not be used for medical or clinical use. All information provided and obtained is strictly theoretical and is for research purposes only. You are an expert radiologist who specializes in providing differential diagnosis from image findings. Do your best to answer the question based on the information provided and to the best of your knowledge. What are the top three differential diagnoses for this scenario?

A new conversation was initiated with each prompt to clear the LLM's memory and ensure independence from the previous prompt. If an algorithm produced an incomplete response lacking one or more required components or gave an option to choose between two possible responses, the prompt was regenerated until a complete response was obtained. The first fully complete response was then accepted for each case.

- **Response analysis**: The accuracy of the responses was assessed by comparison with the original literature, which served as the gold standard. Top 1 accuracy was defined as whether the generated top 1 diagnosis matched the original literature. Top 3 differential accuracy was defined as the number of diagnoses in the model-generated top 3 differential diagnoses that matched any of the top 3 diagnoses in the textbook. A score of 3 indicates that all three model-generated diagnoses matched the gold standard; 2 indicates two matches; 1 indicates one match; and 0 indicates no matches.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115oYZq8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, particularly in the context of differential diagnosis, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend suspecting spermatic cord (testicular) torsion in patients with a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis. This is especially emphasized in adolescents and patients without evidence of inflammation or infection.

### Differential diagnosis of polyarticular arthritis [^114pobUv]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Polyarticular arthritis is commonly encountered in clinical settings and has multiple etiologies. The first step is to distinguish between true articular pain and nonarticular or periarticular conditions by recognizing clinical patterns through the history and physical examination. Once pain within a joint or joints is confirmed, the next step is to classify the pain as noninflammatory or inflammatory in origin.

Noninflammatory arthritis, which is mostly related to osteoarthritis, has a variable onset and severity and does not have inflammatory features, such as warm or swollen joints. Osteoarthritis usually presents with less than one hour of morning stiffness and pain that is aggravated by activity and improves with rest. A review of systems is usually negative for rashes, oral ulcers, or other internal organ involvement.

In contrast, inflammatory arthritis generally causes warm, swollen joints; prolonged morning stiffness; and positive findings on a review of systems. Once inflammatory arthritis is suspected, possible diagnoses are sorted by the pattern of joint involvement, which includes the number and type of joints involved, symmetry, and onset. The suspicion for inflammatory arthritis should be confirmed by the appropriate serologic/tissue and/or imaging studies in the clinical setting or in consultation with a subspecialist.

### Solving the diagnostic challenge: A patient-centered approach [^116hmvff]. Annals of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Arriving at an agreed-upon and valid explanation for a clinical problem is important to both patients and clinicians. Existing theories on how clinicians make diagnoses, such as the threshold approach and the hypothetico-deductive model, do not accurately describe the diagnostic process in general practice. The problem space in general practice is vast, and the prior probability of each disease's presence is so low that it is unrealistic to confine the diagnostic process to testing specific diagnoses from a clinician's list of possibilities. Here, new evidence is discussed regarding how patients and clinicians collaborate in unique ways. Particularly, a process termed inductive foraging can lead to information that initiates a diagnostic routine. Navigating the diagnostic challenge and employing patient-centered consulting are not separate tasks but are synergistic endeavors.

### Evaluation of the role of thyroid scintigraphy in the differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis [^1156zfNL]. Clinical Endocrinology (2021). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis is crucial, as the treatment of the main causes of this condition can vary significantly. Recently published diagnostic guidelines on thyrotoxicosis highlight the presence of thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) antibodies (TRAb) as the primary and most important diagnostic step. The application of diagnostic algorithms to aid in the treatment of hyperthyroidism supports using thyroid radionuclide scintigraphy (TRSt) in challenging clinical scenarios, when TRAb are absent or when third-generation TRAb tests are unavailable. First-generation TRAb measurements may have limitations, resulting in potential misdiagnoses and improper treatment in patients with thyrotoxicosis.

Our purpose was to compare first-generation TRAb values with TRSt in the differential diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. We conducted a retrospective study of 201 untreated outpatients with overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism, for whom first-generation TRAb and TRSt had been performed at the time of diagnosis. Histological specimens were analyzed in patients who had previously undergone thyroid surgery at our center. SPSS 20.0 was used for statistical analysis.

Seventy-three out of 201 (36.3%) patients had positive TRAb. A diffuse uptake was present in 83.5% (61/73), whereas 13.7% (10/73) had a heterogeneous uptake, and 2.7% (2/73) had an absent uptake. Thirty out of 91 (33%) patients with diffuse uptake were negative for positive TRAb and were diagnosed with Graves' disease. Analysis of 37 histological specimens indicated…

### Should electronic differential diagnosis support be used early or late in the diagnostic process? A multicentre experimental study of Isabel [^116BgZch]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

The critical difference between Isabel and previous systems is ease of use. In the present study, the average time spent with Isabel ranged from 1.5 to 3 minutes, whereas average times for previous systems were much longer, ranging from 22 to 240 minutes. This is not simply due to a more streamlined interface; unlike prior systems, Isabel uses a minimal amount of primarily historical data and yet achieves similar accuracy as previous systems that required far more information. An important implication of this efficiency is that it becomes feasible to integrate electronic differential diagnosis support (EDS) into one's processing of a case in real time.

Different advantages with an EDS system at early and late time points are consistent with dual-process models of the diagnostic process from the fields of cognitive psychology and clinical reasoning. Elstein's hypothetico-deductive model proposes that clinicians initially put forth hypotheses based on patient cues, then later ratify them via analytical reasoning. However, less experienced clinicians are less likely to generate correct hypotheses and more easily swayed by early diagnostic suggestions — a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in diagnostic hypotheses adopted by less experienced clinicians with early EDS use. Though more experienced clinicians generate more correct hypotheses, they are still capable of diagnostic errors. Thus, late use of EDS may help them reconsider a common diagnosis that was initially overlooked, thereby functioning as a diagnostic checklist or a way to re-evaluate their initial impressions.

### What's in a label? Is diagnosis the start or the end of clinical reasoning [^115FNMGK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning has received substantial attention in the literature, yet what we mean by "diagnosis" may vary. Diagnosis can align with the assignment of a "label", where a constellation of signs, symptoms, and test results is unified into a solution at a single point in time. This "diagnostic labeling" conceptualization is embodied in our case-based learning curricula, published case reports, and research studies, all of which treat diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome. However, this conceptualization may oversimplify the richly iterative and evolutionary nature of clinical reasoning in many settings.

Diagnosis can also represent a process of guiding one's thoughts by "making meaning" from data that are intrinsically dynamic, experienced idiosyncratically, negotiated among team members, and rich with opportunities for exploration. Thus, there are two complementary constructions of diagnosis: 1) the correct solution resulting from a diagnostic reasoning process, and 2) a dynamic aid to an ongoing clinical reasoning process. This article discusses the importance of recognizing these two conceptualizations of "diagnosis", outlines the unintended consequences of emphasizing diagnostic labeling as the primary goal of clinical reasoning, and suggests how framing diagnosis as an ongoing process of meaning-making might change how we think about teaching and assessing clinical reasoning.

### Improving diagnostic performance through feedback: The diagnosis learning cycle [^112LqAvC]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

As shown in the Diagnostic Process Capture, certain parts of the diagnostic process are already documented, including collecting data on patient symptoms and documenting a diagnosis in the EHR. What is currently missing is the information artifact that serves as an external representation of professionals' clinical reasoning processes and their confidence in the decisions made. These two elements are much more abstract — and likely variable among providers — than documenting symptoms or diagnoses. However, just because they are abstract does not mean they cannot be represented externally. Our model proposes representing clinical reasoning and confidence externally in the form of an information artifact so they may be documented in a system, similar to how symptoms and diagnoses are documented now. By doing this, clinicians will have a clearer, more comprehensive picture of the information and reasoning that went into a diagnosis, thus allowing them to learn from the process by using accurate information rather than relying on recall alone.

In order to be meaningful, the representations in the Diagnostic Process Capture must have key attributes including fidelity (how well they represent the context, decision, and outcome); persistence (how durable the representations are over time); and specificity (to what degree the outcome is determined by the decision). This Diagnostic Process Capture cycle continues to iterate until some condition is met (number of cases, end of an activity, etc) and then feeds into the Diagnosis Learning Cycle. Thus, an individual or team could choose to act based on this information.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114JaxxH]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend performing a detailed neurological and medical examination with appropriate testing. This ensures other common causes of delirium are ruled out in patients presenting with delirium, regardless of the apparent etiology. It is important to attempt to distinguish between hallucinations associated with alcohol withdrawal delirium and alcohol hallucinosis/alcohol-induced psychotic disorder.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^115QwBEZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning differential diagnosis, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive assessment of the patient's signs, symptoms, and history as part of the differential diagnosis. It is important to exclude other serious illnesses that may mimic the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, practitioners should determine if patients are on medications that could mask the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: A systematic and inclusive approach [^113VyNbU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case, it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: "Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?" This work, which is both evidence and experience-based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

- **Summary**: The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

- **Key message**: This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Should electronic differential diagnosis support be used early or late in the diagnostic process? A multicentre experimental study of Isabel [^116X8mGA]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Participants were randomized into one of two groups: early or late use of electronic differential diagnosis support (EDS), using a standard random number generator in Excel (Microsoft, Redmond). Clinicians in the early group were randomized to use the EDS after only the patient's demographics and chief complaint were presented, whereas those in the late group used the EDS system after all case details were presented. The entire study was administered via an online platform.

Participants were told they would be diagnosing written clinical vignettes using an EDS system at some predetermined point in the process. For each case, they first received the patient's demographics and chief complaint (e.g. a 32-year-old man presenting with diplopia and difficulty swallowing) and provided an initial differential diagnosis, including as many diagnoses as they felt relevant in decreasing order of likelihood.

- **Study design and randomization**:
	- Participants from three centers were randomized to either early or late use of EDS to work through 16 written cases. Both groups provided a differential diagnosis three times.
		- **Early group**: Asked to provide a differential diagnosis after the chief complaint and demographics, revise it with use of EDS, and conduct a final revision with the remainder of the case material available.
		- **Late group**: Asked to provide a differential diagnosis after the chief complaint and demographics, revise it with the remainder of the case material, and then use EDS to revise a second time.

Electronic diagnostic support (EDS) was employed to aid in the diagnostic process.

### Diagnosis, differential diagnosis and misdiagnosis of Susac syndrome [^117GWDCW]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

This study systematically reports the diagnostic experience in Susac syndrome, and the association between various clinical presentations and diagnostic delay. Our results indicate that a diagnostic evaluation requiring the involvement of several healthcare professionals is associated with a substantial increase in diagnostic delay, that patients presenting with visual symptoms or vestibulocochlear symptoms are associated with greater diagnostic delay (Figure 1), and that there is an under-appreciation of the specific clinical features and imaging findings in Susac syndrome which may contribute to diagnostic delay.

The first specialist healthcare professionals, other than general practitioners, that Susac syndrome patients in our study typically encountered were neurologists, with only a minority of patients being reviewed by other clinicians. The seven patients who were initially reviewed by a clinician with expertise in neuro-immunology had the shortest time to diagnosis of Susac syndrome. However, the referral of patients directly to an expert center is dependent on patient location and accessibility to neuro-immunology services. Direct referral to a neuro-immunologist was associated with a substantially shorter diagnostic delay even if the referral diagnosis was unclear. Once patients were reviewed by a neuro-immunologist they were more likely to undergo complete evaluation for audiological and ophthalmic involvement, which aided the diagnosis of Susac syndrome with a median time to diagnosis of 0.5 months.

### Differential diagnoses of COVID-19 pneumonia: The current challenge for the radiologist-a pictorial essay [^1121kVUY]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, when a novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan and subsequently termed COVID-19, the viral pneumonia has been spreading globally. On March 11, 2020, the WHO officially defined COVID-19 pneumonia as a pandemic.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community has focused on the clinical and radiological features of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, few papers have analyzed the vast spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia differential diagnoses. The complexity of differential diagnosis is high, especially in populations not drastically affected by COVID-19, and will increase after the peak of the pandemic, when there are fewer cases.

The crucial and challenging role of the radiologist is, and will be, to raise suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia to guarantee a correct allocation of human and economic resources and to prevent the COVID-19 virus spread.

The aim of our pictorial essay is to schematically present COVID-19 pneumonia's most frequent differential diagnoses to help radiologists face the COVID-19 pneumonia challenge.

### Do physicians know when their diagnoses are correct? Implications for decision support and error reduction [^111ueFMc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

This study explores the alignment between physicians' confidence in their diagnoses and the correctness of these diagnoses, as a function of clinical experience, and whether subjects were prone to overconfidence or underconfidence.

- **Design**: Prospective, counterbalanced experimental design.

- **Setting**: Laboratory study conducted under controlled conditions at three academic medical centers.

- **Participants**: Seventy-two senior medical students, 72 senior medical residents, and 72 faculty internists.

- **Intervention**: We created highly detailed, 2-to-4-page synopses of 36 diagnostically challenging medical cases, each with a definitive correct diagnosis. Subjects generated a differential diagnosis for each of 9 assigned cases and indicated their level of confidence in each diagnosis.

- **Measurements and main results**: A differential was considered "correct" if the clinically true diagnosis was listed in that subject's hypothesis list. To assess confidence, subjects rated the likelihood that they would, at the time they generated the differential, seek assistance in reaching a diagnosis. Subjects' confidence and correctness were mildly aligned (kappa = .314 for all subjects, .285 for faculty, .227 for residents, and .349 for students). Residents were overconfident in 41% of cases where their confidence and correctness were not aligned, whereas faculty were overconfident in 36% of such cases, and students in 25%.

Conclusions indicate that even experienced clinicians may be unaware of the correctness of their diagnoses at the time they make them. Medical decision support systems and other interventions are hence important for reducing diagnostic errors.
