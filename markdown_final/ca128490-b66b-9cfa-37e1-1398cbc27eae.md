## Question

Asymptomatic 62-year-old woman with obesity and well-controlled diabetes; lipid panel notable for markedly elevated LDL; started on best therapy for these findings.

A 62-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for her annual check-up. She has no current complaints and says that she has been healthy over the last year. Her past medical history is significant for obesity and diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. She does not smoke and drinks socially. Selected lab results are shown below:

High-density lipoprotein: 48 mg/dL
Low-density lipoprotein: 192 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 138 mg/dL

Given these results, the patient is placed on the drug that will be the best therapy for these findings. Which of the following is a potential side effect of this treatment?

Answer Choices:
A. Gastrointestinal upset
B. Hepatotoxicity
C. Malabsorption
D. Pruritus

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which potential side effect corresponds to the best therapy for a 62-year-old woman with obesity, well-controlled diabetes, and markedly elevated LDL cholesterol of 192 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct first-line therapy for severe hypercholesterolemia in a person with diabetes. Then, I should verify the most common adverse effects of that therapy. Next, I will examine each answer choice against the expected side-effect profile. Finally, I will confirm the best-supported option and briefly note monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and the indication for therapy. An LDL-C of 192 mg/dL meets criteria for severe hypercholesterolemia, and in adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes, high-intensity statin therapy is indicated regardless of calculated ASCVD risk, with the goal of achieving at least a 50% LDL-C reduction, so the best therapy here is a high-intensity statin such as atorvastatin or rosuvastatin [^a58f9b4d] [^8de9612c].

> Wait, let me verify the expected side effects of statins before jumping to conclusions. The most frequently reported adverse effects are statin-associated muscle symptoms, with myalgia reported in roughly 1–5% in trials and higher in observational cohorts, and guidelines also emphasize counseling about new-onset diabetes risk and drug–drug interactions. Clinically significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon, malabsorption is not a recognized statin effect, and pruritus is not a typical statin adverse effect, though rash can occur rarely [^3a5078f6] [^e258c51b] [^57b65a6b].

> I will now examine each option against this profile. Option A, gastrointestinal upset, is not a classic statin side effect; statins are not associated with prominent GI intolerance, whereas metformin commonly causes GI upset, so this would be misleading for statins. Option B, hepatotoxicity, is a recognized but uncommon adverse effect; guidelines recommend baseline liver enzymes and symptom-triggered rechecks rather than routine periodic testing, reflecting the low incidence and typically reversible nature when detected. Option C, malabsorption, is not a known statin adverse effect and does not fit the mechanism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Option D, pruritus, is not a typical statin complaint, though rare hypersensitivity reactions can occur; when patients report pruritus on statins, I should double-check for other causes or a rash rather than attributing it to statins by default [^e258c51b] [^57b65a6b].

> Hold on, I should verify which choice best aligns with guideline-highlighted safety issues. Among the listed options, hepatotoxicity is the only plausible statin-related adverse effect, even if uncommon, and is the one most consistently addressed in pretreatment counseling and monitoring recommendations. Therefore, the best answer is B, hepatotoxicity, acknowledging that clinically significant liver injury is rare and usually manageable with discontinuation and follow-up labs [^e258c51b] [^57b65a6b].

> Let me reconsider the distractors briefly to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. Gastrointestinal upset would be a strong distractor if the question were about metformin, which commonly causes nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia, and where extended-release formulations reduce GI adverse effects; that context does not apply to statins, reinforcing that A is incorrect here. Pruritus and malabsorption simply do not match the statin safety profile, which further supports choosing hepatotoxicity as the most appropriate answer among the choices provided [^d8b0d38f] [^f4049f99].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps. Before and during statin therapy, I would obtain baseline liver enzymes, assess for muscle symptoms, review drug interactions, and counsel on the small risk of new-onset diabetes. If liver enzymes rise to more than three times the upper limit of normal, I would hold the statin, evaluate for other causes, and consider rechallenge or an alternative agent, consistent with guideline-based safety monitoring [^e258c51b] [^57b65a6b].

The best therapy for markedly elevated LDL cholesterol in a 62-year-old woman with obesity and well-controlled diabetes is a **high-intensity statin** (e.g. atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg) [^a58f9b4d] to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction and reduce ASCVD risk [^a50a6806]. The most common side effect is **muscle symptoms** (myalgia or myopathy) [^3a5078f6], which are usually mild and reversible with dose adjustment or switching statins [^3a5078f6]. Hepatotoxicity is rare but possible, so liver enzymes should be monitored if symptoms arise [^57b65a6b]. Gastrointestinal upset, malabsorption, and pruritus are not typical statin side effects [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for high-intensity statin therapy

Current guidelines recommend **high-intensity statin therapy** for adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, aiming for a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction [^a58f9b4d] [^a50a6806]. This approach significantly reduces ASCVD events and mortality in high-risk patients [^ff93c869].

---

## Potential side effects of high-intensity statin therapy

### Muscle-related side effects

- **Myalgia**: The most common side effect, occurring in 1–5% of patients in clinical trials and 11–29% in observational studies [^3a5078f6].
- **Myopathy**: Less common but clinically significant, characterized by muscle pain, weakness, and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels.
- **Rhabdomyolysis**: Rare but serious, potentially leading to renal impairment.

---

### Hepatotoxicity

- **Elevated liver enzymes**: Mild elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) occur in approximately 1–2% of patients [^notfound].
- **Clinical hepatitis**: Rare but possible, necessitating periodic liver function monitoring, especially in patients with underlying liver disease or those taking interacting medications.

---

### Other potential side effects

- **New-onset diabetes mellitus**: Slightly increased risk, particularly in patients with predisposing factors such as obesity and metabolic syndrome [^e258c51b].
- **Cognitive impairment**: Rare reports of reversible cognitive effects, though evidence is limited.
- **Cataracts**: Some observational studies suggest a possible association, but causality remains unclear.

---

## Monitoring and management of side effects

Regular monitoring and patient education are essential to detect and manage side effects early. Obtain a **lipid profile** 4–12 weeks after initiation or dose changes, then annually thereafter [^f43fc6b2]. Assess liver enzymes if symptoms suggest hepatotoxicity, and monitor CK if muscle symptoms occur [^notfound]. Use shared decision-making to discuss benefits, risks, and patient preferences before and during therapy [^22131194].

---

## Comparison with other lipid-lowering therapies

| **Medication class** | **Common side effects** | **Relevance to patient profile** |
|-|-|-|
| Statins | - Myalgia <br/> - Hepatotoxicity <br/> - New-onset diabetes | First-line therapy; significant ASCVD risk reduction [^a58f9b4d] |
| Ezetimibe | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Fatigue | Adjunctive therapy; minimal LDL-C reduction alone [^79997b9a] |
| PCSK9 inhibitors | - Injection site reactions <br/> - Nasopharyngitis | Reserved for statin-intolerant or refractory cases; expensive [^e21c004d] |
| Fibrates | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Myopathy <br/> - Hepatotoxicity | Not first-line; primarily for hypertriglyceridemia [^61abcbab] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

High-intensity statin therapy is the **best initial treatment** for this patient, with muscle-related symptoms being the most common side effect [^3a5078f6]. Hepatotoxicity is rare but warrants monitoring if symptoms occur [^notfound]. Gastrointestinal upset, malabsorption, and pruritus are not typical statin side effects [^notfound]. Regular monitoring and patient education are essential to ensure safety and adherence [^f43fc6b2].

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^602a2138]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Based on the results of clinical trials and the known risks of progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes, an ADA Consensus Development Panel concluded that people with IGT and/or IFG should be counseled on lifestyle changes with goals similar to those of the DPP (5–10% weight loss and moderate physical activity of ∼30 min/day). Regarding the more difficult issue of drug therapy for diabetes prevention, the consensus panel felt that metformin should be the only drug considered for use in diabetes prevention. For other drugs, the issues of cost, side effects, and lack of persistence of effect in some studies led the panel to not recommend use for diabetes prevention. Metformin use was recommended only for very-high-risk individuals (those with combined IGT and IFG who are obese and have at least one other risk factor for diabetes) who are under 60 years of age. In addition, the panel highlighted the evidence that in the DPP, metformin was most effective compared with lifestyle in individuals with BMI ≥ 35 kg/m 2 and those under age 60 years.

When deciding how aggressive an LDL-C-lowering regimen to prescribe, clinicians should be mindful that the absolute risk reduction is a function of both the absolute decrease in LDL-C concentration and the estimated ongoing ASCVD risk. The smaller the absolute drop in LDL-C, the less the relative risk reduction, and so the benefit gained from intervention depends on the risk status of the patient. At low LDL-C levels (eg, patients on statin) further lowering is recommended primarily for those in the highest risk categories. This approach is explored in figure 3 where we present typical patients with ASCVD at high/very high risk, who would fall into three of the categories of LDL-C goals set out in the guidelines.

Figure 3
Patient scenarios. Cases of patients at high ASCVD risk being ascribed to regimens of increasingly intensive LDL-C lowering. LDL-C and triglyceride levels are given in mmol/L (see online supplemental figure 1 for the mg/dL version). The predicted LDL-C reductions of 20% for ezetimibe and 60% for PCSK9i are based on average published responses. Case 1 is a patient with probable FH on the basis of his high LDL-C and sibling with diagnosed FH. Note, the additional 6% reduction on 40 mg rosuvastatin is based on the untreated LDL-C of 5.1 mmol/L; the 20% drop on ezetimibe is calculated from the LDL-C on 20 mg rosuvastatin. Case 2 is a woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes plus other risk factors (hypertension) with symptomatic ASCVD. Case 3 is a man with hypertension with repeat ASCVD events within a short time period (26 months). Note, when LDL-C levels are low — typically < 1.8 mmol/L — laboratory measurement can be problematic especially if lipoprotein(a) or plasma triglyceride levels are high. The guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B as secondary measures to assess the need for further lipid-lowering action when LDL-C is low, as discussed in more detail.

Treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) — initial management emphasizes diagnosis/treatment of causes, lifestyle therapy, and medication selection to support weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction. Determining optimal therapy begins with diagnosing and treating the causes of the diseases of obesity and T2DM, and the algorithm specifies to evaluate and treat primary and secondary causes of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Healthful nutrition, routine physical activity, and behavioral therapy are recommended to achieve and maintain > 5% weight reduction for most patients with T2DM and pre-obesity/overweight or obesity, and additional weight reduction often results in further improvements in glycemic control and reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and potentially a reduction in CVD event risk. The algorithm also advises to avoid medications that may increase body fat, and lists factors determining choice of anti-obesity/anti-diabetes medications including safety, efficacy, effects on body weight and blood glucose, potential diabetes remission, improvement in CVD risk factors, and evidence of reduced CVD outcomes.

### American college of endocrinology pre-diabetes consensus conference: part two [^a3a004c8]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

What, she asked, constitute other suitable end points? Safety end point analysis is required to address drug risk. Surrogate end points rather than clinical benefit end points include measures such as weight loss, lipids, blood pressure, and quality of life, but clinical outcome is clearly more meaningful. In STOP-type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease outcomes decreased, with hypertension also developing less frequently, although Parks observed that before accepting this as an effect of α-glucosidase inhibitors "we do need some confirmatory data". To appropriately determine whether a drug treatment is appropriate for pre-diabetes, we therefore must be able to address its risk-benefit ratio. As all drugs have some risk, targeting an otherwise healthy population in which some individuals at risk never develop diabetes requires special caution and assessment of costs to the individual, to industry, and to society. A drug may be only useful in particular subsets of at-risk patients, with the DPP, as an example, showing a particularly great effect of metformin in patients who were younger and had higher BMI or fasting glucose levels at baseline.

A special FDA public advisory committee held 1–2 July 2008 was asked whether antidiabetes therapy without a concerning cardiovascular safety signal during phase 2–3 of development will be required to conduct a long-term cardiovascular trial or to provide other equivalent evidence to exclude unacceptable cardiovascular risk; 14 committee members voted in favor of, and two voted against, requiring such tests. Based on other discussions at the advisory committee meeting, Parks stated that A1C is still considered a valid efficacy end point for antidiabetes drug approval, that type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease requiring lifelong therapy, that long-term safety profile is important for informed use, and that while demonstration of cardiovascular benefit is not required, it is critical to ensure no cardiovascular harm. Presumably, these preliminary considerations could be applied to a trial of a drug for diabetes prevention. Currently, "none of the drugs are labeled for prevention of microvascular or macrovascular outcomes" but, rather, are labeled for reduction of hyperglycemia. In discussion of Parks' presentation, it was noted that Ratner's power calculations about the trial size needed to show cardiovascular benefit would be likely to apply to a trial designed to show lack of cardiovascular harm, such that a 3-year study of a pre-diabetic population with a 0.5–1% annual cardiovascular disease rate would require tens of thousands of subjects to prove lack of a 40% increase in adverse events.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^f58a303a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases are common medical conditions that are often found comorbid with each other. T2DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by increased plasma glucose concentration (hyperglycemia) caused by persistent insulin resistance, and progressive β cell failure. Insulin resistance is a normal reaction of the body to cope with an excess of circulating triglycerides. Normally, food intake causes only a transient insulin resistance, but currently the excess of energy intake in humans in many regions of the world is almost constant causing sustained insulin resistance leading to T2DM often in combination with dyslipidemia.

Metformin is used as first line treatment of T2DM due to its primary pharmacological effect of controlling disturbed glucose metabolism. Interestingly, despite its longstanding and widespread use, the molecular mechanism via which the drug acts is still a matter of considerable controversy as it additionally influences lipid/cholesterol pathways. Dyslipidemia (or diabetic dyslipidemia when diagnosed in T2DM patients) is an abnormality in lipid metabolism; i.e. quantitatively observed in abnormalities in blood lipids including increased triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) and a decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration. These disturbances are established risk factors in the development of atherosclerosis. Metformin treatment double dose (500–750 mg/day) given to T2DM patients showed after 12 weeks a decreased central blood pressure suggesting a beneficial influence on cardiovascular disease. Table 1 (Supplementary) shows recent articles related to diabetic dyslipidemia. Statins are prescribed as first choice treatment for (T2DM) patients with dyslipidemia, because of their impressive LDL-C lowering effects. Dyslipidemia and insulin resistance are potential risk factors for myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is also important to initiate statin therapy in diabetic patients without known cardiovascular disease. Paradoxically long-term statin therapy when given as monotherapy to dyslipidemic patients is associated with increased incidence of T2DM. Both metformin and statins thus act on glucose — as well as lipid metabolism which is why metformin–statin combination therapy is prescribed to many T2DM patients. However, the therapeutic effects of different doses of statin and metformin given in combination have not been thoroughly and systematically investigated. Since both drugs act on glucose as well as lipid metabolism, it is important to understand in detail the interactions between metformin and statin action on metabolism to be able to design treatments with optimal safety/efficacy profiles

Table 1
Overview of areas and focus of recent review articles about diabetes dyslipidemia and the corresponding focus area for each review is given

The aim of this article is therefore to provide insight in the molecular mechanism of statin/metformin interaction which can help to determine an optimal dosing strategy of both drugs.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^5b5e4b39]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Endocrine Society guideline — statin therapy for primary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention — reports that randomized controlled trial (RCT) data in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels < 190 mg/dL and > 70 mg/dL document benefit, that studies found high-level evidence for ASCVD riskreduction with initiation of moderate- or highintensity statins in those aged 40 to 75 years with a > 7.5% estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD, and that "it is recommended that individuals 40 to 75 years of age, who are not already candidates for statin therapy, receive moderateintensity statin therapy… when they have a > 7.5% estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD and an LDL-C value of 70 to 189 mg/dL", noting the reduction in ASCVD risk clearly outweighs potential adverse effects and is supported by meta-analysis across LDL-C levels > 70 mg/dL.

Ms M, a 74-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes of 6 years' duration, has a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) value of 7.4% despite taking 3 oral antidiabetic medications, as well as coexistent hypertension and abdominal obesity. She has no known microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes and is otherwise healthy. She is reluctant to commence insulin treatment as she dislikes the idea of injections and wonders if there are any alternate options if she is to get her HbA(1C) value below 7%. The natural history of type 2 diabetes, reasons why many patients begin requiring insulin over time, rationale for tight glycemic control, and therapeutic options for Ms M are discussed.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically with respect to patients with dyslipidemia, AACE/ACE 2016 guidelines recommend to consider initiating weight-loss medications combined with lifestyle therapy when necessary to achieve sufficient improvements in lipids (elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL-C) in patients with overweight or obesity and dyslipidemia.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^ecf44848]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is the most fundamental risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In clinical practice, many commonly prescribed medications can alter the patient's lipid profile and, potentially, the risk for ASCVD-either favorably or unfavorably. The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic, in terms of unrecognized, disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations, in spite of deceptively and relatively lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several factors, most notably insulin resistance, associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have been shown to correlate with an increased risk/number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies. Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient's absolute risk.

Metformin

Metformin is a member of the biguanide family with proven safety and efficacy. Metformin has long been used in the management of T2DM and it is one of the insulin sensitising agents commonly used in the treatment of PCOS, though it is still an unlicensed indication in PCOS. The mechanism of action of metformin is through inhibition of hepatic glucose production, increased glucose uptake and increased insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues. The common side effects associated with metformin are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal bloating; however, the prevalence of these symptoms is variable, and the severity of the side effects can be reduced by titrating the dose guided by the severity of the symptoms, or by using modified-release preparations. Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of having prediabetes or T2DM. Despite this clear association, obesity sometimes confounds the link between PCOS and T2DM. Thus, prevention of T2DM in this cohort is crucial, and there is reliable evidence for the use of metformin to reduce the risk of T2DM in high-risk women with PCOS. In a study comparing metformin and lifestyle intervention in women with PCOS, a significant reduction in BMI was observed in both groups; however, reduction in androgen levels was only seen in the metformin group. In an RCT of obese and morbidly obese women with PCOS assessing the effect of metformin on body weight, a significant decrease in BMI independent of lifestyle modification was reported. In a study of 3234 non-diabetic participants with elevated fasting plasma glucose randomised to either metformin or lifestyle intervention with a mean follow up nearly 3 years, lifestyle changes reduced the new incidence of T2DM by almost 60%. In contrast, metformin reduced it by just over 30%; however, this effect was lost entirely following the washout period. This was further confirmed in a similar study where the impact of metformin no longer existed after 12 months of withdrawal. Women with PCOS are also at an increased risk of CVD owing to the hyperinsulinemia, high androgen levels, obesity and dyslipidaemia. There is evidence that obesity and PCOS independently affect vascular endothelial function; however, the association between high insulin levels and CVD is independent of obesity. Women with PCOS have worse lipid profiles compared with the healthy population and they typically have low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high triglyceride levels that are both strong predictors of CVD. Thus, the management of dyslipidaemia is crucial in PCOS. Metformin improves dyslipidaemia by either a direct effect on the hepatic metabolism of free fatty acids or indirectly by reducing hyperinsulinemia. Many studies have reported that metformin has a significant impact on dyslipidaemia;, however, there was no beneficial effect of metformin on total cholesterol levels.

Primary prevention with CAC = 0 AU

A 57-year-old African American female with a history of hyperlipidemia, not currently on therapy, and with well-controlled hypertension on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily presents for her annual primary care visit. Her fasting lipid panel reveals the following:

- **LDL-C**: 156 mg/dL
- **HDL-C**: 29 mg/dL
- **Triglycerides**: 170 mg/dL
- **Total cholesterol**: 219 mg/dL

Her blood pressure is 130/79 mm Hg, and her hemoglobin A1c is 4.6%. She is a never-smoker, and there is no family history of heart disease. Her primary care physician calculates her 10-year ASCVD risk using the PCE, resulting in a 10.6% estimated risk (PREVENT 10-year risk of CVD 7.1%, ASCVD 4.3%). The patient expresses hesitation about initiating statin therapy. To further refine her risk estimation, a CAC score is obtained, which returns a result of 0 AU.

Given this patient's intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk, as calculated by the PCE, and her CAC score of 0, the patient's risk can be further refined. Both the 2018 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines and the 2022 ACC ECDP provide specific guidance for cases where CAC scoring is used to refine risk stratification and guide therapy decisions, particularly when there is patient uncertainty about statin initiation.

For patients with a zero CAC score, considerable evidence suggests low short-term risk of cardiovascular events. Consensus recommendations support that in these cases, statin therapy may be safely deferred if there is absence of severe hyperlipidemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL), diabetes, tobacco use, or family history of premature coronary artery disease. Recommendations support reassessing a CAC score at 3 to 5 years. This is similar to recommendations from the CCS guidelines although no specific guidance on treatment deferral for CAC of 0 is made. Notably, while the ESC guidelines note a low event rate with a CAC score of 0, no comment is made on the impact on treatment.

In summary, for this patient, the CAC score of 0 shifts her risk profile into a low-risk category. Given the excellent short-term prognosis, statin therapy can be safely deferred with interval testing of her lipids and CAC score.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^2261d16c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

Lipids in older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) — targets and testing frequency: Optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets have not been established. It is recommended that goals for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides be consistent with ADA recommendations of HDL-C greater than 40 mg/dL in men, HDL-C greater than 50 mg/dL in women, and triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL. Expert consensus suggests that persons with low-risk lipid values (LDL-C < 100 mg/dL; HDL-C > 50 mg/dL; triglycerides < 150 mg/dL) on an initial assessment may have lipids checked every 2 years; in most persons with DM, measurement of a fasting lipid profile is recommended at least annually and more frequently if targets are not being met.

### An update to the article "Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis" [^d8b0d38f]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Our results showed that in terms of glycaemic control, there were no significant differences between the different formulations. This alone is valuable evidence for the clinician who seeks to optimise the management of diabetes. However, metformin's use now extends beyond diabetes care, making evaluation of differences in other parameters increasingly important. For example metformin XR was significantly more effective than IR in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which may be an important benefit in patients with significant obesity or other metabolic disease.

A key influence on real-world efficacy of any drug is tolerability. A drug with few unpleasant side effects is much more likely to produce good results outside of the highly regulated world of clinical trials, because patients are more likely to actually take it. An important element of our study was therefore to assess whether there are significant differences between metformin formulations in terms of tolerability, in particular the likelihood of experiencing gastrointestinal side effects. Gastrointestinal effects are a major barrier to tolerating metformin therapy, affecting 20–30% of patients taking metformin. Around 1 in 20 patients will experience effects bothersome enough for them to stop taking metformin altogether. Longer-acting formulations are often recommended to patients who experience gastrointestinal side effects with immediate release metformin, based on the idea that there may be fewer unwanted effects with these preparations. Our data support the idea that metformin DR is associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects than metformin IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30–0.66, p < 0.0001). When metformin XR is compared to metformin IR, there is also a reduction in the likelihood of adverse gastrointestinal side effects, although this does not reach our pre-specified threshold for statistical significance.

Side Effects of Metformin Formulations

There was a non-statistically significant reduction in the likelihood of experiencing GI side effects between individuals randomised to met-XR versus met-IR (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45–1.07, I² = 71%, p = 0.10), based on nine studies including 2164 participants (Fig. 5 a). Individuals randomised to met-DR versus met-IR were less than half as likely to experience any GI side effects (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.80, I² = N/A, p = 0.006), based on one study including 472 participants (Fig. 5 b). There was no significant difference in the likelihood of developing any GI side effects between individuals randomised to met-DR versus met-XR (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.32–2.19, I² = N/A, p = 0.72), in one study including 159 participants (Fig. 5 c). When each reported side effect was considered separately, randomisation to met-XR versus met-IR was associated with reduced likelihood of heartburn/dyspepsia and increased tolerability overall (Table 2). Randomisation to met-DR v met-IR was associated with reduced likelihood of nausea (Table 2). No studies comparing met-DR versus met-XR reported the likelihood of experiencing each side effect separately.

Cholesterol reduction — Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline recommendations specify statin treatment thresholds, targets, and monitoring for adults at metabolic risk. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 5.9 mmol/L), we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), we recommend a 10-year risk for ASCVD should be calculated. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy either to achieve an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences, to achieve either an LDL-C goal < 130 mg/dL (< 3.4 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of 30% to 50%. In individuals with metabolic risk, without diabetes, on statin therapy, we suggest monitoring glycemia at least annually to detect new-onset diabetes mellitus. In individuals aged > 75 years without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend discussing the benefits of statin therapy with the patient based on expected benefits vs possible risks/side effects; decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis and statin therapy should be calibrated to reach the recommended LDL targets.

Screening and classification of initial lipoprotein lipid levels — In all adults (≥ 20 years of age), a fasting or nonfasting lipoprotein profile should be obtained at least every 5 years and should include at minimum total cholesterol and HDL-C to allow calculation of non–HDL-C (total-C – HDL-C); if fasting (generally 9–12 hours), the LDL-C level may be calculated provided the triglyceride concentration is < 400 mg/dL. If atherogenic cholesterol levels (non–HDL-C and LDL-C) are in the desirable range, lipoprotein lipid measurement and ASCVD risk assessment should be repeated in 5 years, or sooner based on clinical judgment, with earlier rescreening prompted by changes in ASCVD risk factors (including weight gain), a premature ASCVD event in a first-degree relative, evidence of ASCVD in the patient, or a new potential secondary cause of dyslipidemia; for those with atherogenic cholesterol in the desirable range, public health recommendations regarding lifestyle should be emphasized.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/ m2, acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

### Long-term glycaemic improvement after addition of metformin to insulin in insulin-treated obese type 2 diabetes patients [^cb75a04c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the adjunct effect of metformin to insulin in type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Obese and overweight type 2 diabetes patients treated with insulin for at least 1 year, and with poor glycaemic control (HbA1c > upper reference level + 2%), were included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were treated for 12 months with either metformin (850 mg b.i.d.) or placebo added to their usual insulin, which was stabilized during a 3-month placebo run-in period, but thereafter attempted to be unchanged.

Results

Thirty-seven patients were included. Two patients dropped out during run-in. There were no differences between the metformin (n = 16) and placebo (n = 19) group at baseline. Most patients received multiple insulin injections. Metabolic control was improved by addition of metformin. Mean change in HbA1c from baseline showed highly significant difference between groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Mean change (percentage units ± s.d.) at 12 months was -1.1 ± 0.7% vs. + 0.3 ± 0.8% (p < 0.001) for HbA1c and -1.4 ± 2.1 mmol/l vs. + 0.6 ± 2.2 mmol/l (p = 0.025) for fasting blood glucose. Mean low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol change differed slightly at 6 months, but not at 12 months. There were no changes in insulin dose, blood pressure, body weight, triglycerides, total- and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, fibrinogen, C-peptide and laboratory safety variables, including serum B12. Combination therapy was well-tolerated with the same adverse event rate as insulin alone, but more patients with diarrhoea.

Conclusion

Addition of metformin to insulin induced and maintained clinically significant and consistent long-term reduction of hyperglycaemia in obese, insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients.

### Efficacy and side effect profile of different formulations of metformin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f4049f99]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide for a variety of indications. Although metformin has several important advantages, for example being easy to store and administer, it is associated with a high incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Slower-release formulations of metformin may reduce the incidence of side effects while maintaining efficacy; however, there is a lack of systematic evidence available to guide head-to-head comparisons between different metformin formulations.

Methods

PubMed, Web of Science, OVID EMBASE, MEDLINE, The Cochrane database and Clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched (from inception to 25 January 2021). Trials that randomized adult participants to extended-release formulation of metformin (met-XR), delayed-release (met-DR) or immediate-release metformin (met-IR) were included. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and risk-of-bias, with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer. Outcome measures were change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, BMI, lipid profile and side effects. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models.

Results

Fifteen studies (n = 3765) met eligibility criteria. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of met-IR, met-XR or met-DR in changing FPG (p = 0.93). A non-significant reduction in mean body weight was observed in individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR (− 1.03 kg, 95% CI − 2.12 to 0.05, p = 0.06). Individuals randomized to met-XR vs. met-IR had lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (− 5.73 mg/dl, 95% CI − 7.91 to − 3.56, p < 0.00001). Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.80, p = 0.006).

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate equal efficacy of longer-acting formulations (met-XR, met-DR) versus immediate-release metformin formulations in terms of glycaemic control. There were insufficient studies available to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations outside of diabetes care. However met-XR was associated with reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations, while met-DR was strongly associated with reduced GI side effects, which could improve drug compliance.

### Fenofibric acid (trilipix) [^a123907d]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

1.1 Co-administration Therapy with Statins for the Treatment of Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix is indicated as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin to reduce TG and increase HDL-C in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and CHD or a CHD risk equivalent who are on optimal statin therapy to achieve their LDL-C goal.

CHD risk equivalents comprise:

Other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease);
Diabetes;
Multiple risk factors that confer a 10-year risk for CHD > 20%

1.2 Treatment of Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Trilipix is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce TG in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of Trilipix therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.3 Treatment of Primary Hyperlipidemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Trilipix is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated LDL-C, Total-C, TG, and Apo B, and to increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.4 Important Limitations of Use

No incremental benefit of Trilipix on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality over and above that demonstrated for statin monotherapy has been established. Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 135 mg of Trilipix was not shown to reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in 2 large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

1.5 General Considerations for Treatment

Laboratory studies should be performed to establish that lipid levels are abnormal before instituting Trilipix therapy.

Every reasonable attempt should be made to control serum lipids with non-drug methods including appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that may be contributing to the lipid abnormalities. Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia (beta-blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible, and excessive alcohol intake should be addressed before triglyceride-lowering drug therapy is considered. If the decision is made to use lipid-altering drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

Risk of Bias and Sensitivity Analyses

The risk of bias was moderate-to-low in the majority of included studies; however two studies were open-label. Removal of these two studies did not substantively alter any outcomes, therefore all were included. We assessed the likelihood of single studies significantly influencing the overall results using LOO analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2) for met-IR v. met-XR comparisons. Two outcome measures investigated failed LOO analysis: change in body weight and likelihood of vomiting. This decreases our confidence of the robustness of these findings. Funnel plots for all outcomes were assessed visually (Supplementary Fig. S3); there were no obvious asymmetries in the plots for any study outcomes. All outcomes with more than five studies were subject to Egger's test, and all passed.

GRADE Analysis (Certainty of Evidence)

The majority of outcomes were classified as having a moderate certainty of evidence (Supplementary Fig. S4), with one outcome having a high certainty of evidence (LDL cholesterol). The moderate certainty of evidence was due to from five outcomes having high heterogeneity between studies and four outcomes having high degrees of imprecision in the derived estimates. No publication bias (as ascertained by the Egger's testing and funnel plot analyses) was detected. All studies reported direct evidence (Supplementary Fig. S4).

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^15ff86d1]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus (evaluation), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain a lipid profile at initiation of statins or other lipid-lowering therapy, 4–12 weeks after initiation or a change in dose, and annually thereafter, to facilitate monitoring the response to therapy and inform medication-taking behavior.

### Dasatinib improves insulin sensitivity and affects lipid metabolism in a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia [^40de694e]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 65-year-old woman had been visiting our department for the treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus since December 2012. Her glycated haemoglobin levels were well controlled (≈5.8% (40mmol/mol)) by metformin (500mg). In July 2014, her white cell count increased suddenly to 33530 cells/μL and she was diagnosed with Ph+ chronic myeloid leukaemia. She was started on dasatinib (100mg), which immediately normalised plasma levels of WCC. Dasatinib improved the glycaemic index to < 6.0% and also improved plasma levels of triglycerides (TGs) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c). Levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were increased but remained within the normal range. The TG:HDL-c ratio and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index rapidly improved. Followed by an improvement in insulin sensitivity, plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were increased. This case study suggests that dasatinib might have positive as well as negative effects on the metabolism of glucose and lipids.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^61abcbab]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia — drug therapy for triglyceride lowering and pancreatitis risk: We recommend that a fibrate be used as a first-line agent for reduction of triglycerides in patients at risk for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis, and we suggest that three drug classes (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids) alone or in combination with statins be considered as treatment options in patients with moderate to severe triglyceride levels. Three drug classes are clinically available for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia — fibrates, niacin, and n-3 fatty acids — and if the primary goal is to lower triglyceride levels, fibrates and perhaps n-3 fatty acids are best, whereas if the primary goal is to modify the size and density of LDL and HDL particles, niacin is best. Fibrates should be strongly considered in patients with severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia and should be considered in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia; fibrates decrease triglyceride levels by 30–50% and sometimes increase HDL cholesterol, and in patients with high triglyceride levels LDL cholesterol levels may increase, whereas in mild hypertriglyceridemia LDL cholesterol levels may decrease. There is inconsistency in the evidence base for cardiovascular risk reduction using fibrates, the use of niacin is associated with significant side effects, and there are limited data on the use of n-3 fatty acids to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Statin intolerance — NLA definition and management: Statin intolerance was defined by the panel as adverse symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities attributed by the patient (or provider) to the statin and in most cases perceived by the patient to interfere unacceptably with activities of daily living, leading to a decision to stop or reduce statin therapy; myalgia, defined as muscle aches, soreness, stiffness or tenderness, is the most frequently reported side effect of statin use with reports generally ranging from 1–5% in controlled clinical trials to 11–29% in observational studies. The NLA Statin Safety Panel stated that patients should be told that whether to continue taking the statin is their decision, but it is best guided by advice from their health care provider, and patients should be advised that before stopping a statin due to possible side effects, they should first speak to their health care provider. Even if statin intolerance is confirmed, in most cases the clinician and patient should attempt to maintain statin treatment in some form to reduce the patient's CVD event risk; options for continuing statin therapy include a lower daily dosage of the same statin, less than daily dosages of the same statin (optimally with a long-acting statin, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin), or use of an alternative statin, and patients who are initially intolerant to 1 statin can often tolerate a different statin. The highest tolerated dose of statin should be targeted, and other non-statin lipid-lowering drugs are options for patients with statin intolerance with consideration of their potential for side effects.

### Hyperandrogenism and cardiometabolic risk in pre-and postmenopausal women-what is the evidence? [^d25e6f52]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Dyslipidemia

Women with PCOS have a higher risk of adverse lipid profile. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (38 studies) comparing BMI-matched groups of women with PCOS and controls for different BMI categories demonstrated that triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non–high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were clearly increased in women with PCOS of reproductive age, independent of BMI category (Table 1). However, a Nordic cohort study showed that lipid profiling in women younger than age 35 years with PCOS and assessed as having low cardiovascular risk rarely changed the clinical care according to guidelines. In contrast, women with PCOS who also have type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension and are categorized as having high cardiovascular risk should be monitored with lipid profiling for potential treatment. Peri- and postmenopausal women with PCOS also have enhanced risk of adverse lipid profile, specifically decreased HDL and higher triglycerides, as demonstrated in a systematic review and meta-analysis. However, subgroup analysis of BMI-matched groups (13 studies) showed that only reduction in HDL in women with PCOS remained significant (Table 2). Overall, PCOS is associated with dyslipidemia, which is independent on BMI for women of reproductive age. However, in peri- and postmenopausal women, adverse lipid profile is largely dependent on BMI except for low HDL.

Dyslipidemia is a common condition also in women with ovarian hyperthecosis. Barth et al described 4 cases in which all had dyslipidemia. They were treated with GnRH agonist, which was highly effective in reducing the high testosterone levels and hirsutism, but 6 months of treatment had no effect on the lipid profile. Likewise, an adverse lipid profile has been reported in cases of androgen-secreting tumors.

CAH is associated with an elevated risk of dyslipidemia. Population-based register studies from Sweden and Korea reported increased OR of about 3.0 for dyslipidemia in women with CAH. Furthermore, an earlier British longitudinal cohort study showed that 48% of women with classic CAH had hypercholesterolemia. However, the influence of obesity, CAH phenotype, and genotype, as well as treatment with glucocorticoids and/or mineralocorticoids on the lipid profile has not been studied.

### Pioglitazone and metformin [^4ece1c6b]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Pioglitazone

Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. Pioglitazone enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values. In controlled clinical trials, pioglitazone had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].

Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone. Overall, patients treated with pioglitazone had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol. There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone or any other antidiabetic medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.15) and ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1)].

In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15-mg, 30-mg, and 45-mg pioglitazone dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group. Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone than in the placebo-treated patients. There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone compared to placebo (see Table 16).

In the two other monotherapy studies (16 weeks and 24 weeks) and in combination therapy studies with metformin (16 weeks and 24 weeks), the results were generally consistent with the data above.

### Screening for lipid disorders in adults: recommendation… [^12d450dd]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

B recommendation. Screening women at increased risk: The USPSTF strongly recommends screening women 45 years and older for lipid disorders if they are at increased risk of CHD. A recommendation. The USPSTF recommends screening women 20 to 45 years of age for lipid disorders if they are at increased risk of CHD. B recommendation. Screening young men and all women not at increased risk: The USPSTF makes no recommendation for or against routine screening for lipid disorders in men 20 to 35 years of age, or in women 20 years and older who are not at increased risk of CHD. C recommendation. Rationale. Importance There is good evidence that high levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are important risk factors for CHD. The risk of CHD is highest in persons with a combination of risk factors.

The 10-year risk of CHD is lowest in young men and in women who do not have other risk factors, even in the presence of abnormal lipid levels. Detection The USPSTF found good evidence that lipid measurement can identify asymptomatic men and women who are eligible for preventive therapy. Benefits of detection and early treatment. There is good evidence that lipid-lowering drug therapy substantially decreases the incidence of CHD in persons with abnormal lipid levels. The absolute benefits of lipid-lowering treatment depend on a person's underlying risk of CHD. Men older than 35 years and women older than 45 years who are at increased risk of CHD will realize a substantial benefit from treatment. Younger adults with multiple risk factors for CHD, including dyslipidemia, will realize a moderate benefit from treatment. Younger men and women without risk factors for CHD will realize a small benefit from treatment, as seen in the risk reduction in 10-year CHD event rate.

Harms of detection and early treatment. There is good evidence that the harms from screening and treatment are small, and include possible labeling and the adverse effects associated with lipid-lowering therapy. USPSTF assessment The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in all men 35 years and older, and women 45 years and older at increased risk of CHD substantially outweigh the potential harms. The USPSTF concludes that the benefits of screening for and treating lipid disorders in young adults at increased risk of CHD moderately outweigh the potential harms. The USPSTF concludes that the net benefits of screening for lipid disorders in young adults not at increased risk of CHD are not sufficient to make a general recommendation.

Clinical Considerations Lipid disorders, also called dyslipidemias, are abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism and include elevations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or triglycerides; or deficiencies of HDL cholesterol. These disorders can be acquired or familial. This recommendation applies to adults 20 years and older who have not previously been diagnosed with dyslipidemia. Increased risk, for the purposes of this recommendation, is defined by the presence of any one of the risk factors listed. The greatest risk of CHD is conferred by a combination of multiple factors. Although the USPSTF did not use a specific numerical risk for this recommendation, the framework used by the USPSTF in making these recommendations relies on a 10-year risk of cardiovascular events. 1: Diabetes Personal history of CHD or noncoronary atherosclerosis (e.g.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.

Special cases for statin combination and other combination therapies — among patients who require multiple LDL-C–lowering therapies (e.g., intolerant to statins or familial hypercholesterolemia) combining statin and therapies with different mechanisms of action and in the order above is recommended, with careful consideration of cost and polypharmacy risks. In atherogenic dyslipidemia with elevated triglycerides (TG) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) plus low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), options include therapies that mainly lower TG and VLDL-C such as fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids; prescription omega-3 fatty acids are currently only indicated for patients with TG ≥ 500 mg/dL. Colesevelam may worsen TG, especially in those with levels ≥ 200 mg/dL at baseline, and niacin may be used in patients with stable type 2 diabetes for lipid management with monitoring of glucose control.

Progressive atherosclerosis or recurrent events despite evidence-based therapy — NLA Expert Panel consensus emphasizes that "little evidence is available from RCTs" to guide such patients on high-intensity statins; "very aggressive therapy to lower atherogenic cholesterol levels to values well below goal thresholds may be considered", although "this approach is not clearly supported by clinical trial evidence". Additional evaluation "such as an elevated level of Lp(a) or other additional risk indicators may be warranted", and "nonlipid risk factors should be well controlled in such patients".

### Isolated low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C): implications of global risk reduction. case report and systematic scientific review [^08a77e1d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The importance of low HDL-C and cardiovascular disease associated with the lipid triad (Low HDL-C, elevated triglycerides, and increased small dense LDL-C) found in the metabolic syndrome (metS) and overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a contributing factor to the elevated non HDL-C discussed in the current NCEP ATP III guidelines or the patients with isolated low HDL-C is rapidly evolving.

The accelerated atherosclerosis (atheroscleropathy) associated with the metS and T2DM has been previously reviewed and is definitely a serious problem associated with the current epidemic of obesity – diabesity and T2DM.

Both isolated low HDL-C and elevated non HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-C) levels are difficult to get to known NCEP ATP III recommendations and this task usually requires combination therapy. These therapies consist of therapeutic life style changes and pharmacotherapy including statins, fibrates, selective cholesterol inhibitors such as ezetimibe, and niacin in addition to a global risk reduction of all non HDL-C existing risk factors (table 2).

Table 2
Effects of drugs on HDL-C levels

In this case report a focus on isolated low HDL-C is appropriate. This case report demonstrates a marked improvement of all lipid parameters including his low HDL-C. However, this marked improvement is not always as simple as this case and therefore, both the patient and the clinician need to be very patient, as well as, creative in order to achieve global risk reduction.

Isolated low HDL-C

In 1977 the Tromso Heart Study demonstrated that CAD patients have HDL-C levels 35% lower than controls and those patients with low HDL-C are three times more likely to develop CAD than those with elevated LDL-C. These early views certainly support the concept that an isolated low HDL-C is a common antecedent of clinical CHD, as well as being important in accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis.

The inverse relation of HDL-C to CHD events has been widely discussed since the original publication of data from the Framingham study (1986). Castelli WP et al. were able to show an inverse association of high HDL-C and low coronary risk was as statically as strong as the direct association of high LDL-C and high coronary risk in a cohort of men and women age 40–82 followed for 12 years who were free from CAD at study entry. At any level of cholesterol low HDL-C increases the rate of CHD

### Metformin use in prediabetes: a review of evidence and a focus on metabolic features among peri-menopausal women [^2331ec4c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 The Rebuttal

Despite these contending views, metformin remains the cornerstone of pharmacological management in prediabetes for a couple of reasons. To start with, Herman et al.proposed that metformin should be used in high‐risk individuals meeting DPP eligibility criteria, as it offers proven benefits in preventing T2D and associated complications. He further noted that there was often a 3–8 years delay between the onset and diagnosis of T2D, during which many patients already develop microvascular complications. Therefore, early intervention with metformin — an effective, safe and cost‐efficient drug — can help mitigate diabetes progression before complications manifest. Secondly, while lifestyle modifications may be superior to metformin monotherapy, it heavily depends on the patients' compliance and the intensity of the lifestyle moderation. Indeed, as shown in the Look AHEAD study, most participants regained their body weight 1 year after receiving lifestyle intervention. Realistically, while lifestyle modifications remain the first line in all treatment, they may be inadequate in the management of high‐risk individuals with prediabetes, particularly in those who are not fit for intense physical activity or have dietary restrictions. In fact, the Look AHEAD trial also showed that intensive weight‐loss lifestyle modifications subsequently proved limited in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events in overweight or obese adults with T2D. Only those participants with significant weight loss of 5–10% showed reduced cardiovascular risks. Therefore, a pharmacological option in prediabetes management remains relevant and necessary in clinical practice in high‐risk prediabetic populations.

The efficacy, safety and cost‐effectiveness of metformin therapy have been established among very high‐risk individuals. The likelihood of achieving beneficial effects is greatest when metformin is prescribed to those who meet the DPP eligibility criteria. Given the variability in treatment response, metformin therapy should be prioritized for individuals at highest risk — such as younger, more obese, more hyperglycaemic individuals, including women with a history of GDM.

Inclisiran — evidence base and recommendation: Recommendation 4 states there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against inclisiran. The evidence review was derived from 5 randomized clinical trials including 4226 participants, with follow-up ranging from 8 to 21 months; the latter 3 phase 3 trials tested inclisiran at the currently approved dose of 284 mg for a period of 18 months. Phase 3 trials included adults at increased cardiovascular risk taking maximally tolerated statin doses or no statin due to intolerance with elevated LDL-C thresholds (≥ 70 mg/dL with ASCVD; ≥ 100 mg/dL if with an ASCVD equivalent), where ASCVD equivalents included HeFH, T2D, or a 10-year risk of ≥ 20% using the PCE for CVD or equivalent; participants were allowed to continue statins (if tolerated) and ezetimibe. Overall, there were few trials and events and the CIs included appreciable potential benefit and harm, and the event rates of outcomes were low, so the task force made no recommendation due to insufficient evidence.

### Metformin and body weight [^20cf6b09]. International Journal of Obesity (2008). Low credibility.

Most patients with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, overweight or obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and obesity per se is strongly associated with multiple cardiometabolic risk factors. However, many antidiabetic treatments increase body weight. The oral antidiabetic agent, metformin, has been evaluated in hundreds of clinical studies in diverse patient populations during approximately five decades of clinical use. This review summarizes the effects of metformin on body weight, with special reference to studies of longer duration (≥ 6 months) as both diabetes and obesity are long-term conditions. Approximately half of studies in drug-naive type 2 diabetic patients demonstrated significant weight loss with metformin compared with baseline or comparator drugs, although pooled analyses have suggested no significant effect versus placebo. Similarly, metformin has been shown to induce weight loss in obese nondiabetic populations, although studies of long duration in this population are scarce. Metformin does appear to mitigate the adverse effects of insulin on body weight. The weight-neutral or weight-sparing effects of metformin constitute a therapeutic advantage in diabetes management where other first-line oral antidiabetic treatments often promote clinically significant weight gain.

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds — evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of < 100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of < 130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤ 100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥ 100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of < 55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that "normal" very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are < 150 mg/dL is typically ≤ 30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically > 30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### Fenofibric acid (Fenofibric acid delayed-release) [^4ce1cf64]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

1.1 Treatment of Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce triglycerides (TG) in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetic patients showing fasting chylomicronemia will usually obviate the need for pharmacological intervention. Markedly elevated levels of serum triglycerides (e.g. > 2,000 mg/dL) may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. The effect of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules therapy on reducing this risk has not been adequately studied.

1.2 Treatment of Primary Hypercholesterolemia or Mixed Dyslipidemia

Fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules are indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (Total-C), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

1.3 Limitations of Use

Fenofibrate at a dose equivalent to 135 mg of fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules did not reduce coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in 2 large, randomized controlled trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

1.4 General Considerations for Treatment

Laboratory studies should be performed to establish that lipid levels are abnormal before instituting fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules therapy.

Every reasonable attempt should be made to control serum lipids with non-drug methods including appropriate diet, exercise, weight loss in obese patients, and control of any medical problems such as diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism that may be contributing to the lipid abnormalities. Medications known to exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia (beta-blockers, thiazides, estrogens) should be discontinued or changed if possible, and excessive alcohol intake should be addressed before triglyceride-lowering drug therapy is considered. If the decision is made to use lipid-altering drugs, the patient should be instructed that this does not reduce the importance of adhering to diet.

Drug therapy is not indicated for patients who have elevations of chylomicrons and plasma triglycerides, but who have normal levels of VLDL.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^e21c004d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations.

Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl. Editor's Note: Dr. Arnold is a contributing editor for American Family Physician.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — diabetes and severe hypercholesterolemia: In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^ff93c869]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA dyslipidemia recommendations — atherogenic cholesterol lowering and ASCVD risk: For statin therapy, every 38.7 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduced major vascular events by 22% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.76–0.80; P < .001) after approximately 5 years; reductions in LDL-C of 77.4 and 116.1 mg/dL would be expected to reduce the risk of a major vascular event by 40% and 53%, respectively. Over approximately 5 years, each 1% reduction in LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is associated with an approximately 1% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) event risk. With high intensity statin therapy, the best average LDL-C reduction (~50%) would be associated with ~50% reduction in CHD events or ~40% reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events assuming a mean untreated LDL-C of 150 mg/dL and a 75 mg/dL reduction. Lifelong genetic evidence suggests that ASCVD risk reduction per 1% atherogenic cholesterol lowering may be greater, with reductions of ~3% per 1% lower LDL-C concentration over decades.

When considering pioglitazone as a third‐line agent, it is important to compare its efficacy and safety with alternatives like GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and DPP‐4 inhibitors. GLP‐1RAs offer strong glycaemic control, weight loss and cardiovascular benefits but may be limited by injection requirements and cost. DPP‐4 inhibitors are an oral option with low hypoglycaemia risk but provide modest HbA1c reductions. The choice should depend on factors such as cardiovascular risk, weight concerns, hypoglycaemia risk, cost and patient preferences. Pioglitazone may benefit patients with high insulin resistance, while GLP‐1RAs may be better for those with obesity. This personalised approach aligns with patient‐centred care guidelines.

While significant, the modest weight gain observed with pioglitazone addition appears less pronounced than historically reported with pioglitazone monotherapy, suggesting a partial counterbalancing effect of SGLT2 inhibitors. This finding may help clinicians in shared decision‐making discussions with patients, particularly when weighing the benefits of improved glycaemic control against potential weight effects.

The neutral cardiovascular safety profile and improved HDL‐C levels suggest that this triple therapy combination may suit patients with established cardiovascular disease. However, more extensive outcome studies would be needed to confirm cardiovascular benefits.

### Factors influencing initial choice of insulin therapy in a large international non-interventional study of people with type 2 diabetes [^035eb054]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Insulin therapy is not usually started when T2DM is diagnosed, except where co-morbid conditions or therapy contribute to more extreme hyperglycaemia. Only when the target HbA1c level is no longer attained with one or more oral glucose-lowering agents are insulin injections, or sometimes glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetics, normally started. Participants in the CREDIT study in general followed that pattern as more than two-thirds had previously taken two or more oral agents, mostly metformin and sulphonylureas. However, in general, they had been allowed to deteriorate to levels of glucose control well over target levels, as evidenced by elevated HbA1c, FPG and PPG. Similar poor glycaemic control across countries in people with T2DM starting insulin has been reported previously and appears to be common in clinical practice worldwide.

Duration of diabetes when starting insulin was generally around 10 years, but it is not possible from the current study to know how long uncontrolled hyperglycaemia had been allowed to persist before starting insulin, nor what other therapeutic attempts had been made to control it. The published literature suggests that HbA1c is higher at each step or addition of a new medication, suggesting that the late starting of insulin is just another part of a worsening continuum of failure to achieve glucose control targets. This in turn suggests that either glucose control deteriorates faster than physicians believe that they need to titrate therapy or that the barriers to therapy titration worsen with number of therapies or both.

That the problem is a systematic management issue related to use of therapies and control of metabolic risk factors, rather than control of glucose levels and use of insulin, is supported by the observation that other management was also not optimal. While the problem of obesity may be unmanageable in many people with current therapeutic tools, the elevated mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels and omissions of therapy to control these, in addition to the similar blood pressure management findings, suggest a global failure of preventative care rather than a problem related to one specific cardiovascular risk factor. In this regard, it can be seen that statin use was lowest in Eastern Europe and Japan, the countries with the highest LDL-cholesterol levels at the time of insulin initiation. This prescribing pattern was echoed for antiplatelet agents, but for blood pressure lowering agents, the pattern is less clear, partly due to different patterns of use of different antihypertensive agents (such as high renin angiotensin system blockade in Eastern Europe) and the lower prevalence of hypertension in the Japanese participants.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — statin therapy implementation recommendations include the following: A clinician-patient risk discussion is recommended before initiation of statin therapy to review net clinical benefit, weighing the potential for ASCVD risk reduction against the potential for statin-associated side effects, statin-drug interactions, and safety, while emphasizing that side effects can be addressed successfully. In patients with indication for statin therapy, identification of potential predisposing factors for statin-associated side effects, including new-onset diabetes mellitus and statin-associated muscle symptoms, is recommended before initiation of treatment. In patients with statin-associated side effects that are not severe, it is recommended to reassess and to rechallenge to achieve a maximal LDL-C lowering by modified dosing regimen, an alternate statin or in combination with nonstatin therapy. In patients at increased ASCVD risk with severe statin-associated muscle symptoms or recurrent statin-associated muscle symptoms despite appropriate statin rechallenge, it is reasonable to use RCT-proven nonstatin therapy that is likely to provide net clinical benefit.

Discussion

Main Findings

Our findings suggest that in people with T2DM and/or PCOS there were no significant differences in efficacy of glycaemic control between all included metformin formulations (IR, XR and DR), based on change in FPG and in HbA1c after treatment. In addition, our analyses showed very similar reductions in FPG with randomisation to met-XR versus met-DR across a range of clinically relevant doses. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of weight loss experienced by patients randomised to different metformin formulations or in the change in their BMI during treatment. However, patients randomised to met-XR had significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels compared to those randomised to met-IR. GI side effects were markedly reduced in patients randomised to longer-acting metformin preparations compared to met-IR, particularly with met-DR.

Strengths

Our analyses provides the first systematic comparison of the three formulations of metformin that have currently been trialled in head-to-head trials. Meta-regression and extensive sensitivity analyses have been performed to optimise comparisons between available studies and to leverage all existing data, despite methodological differences between the original studies, for example in dosing and study length. There are few previous syntheses of data directly comparing preparations of metformin. A previous comprehensive review concluded that side effects were reduced with met-XR compared to IR, but predated the availability of the new met-DR formulation.

Limitations

The drawing of definitive conclusions from our meta-analysis was limited by both the quantity and quality of the studies available. In particular, there was a lack of studies involving comparisons of individuals randomised to met-DR vs. met-IR (one study; n = 571) or met-DR vs. met-XR (two studies; n = 260). We thus suggest a cautious view regarding the interpretation of these comparisons. Our results highlight the need for more high-quality studies investigating optimal use of various metformin formulations, particularly in patient populations other than type 2 diabetes. Moreover, if more and higher quality data were available then non-significant effects, for example reduction in total cholesterol levels with met-XR v. met-IR, might reach significance, as would be expected from the observed reduction in LDL cholesterol. While metformin is prescribed for a range of clinical indications, the studies available for inclusion in our meta-analysis were limited mainly to populations with T2DM. We were thus only able to compare the efficacy of different metformin formulations for outcomes related to T2DM: glycaemic control, body weight and lipid profiles.

### Obesity and diabetes-not only a simple link between two epidemics [^54154a54]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Up to now, greatest experience in adjuvant therapy concerns metformin. Its positive potential is based on the theory of the coexistence of T1D and insulin resistance, what is especially important in obese or pubertal patients. 15, 23 Metformin, which remains since many years the first‐choice treatment in T2D, sensitizes tissues to insulin activity; however, many studies that assessed its use in T1D did not come to an unequivocal conclusion concerning the effects of its application. 24, 25, 26, 27 Two meta‐analyses assessing the efficacy and safety of adjuvant therapy with metformin in adolescents with T1D indicate however numerous advantages that result from its use, especially in patients with insufficient glycaemic control. 28, 29 The study by Liu and co‐authors underlined additional metabolic effects related to this adjuvant treatment, including the decrease of the total, high‐density lipoprotein, and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. 29 Burchardt and co‐authors in 2 independent randomized investigations revealed a significant positive impact of metformin in adjuvant treatment on triglyceride concentrations as well as on the levels of glycated low‐density lipoprotein that have atherogenic properties. In consequence, such a therapy reduced the carotid intima‐media thickness. 27, 30

3.3 Obesity and T1D complications

Intensive insulin treatment in T1D on one hand reduces the risk of microvascular complications but on the other may be responsible for the development of the CVD as well as that induced by obesity metabolic syndrome (MS). Insulin resistance as well as other components of the MS are presently increasingly commonly accounted to the chronic complications of T1D, and CVD becomes the leading cause of death among patients older than 30 years. 15, 31

Both T1D and CVD are known to be associated with an increased risk of mortality. In ADOC study, T1D patients had higher mortality rates than nondiabetic controls, and ischaemic heart disease was one of the factors that increased mortality risk. Interestingly, in this study, obesity was associated with lower mortality, and this effect has been called "obesity paradox". 32 Few studies also suggested higher relative risk of mortality in females than in males with T1D. 32, 33

Another complication of T1D, which is also related to CVD, is diabetic nephropathy (diabetic kidney disease — DKD). 34 In patients with T1D with DKD, obesity is twice as common as among those without concomitant DKD. 35 Improperly high BMI was also described as a possible risk factor of the development of diabetic retinopathy. 36 As a consequence of all, the above patients with T1D, especially teenagers, tended to assess their health condition worse. 14, 18

Atherogenic cholesterol and ASCVD risk — Non–HDL-C has been regularly shown to be a better predictor of ASCVD event risk than LDL-C, and the panel included both LDL-C and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C is the sum of LDL-C and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol) as atherogenic cholesterol components. Reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced, and numerous clinical trials of atherogenic cholesterol–lowering therapies have demonstrated their ability to reduce the incidence of ASCVD in proportion to the amount of LDL-C and non–HDL-C reduction. Examinations of on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration compared with coronary heart disease (CHD) events in primary and secondary prevention also show a strong positive correlation, with effects evident with drug, diet/lifestyle, and surgical therapies and across the full spectrum of LDL-C and non–HDL-C levels. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' meta-analysis reported that a 1.0 mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) change in LDL-C resulted in a 22% relative risk reduction.

Adipocentric and multiorgan paradigms — type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) causation and treatment framing emphasize that major risk factors for T2DM include body fat, age ≥ 45, physical inactivity, and family history and race, yet not all cases of common metabolic diseases are attributable to increased body fat; some cases of T2DM can be caused by rare conditions (e.g., hemochromatosis, hypercortisolism, excessive growth hormone, pancreatic insufficiency, side effects of concomitant therapies, and genetic syndromes of insulin resistance or limited pancreatic insulin secretion), and T2DM can worsen due to reduced body fat as in lipodystrophy. Despite multiorgan complexity, increased body fat is described as a consistent potentially modifiable major risk factor for pre-diabetes/T2DM and other metabolic diseases, and body fat is often modifiable. The adipocentric paradigm helps explain why healthful nutrition, routine physical activity, behavior modification, anti-obesity medication, and bariatric procedures may improve weight, metabolic diseases, and cardiometabolic risk factors, and it states that pre-obesity/obesity may often be considered the most clinically relevant treatment target and priority for patients without adverse acute complications.

Follow-up visits for atherogenic cholesterol management — if goal levels have not been achieved, the statin dosage may be increased or the patient might be switched to a more efficacious agent; after an adequate trial of the highest intensity statin therapy tolerated, the clinician may consider referral to a lipid specialist or addition of a second cholesterol-lowering agent. Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.
