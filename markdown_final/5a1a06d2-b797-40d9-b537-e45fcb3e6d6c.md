## Question

For a 16-year-old female with thick nasal discharge and facial swelling following a course of amoxicillin for an upper respiratory infection, would intranasal fluticasone or mometasone be beneficial?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intranasal corticosteroids such as fluticasone or mometasone would be beneficial for a 16-year-old with thick nasal discharge and facial swelling following a course of amoxicillin for an upper respiratory infection, and is seeking clear recommendations with supporting references.

> In a 16-year-old with persistent thick nasal discharge and facial swelling after amoxicillin, the presentation remains most consistent with acute rhinosinusitis, and ongoing symptoms likely reflect mucosal inflammation rather than persistent bacterial infection; guidelines emphasize that many ARS episodes are self-limited and supportive care, including intranasal corticosteroids (INCS), can reduce symptom burden while antibiotics offer limited incremental benefit outside of specific bacterial criteria [^111khKvo] [^114RCeCn].

> Evidence supports INCS for acute rhinosinusitis symptom improvement, particularly for congestion and facial pain/pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 2,495 patients showed a modest but significant increase in resolution or improvement at 14–21 days, with the clearest benefit by day 21, and most trials allowed concomitant antibiotics, mirroring post-antibiotic scenarios like this case [^111Nbh4u] [^1114LYnv] [^114vJmXR].

> Trial data directly inform agent selection and dosing: mometasone furoate 200 mcg twice daily outperformed both placebo and amoxicillin for major symptom and total symptom scores beginning as early as day 2, and increased minimal-symptom days versus placebo and amoxicillin over a 15–21 day course, supporting use after antibiotic non-response [^113Fjmks] [^115dFxVw].

> Fluticasone propionate has supportive evidence as an adjunct in patients with recurrent or chronic histories experiencing an acute episode, with higher clinical success and faster improvement versus placebo when combined with standard antibiotic therapy, suggesting class benefit even in more refractory phenotypes [^116Dba4e].

> Safety in adolescents is favorable: second-generation INCS (mometasone, fluticasone) have negligible systemic bioavailability, and pediatric meta-analysis shows no persistent HPA axis or ocular abnormalities and no significant signal for epistaxis or headache versus placebo; local epistaxis is generally mild and technique-dependent, which can be mitigated by proper spray use [^114oJ5RG] [^113JnYdb] [^113JnYdb].

> Practical recommendation: initiate mometasone furoate nasal spray 200 mcg per nostril daily, with consideration of 200 mcg twice daily for more severe symptoms as used in ARS trials, and continue for at least 2–3 weeks to capture the time-to-benefit demonstrated in RCTs and meta-analyses; fluticasone (propionate or furoate) is an acceptable alternative given comparable class efficacy and safety [^1141oJX9] [^111Nbh4u] [^113cEJRR] [^113SWWw2].

> Adjunctive measures such as isotonic saline irrigation can further reduce symptom severity and are recommended as supportive therapy; reassess at 2–3 weeks and escalate evaluation (e.g., imaging, ENT referral) if symptoms fail to improve or if red flags emerge, including severe/progressive facial swelling, orbital pain, visual changes, or neurologic signs suggestive of complications [^111khKvo].

> Bottom line: Yes — INCS are likely to benefit this adolescent with persistent ARS symptoms after amoxicillin, with the most direct ARS evidence favoring mometasone furoate 200 mcg twice daily for 15–21 days, while fluticasone is a reasonable alternative; expected benefits in congestion and facial pain/pressure outweigh minimal risks when used with correct technique and appropriate monitoring [^1141oJX9] [^115dFxVw] [^111Nbh4u] [^113JnYdb].

Intranasal fluticasone or mometasone is **likely beneficial** [^111khKvo] and would be helpful for a 16-year-old with thick nasal discharge and facial swelling after amoxicillin for a URI. Intranasal corticosteroids reduce nasal inflammation, congestion, and facial pressure in acute rhinosinusitis [^116Dba4e], with **modest symptom relief** [^111Nbh4u] and **low systemic absorption** [^114oJ5RG]. They are **safe in adolescents** [^113JnYdb], with minimal systemic effects and rare local side effects (mild epistaxis, irritation) [^111JATmB]. Use fluticasone propionate 100–200 mcg daily [^113cEJRR] or mometasone furoate 100–200 mcg daily [^1141oJX9] for **2–3 weeks** [^111Nbh4u], and **reassess** if symptoms persist or worsen [^114RCeCn].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting intranasal corticosteroids

Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) reduce nasal inflammation, congestion, and facial pressure in acute rhinosinusitis [^1114LYnv]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found **modest symptom relief**, particularly for facial pain and congestion [^111Nbh4u], with benefits most pronounced at 21 days — supporting an approximately three-week course.

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical efficacy

Fluticasone and mometasone are second-generation INCS with high glucocorticoid receptor affinity [^114oJ5RG], potent anti-inflammatory effects, and **minimal systemic absorption** [^116Xuqhq]. Clinical studies show both agents significantly reduce nasal congestion, discharge, and facial pressure in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^116Dba4e] [^111GLs1U].

---

## Safety profile in pediatric and adolescent populations

Intranasal corticosteroids have a **favorable safety profile** in pediatric and adolescent populations [^111JATmB]. A systematic review and meta-analysis found no persistent cortisol abnormalities or intraocular pressure changes with INCS use in children [^113JnYdb]; although a minority of trials reported reduced growth velocity, INCS were overall considered safe at recommended doses [^113JnYdb]. Common local adverse effects include mild epistaxis and nasal irritation [^111GLs1U], which are generally self-limited and rarely require discontinuation. Systemic adverse effects — such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression or growth retardation — are **rare** [^116Xuqhq] due to minimal systemic absorption [^113JnYdb].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

For a 16-year-old, recommended dosing is: **fluticasone propionate** 100–200 mcg intranasally once daily (maximum 200 mcg/day) [^113cEJRR] or **mometasone furoate** 100–200 mcg intranasally once daily (maximum 200 mcg/day) [^113Fjmks]. Proper **administration technique** is essential: gently blow the nose before dosing, aim the spray away from the nasal septum, and avoid forceful sniffing after spraying.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) recommend intranasal corticosteroids as **first-line therapy** for symptomatic relief in acute and chronic rhinosinusitis [^114RCeCn] [^113mEew1] [^114q8wyq]. They also endorse INCS use in pediatric and adolescent populations given their favorable safety and efficacy profiles [^113mEew1].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Intranasal corticosteroids, such as fluticasone and mometasone, are **effective and safe** [^116Dba4e] for managing thick nasal discharge and facial swelling in adolescents following a URI. They provide **modest symptom relief** [^111Nbh4u] — particularly for nasal congestion and facial pressure — with **minimal systemic absorption** [^114oJ5RG], supporting use in pediatric patients. A course of about three weeks is reasonable, with **reassessment** if symptoms persist or worsen.

### Molecular and clinical pharmacology of intranasal corticosteroids: Clinical and therapeutic implications [^114oJ5RG]. Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) are effective treatments for allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis. In recent years, increased understanding of corticosteroid and glucocorticoid receptor pharmacology has enabled the development of molecules designed specifically to achieve potent, localized activity with minimal risk of systemic exposure. Pharmacologic potency studies using affinity and other assessments have produced similar rank orders of potency, with the most potent being mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and its modification, fluticasone furoate. The furoate and propionate ester side chains render these agents highly lipophilic, which may facilitate their absorption through nasal mucosa and uptake across phospholipid cell membranes. These compounds demonstrate negligible systemic absorption.

Systemic absorption rates are higher among the older corticosteroids (flunisolide, beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, and budesonide), which have bioavailabilities in the range of 34–49%. Studies, including one-year studies with mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and budesonide that evaluated potential systemic effects of INSs in children, have generally found no adverse effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function or growth. Clinical data suggest no significant differences in efficacy between the INSs. Theoretically, newer agents with lower systemic availability may be preferable and may come closer to the pharmacokinetic/pharmacologic criteria for the ideal therapeutic choice.

### Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nbh4u]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common condition in ambulatory care, where it is frequently treated with antibiotics, despite little evidence of their benefit. Intranasal corticosteroids might relieve symptoms; however, evidence for this benefit is currently unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on the symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases until February 2011 for studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids with placebo in children or adults having clinical symptoms and signs of acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in ambulatory settings. We excluded chronic/allergic sinusitis. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' methodological quality.

- **Results**: We included 6 studies with a total of 2,495 patients. In 5 studies, antibiotics were prescribed in addition to corticosteroids or placebo. Intranasal corticosteroids resulted in a significant, small increase in resolution or improvement of symptoms at days 14 to 21 (risk difference [RD] = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03–0.13). Analysis of individual symptom scores revealed most consistently significant benefits for facial pain and congestion. Subgroup analysis by time of reported outcomes showed a significant beneficial effect at 21 days (RD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.17), but not at 14 to 15 days (RD = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11). Meta-regression analysis of trials using different doses of mometasone furoate sho

### Intranasal corticosteroid therapy: Systematic review and meta-analysis of reported safety and adverse effects in children [^113JnYdb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to address concerns related to the safety profile of both Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and non-FDA-approved intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) use in the pediatric population.

The data sources included a systematic review of MEDLINE, PubMed, and EMBASE databases using a comprehensive search strategy, encompassing all INCS formulations and adverse events. The study design was developed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with additional sources identified from study references of relevant articles.

- **Review methods**: A structured literature search was conducted. Extracted data included age, population size, study design, drug (dosage, route, and frequency), presence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, ocular symptoms, and growth velocity adverse events.

- **Results**: A total of 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies included the use of INCS as nasal sprays and drops. There were no persistent abnormalities noted in cortisol levels or intraocular pressure change. Growth velocity reduction was reported in 3 of 10 randomized trials. Meta-analysis of epistaxis and headache showed no significant difference in the incidence of headache or epistaxis when FDA-approved INCSs were compared to placebo, with a relative risk of 1.12 (95% CI, 0.77–1.63; p = 0.56) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.60–1.18; p = 0.32), respectively. Meta-analysis was not performed for growth velocity, HPA axis suppression, and ocular change.

The conclusions suggest that INCSs, in FDA-approved routes of administration, are generally safe to use in the pediatric population.

### Are you comfortable with over-the-counter intranasal steroids for children? A call to action [^114VnXyW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

The early expression of allergic rhinitis in children is a potential red flag for lifelong problems and comorbid conditions. However, treating pediatric allergic rhinitis in the United States is trending toward a self-management or parental management model with little clinical supervision, reflecting changes in the delivery of health care. Of particular concern are the recent approval of an over-the-counter intranasal steroid to treat nasal allergy symptoms in adults and children as young as age 2 years, and the push for a retail model of health care as exists in some other countries. For children with allergic rhinitis, treating nasal symptoms alone with over-the-counter products may further delay a diagnosis that is often already ignored due to its "annoyance factor" as opposed to being considered a serious health issue. How to ensure an appropriate diagnosis and management for these children remains a challenge, regardless of who is doing the treating. The call to action is for allergists and allergy medical organizations to drive the effort to ensure awareness of why and how to appropriately diagnose and treat allergic rhinitis in children. Starting points for the discussion are provided.

### Treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis with oral steroids followed by topical steroids: A randomized trial [^116xAogS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyposis is a common condition, yet the long-term efficacy and safety of medical management approaches remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 2-week regimen of oral steroid therapy followed by 26 weeks of sequential topical steroid maintenance therapy.

This was a parallel randomized trial with computer-generated block randomization and central allocation. Both patients and investigators were blinded to group assignment. The ClinicalTrials.gov registration number is NCT00788749. The study was conducted at a specialty rhinology clinic in Tayside, Scotland.

The trial involved 60 adults with CRS and moderate-sized or larger nasal polyps who were referred by their primary physicians for specialty care. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral prednisolone, 25 mg/d, or a placebo for 2 weeks. This was followed in both groups by fluticasone propionate nasal drops, 400 µg twice daily, for 8 weeks and then fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 200 µg twice daily, for 18 weeks.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was polyp grading. Other measures included hyposmia score, quality of life, symptoms, nasal patency, adrenal function, and bone turnover.

- **Results**: The mean decrease in polyp grade from baseline to 2 weeks was 2.1 units (SD, 1.1) in the prednisolone group, compared to 0.1 unit (SD, 1.0) in the placebo group (mean difference between groups, -1.8 units [95% CI, -2.4 to -1.2 units]; P < 0.001). At 10 weeks, the difference between groups was -1.08 units (CI, -1.74 to -0.42 units; P = 0.001), and at 28 weeks, the difference was -0.8 unit (CI, -1.8 to 0.2 unit; P = 0.11).

This study highlights the initial effectiveness of oral steroids in reducing polyp size in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, although the difference diminishes over time.

### Corticosteroids for the common cold [^115GAjA5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

The common cold is a frequent illness that, although benign and self-limiting, results in many consultations to primary care and considerable loss of school or work days. Symptomatic treatments have limited benefit. Corticosteroids are an effective treatment for other upper respiratory tract infections, and their anti-inflammatory effects may also be beneficial in the common cold. This updated review includes one additional study.

- **Objectives**: To compare corticosteroids versus usual care for the common cold on measures of symptom resolution and improvement in children and adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 4), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's specialised register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 2), NHS Health Economics Database (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1948 to May week 3, 2015), and EMBASE (January 2010 to May 2015).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind, controlled trials comparing corticosteroids to placebo or to standard clinical management.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We were unable to perform meta-analysis and instead present a narrative description of the available evidence.

- **Main results**: We included three trials (353 participants). Two trials compared intranasal corticosteroids to placebo, and one trial compared intranasal corticosteroids to usual care. No trials studied oral corticosteroids. In the two placebo-controlled trials, no benefit.

### A prospective study on the efficacy of mometasone furoate monohydrate aqueous nasal spray on Chinese patients with allergic rhinitis [^115z5ija]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We undertook a prospective study of the efficacy of a new intranasal steroid, mometasone furoate nasal spray (Nasonex; Schering-Plough Corp, Kenilworth, NJ).

- **Study design**: Chinese patients with allergic rhinitis were recruited and assessed using a questionnaire that included demographic data and a Rhinitis Symptoms Score. Objective assessments of the nasal passages were conducted with a 2.7-mm 30-degree rigid nasoendoscope and scored using the modified Lund and Kennedy sinusitis staging for endoscopic appearances of the nasal cavity in rhinosinusitis. Assessments occurred before treatment, after which 200 microg/d MFNS was prescribed. Patients were reevaluated after 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. A total of 51 patients completed the 16-week study.

- **Results**: There were significant reductions in the mean Rhinitis Symptoms Score from 6.19 to 3.8 (P < 0.001) and in the mean Endoscopic Appearance Score from 4.6 to 3.58 (P = 0.046). Analysis showed reductions in the severity of all three aspects of rhinitis symptoms: rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal obstruction.

- **Conclusion**: Mometasone furoate nasal spray was effective in controlling allergic rhinitis and was well tolerated by patients.

### Topical steroids in chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1163yjcS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether topical steroids provide symptomatic relief in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps.

Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. In the review methods, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on articles identified by two independent reviewers of all randomized controlled trials that evaluated intranasal corticosteroids in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps. The quality of included studies was evaluated, and results were synthesized using standard random-effects meta-analytical methods.

Among 424 potential studies, only nine randomized trials involving 657 patients were eligible. The quality of design and reporting was suboptimal, with only one trial adhering to accepted standards for reporting. Five trials combined outcome measures and reported on the overall response of CRS without polyps to topical steroids. The summary estimate for the overall response to treatment showed no significant benefit and substantial variability among studies (5 trials: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.50–1.10, P = 0.14, χ² = 13.78, I² = 66.2%). Total symptom score was reported in three trials with a standardized mean difference favoring topical steroids (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.16–1.09, P = 0.009), with no evidence of heterogeneity (χ² = 3.03, P = 0.22). Although the data were limited, there were no reports of increased adverse effects with topical steroids.

In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear overall benefit for topical steroids in CRS without polyps; however, their use appears to have no increased adverse effects.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^111JATmB]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Drug-related adverse events occurred in less than 20% of patients in all treatment groups. The most common drug-related adverse event in all groups was epistaxis. This was also the most common drug-related adverse event in the subset of patients aged 2–6 years, occurring in 15% of patients treated with placebo compared with 5% and 7% of patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg, respectively. All epistaxis events were mild in intensity, with the exception of one patient in the placebo group in whom the event was unresolved. The 6–12-year age subset had a lower incidence of drug-related adverse events in the placebo and FFNS 55 µg treatment groups (post hoc analysis).

Only one serious adverse event of tonsillitis was reported in a 4-year-old patient treated with FFNS 110 µg but was not considered to be related to the study drug. The patient was withdrawn from the study due to the event.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1134yktx]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Pass/fail results on sweep audiometry (fail at two or more frequencies at 25 dB hearing level in the better ear) did not differ between the groups: 63% (52/83) of treated children versus 58% (47/81) of those in the placebo group failed at three months, as did 59% (44/74) versus 51% (34/67) at nine months.

We evaluated concealment in children and parents (guardians), and prediction of the correct group was no better than chance. More than 80% of parents (guardians) in the placebo group thought their children were receiving the active treatment. Reported adherence was very good or excellent in 95/99 (96%) children in the topical steroid group and 93/103 (90%) in the placebo group at one month and in 79/90 (88%) and 78/89 (88%) at three months.

Analysis of adherence by age group showed a non-significant difference for the main outcome at one and three months (Fisher's test 0.04; χ² test for trend P = 0.40).

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^115ig6Gq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to June week 2, 2011), and EMBASE (January 2009 to June 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Four RCTs with a total of 1008 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged studies to be of moderate methodological quality. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials; however, the three trials performed in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants received oral antibiotics and were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in three trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^117PCYCB]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Use of rescue medication was very low across all treatment groups for the ITT population. In the first two weeks, the mean number of days without the use of rescue medication for patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 110 µg was 13.3 and 13.4, respectively. This was slightly higher than for patients treated with placebo (12.8 days). When comparing all experimental treatments versus placebo, the LS mean differences were all significant: FFNS 55 µg, P = 0.048; FFNS 110 µg, P = 0.011; and FFNS 55/110 µg, P = 0.009. These statistically significant LS mean differences were maintained for all experimental groups over the four-week study period.

In the primary analysis of the subset of patients aged 2–6 years, the mean number of days without the use of rescue medication in the first two weeks was slightly higher for treatment groups versus placebo (FFNS 55 µg, 13.3; FFNS 110 µg, 13.5; placebo, 12.9). However, statistically significant LS mean differences were not observed in this time period. Nevertheless, over four weeks of treatment, statistically significant LS mean differences were observed for all treatment groups compared with placebo (FFNS 55 µg, P = 0.007; FFNS 110 µg, P < 0.001; FFNS 55/110 µg, P < 0.001).

After the first two weeks of treatment, 33% of patients treated with FFNS 55 µg and 43% of patients treated with FFNS 110 µg rated their overall response to therapy as "significantly improved", compared with only 12% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.001). A similar trend was observed in the subset of patients aged 2–6 years.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish…

### SPL drug information for mometasone furoate [^115ttMwx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of mometasone furoate INH (also known as Nasonex, Asmanex, Asmanex HFA, Elocon, Sinuva, Propel):

- **Corticosteroid withdrawal, adrenal insufficiency**: Do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period. Use caution when transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy.

- **Decreased bone mineral density**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term corticosteroid use has been associated with an increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis.

- **Glaucoma, cataract**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts.

- **Growth delay**: Use caution in pediatric patients.

- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome**: Use caution in patients receiving high doses or susceptible patients receiving regular doses.

- **Immunosuppression**: Use caution in patients with active or latent tuberculosis, systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.

- **Increased serum mometasone levels**: Use caution in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin.

- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as mometasone has been associated with an increased risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Advise patients to rinse their mouth with water and spit out the contents without swallowing.

### The safety of intranasal steroids [^111MN9Nr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The increasing use of intranasal steroids in the management of allergic rhinitis reflects their efficacy, tolerability, and safety. However, issues related to the safety of intranasal steroids continue to generate debate and confusion among clinicians. Consequently, there is often reluctance and uncertainty in prescribing these effective agents for the treatment of perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis.

Issues of particular concern are whether intranasal steroids adversely affect various homeostatic systems, influence growth and bone metabolism, and compromise ocular function. Furthermore, the expanding role of intranasal steroids in the pediatric, geriatric, and postmenopausal populations has raised concerns that these agents may result in a steroid burden that more readily causes adverse effects.

An extensive review of the literature overwhelmingly supports the assertion that intranasal steroids are safe in prescribed doses and should allay the misconceptions regarding their appropriate use in the management of allergic rhinitis.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^112U5ttG]. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is the inflammation and swelling of the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes and is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014), and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

- **Main results**: Five RCTs with a total of 1,193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflamma.

### Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol [^111mQf91]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy**:
	- Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in patients with asthma during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for the recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn.

	- During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol MDPI may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does not provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies.

	- During periods of stress or a severe asthmatic attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physician for further instruction.

### Safety of intranasal corticosteroids in acute rhinosinusitis [^116Xuqhq]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for acute rhinosinusitis (RS) recommend the use of intranasal corticosteroids (INSs) as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. However, the adverse event (AE) profiles of oral glucocorticoids, which result largely from the systemic absorption of those agents, have engendered concerns about the safety of INSs. These concerns persist for INSs despite significant clinical differences between them and systemic corticosteroids in systemic absorption, and among the INSs in terms of bioavailability, mechanism of action, and lipophilicity, which may contribute to differences in AEs.

For example, the systemic bioavailability of the INSs as a percentage of the administered drug is less than 0.1% for mometasone furoate, less than 1% for fluticasone propionate, 46% for triamcinolone acetonide, and 44% for beclomethasone dipropionate. A review of the safety profiles of INSs, as reported in clinical trials in acute and chronic RS and allergic rhinitis, shows primarily local AEs (e.g. epistaxis and headache) that are generally classified as mild to moderate, with occurrence rates that are similar to those with placebo.

Studies of the safety of mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide did not identify any evidence of systemic AEs, such as growth retardation in children due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, bone mineral density loss, or cataracts. This suggests that INSs can be safely administered in patients with acute RS without concern for systemic AEs.

### Efficacy of nasal mometasone for the treatment of chronic sinonasal disease in patients with inadequately controlled asthma [^114jEqd4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic sinonasal disease is common in asthmatic patients and is associated with poor asthma control; however, there are no long-term trials addressing whether chronic treatment of sinonasal disease improves asthma control.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether treatment of chronic sinonasal disease with nasal corticosteroids improves asthma control, as measured by the Childhood Asthma Control Test and Asthma Control Test in children and adults, respectively.

- **Methods**: A 24-week multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of placebo versus nasal mometasone in adults and children with inadequately controlled asthma was performed. Treatments were randomly assigned, with concealment of allocation.

- **Results**: Two hundred thirty-seven adults and 151 children were randomized to nasal mometasone versus placebo, and 319 participants completed the study. There was no difference in the Childhood Asthma Control Test score (difference in change with mometasone - change with placebo [ΔM - ΔP]: -0.38; 95% CI, -2.19 to 1.44; p = 0.68; age 6–11 years) or the Asthma Control Test score (ΔM - ΔP: 0.51; 95% CI, -0.46 to 1.48; p = 0.30; age ≥ 12 years) in those assigned to mometasone versus placebo. In children and adolescents (age 6–17 years), there was no difference in asthma or sinus symptoms but a decrease in episodes of poorly controlled asthma defined by a decrease in peak flow. In adults, there was a small difference in asthma symptoms measured by using the Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ΔM - ΔP: 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.11; P < .01) and in nasal symptoms.

### Comparison of cefuroxime with or without intranasal fluticasone for the treatment of rhinosinusitis. The CAFFS trial: a randomized controlled trial [^116Dba4e]. JAMA (2001). High credibility.

It is not known whether intranasal corticosteroids are beneficial for treating acute rhinosinusitis in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms.

- **Objective**: To assess whether the addition of an intranasal corticosteroid to antibiotic therapy affects the speed and rate of recovery in patients with acute rhinosinusitis.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of 95 patients (median age, 39 years) with a history of recurrent sinusitis or chronic rhinitis and evidence of acute infection by sinus radiograph or nasal endoscopy, conducted from October 1998 through April 2000 at 22 sites (12 primary care and 10 otolaryngology).

- **Intervention**: Two puffs (total dose, 200 micrograms) of fluticasone propionate (n = 47) or placebo nasal spray (n = 48) in each nostril once daily for 21 days; all received 2 puffs of xylometazoline hydrochloride in each nostril twice daily for 3 days and 250 mg of cefuroxime axetil twice daily for 10 days.

- **Main outcome measure**: Time to clinical success (patient-reported cured or much improved) during telephone follow-up at 10, 21, and 56 days.

- **Results**: A total of 88 patients (93%) completed follow-up. Patients recorded their symptoms, work assessment, and compliance during the 3-week treatment phase. Patients receiving fluticasone achieved a significantly higher rate of clinical success than patients receiving placebo (93.5% vs. 73.9%; p = 0.009). Patients treated with fluticasone improved significantly more rapidly (median of 6.0 days to clinical success) compared to those on placebo.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^115uoA47]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids are the most efficacious anti-inflammatory medications for allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the efficacy and safety of intranasal corticosteroids in children have not yet been subject to specific research in China. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS) in a Chinese pediatric population.

- **Methods**: In this phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, pediatric AR patients aged 2–12 years were randomized 1:1:1. They received either FFNS 55µg, 110µg, or a placebo. Electronic diary cards were completed to record symptoms, rescue medication use, and treatment compliance. Anterior rhinoscopy and overall response to therapy were evaluated and recorded.

- **Results**: Patients treated with FFNS at either dose experienced a significantly greater reduction in daily reflective total nasal symptom score compared with placebo, maintained even in a younger subset of patients (2–6 years). Drug-related adverse events occurred in less than 20% of patients in all groups. FFNS was well tolerated at both doses.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates favorable efficacy and safety profiles for FFNS 55µg or 110µg in Chinese pediatric populations (2–12 years), supporting its use in clinical treatment for AR, including younger children aged 2–6 years.

- **Impact**: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of intranasal fluticasone furoate in Chinese pediatric allergic rhinitis. This research addresses the deficiency in efficacy and safety data for this medication in the specified demographic.

### Mometasone furoate is a less specific glucocorticoid than fluticasone propionate [^116vzuif]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Fluticasone propionate (FP) and mometasone furoate (MF) are potent synthetic corticosteroids widely used as anti-inflammatory agents for treating respiratory diseases. As part of assessing the potential for side effects associated with their use, their activities have been compared not only at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but also at other members of the steroid nuclear receptor family.

Cell-based functional systems were established to measure different aspects of GR function and the activity at all the other steroid nuclear receptors. The effects of MF and FP on the GR were potent and indistinguishable. Neither corticosteroid showed any activity at the estrogen receptor, while both were weak antagonists of the androgen receptor. FP was a relatively weak agonist of the progesterone receptor, but MF was a very potent agonist, giving activity at similar concentrations to those that stimulate the GR (concentration generating 50% maximal effect (EC50) = 50 pM). Moreover, while FP was a weak antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (concentration generating 50% maximal inhibitory effect = 80 nM), MF displayed potent partial agonist activity (EC50 = 3 nM, 30%).

Mometasone furoate is considerably less specific for the glucocorticoid receptor than fluticasone propionate, showing significant activity at other nuclear steroid receptors.

### Steroids for acute sinusitis [^114vJmXR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for primary care visits. It causes significant symptoms and often results in time off work and school.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are effective in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006), EMBASE (1990 to June 2006), and bibliographies of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered eligible if they compared INCS treatment to placebo treatment of a control group for acute sinusitis; acute sinusitis was defined by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by radiological evidence or by nasal endoscopy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with either resolution or improvement of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were any adverse events that required discontinuation of treatment, drop-outs before the end of the study, rates of relapse, complications, and return to school or work.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed trial quality, and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

- **Main results**: Four studies with 1943 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled in which the included participants had acute sinusitis. The treatment assigned was INCS versus control treatment for 15 or 21 days. The rates of loss to follow-up in the studies were 7%, 11%, 41%, and 10%. When the results from the studies were compiled, it was evident that INCS produced a significant benefit in resolving symptoms for patients with acute sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

- **Three specific issues were considered**: 1) Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, non-antibiotic regimens; and 3) The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to complete the diagnostic evaluation.

### Exhalation delivery systems for application of intranasal corticosteroids [^112iQGmp]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common sinonasal disorder resulting in significant inflammation in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Topical nasal steroids play an important role in the treatment of CRS. The exhalation delivery system with fluticasone (EDS-FLU) utilizes a patient's forced exhalation to power the delivery of topical steroids to deeper areas of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses most affected by CRS. This review focuses on evidence surrounding the safety and efficacy of the EDS-FLU system.

- **Methods**: Literature search was conducted on articles investigating the safety and efficacy of EDS-FLU. Relevant efficacy and safety data were examined and summarized from the studies.

- **Results**: The efficacy and safety of EDS-FLU in CRS, both with and without polyps, have been established in open-label and placebo-controlled phase 3 trials. There was a significant improvement in the cardinal symptoms of CRS and subjective patient-reported outcomes scores. Additionally, there was objective improvement in sinonasal inflammation as measured by polyp grade. Recent studies have also established significant improvement in health status and general quality of life following treatment using EDS-FLU. Emerging data have also examined patients who have previously had endoscopic sinus surgery and were on appropriate medical therapy. They noted improvement in polyp burden and overall Lund-Kennedy scores after using EDS-FLU.

- **Conclusion**: The exhalation delivery system with fluticasone demonstrates significant results in both patient-oriented outcomes and objective measures of sinonasal inflammation.

### Positional installation of intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis: A systematic review of the literature [^112Zghn9]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The first-line treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis includes topical corticosteroids aimed at decreasing inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa. No guidelines exist regarding the effect of head position during the administration of corticosteroids. It is hypothesized that certain positions enhance delivery to the paranasal sinuses, with further improvement in delivery after sinus surgery.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline Ovid, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. All studies evaluating intranasal medications administered in two or more head positions were included. Study population, head positions, method/volume of delivery, and outcome metrics were recorded.

Twenty-four studies compared head positions and their role in the distribution of intranasal medication. In twelve papers studying surgically naive subjects, six found improvement in delivery to specific sinonasal regions (middle meatus; lateral, superior, or posterior nasal cavity) and/or symptomatic improvement in the lying head back (LHB) or head down and forward (HDF) positions. However, only three reached statistical significance. Among the twelve papers studying surgically altered patients, ten found delivery improved in the HDF, LHB, and head forward 45° or 90° positions. Of the five studies of extended frontal sinus procedures (Draf IIb/III), the majority found distribution to the frontal sinus improved with the head forward 90° position. Patients found the HDF position most uncomfortable.

In conclusion, studies found no statistically significant difference in distribution to unoperated sinuses among different positions.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^116EqvNL]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and inflammation, with episodes of asthma worsening occurring in response to various stimuli. With their anti-inflammatory properties, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the first-line therapy to relieve persistent asthma symptoms of all severities. For treatment of patients with moderate to severe asthma who are not adequately controlled on ICS monotherapy, or whose disease severity warrants treatment with an additional controller medication, combination therapy with an ICS and a bronchodilator (e.g. long-acting β2-agonist [LABA]) is recommended by asthma guidelines.

Mometasone furoate (MF), a potent and safe ICS with high affinity for glucocorticoid receptors, is approved in the United States for treatment of asthma in adult and pediatric patients. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MF with regard to lung function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life, as well as its safety and tolerability at multiple strengths (100–800 μg) and dosing regimens. Formoterol (F), a LABA, when administered as monotherapy, rapidly dilates airway smooth muscle and maintains control over 24 hours, thereby improving lung function and reducing asthma symptoms.

Because individual components of MF/F possess well-defined efficacy, as well as pharmacologic and safety profiles when administered separately at recommended doses, the new MF/F combination administered through a single metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is expected to exhibit similar benefits.

### Topical steroid for chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps [^112q7bBo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroid is used as part of a comprehensive medical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without polyps. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to show a clear overall benefit. Trials studying the efficacy of topical corticosteroid use various delivery methods in patients who have or have not had sinus surgery, which directly impacts topical delivery and distribution.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical steroid in patients with CRS without nasal polyps and perform a meta-analysis of symptom improvement data, including subgroup analysis by sinus surgery status and topical delivery methods.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 9 July 2010.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials in which a topically administered corticosteroid was compared with either a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative topically administered corticosteroid for the treatment of CRS without polyps in patients of any age.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors reviewed the search results and selected trials meeting the eligibility criteria, obtaining full texts and contacting authors where necessary. We documented our justification for the exclusion of studies. Two authors extracted data using a pre-determined standardized data form.

### Treating acute rhinosinusitis: comparing efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray, amoxicillin, and placebo [^1141oJX9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids used with antibiotics are known to improve rhinosinusitis symptoms compared with antibiotic therapy alone. However, the efficacy of intranasal corticosteroid monotherapy for acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis is not established.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) versus amoxicillin and placebo in patients with acute, uncomplicated rhinosinusitis.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, double-dummy trial, subjects (≥ 12 years; N = 981) were randomized to MFNS 200 µg once daily or twice daily for 15 days, amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 10 days, or respective placebo. Follow-up was 14 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean AM/PM major symptom score over the treatment phase. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the total symptom score. Safety assessments included disease recurrence during follow-up and adverse event monitoring.

- **Results**: Mometasone furoate nasal spray 200 µg twice daily was significantly superior to placebo (P < .001) and amoxicillin (P = 0.002) at improving the major symptom score. Starting on Day 2, MFNS 200 µg twice daily improved the total symptom score throughout treatment versus amoxicillin (P = 0.012) and placebo (P < .001). Global response to treatment was significantly greater with MFNS 200 µg twice daily versus amoxicillin (P = 0.013) and placebo (P = 0.001). Although significantly superior to placebo, MFNS 200 µg once daily was not superior to amoxicillin for the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints. All treatments were well tolerated.

### Effects of three nasal topical steroids in the intraocular pressure compartment [^113v292x]. Otolaryngology — head and neck surgery (2004). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the use of fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, or beclomethasone dipropionate for the treatment of rhinitis produced, as a side effect, an increase in intraocular pressure. Only one printed article proclaims that the increase in secondary intraocular pressure is due to the use of local nasal steroids.

- **Patients and study design**: We conducted a comparative, double-blind, experimental, prospective, longitudinal study in which 360 patients were divided at random into four groups. Ninety of them were given a placebo (control group), and the other 270 were divided into three other groups of 90 patients each, with each group receiving a different local nasal steroid.

- **Measurement parameters**: All patients had their intraocular pressure measured by Goldman's tonometry at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after using the placebo or local nasal steroid.

- **Results**: Variations were found in the intraocular pressure of patients who used local steroids, with discreet elevations in the beclomethasone dipropionate and mometasone furoate groups. However, variations were always within normal limits.

- **Conclusion**: Fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and beclomethasone dipropionate cause variations in intraocular pressure, but these variations are within normal limits.

### Intranasal corticosteroids for non-allergic rhinitis [^115rfotL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Non-allergic rhinitis is defined as dysfunction and non-infectious inflammation of the nasal mucosa caused by provoking agents other than allergens or microbes. It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhea/post-nasal drip, and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms, including occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food, and age. On a cellular molecular level, different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack effective treatment due to poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed for patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.

### Should we prescribe antibiotics to this patient with persistent upper respiratory symptoms? Grand rounds discussion from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [^115izRZV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published advice for high-value care on the appropriate use of antibiotics for acute respiratory tract infections. They conducted a narrative literature review of evidence for antibiotic use in this setting, which included recent clinical guidelines from professional societies supplemented by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. They concluded that clinicians should reserve antibiotic treatment for acute rhinosinusitis in patients with persistent symptoms for more than 10 days, high fever and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3 consecutive days, or worsening symptoms following a typical viral illness that lasted 5 days and had initially improved ("double-sickening").

In this Grand Rounds, two prominent clinicians debate whether to initiate antibiotic treatment in a 62-year-old man with a history of recurrent sinusitis who presents with persistent upper respiratory symptoms. They review the data on which the ACP/CDC recommendations are based and discuss the potential benefits and risks, as well as the challenges and controversies, of prescribing antibiotic therapy in this setting.

### Added relief in the treatment of acute recurrent sinusitis with adjunctive mometasone furoate nasal spray [^117FHvQ1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2000). Low credibility.

Intranasal glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. However, their effectiveness as an anti-inflammatory adjunct in the treatment of acute sinusitis has not been adequately established in a controlled clinical study.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that intranasal corticosteroid treatment produces additional relief in the treatment of acute sinusitis with oral antibiotics.

- **Methods**: Patients who were 12 years and older with a history of recurrent sinusitis were treated during a new episode of acute sinusitis, diagnosed by symptoms and confirmed by a computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses. Patients were treated for 21 days with amoxicillin clavulanate potassium and randomized to receive either mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS; Nasonex [400 microg, twice daily]; n = 200 patients) or placebo spray (twice daily; n = 207 patients). Symptom scores for headache, facial pain, congestion, purulent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and cough were recorded at baseline and throughout treatment.

- **Results**: Baseline symptom scores indicated a moderate level of symptom severity comparable in both groups. Patient-recorded symptom scores, taken twice daily, showed that adjunctive treatment with MFNS caused a significantly greater decrease in total symptom score (primary efficacy variable) and in individual scores of inflammatory symptoms associated with the obstruction process (headache, congestion, and facial pain) compared with placebo. Symptoms associated with the secretory processes were improved as well.

### Intranasal fluticasone furoate in pediatric allergic rhinitis: Randomized controlled study [^111rBwmZ]. Pediatric Research (2021). High credibility.

Intranasal corticosteroids are the most efficacious anti-inflammatory medications for allergic rhinitis (AR). However, the efficacy and safety of intranasal corticosteroids in children have not yet been subject to specific research in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate nasal spray (FFNS) in a Chinese pediatric population.

- **Methods**: In this phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study, pediatric AR patients aged 2–12 years were randomized 1:1:1, receiving either FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg or placebo. Electronic diary cards were completed to record symptoms, rescue medication use, and treatment compliance. Anterior rhinoscopy and overall response to therapy were evaluated and recorded.

- **Results**: Patients treated with FFNS at either dose experienced a significantly greater reduction in daily reflective total nasal symptom score compared with placebo. This was maintained in a younger subset of patients (2–6 years). Drug-related adverse events occurred in < 20% of patients in all groups. FFNS was well tolerated at both doses.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates favorable efficacy and safety profiles for FFNS 55 µg or 110 µg in Chinese pediatric populations (2–12 years), supporting its use in clinical treatment for AR children, including younger children aged 2–6 years.

- **Impact**: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of intranasal fluticasone furoate in Chinese pediatric allergic rhinitis. This research not only addresses the deficiency in efficacy and safety data but also provides valuable insights for clinical practice.

### Use of topical nasal therapies in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^117TqcWs]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether the use of topical nasal therapies with saline alone and in combination with antibiotics, antifungals, or corticosteroids is effective in the treatment of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a systematic literature search was performed utilizing the MEDLINE database (1966 to May 2012), EMBASE database (1980 to May 2012), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

- **Review methods**: Electronic databases were searched by three otolaryngologists. Studies on five major categories of topical nasal therapies were obtained, including saline (hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic), topical antibiotics, topical steroids, and topical antifungals. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included.

- **Results**: Sixteen randomized controlled trials were identified examining topical saline (hypertonic or isotonic) in CRS patients. Two randomized controlled trials were found studying the effect of topical antibiotics in patients with CRS. Four randomized controlled trials were identified studying topical antifungal treatment for CRS. Twenty-five randomized controlled trials were found studying topical steroids in CRS patients.

- **Conclusion**: A high aggregate quality of evidence supports the effectiveness of saline irrigations in treating CRS. There is insufficient evidence to support a clear benefit of topical antibiotics in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Topical antifungal therapies have not been shown to be significantly different in efficacy than saline control.

### Long-term safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol combination for treatment of patients with persistent asthma [^115eLLZx]. The Journal of Asthma (2010). Low credibility.

The combination of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists is recommended for the treatment of patients with persistent asthma inadequately controlled on ICS monotherapy. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term safety of mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in patients with persistent asthma who were previously on medium- to high-dose ICS.

This was a 52-week, randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, evaluator-blinded study. At baseline, 404 patients (aged > 12 years) were stratified according to their previous ICS dose (medium or high) and then randomized 2:1 to receive twice-daily treatment of either MF/F (200/10 or 400/10 μg) or fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/S; 250/50 or 500/50 μg). The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of patients reporting any adverse event (AE). Additional safety evaluations included plasma cortisol 24-hour area under the curve (AUC 0–24h) and ocular changes, while pulmonary function, asthma symptoms, and use of rescue medication were monitored.

The incidence of patients experiencing more than one treatment-emergent AE was similar across treatment groups: MF/F 200/10 μg (77.3%, n = 109), FP/S 250/50 μg (82.4%, n = 56), MF/F 400/10 μg (79.2%, n = 103), and FP/S 500/50 μg (76.9%, n = 50). The rates of treatment-related AEs were also similar: MF/F 200/10 μg (28.4%), FP/S 250/50 μg (23.5%), MF/F 400/10 μg (23.1%), and FP/S 500/50 μg (20.0%). Headache (3.7%) and dysphonia (2.7%) were the most common treatment-related AEs reported overall.

### Intranasal steroids versus placebo or no intervention for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111GLs1U]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

This review is one of six examining the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, rhinorrhea, facial pressure/pain, and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. The use of topical (intranasal) corticosteroids has been widely advocated for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis, given the belief that inflammation is a major component of this condition.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 8), MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) against placebo or no treatment in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the most common adverse event — epistaxis. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1155zK4m]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Topical intranasal corticosteroids have shown evidence of efficacy from several small clinical trials, as well as theoretical reasons for further evaluation. Their anti-inflammatory effects on the post-nasal space, the peritubal lymphatic tissue, and encroaching adenoids have been suggested. Although oral steroids may provide some benefit in otitis media with effusion, their use for a chronic relapsing condition in childhood is generally precluded by the possibility of severe idiosyncratic effects and growth retardation. Thus, while many doctors may prefer intranasal corticosteroids over oral steroids for safety reasons, more research is needed to establish their clinical effectiveness when given as an adjunct to active monitoring in an affected cohort of children.

### Different types of intranasal steroids for chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hi4hx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

This review is one of six examining the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure or pain, and loss of the sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Topical (intranasal) corticosteroids are used with the aim of reducing inflammation in the sinonasal mucosa to improve patient symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different types of intranasal steroids in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 7); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP; and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 11 August 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing first-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide) with second-generation intranasal corticosteroids (e.g. ciclesonide, fluticasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, betamethasone sodium phosphate), or sprays versus drops, or low-dose versus high-dose intranasal corticosteroids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health.

### Mometasone furoate nasal spray increases the number of minimal-symptom days in patients with acute rhinosinusitis [^115dFxVw]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is triggered by viral or, uncommonly, bacterial infection, causing inflammatory symptoms for ≤ 12 weeks.

- **Objective**: To investigate effects of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) vs. amoxicillin and placebo on minimal-symptom days.

- **Methods**: A double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled 15-day study randomly assigned patients 12 years of age or older to MFNS 200 μg twice daily, MFNS 200 μg once daily, amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. Patients had baseline rhinosinusitis major symptom score (MSS; combined rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, congestion, sinus headache, facial pain) of ≥ 5 and ≤ 12 (maximum: 15) for 7 to 28 days; scores were similar among groups. Minimal-symptom days and minimal-congestion days were defined post hoc by average am/pm MSS ≤ 4 and average AM/PM congestion ≤ 1.

- **Results**: MFNS twice daily (n = 234) showed more minimal-symptom days vs. placebo (n = 246) (62.69% vs. 50.33%; P < .0001) or amoxicillin (n = 248) (54.35%; p = 0.0040). The MFNS QD was associated with numerically more minimal-symptom days than amoxicillin or placebo (54.72%; P ≤ .8982). MFNS was associated with more minimal-congestion days than placebo (72.97%, 67.73%, and 56.67% for twice daily, once daily, and placebo; P < .0001 for each vs. placebo) and MFNS BID with more minimal-congestion days than amoxicillin (72.97% vs. 64.15%; p = 0.0007). Median time to first minimal-symptom day sustained until study end was 8.5 days for MFNS BID vs. 11 for placebo (P = 0.0085).

- **Conclusion**: MFNS 200 μg twice daily significantly increased minimal-symptom days compared to placebo and amoxicillin.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis leads more than 30 million patients to seek health care annually in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis, with the challenge being distinguishing between bacterial and viral sinusitis symptoms. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages.

Antibiotics should be considered for patients experiencing severe symptoms for three or more days, significant worsening after three to five days, or symptoms lasting seven or more days. Diagnostic testing with antral puncture is impractical due to its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful but is not widely available. Studies indicate that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in individuals without a beta-lactam allergy.

For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Clindamycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care strategies for rhinosinusitis, such as saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce symptom severity. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limiting.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^116wXkHe]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

The main findings, favoring placebo at one and nine months, provide evidence that topical intranasal corticosteroids are not likely to be an effective means of treating children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. The study has demonstrated the feasibility of active monitoring in general practice, with particularly high natural resolution rates occurring after as little as one month of follow-up.
