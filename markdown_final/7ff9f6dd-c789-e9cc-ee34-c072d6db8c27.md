## Question

What are cell counts in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the cell counts used to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, including the diagnostic threshold, how to correct for blood contamination, how to monitor treatment response, and how to interpret special scenarios like culture-negative neutrocytic ascites and bacterascites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the diagnostic gold standard and the exact PMN threshold. Then, I should verify how to handle bloody taps and whether a correction factor is needed. Next, I will review how to monitor response after antibiotics and what constitutes treatment failure. After that, I need to check the role of culture and how to interpret culture-negative neutrocytic ascites and bacterascites. Finally, I will consider alternative biomarkers and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic criterion. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is diagnosed when the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count exceeds 250 cells per mm³, regardless of culture results, and this threshold is the gold standard across major society guidelines from AASLD, EASL, and BASL/BSG, so I should anchor on that number and not overthink it [^11179ard] [^115nLPF8] [^117GHjGJ].

> Wait, let me verify the unit confusion I briefly considered. Some sources state " > 250 cells/L", but that is incorrect for the conventional diagnostic threshold; the correct unit is cells/mm³, which is equivalent to cells/μL, so I should explicitly state that the diagnostic PMN count is > 250 cells/mm³ (or > 250 cells/μL) to avoid misinterpretation [^11179ard] [^115nLPF8].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle bloody ascites. If the ascitic fluid is bloody, PMNs may be artificially elevated from peripheral blood contamination; a commonly used correction is to subtract 1 PMN for every 250 red blood cells, and I should confirm that this correction is reasonable in practice, even though it is not universally mandated by guidelines and may not be necessary in all cases [^115gh6j9].

> Next, I should review how to monitor treatment response. Guidelines recommend repeating a diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours to assess antibiotic efficacy; a lack of response is defined by a decrease in PMN count of less than 25% from baseline, which should prompt broadening of antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis or resistant organisms, and I need to ensure I include that 25% threshold precisely [^1131FfV3] [^116wYAge].

> I will now examine the role of culture, because I should not conflate diagnosis with microbiology. Culture is not required to make the diagnosis of SBP; culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (CNNA) with PMN > 250 cells/mm³ and negative culture carries similar morbidity and mortality and should be treated identically to culture-positive SBP, so I should emphasize that empiric therapy should not be withheld while awaiting culture results [^116V5aiV] [^116V5aiV].

> But wait, what if cultures are positive and the PMN count is low? That is bacterascites, and I need to check how to manage it. If the patient has systemic inflammatory signs, antibiotics are indicated; if asymptomatic, many guidelines favor observation with repeat paracentesis rather than immediate treatment, so I should tailor action to clinical context and not jump to antibiotics in all bacterascites cases [^114fBQpW] [^114DJ84Y].

> Let me consider alternative biomarkers, because clinicians often ask about faster tests. Reagent strips for leukocyte esterase can be highly sensitive but have variable specificity and are not recommended as standalone diagnostics by major guidelines; ascitic calprotectin shows promise with high sensitivity and specificity in meta-analyses, and lactoferrin correlates with PMN burden, but these remain adjuncts rather than replacements for PMN counting in current practice [^112E8wZq] [^114vfZjg] [^113Zw8Bo].

> I should double-check the practical steps to maximize diagnostic yield. Bedside inoculation of at least 10 mL of ascitic fluid into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles improves culture sensitivity substantially, and this should be done before antibiotics when feasible; additionally, automated PMN counting has shown good agreement with manual methods and can expedite results, which is helpful in busy settings [^116i32Wu] [^111Cidmm].

> Let me synthesize a concise, clinically usable answer. The cell count that defines spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an ascitic fluid PMN count greater than 250 cells/mm³. Bloody samples may require correction by subtracting 1 PMN for every 250 RBCs. Treatment response is assessed at 48 hours, and failure to decrease PMNs by at least 25% from baseline should trigger escalation and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. Culture is supportive but not required for diagnosis, and culture-negative neutrocytic ascites should be treated like SBP, whereas bacterascites warrants individualized management based on symptoms and repeat testing [^11179ard] [^115gh6j9] [^1131FfV3] [^116V5aiV] [^114fBQpW].

The diagnostic cell count for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an **ascitic polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count ≥ 250 cells/mm³** [^11179ard] [^115nLPF8] [^117GHjGJ]. This threshold applies regardless of culture results, as cultures are often negative or delayed [^116iQsaf]. If the ascitic fluid is bloody, correct the PMN count by subtracting 1 PMN for every 250 red blood cells [^115gh6j9]. A PMN count < 250 cells/mm³ with a positive culture is termed bacterascites and warrants close monitoring or treatment if symptomatic [^114fBQpW] [^114DJ84Y]. Early recognition and prompt antibiotic therapy based on this PMN threshold are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^1179yLrQ] [^116zJJij].

---

## Diagnostic threshold for SBP

- **PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³**: The universally accepted diagnostic threshold for SBP is an ascitic PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ [^11179ard] [^115nLPF8] [^117GHjGJ]. This criterion is endorsed by major liver societies, including the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) [^11179ard], the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [^115nLPF8], and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) [^117GHjGJ].

- **Independence from culture results**: The diagnosis of SBP is established based on the PMN count alone, irrespective of culture results, as cultures are often negative or delayed [^116iQsaf].

- **Correction for bloody taps**: In cases of bloody ascitic fluid, the PMN count should be corrected by subtracting 1 PMN for every 250 red blood cells (RBCs) to avoid false positives due to blood contamination [^115gh6j9].

---

## Clinical significance of PMN count

- **Inflammatory response**: An elevated PMN count reflects the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the ascitic fluid, indicating the presence of neutrophils recruited to the site of infection [^notfound].

- **Prognostic implication**: Higher PMN counts are associated with increased severity of infection and poorer clinical outcomes, including higher mortality rates [^11383vkz].

- **Guideline recommendation**: The PMN count is the gold standard diagnostic criterion for SBP and is recommended by major liver societies for routine clinical practice [^117GHjGJ] [^115nLPF8] [^11179ard].

---

## Variants of SBP based on cell counts and culture results

| **Variant** | **Pmn count** | **Culture result** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Classic SBP | ≥ 250 cells/mm³ | Positive | Standard diagnosis of SBP requiring immediate antibiotic therapy [^1179yLrQ] |
| Culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (CNNA) | ≥ 250 cells/mm³ | Negative | Clinically significant variant with similar mortality to culture-positive SBP, requiring antibiotic therapy [^116V5aiV] |
| Bacterascites | < 250 cells/mm³ | Positive | Indicates bacterial colonization of ascitic fluid; monitor closely or treat if symptomatic [^114fBQpW] [^114DJ84Y] |

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Immediate antibiotic therapy**: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly in patients with ascitic PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³, without waiting for culture results [^1179yLrQ] [^11384V4d].

- **Follow-up paracentesis**: A repeat paracentesis at 48 hours is recommended to assess treatment response. A decrease in PMN count by less than 25% from baseline indicates treatment failure and necessitates adjustment of antibiotic therapy [^1131FfV3] [^116wYAge].

- **Adjunctive therapies**: Intravenous albumin administration is recommended in patients with SBP, particularly those with renal dysfunction or jaundice, to reduce the risk of renal impairment and mortality [^111RuPDB].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Operator dependence**: Manual PMN counting is operator-dependent and may lead to variability in results. Automated cell counters have been validated as reliable alternatives [^111Cidmm].

- **False positives**: Bloody ascitic fluid may lead to falsely elevated PMN counts, necessitating correction for RBC contamination [^115gh6j9].

- **Alternative biomarkers**: Biomarkers such as ascitic calprotectin and lactoferrin have been studied as potential adjuncts or alternatives to PMN counting, but further validation is required before routine clinical adoption [^114vfZjg] [^113Zw8Bo].

---

The diagnostic cell count for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an **ascitic PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³** [^11179ard]. This threshold is the gold standard for diagnosing SBP and guides immediate antibiotic therapy, with culture results serving as supportive rather than diagnostic evidence [^117GHjGJ] [^116iQsaf].

### Can clear ascitic fluid appearance rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis? [^115vPYKU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of abnormal ascitic fluid appearance in the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), as a sensitivity approaching 100% could exclude SBP if the fluid is clear.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all ascitic fluid samples sent for cell count over a 4-year period. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was defined as an absolute neutrophil count of more than 250 cells/mm³ or a positive culture. Abnormal fluid appearance was defined as hazy, cloudy, or bloody.

Results

There were 916 ascitic fluid samples analyzed during the study period. Eighteen percent of samples had a clear appearance, whereas 82% were abnormal. Abnormal ascitic fluid appearance had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% confidence interval, 95.3%-99.5%) and a specificity of 22.7% (95% confidence interval, 19.4%-26.3%) in the detection of SBP.

Conclusions

Abnormal fluid appearance has a high sensitivity for the detection of SBP. Thus, clear fluid might safely exclude SBP.

### Emergency medicine updates: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113zjcZu]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites and is associated with significant risk of mortality. Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this condition.

Objective

This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning SBP for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

SBP is commonly due to Gram-negative bacteria, but infections due to Gram-positive bacteria and multidrug resistant bacteria are increasing. The typical presentation of SBP includes abdominal pain, worsening ascites, fever, or altered mental status in a patient with known liver disease; however, some patients may be asymptomatic or present with only mild symptoms. Paracentesis is the diagnostic modality of choice and should be performed in any patient with ascites and concern for SBP or upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or in those being admitted for a complication of cirrhosis. Ultrasound should be used to optimize the procedure. An ascites absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 250 cells/mm³ is diagnostic of SBP. Ascitic fluid should be placed in blood culture bottles to improve the culture yield. Leukocyte esterase reagent strips can be used for rapid diagnosis if available. While many patients will demonstrate coagulation panel abnormalities, routine transfusion is not recommended. Management traditionally includes a third-generation cephalosporin, but specific patient populations may require more broad-spectrum coverage with a carbapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Albumin infusion is associated with reduced risk of renal impairment and mortality.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the care of patients with suspected SBP.

### The diagnostic accuracy of ascitic calprotectin for the early diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vfZjg]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and has an incidence of up to 30% in hospitalized patients. Importantly, it may raise their mortality rate up to 30%. Hence, a delayed diagnosis is associated with poor prognosis. This systematic review aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ascitic fluid calprotectin for the early diagnosis of SBP in patients with ascites. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. A systematic literature search was conducted from inception to February 2020 in the following electronic bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, The Cochrane Library and OpenGrey. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool was used to assess risk of bias. Ten studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted and the summary sensitivity of a positive ascitic fluid calprotectin assessment to detect SBP was 93% [95% confidence interval (CI) 90–95%] while the summary specificity was 89% (95% CI 80–95%), irrespectively of the method used. The positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio of the test were 8.7 (95% CI 4.4–17.1) and 0.08 (85% CI 0.06–0.12). All studies showed positive correlation between ascitic calprotectin and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count. Ascitic calprotectin appears to be an excellent alternative to PMN leucocyte count of ≥ 250 cells/mm³ for the diagnosis of SBP with much faster time to diagnosis. Owing to its substantially high negative predictive value, the test can accurately exclude SBP avoiding unnecessary antibiotics in suspected patients.

### Total ascitic fluid leukocyte count for reliable exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with ascites [^115NqTT1]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in patients with ascites is established by definition with a polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count in the ascitic fluid greater than 0.250 g/l determined via cytological (microscopic) examination. In this study, we correlated the automatically assessed total ascitic nucleated cell count with PMN and determined its predictive value for diagnosis of SBP.

Methods

Six hundred and eleven consecutive paracenteses of 179 patients with ascites of various aetiologies (liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and ascites of other aetiology) were studied retrospectively.

Results

The most reliable diagnostic cut-off level was determined for differentiation between SBP and non-SBP via receiver operating characteristics analysis. A total ascitic nucleated cell count less than 1.0 g/l is unlikely to represent SBP (negative predictive value, 95.5%).

Conclusions

If ascitic fluid samples with machine-made total ascitic nucleated cell count below 1.0 g/l are not followed by additional laboratory tests, the risk of missing the diagnosis of SBP is low. Applying these criteria we would have classified 51 samples of 611 samples (20 of 179 patients) wrongly using the cut-off value of 1 g/l. On the other hand we would have spared cytologic evaluation in about 63% of paracentesis performed in our hospital. Nevertheless, to insure patient safety, standard laboratory analysis is recommended in circumstances of clinical uncertainty. Thus, patients with first manifestation of ascites should always receive cytologic examination and full diagnostic investigation to exclude other causes of ascites.

### Diagnostic of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis… [^1166Wr96]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic of Spontaneous Bacterial PeritonitisClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, an infection of ascitic fluid in the absence of localized intra-abdominal infection, is one of the main potentially fatal complications of cirrhosis. In the case of SBP, early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic care can improve patient survival. The diagnosis of SBP is based on the detection of a polymorphonuclear neutrophils count equal to or greater than 250 /mm³ in the ascitic fluid. However, obtaining an ascitic cell count is sometimes difficult because it can not always be performed in emergency especially outside the opening hours of the laboratory of Bacteriology. This raises the necessity of developing quick and easy alternative approaches of diagnosis. Although performed on small groups of patients, several studies have reported that IL-8 or IL-6 might be used as markers of ascitic fluid infections.

Based on these data and confirmed by the investigators preliminary results the investigators propose to study on a broad recruitment of patients estimated to about 500 inclusions the interest of using IL-8 and IL-6 as predictive markers of SBP. The investigators propose to use an ELISA method, standardized, rapid and automated, applicable in the context of emergency as previously described in the work conducted to exclude the urinary tract infection. During the preliminary experiments conducted for this project, the investigators also found systematic variation of another marker, leptin. This is a protein hormone involved in the inflammatory and immune responses. It appears necessary to include the study of this marker in the analysis of differential protein response between patients suffering or not suffering from SBP.
- The main objective is to establish the diagnostic performance of IL-8 and IL-6, assayed in the ascites fluid by an automated ELISA in the early diagnosis of SBP.
- The secondary objectives are to confirm the interest of the measurement of leptin in the SBP and to establish the diagnostic performance of IL-8 and IL-6 or leptin according to different clinical features in patients.

Monitoring response to antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis occurs due to serious impairment of the immune system and may trigger severe complications, particularly AKI, HE, or ACLF; it is also associated with a high risk of mortality. The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis requires a high index of suspicion because the clinical symptoms are heterogeneous and may not always include abdominal manifestations. The biomarker used for diagnoses and for monitoring the efficacy of antibiotic therapy is neutrophil count in the ascitic fluid, and a bacterial isolate is not required for diagnoses because ascitic fluid culture is positive in less than half of cases. Other biomarkers based on systemic inflammation secondary to the infection, such as cytokines (eg, IL-6), pro-calcitonin, and others, have been investigated, but none have yet successfully shown to improve diagnostic accuracy. A summary of the changes in neutrophil count in ascitic fluid during antibiotic therapy and their clinical interpretations is presented in Table 5.

TABLE 5
Clinical interpretation and therapeutic consequences of changes in neutrophil counts in the ascitic fluid during antibiotic treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,

Monitoring response to treatment of HE

Development of overt HE requires rapid clinical investigation and initiation of therapy, including the management of possible precipitating factors. Specific therapy of HE focuses on preventing ammonia absorption from the gut and reducing ammonia production. The response to treatment is generally monitored by evaluating neurological status every 6–12 hours on the same scales that are used to categorize disease severity, usually the West Haven criteria. Psychometric testing is reserved for monitoring treatment effects on covert HE. There are no specific biomarkers for monitoring the response to therapy of patients with overt HE, but plasma ammonia levels may be informative because these decrease in patients improving from HE symptoms. However, international guidelines do still not recommend the measurement of ammonia levels for monitoring the treatment of HE.

Executive summary of recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis in new- onset ascites 1.1. A diagnostic paracentesis is recommended in all patients with new-onset ascites. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.2. The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include total protein concentration and calculation of the serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 1.3. Ascites fluid analysis for cytology, amylase, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and adenosine deaminase should be considered based on pretest probability of specific diagnosis (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: weak)
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 2.1. Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis SBP) in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.2. A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2.

Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

Regarding specific circumstances for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to patients with bacterascites, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate antibiotics in patients with bacterascites (neutrophil count < 250/mm³ but positive bacterial culture) exhibiting signs of systemic inflammation or infection.

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results? [^114Qadwe]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = 0.05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = 0.02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/μL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/μL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/μL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

### Rifaximin versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a systematic review [^112aQeSp]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods

Standard Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA statement for systematic review were followed during the review process(figure 1).

Figure 1
PRISMA flow diagram.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of interventions

We included trials that studied long-term (> 3 months) administration of rifaximin at any dose compared with norfloxacin for the purpose of primary or secondary prevention of SBP.

Types of participants

Studies that recruited patients with cirrhosis (irrespective of aetiology) and ascites were included in our analysis.

The indications for long term SBP prophylaxis included either primary (high risk patients with baseline ascitic fluid total protein < 1.5 g/dL along with impaired renal function [serum creatinine ≥ 1.2 mg/dL, BUN ≥ 25 mg/dL or serum Na ≤ 130 mEq/L] or patients with liver failure [Child-Pugh score ≥ 9 and serum bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL]) or secondary prophylaxis (previous episode of SBP).

Patients with active or recent gastrointestinal bleed, known liver malignancy or hypersensitivity to the planned drugs were excluded.

Types of outcome measures

The primary outcome measure across all studies was the occurrence of SBP. We used the AASLD definition of SBP, that is, the diagnosis is made in the presence of an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMNL) count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. The secondary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, defined as death due to any cause during the study period.

Study search and selection

We performed both computerised and manual searching of articles from digital dissertation databases, including Google Scholar, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL Register for Controlled Trials from 1950 until January 2017. We limited our search to studies involving humans only and articles published in the English language using keywords and/or medical subject headings (MeSH) for 'rifaximin' and 'norfloxacin' and 'spontaneous bacterial peritonitis'.

Reference lists of returned search articles were manually screened. Two authors independently reviewed all articles for inclusion. First, all titles and abstracts were assessed and irrelevant articles were rejected. Second, full-text articles were assessed and studies were selected based on meeting the inclusion criteria. After identifying relevant titles, all abstracts were read and eligible articles were selected.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^117FiXF1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was first recognized by Harold Conn in the 1964. SBP is the infection of ascitic fluid that occurs in the absence of visceral perforation or intra-abdominal inflammatory focus. Over 60% of the SBP episodes are caused by Gram-negative enteric bacilli like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The key pathogenic mechanism initiating SBP is bacterial translocation, a process through which enteric bacteria cross the intestinal barrier and infect the mesenteric lymph nodes, thus entering the blood circulation and ascitic fluid. The high rate of bacterial translocation in cirrhosis is due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth, loss of integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier and local immune system. The intestinal bacterial overgrowth in patients with cirrhosis plays a key role and is mainly attributed to delayed intestinal transit time. In healthy people, the Kupffer cells collaborate with neutrophils in the process of bacterial extraction from the circulation. In patients with hepatic cirrhosis, because of intra and extrahepatic shunts, the bacteria bypass the Kupffer cells, with resultant bacteremia and ascitic fluid inoculation. Low serum and ascites complement levels also predispose to bacteremia and eventual bacterial proliferation within ascitic fluid.

Transient ascites is reported in about 13% of patients with EHPVO. SBP complicating prehepatic portal hypertension is extremely rare and to date there is only one published case report. The postulated reasons for the low incidence of SBP includes the low occurrence of ascites, intact hepatic reticuloendothelial system and a relatively high ascitic fluid protein content in patients with EHPVO.

Clinical manifestations of SBP are often nonspecific. Approximately 10% of the patients with SBP are asymptomatic. The most frequently encountered symptoms and signs are fever, abdominal pain, signs of hepatic encephalopathy, abdominal tenderness, diarrhea, ileus and shock. SBP is diagnosed when the ascitic polymorphonuclear leucocytes exceed 250 cells/mm³ and bacteriological cultures isolate only one germ. Empirical antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately after diagnosis of SBP, without waiting for the results of ascitic fluid culture. Cefotaxime is currently the drug of choice as it covers most causative organisms and because of its high ascitic fluid concentrations during therapy. The recommended dose is 2 g IV t.i.d. for 5 days. Infection resolution is obtained in 77–98% of patients. If ascitic fluid neutrophil count fails to decrease to less than 25% of pre-treatment value after 2 days of antibiotic treatment, there is likelihood of failure to respond to therapy and this should raise the suspicion of infection caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115HHZ9u]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Ascites — initial evaluation includes abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler, complete blood count, liver function tests (INR, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin), renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), serum and urine electrolytes (Na, K) and urine analysis with spot urine protein, and ascitic fluid analysis with serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and culture. For ascitic fluid interpretation, a serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites, while a high ascitic fluid protein (> 2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites; other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context.

### Homocysteine: a new diagnostic marker in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^112ue1AZ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) depends primarily on a polymorphonuclear leukocyte cell count more than 250/mm. This method is invasive, and not diagnostic in all variants of SBP; we aimed to assess serum homocysteine as a precise indicative marker for the diagnosis of all variants of SBP.

Patients and Methods

A total 323 consecutive ascitic patients were registered in this prospective work. Serum and ascitic fluid of homocysteine were evaluated utilizing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

Participants were classified into a non-SBP group, including 262 participants and 61 patients with SBP. Serum and ascitic homocysteine were considerably elevated in the SBP group than in the non-SBP group (17.94 ± 7.57 vs. 11.75 ± 5.68μmol/l; P < 0.001 and 14.70 ± 5.45 vs. 9.75 ± 4.55μmol/l; P < 0.001). At a cutoff value of 17.79μmol/l, serum homocysteine had 89.3% specificity and 95.1% sensitivity for distinguishing SBP (area under the curve: 0.932) and, at a cutoff value of 16.1μmol/l, ascitic homocysteine had 84.4% specificity and 92.7% sensitivity for distinguishing SBP (area under the curve: 0.901). Both were positively correlated with the polymorphonuclear count, C-reactive protein, Child-Pugh score, and Model For End-Stage Liver Disease score as well as negatively correlated with the protein content in the ascitic fluid and estimated glomerular filtration rate. After SBP therapy, there was a marked reduction in serum and ascitic homocysteine levels.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that serum and ascitic homocysteine are considerably higher in SBP participants versus non-SBP patients. Serum homocysteine may provide a reliable and noninvasive diagnostic marker for all variants of SBP.

Table 1
Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of the participants (n = 77)

The inclusion criteria for the study were: 1) age > 18 years; 2) diagnosis of cirrhosis with ascites; 3) hospital admission; and 4) informed consent from the patient or from a first-degree relative, if the patient was encephalopathic. The exclusion criteria were: 1) age < 18 years; 2) unwillingness to provide informed consent; 3) extrahepatic malignancies; 4) no available data on ascitic fluid; 5) source of infection additional to SBP; and 6) non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.

All patients admitted to the hospital with any of the following underwent abdominal paracentesis on presentation: fever or signs of systemic inflammation, abdominal pain, shock, altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening of liver and/or renal function, or any degree of hepatic encephalopathy. Ascitic fluid was directly inoculated into blood culture bottles (BACT/ALERT® Culture media, BIOMERIEUX, Inc. Durham, NC). The volume inoculated was at least 10 mL for aerobic and 10 mL for anaerobic culture, and this was performed at the patient's bedside. Detailed data on cell count, protein and albumin concentration, as well as microbe sensitivities, were collected and analyzed. SBP was diagnosed as an infection of ascitic fluid without any intra-abdominal surgically treatable source of infection, and was based on a neutrophil count > 250/mm³ in ascitic fluid, as determined by microscopy or positive culture of the ascitic fluid according to the guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). On admission, all patients had a broad biochemical evaluation, arterial blood gases and baseline liver imaging (ultrasound or computed tomography) to exclude malignancy or other source of infection.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^114ywVHH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is defined by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture and an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear count (≥ 250 cells/mm³) without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. Transient ascites is well documented in patients with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction but spontaneous bacterial peritonitis complicating extrahepatic portal venous obstruction is extremely uncommon. The postulated reasons for the low incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction includes: lower incidence of ascites; intact hepatic reticuloendothelial system; and a relatively high ascitic fluid protein content. Here we report two cases of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis complicating extrahepatic portal venous obstruction.

To the Editor: In their Rational Clinical Examination study examining the performance and complications of paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with ascites and portal hypertension, Dr Wong and colleagues1 presented a comprehensive review of the literature in the context of a patient scenario. They provided evidence for analyses of ascitic fluid and suggested in their bottom line that, among other tests, the analysis of ascites pH and the calculation of the blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient are appropriate for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. However, the measurement of ascites pH and arterial pH is not recommended in guidelines on management of patients with ascites due to cirrhosis. 2 In their scenario, they analyzed arterial and ascitic fluid pH but apparently did not use this information. Instead, their final decision to start broad spectrum antibiotic treatment for presumed SBP was based on the polymorphonuclear leukocyte count. De Gottardi A.

### Validation of automated blood cell counter for the determination of polymorphonuclear cell count in the ascitic fluid of cirrhotic patients with or without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^111Cidmm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count in ascitic fluid is the most useful test for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We evaluated the validity of an automated blood cell counter for the PMN determination in ascitic fluid by comparing it with the traditional hematologic method with a light microscope in a manual counting chamber.

Methods

A total of 130 ascitic fluid samples were collected from 74 consecutive cirrhotics. The agreement between the two techniques was assessed according to Bland and Altman's method. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the automated blood cell counter were calculated by considering the diagnosis of SBP as a PMN count ≥ 250 cells/mm³, determined by the manual method as the "gold standard".

Results

The mean PMN counts assessed by the manual method and the automated blood cell counter were 124 ± 301 cells/mm³ and 130 ± 339 cells/mm³, respectively (p = 0.89, ns). The mean ± SD of the difference between manual and automated measurements was 6 ± 61 cells/mm³, whereas the limits of agreement were +127 cells/mm³ (95% CI = +108 to +147) and −115 cells/mm³ (95%CI = −96 to −135). SBP was diagnosed in 11 patients. All but one were correctly identified with the automated blood cell counter, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100%; positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 99.1%, respectively.

Conclusions

The manual method and the automated blood cell counter have a good agreement in the PMN determination in ascitic fluid, and the automated blood cell counter is a reliable tool for rapid diagnosis of SBP.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^111iM9rq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the European guidelines, SBP is diagnosed based on a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count ≥ 250/mm³ in ascetic fluid and exclusion of secondary causes of intraabdominal infection. A retrospective study from the USA found that only 52.4% of SBP patients fulfilled the polymorphonuclear diagnostic criteria. In addition, paracentesis is required to determine the ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear count. In clinical practice, some patients have contraindications to abdominocentesis. These limitations limit the use of polymorphonuclear count and reduce the efficiency of SBP diagnosis. This indicates that there are limitations to diagnosing SBP based on a polymorphonuclear count. Therefore, it is essential to develop a new diagnostic tool for SBP. A calculation tool for predicting SBP could help to find identify SBP rapidly and noninvasively.

In recent years, several models have been developed for the diagnosis of SBP, but only single-center reports with small sample sizes are available. In addition, most studies were conducted in foreign countries, with only scarce reports from China. Single-center studies have inherent limitations, and models may have different degrees of overfitting. Importantly, none of the previous models have been validated in an external data set. SBP has nonspecific symptoms and should be considered in patients with cirrhosis who develop signs or symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, altered mental state, abdominal tenderness, or low blood pressure. However, the aforementioned symptoms are not considered in any of the currently available models. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify symptoms and clinical and laboratory parameters to predict the development of SBP in cirrhotic ascites, as well as to develop a scoring system that is applicable to China for early diagnosis of SBP or exclusion of SBP without the need for abdominal paracentesis.

### Ascitic fluid lactoferrin for diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^113Zw8Bo]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is based on a manual count of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs). This procedure is operator-dependent and lysis of PMNs during transport to the laboratory may lead to false-negative results. Furthermore, ascitic fluid culture is insensitive and leads to delays in diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of ascitic fluid lactoferrin (AFLAC) for the diagnosis of SBP and to identify a cut-off level that can be used for future development of a rapid bedside test.

Methods

A total of 218 consecutive ascites samples from 148 patients (1–8 samples per patient) with cirrhosis at 2 tertiary care medical centers were examined for PMN count, bedside culture, and lactoferrin concentration. AFLAC concentrations were determined using a polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An ascitic fluid PMN count of 250 cells/mL or greater with or without a positive culture was used for diagnosis of SBP.

Results

Twenty-two (10.1%) samples fulfilled diagnostic criteria for SBP. Samples with SBP had a significantly higher lactoferrin concentration (median, 3744 ng/mL; 25th-75th percentiles [P25-P75], 788–9617) compared with non-SBP samples (median, 31 ng/mL; P25-P75, 12–67; P < .001). By using a cut-off level of 242 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for diagnosis of SBP were 95.5% and 97%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.98.

Conclusions

AFLAC can serve as a sensitive and specific test for diagnosis of SBP. Qualitative bedside assays for the measurement of AFLAC can be developed easily and may serve as a rapid and reliable screening tool for SBP in patients with cirrhosis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116V5aiV]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Ascitic fluid culture

Ascites culture is essential to help guide antibiotic therapy. Patients with 'culture-negative neutrocytic ascites' (PMN count > 250 cells/mm³) have a similar presentation to those with culture-positive SBP. As both groups of patients have significant morbidity and mortality, they should be treated in a similar manner. Some patients have 'bacterascites' in which cultures are positive, but, ascitic neutrophil count is < 250 cells/mm³. In some patients, bacterascites represents a transient and spontaneously reversible colonisation of ascites, in others, particularly those who are symptomatic, it may represent the first step in the development of SBP. Discussion with microbiologists about the organism cultured can help differentiate the above two scenarios, and when a positive culture is obtained a repeat tap should be sent to guide management.

Although the identification of pathogen(s) is essential for the management of infectious diseases, ascites fluid cultures often fail to provide positive results, even when using ascites samples from patients who develop clinical manifestations of SBP. Bacterial DNA detection and sequencing have been applied to the diagnosis of several infectious diseases, and molecular techniques can detect small amounts of bacterial DNA within a few hours. These promising techniques have yet to be introduced into routine clinical practice.

Fungal peritonitis is a rare, less studied complication and observational data suggest a worse prognosis. In a large multicentre study of 2743 cirrhotic inpatients, of whom 1052 had infections, 12.7% of infected patients had evidence of fungal infections with a case fatality of 30%. The majority of these were urinary, but the highest mortality was seen with fungaemia and peritonitis (case fatality > 50%).

Secondary bacterial peritonitis

A small proportion of patients with cirrhosis may develop peritonitis secondary to perforation or inflammation of an intra-abdominal organ, known as secondary bacterial peritonitis. In a small retrospective analysis, secondary peritonitis represented 4.5% of all peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. This should be suspected in those who have localised abdominal symptoms or signs, very high ascitic neutrophil count, the presence of multiple organisms on ascitic culture or in those with inadequate response to treatment. Cross-sectional imaging, such as CT, should be performed with early consideration of surgery in this scenario.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is associated with a high mortality rate. After antibiotic therapy, improvement in fluid polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count is expected within 2 days. However, our institution recognized cases unresponsive to standard treatment.

Methods

To study these recalcitrant cases, we completed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted for SBP to the University of Chicago from 2002 to 2007. SBP was defined by an ascitic PMN cell count ≥ 250/ml.

Results

Of 55 patients with SBP, 15 did not show improvement in fluid PMN cell count to below 250/ml with standard treatment, leading to a prevalence of 27%. The patients with persistent SBP were younger than those with nonpersistent SBP [mean (SD) 51.80 (9.84) compared with 58.13 (8.79); p = 0.0253]. Persistent SBP had a higher serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) [median (Q1, Q3) 1.85 (1.50, 2.41) compared with 1.10 (0.60, 1.60)] and a higher score in the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) [mean (SD) 27.98 (8.09) compared with 22.22 (8.10)] than nonpersistent SBP patients; p = 0.027 and p = 0.023, respectively. In addition, persistent SBP patients were more likely to have a positive ascitic fluid culture than nonpersistent SBP patients [odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) 4.33 (1.21, 15.47); p = 0.024]. Importantly, in-hospital mortality in the persistent SBP group was 40%, compared with 22.5% in the nonpersistent SBP group [OR = 2.30 (0.64, 8.19); p = 0.20].

Conclusions

The risk of persistent SBP is nearly 40% in patients with MELD score > 25, SAAG > 1.5 or positive ascitic fluid culture. Furthermore, patients who develop persistent SBP tend to experience a higher mortality rate. This study underscores the importance of further examination of this vulnerable population.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction [^111ZhpLd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is defined by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture and an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear count (> 250 cells/mm³) without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source of infection. SBP usually occurs in a background of cirrhosis and it rarely affects patients without cirrhosis. Cases of SBP have been reported in patients with nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, systemic lupus erythematosus and Budd-Chiari syndrome without liver cirrhosis. SBP in extrahepatic portal venous obstruction (EHPVO) is extremely rare with only a single case reported to date.

### Renal dysfunction is the most important independent predictor of mortality in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^111cc6PJ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most common infection among patients with cirrhosis. To improve stratification of patient care, we performed a systematic review to identify the most robust predictors of mortality in cirrhotic patients with SBP.

Methods

We reviewed prognostic studies (English language only) of adult patients with SBP, defined as a polymorphonuclear ascitic fluid cell count of 250 cells/mm³ or more, with or without positive results from culture of ascitic fluid. We reviewed only studies that performed survival and multivariate analyses and reported in-hospital or mortalities within 30 days.

Results

Of 2008 available references, 18 were included in the study (median, 115 patients per trial). The median age of patients was 56 years (68% male). The most common predictors of death were renal dysfunction, lack of SBP resolution, immunosuppressive factors, and hospital-acquired SBP. Sensitivity analysis using the 12 best-quality studies identified renal dysfunction and levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine as the most important variables. The mortality rate among patients with renal dysfunction was 67%, compared with only 11% of patients who maintained normal renal function.

Conclusions

Renal dysfunction is the main prognostic factor for cirrhotic patients with SBP, followed by the MELD score. Further studies are needed to determine whether these factors identified retain prognostic value in high-risk patients who receive albumin. Risk stratification might be used to select additional treatments, such as early vasoconstrictor therapy, for the highest-risk group.

### Outcomes after hospitalisation with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis over a 13-year period: a retrospective cohort study [^11383vkz]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goals

Assess outcomes in patients with an index presentation of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) over a 13-year period.

Background

SBP, a bacterial infection of ascites, has a poor prognosis.

Study

Retrospective cohort study assessing mortality (standardised to 32months) and prognostic factors in patients with SBP during two periods: period 1 (June 2006-November 2012) and period 2 (December 2012-May 2019).

Results

The study included 178 patients who were followed up for 11.6 (29.2) months. Mortality was high, with 12-, 24- and 32-month survival being 32%, 26% and 24%, respectively. Inpatient mortality was 36% with mortality in those surviving hospitalisation being 62%. Serum creatinine at the time of SBP diagnosis was an independent predictor of mortality at 32months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.002, P = 0.023] and inpatient mortality (HR 1.003, P = 0.035). Positive ascitic fluid culture and ascitic fluid neutrophil count were independent predictors of 32-month (HR 1.679, P = 0.008) and inpatient mortality (HR 1.0001, P = 0.005), respectively. Patients in period 2 had lower ascitic fluid albumin (5.9 ± 3.3g/L vs. 10.8 ± 5.4g/L, P < 0.001), higher ascitic fluid neutrophil count (815.0cells/mm³ vs. 345.0cells/mm³, P < 0.001) and higher rates of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (58 vs. 35%, P = 0.002). Mortality at 32months and mortality in those surviving hospitalisation were similar at 78 vs. 73%, P = 0.392 and 66 vs. 58%, P = 0.355, for periods 1 and 2, respectively.

Conclusions

Despite more advanced initial presentations, mortality rates have remained similar over the last 13years. Serum creatinine at the time of SBP diagnosis is an independent predictor of mortality.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in asymptomatic outpatients with cirrhotic ascites [^111DbAv2]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

The prevalence and natural history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in asymptomatic patients with ascites secondary to cirrhosis is unknown. From a prospectively recorded database, we reviewed the clinical and laboratory features of all outpatients with cirrhotic ascites undergoing paracentesis between July 1994 and December 2000. The prevalence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the population of 427 cirrhotic outpatients as defined by neutrocytic ascites (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³)) was 3.5%. Of the 15 patients with neutrocytic ascites, 6 were culture positive (1.4%) and 9 culture negative (2.1%). Eight other patients (1.9%) had bacterascites. The organisms cultured from ascitic fluid in these asymptomatic patients with culture positive neutrocytic ascites and bacterascites were predominantly gram positive. No patient developed hepatorenal syndrome, and 1-year survival of 67% was better than historical data from hospitalized patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Moreover, patients who did not receive antibiotics for neutrocytic ascites fared no worse than patients who did receive antibiotics. In conclusion, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in outpatients with cirrhotic ascites is less frequent, occurs in patients with less advanced liver disease, and may have a better outcome than its counterpart in hospitalized patients. In addition, the organisms cultured from ascitic fluid in outpatients are predominantly gram positive. A reassessment of diagnostic criteria for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in outpatients may be required.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1131FfV3]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE) response assessment and duration are specified as follows: it is recommended that a diagnostic paracentesis (or thoracentesis for SBE) be performed 48 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy to assess response, and a negative response is defined by a decrease in PMN count < 25% from baseline that should prompt broadening antibiotics and evaluation for secondary peritonitis. The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy is 5–7 days, although a small study found therapy was shorter when discontinued once PMN decreased to < 250/mm³ (mean, 4.8 days) compared with empirically determined duration (mean, 9.6 days). Patients with ascites PMN < 250/mm³ and a positive bacteriological culture (bacterascites) without signs of infection should not receive antibiotics, and a repeat diagnostic paracentesis should be performed to investigate progression to SBP, while repeat paracentesis/thoracentesis may be unnecessary if an organism is isolated, is susceptible, and the patient is improving clinically.

### A new highly sensitive point of care screen for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis using the leukocyte esterase method [^115EyEnw]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Urine reagent strips measuring leukocyte esterase activity have been studied to screen spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) but are insensitive. We calibrated a strip specifically for ascitic fluid to achieve high sensitivity in this diagnosis.

Methods

Experiments were conducted on ascitic fluid from patients with cirrhosis. Samples with SBP were diluted with native acellular ascitic fluid to achieve PMN counts below, above, and close to the diagnostic threshold of 250 PMN/μL. A model of SBP was created by spiking negative ascitic fluid samples (< 250 PMN/μL) with activated PMN from blood of patients with sepsis, and diluted to achieve a range of PMN. Aliquots were tested at 2, 3, 4, and 10 min with the Periscreen leukocyte esterase strip. PMN/microl was correlated to timings and color scales: white defined negative (PMN < 250/microl); and shades of brown, purple, and pink defined positive. Ascitic fluid samples were obtained from 58 patients. Negative ascitic fluid was used from 32 to generate the model SBP.

Results

One thousand three hundred and four experiments were performed with a median PMN count of 492/μL (0–7510). After exclusion of uninterpretable colorimetric results, 1089 experiments were analyzed [PMN of 444/microl (0–7510)]. The best result was obtained at 3 min (n = 299), with Se: 100%, Sp: 57.9%; NPV: 100%, PPV: 76.5%. The test was not interpretable in bloody, chylous or bilious ascitic fluid, or concurrent imipenem treatment.

Conclusions

This new leukocyte esterase strip calibrated to an ascitic fluid PMN count 250/μL is a robust screening tool when the strip turns any hue of tan/brown at 3 min.

### Physician clinical impression does not rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients undergoing emergency department paracentesis [^117VcRDt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether clinical characteristics and physician assessment are useful in the exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in emergency department (ED) patients with ascites requiring paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis. Predefined clinical characteristics including historical features and ED vital signs were recorded. Each patient was assessed by 2 separate, blinded physicians for severity of abdominal tenderness and overall clinical suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) of the individual clinical characteristics and the physician assessments. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was defined by absolute neutrophil count greater than 250 cells/mm(3) or positive fluid culture result.

Results

There were 285 separate physician assessments in 144 patients enrolled with complete data. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed in 17 (11.8%) patients. Physician clinical impression had a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62% to 91%) and specificity of 34% (95% CI 28% to 40%) for the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The lowest negative LR was associated with the presence of any abdominal pain or tenderness (negative LR = 0.4); however, the presence of pain/tenderness was also observed in 85% of patients without spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Six patients (4.2%) with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis had at least 1 physician assessment of little to no risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and 3 of the 6 subsequently died during their hospitalization.

Conclusion

Clinical characteristics and physician assessment were insufficient in the diagnosis or exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the ED patient undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic paracentesis. This finding supports routine laboratory fluid analysis after ED paracentesis.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1132XD33]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Bacterial infection recognition and initial management in cirrhosis — clinical triggers and early therapy are outlined as follows: The presence of fever or hypothermia, chills, and localizing symptoms should raise suspicion for a bacterial infection, although typical symptoms may be absent in cirrhosis; bacterial infection should be suspected when a patient with cirrhosis deteriorates, particularly with encephalopathy, acute kidney injury (AKI), and/or jaundice. Workup should be initiated promptly, including skin examination, leukocyte count with differential, blood cultures, and urinalysis, and if clinical suspicion is strong (e.g., association with systemic inflammatory response), empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as samples for cultures have been collected, particularly in the presence of hemodynamic instability. In patients with cirrhosis in septic shock, mortality increases by 7% for every hour's delay in initiating antibiotics.

### Predicting mortality in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis using routine inflammatory and biochemical markers [^114ho1dY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and high-mortality infectious complication of patients with cirrhosis. New inflammatory markers are associated with morbidity/mortality in various diseases. The aim of our study was to find the 30-day mortality rate of SBP and their predictors.

Patients and Methods

Seventy patients with cirrhosis complicated with SBP and 55 non-SBP controls were enrolled into the study, and patients were evaluated for mortality rate and its predictors.

Results

The 30-day and 3-month mortality rates in the SBP group were 26.1 and 50.7%, respectively. Mortality rates were higher in the SBP group than in the controls. Symptoms at hospital admission and cell counts in ascitic fluid made no difference in predicting 30-day mortality. Patients with SBP with high serum neutrophil counts, high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, high C reactive protein (CRP)/albumin ratio, and high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score had higher 30-day mortality rates. We determined optimal cutoff values of MELD scores and serum neutrophil counts for predicting 30-day mortality as 20.5 and 6850/mm, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for the MELD cutoff value were 83.3 and 80.4%, respectively. We also followed up patients for 60 months after SBP; the patients with high inflammatory markers and MELD scores at the time of SBP diagnosis had worse survival compared with the group with lower levels.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that SBP has high 30-day mortality. MELD scores and inflammatory markers (CRP, CRP albumin ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio) may be used to predict mortality in patients with SBP.

### Bacterial DNA is a prognostic factor for mortality in patients who recover from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^112m5SYi]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of the present work is the relatively small number of patients with SBP. Nonetheless, to our knowledge, it is the largest study to assess multiplex PCR in SBP patients. Moreover, it is the first to show that bactDNA detection at diagnosis of an SBP episode is associated with early mortality after resolution of the infection.

In conclusion, the study provided no evidence to support the implementation of bactDNA detected by a standardized multiplex PCR procedure to improve immediate bacterial identification and early optimization of antibiotic treatment in patients with SBP. However, bactDNA was an independent prognostic factor of early mortality in the subset of patients who recovered from the infection.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Prognosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) remains poor, despite proper management
Delayed or inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy has been demonstrated to further increase mortality rates
Sensitivity of ascitic cultures is moderate to low, even when performed according to guidelines

What the new findings are:

Ascitic fluid (AF) bacterial DNA detected by a multiplex PCR method could not increase the sensitivity of identification and optimize the choice of antibiotic treatment in SBP
During the SBP episode, severe liver disease and a vigorous inflammatory reaction were predictors of 7-day mortality
Presence of AF bacterial DNA and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at baseline were associated with short-term mortality after resolution of the SBP episode

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis management — IV antibiotics should be started empirically (before obtaining culture results) in all patients with an ascites PMN count > 250/mm³; patients with a focal intraabdominal inflammatory entity (e.g., diverticulitis, cholecystitis) may have an ascites PMN count > 250/mm³ and should be treated not for SBP but for the specific condition per standard of care, including a surgical consult; traditionally, third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) were recommended in all patients with SBP, with resolution rates of approximately 90%, and currently they are recommended as the first-line antibiotics (e.g. IV cefotaxime 2 g every 12 hours) in settings where MDROs are not prevalent; inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy in patients admitted with septic shock increases the risk of death by 10 times.

### Predictors of fifty days in-hospital mortality in patients with culture negative neutrocytic ascites [^116kCaL3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a (SBP) common presentation of ascitic fluid infection in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis. There are three variants of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Culture negative neutrocytic ascites, monomicrobialbacterascites, polymicrobialbacterascites. The term culture-negative neutrocytic ascites (CNNA) was proposed in 1984 by Runyon. The diagnosis was made with 1) elevated ascitic fluid polymorponuclear cell count ≥ 250 cells/mm³ 2) negative ascitic fluid culture 3) absence of antibiotic therapy in the last one month 4) no evidence of surgically treatable intraabdominal source of infection or pancreatitis.

There are conflicting reports regarding the natural history and the mortality associated with culture-negative neutrocytic ascites. Pelletier et al. and Saleh et al. reported spontaneous resolution of culture-negative neutrocytic ascites along with lower mortality compared to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. While Runyon and Hoefs advocated comparable mortality rates among culture-negative neutrocytic ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Both the study were based on small sample size (n = 15), also there is no study on the predictors of the mortality in culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Hence we aim to study the clinical course and prognosis associated with culture negative neutrocytic ascites with a larger sample population.

### Usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels in patients with liver cirrhosis [^114RpvT6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Ascites is one of the most common complications of advanced liver disease. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a clinical syndrome in which ascitic fluid becomes infected in the absence of any apparent intra-abdominal source of peritonitis. The diagnosis of SBP is based on a manual count of PMN cells in ascitic fluid, with counts ≥ 250 cells/mm³ indicative of SBP. However, this method of diagnosis is operator-dependent and, therefore, subject to human error. Moreover, lysis of the cells during transport to the laboratory can lead to false negative results.

Parsi et al. assessed the utility of ascitic fluid lactoferrin level for the diagnosis of SBP in patients with cirrhosis. However, few studies have evaluated the findings of Parsi et al. to clarify the clinical usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin level for the diagnosis of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the aims of our study were to investigate the usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels for the diagnosis of SBP in patients with ascites caused by cirrhosis and to evaluate the association between lactoferrin levels and the development of HCC.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^112TH7Sd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

SBP is the leading cause of death in end-stage liver disease patients. Early diagnosis of SBP is important to improve patient survival. Because highly sensitive and specific biomarkers for the diagnosis of SBP in cirrhotic ascites are not available, the diagnosis is often delayed. Several studies have reported unsatisfactory diagnostic accuracy of polymorphonuclear count for SBP. Ascitic bacterial culture is vital for the diagnosis of SBP, but the positive rate is low and the test is time-consuming. In addition, some patients with cirrhosis, especially those with decompensated cirrhosis and reduced platelet count and coagulation elements, refuse abdominal paracentesis due to the bleeding risk. Furthermore, abdominal paracentesis is not always available in the outpatient services. Due to the lack of a corresponding examination, the results of routine laboratory examination of ascites are unavailable. To overcome these issues, there is a need to develop more sensitive and reliable tools for SBP diagnosis.

In this study, we developed and validated a nomogram, which incorporates the symptoms, infection markers, blood glucose, LDH, and MELD scores, for the individualized diagnosis of SBP. The nine variables included in the model were important for predicting SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites; these markers were abdominal pain, diarrhea, WBC, N (%), procalcitonin, CRP, LDH, blood glucose, and MELD score. According to the univariate analysis, age, platelet, and NLR did not predict SBP. The diagnosis model may compensate for the lack of availability of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear count and culture. Importantly, our nomogram is convenient to use and could serve as an effective tool for individualized diagnosis and guiding treatment of SBP. We also developed a Microsoft Excel calculation model to allow convenient adoption in clinical practice.

### Is detection of bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid of clinical relevance? [^116sqvje]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with cirrhosis, bacterial DNA has been found in ascites reflecting bacterial translocation. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is ill-defined especially compared with the standard diagnostics for detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Furthermore, other DNA tests have not been sufficiently evaluated.

Patients and Methods

We prospectively included 151 patients with cirrhosis and ascites admitted to our department. The patients were evaluated for diagnosis of SBP (polymorphonuclear count > 250 cells/mm) or finding of bacterascites, defined by positive bacterial culture from ascites. To detect bacterial species of bacterial DNA fragments in ascites, broad-range polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing analysis with the LightCycler SeptiFast Kit Mgrade were performed. Routine parameters were correlated with these findings.

Results

Eighteen of 151 patients (12%) had SBP according to the classic definition. Bacterial DNA was detected in five of these 18 patients (3%), whereas in 13 patients (9%), bacterial DNA was detected without standard SBP. Seven patients (5%) had culture-positive SBP, only in two of them bacterial DNA was detected. In multivariate analysis, C-reactive protein (P = 0.000), white blood cell count (P = 0.019), and lactic acid dehydrogenase in ascites (P = 0.000) were independently associated with SBP. In the DNA-positive ascites group, none of the assessed parameters was significantly associated with the bacterial DNA positivity.

Conclusion

We found no correlation between detection of bacterial DNA in ascites and SBP (polymorphonuclear count > 250/mm). In contrast to the patients with bacterial DNA in ascites, patients with SBP showed clinical signs of infection. This study provides no evidence that detection of bacterial DNA in ascites of patients with liver cirrhosis is of clinical or diagnostic relevance when using the panel of LightCycler SeptiFast Kit Mgrade.

### Rapid diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis by use of reagent strips [^113cacCN]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

We studied the use of reagent strips for diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients with ascites. A reagent strip for leukocyte esterase designed for the testing of urine with a colorimetric 5-grade scale (0 to 4) was used to evaluate ascitic fluid in 228 nonselected paracentesis performed in 128 cirrhotic patients. We diagnosed 52 SBP and 5 secondary bacterial peritonitis by means of polymorphonuclear cell count and classical criteria. When we considered positive a reagent strip result of 3 or 4, sensitivity was 89% (51 of 57), specificity was 99% (170 of 171), and positive predictive value was 98%. When we considered positive a reagent strip result of 2 or more, sensitivity was 96% (55 of 57), specificity was 89% (152 of 171), and negative predictive value was 99%. In conclusion, the use of reagent strips is a rapid, easy to use, and inexpensive tool for diagnosis of ascitic fluid infection. A positive result should be an indication for empirical antibiotic therapy, and a negative result may be useful as a screening test to exclude SBP.

Results

Baseline characteristics

Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the SBP patients. Patients with culture-positive compared to those with culture-negative SBP had more severe liver disease, according to MELD and Child-Pugh scores, presented ACLF more often and had a more vigorous inflammatory reaction, both in blood, expressed as higher neutrophil-to-white blood cell and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NWR and NLR, respectively), and in AF, expressed as higher white-cell and neutrophil counts. Patients with culture-positive compared to those with culture-negative SBP had lower total protein and albumin in AF. In contrast, no statistically significant differences between bactDNA positive and negative baseline characteristics were observed, though there was a trend towards higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and more frequent manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy. No prophylactic treatment for SBP was recorded. Resolution of the infection occurred in all SBP patients who survived the episode (less than 250×10⁹/L neutrophil count in AF at paracentesis).

### Predictors of fifty days in-hospital mortality in patients with culture negative neutrocytic ascites [^1135Pv8G]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

It is important to mention that CTP and ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear count scores are not statistical significant predictors of mortality in culture negative neutrocytic ascites. Our results of culture negativity was based on the first negative culture results with in 24 h of hospital admission. We don't know how many become culture positive after that. It is not clear those become culture positive after initial negative results should be categorised into SBP or CNNA. We don't know the recurrence rate or conversation rate of culture negative neutrocytic ascites.

Culture negative neutrocytic ascites considered as a less severe variant of SBP. From our study we inferred that if the clinical course, prognosis and mortality rate of culture negative neutrocytic ascites is similar to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis then why should it be considered as a different entity? We argue in favour of calling culture negative neutrocytic ascites as early stage spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The possibility of late stage resolution of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis leading to culture negativity cannot be ruled out, however the chances are really slim as persons with advanced stage of cirrhosis are too immunocompromised to clear the bacterial infection on its own. May be the bacterial particle in ascitic fluid have not reached the threshold limit to be detected by the current culture methods. We still use the old school method of ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear cell count and culture to diagnose ascitic fluid infections. In my opinion we should incorporate bacterial DNA or pro inflammatory markers to diagnose ascitic fluid infections into our current clinical practice. However, it is critical to access the cost effectiveness and feasibility of such newer methods in developing nations with limited resources. To summarize, the prognostic parameters in culture negative neutrocytic ascites with liver cirrhosis are well known and established for more than a decade now but to my knowledge none of the studies have indicated the predictive ability of alanine and aspartate amiotransferase as far as in-hospital mortality is concerned. In this aspect our study will enlighten the scientific community. Our results showed liver enzymes like aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminoransaminase have significant prognostic value in detecting mortality of culture negative neutrocytic ascites along with other classic parameters like acute kidney injury, septic shock, model for end stage liver disease.

Our study has certain limitations. We didn't stratify the septic shock to different sub groups based on bacteriology. The sensitivity and specificity of AST is low (60% and 70% respectively).

### Diagnostic utility of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 kDa in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: single-center study [^111ARSHw]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in cirrhotic patients with ascites. The diagnosis of SBP is mainly made on the basis of a polymorphonuclear leukocyte cell count exceeding 250/μl in ascitic fluid. However, this procedure is subjective. We aimed to evaluate serum and ascitic fluid interferon-γ-induced protein (IP-10) as accurate diagnostic markers for detecting SBP.

Methods

A total of 425 consecutive patients with ascites were included. Serum and ascitic fluid of IP-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

Patients were divided into an SBP group, including 61 patients, and a non-SBP group, including 364 patients. Serum and ascitic IP-10 were significantly higher in SBP patients than in patients without SBP (1855 ± 825 vs. 955 ± 510pg/ml; P < 0.001 and 2160 ± 994 vs. 1110 ± 623pg/ml; P < 0.001), respectively. There was a significant increase in both serum and ascitic levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in SBP patients than in patients without SBP. At a cut-off value of 1915pg/ml, serum IP-10 had 91% sensitivity and 89% specificity for detecting SBP (area under the curve: 0.912). Also, at a cut-off value of 2355pg/ml, ascitic IP-10 had 92.5% sensitivity and 87% specificity for detecting SBP (area under the curve: 0.943). Both were correlated with ascitic fluid proteins, polymorphonuclear count, TNF-α, and IL-6.

Conclusion

Serum and ascitic IP-10, TNF-α, and IL-6 are significantly increased in SBP patients versus patients without SBP. Serum level of IP-10 is more specific and sensitive, such as ascites. Thus, it seems to represent a satisfactory diagnostic marker for the diagnosis of SBP.

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^113Uf1D8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Design

We conducted a cross-sectional study to develop a diagnostic model for the early and accurate diagnosis of SBP.

Study population

The retrospective study was conducted at Beijing You-An Hospital, Capital Medical University, The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, and Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. We continuously recruited 1618 patients with ascites who underwent abdominal paracentesis. Data related to the clinical features, history, demographic information, physical examination, and laboratory test results were collected. Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis was routinely performed in all cirrhotic ascites patients as well as those with suspicion of SBP. Cirrhosis was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria suggested by the 2019 guidelines for the management of cirrhosis. The study included patients aged 18–90 years with cirrhosis and ascites. We excluded patients with any factors that may affect the diagnosis of SBP, namely antibiotic use, use of SBP prophylaxis, ascites without cirrhosis (such as due to pancreatitis, peritoneal cancer, tuberculosis, heart failure, kidney disease, or intraabdominal bleeding), malignant tumors, hematological diseases, abdominal surgery within the past 3 months, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal diseases (such as gastritis, enteritis, or intestinal obstruction), chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the past 1 month, pregnancy, secondary peritonitis, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or contraceptives, bacterial infections other than SBP, recent bleeding, other causes of fever (such as HIV infection), other infections or diseases that may affect the blood, white blood cell (WBC) count or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (e.g. skin or chest infections), or other diseases that can cause elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (e.g. myocardial infarction or myositis). Patients underwent medical history, general examination, abdominal examination, abdominal ultrasound, laboratory tests, routine diagnostic abdominal paracentesis, and ascitic fluid analysis. Patients were divided into three groups: training, internal validation, and external validation. The training group included 70% of patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites (n = 757) from Beijing You-An Hospital and Beijing Ditan Hospital to develop the scoring system. The internal validation group included the remaining 30% of participants with liver cirrhosis and ascites (n = 324) to validate the diagnostic performance of this scoring system. The external validation group recruited patients (n = 367) from The Fifth Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital to further validate the model.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic paracentesis, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to perform diagnostic paracentesis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites in the presence of any of the following:

- gastrointestinal bleeding

- shock

- fever or other signs of systemic inflammation

- gastrointestinal symptoms

- hepatic encephalopathy

- worsening liver or renal function.

### Bacterascites confers poor patient prognosis beyond MELD prediction [^111iZxet]. Liver Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a well-recognized clinical entity with a poor prognosis. In comparison, the prevalence, microbiological flora, and prognostic significance of bacterascites (BA) (the presence of organism on culture but ascitic PMN < 250 cells/mm³) is largely unknown. We, therefore, assessed the prognosis and predictors of outcome in patients with BA in comparison with those with SBP. Ascitic fluid cultures from consecutive patients with cirrhosis from 2008 to 2018 were reviewed retrospectively, and patients with SBP and BA were identified. Baseline demographic, laboratory, and microbiological data were collated and analyzed as prognostic indicators, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patients were censored at the time of LT, death, or last follow-up. For this study 176 and 213 cases of SBP and BA, respectively, were identified and included. Patients with SBP had significantly higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) (p = < 0.01), peripheral blood WCC (p < 0.01), and higher rates of Enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.01) and multi-drug resistant pathogens (p < 0.01). Survival at 1 and 3 months was lower in patients with SBP (p < 0.01) when compared with BA but at 6 months and beyond, no significant difference remained. After the exclusion of deaths within 30 days of presentation, survival between SBP and BA was equivocal at all time points. Mortality was substantially higher across all MELD groupings for both SBP and BA when compared with the predicted mortality calculated by the MELD score alone. BA has a negative impact on patient survival above that predicted by the MELD score. It has similar impact to SBP on patient survival beyond 1 month suggesting it should be seen as a poor prognostic marker and prompt consideration of LT where appropriate. Further studies evaluating the role of secondary prophylaxis in this group are required.

### Diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients by use of two reagent strips [^111F87k7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the potentially life-threatening complications in ascitic cirrhotic patients with a mortality rate ranging between 30 and 50%. The improved survival might be explained by a more rapid diagnosis and treatment. The aim of our study was to assess the utility of two reagent strips, the Multistix test and the Combur(2) test LN, for the rapid diagnosis of SBP.

Methods

Thirty-one unselected consecutive cirrhotic patients with ascites were included and a total of 100 paracenteses were performed. All ascitic fluid was analysed with the two reagent strips, leucocyte and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocyte cell count and blood-bottle culture if the strips were positive. The strips were considered positive if the colour turned to purple: i.e.g.rade 3 or 4 for the Multistix test and 2 or 3 for the Combur(2) test LN on a colorimetric scale.

Results

We diagnosed nine infections of which four were SBP defined by PMN ≥ 250 cells/mm³ and a positive culture in ascitic fluid and five were culture negative neutrocytic ascites (PMN ≥ 250 cells/mm³ and a negative culture). The results of the two strips were concordant and were negative in only one SBP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of these two strips were 89%, 100%, 100% and 99%, respectively.

Conclusions

These reagent strips are very sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SBP, allowing immediate commencement of empirical antibiotic therapy. These strips should be used for the diagnosis of SBP, especially on an emergency basis.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis | Infectious diseases… [^111VyvbY]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Zhang G, Jazwinski Faust A. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis. JAMA. 2021; 325:

1118. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.10292 Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection of fluid that accumulates in the abdomen. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is an infection of abdominal fluid, called ascites, that does not come from an obvious place within the abdomen, such as a hole in the intestines or a collection of pus. The condition typically affects people with liver disease, who often develop ascites as their disease worsens. Ascites forms in advanced liver disease when pressure is increased across the liver and when liver function is impaired, which causes levels of certain proteins to be lower in the blood. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can occur when bacteria that normally live in the intestine enter the abdominal cavity and the ascites becomes infected.

This happens in advanced liver disease because the immune system response weakens and the bacterial environment in the gut changes. Inflammation can cause the intestines to become leaky and allow gut bacteria to infect areas of the body that are normally germ free. The most common symptoms in people with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Some people may also experience confusion. However, there can also be no symptoms. Individuals who have advanced liver disease with ascites and are hospitalized for confusion and/or liver or kidney malfunction should be tested for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The biggest risk with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is sepsis, the rapid progression of infection to the whole body. It is important to recognize spontaneous bacterial peritonitis quickly so it can be treated. Doctors test for it by using a small needle and syringe to take a sample of the ascitic fluid to measure the number of white blood cells.

People who have had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are at risk of developing it again. Doctors may prescribe daily oral antibiotics to people who have either had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or who are at risk of developing it because they have very low protein levels in their ascitic fluid. Patients with advanced liver disease and ascites who experience bleeding from the esophagus, stomach, or intestines should receive antibiotics for 5 to 7 days to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Validation of a new simple scoring system to predict spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [^115gh6j9]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This prospective study included all adult patients with cirrhosis and ascites admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology at Cho Ray Hospital between November 2021 and May 2022. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City. All patients who provided informed consent were included in this study.

Study population

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients with cirrhosis, (b) presence of ascites, and (c) age > 18 years. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) use of antibiotics in the previous two weeks or prophylaxis for SBP before admission; (b) ascites without portal hypertension, such as peritoneal tuberculosis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, congestive heart failure, renal diseases, and pancreatitis, or hemorrhage into ascites; (c) secondary peritonitis; and (d) infections other than SBP, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin infection; (e) patients with malignancy; (f) patients with hematologic disease; (g) patient is taking antiplatelet drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; (h) patients received a platelet or blood transfusion before admission; and (i) patients with diseases associated with increased MPV, for example, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, immune thrombocytopenia, and myeloproliferative disease.

Within 24 h of admission, the patients underwent paracentesis and were sent for biochemical tests and cell counts. In cases of iatrogenic hemorrhagic ascites (post-paracentesis), the neutrophil counts were.

corrected. One neutrophil was subtracted from the absolute neutrophil count for every 250 red blood cells to yield the "corrected neutrophil count". The diagnosis of SBP is based on neutrophil count in ascitic fluid of > 250/mm³, regardless of the results of ascitic culture. Data were collected for each patient through their medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory results. Based on these data, the Mansoura score was calculated upon admission (Table 1). The Child-Pugh classification and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score system were calculated using an established formula to determine the severity of hepatic decompensation.

All patients included in the study had cirrhosis and ascites. Therefore, all the patients had decompensated cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed based on the clinical indicators of severe liver disease, imaging techniques, endoscopic findings, and biochemical indicators of portal hypertension.

### In-hospital mortality in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a new predictive model [^113MJHaG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction and Objective

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a severe complication in cirrhotics with ascites. Early identification of high-risk patients is crucial for prognostic improvement. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) relies on a few objective variables and predicts short-term survival. We aimed to determine the predictive value of MELD score, at admission, in the short-term mortality of SBP patients.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 73 SBP episodes admitted in our department between January 2002 and April 2006. Diagnosis (neutrophil count in ascitic fluid ≥ 250/mm³) was established within 24 h and cefotaxime was immediately started. Data collected included age, sex, etiology of liver disease, severity of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, serum creatinine, total bilirubin and albumin, prothrombin time with international normalized ratio, and ascitic fluid analysis.

Statistics

Student's t-test, chi2 test, univariate analysis, logistic regression model, and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

In-hospital mortality rate was 37%. In multivariate analysis, MELD score (P < 0.001), and advanced age (P < 0.05) were independent predictors of mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curve for MELD score revealed an excellent discriminatory ability to predict death, with an area under curve of 0.84. Age increased the predictive ability of MELD score, represented by an increment of area under curve to 0.88.

Conclusion

MELD score and older age were independent predictors of mortality. Age increased the discriminatory ability of MELD score to predict death. This new model may be useful for stratifying patients in future therapeutic trials, deserving further validation.

### Clinical impression and ascites appearance do not rule out bacterial peritonitis [^111qJ9Gn]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research has demonstrated that physician clinical suspicion, determined without assessing fluid appearance, is not adequate to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) without fluid testing.

Study Objective

To determine the sensitivity of physician clinical suspicion, including a bedside assessment of fluid appearance, in the detection of SBP in Emergency Department (ED) patients undergoing paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational study of ED patients with ascites undergoing paracentesis at three academic facilities. The enrolling physician recorded the clinical suspicion of SBP ("none", "low", "moderate", or "high"), and ascites appearance ("clear", "hazy", "cloudy", or "bloody"). SBP was defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³, or culture pathogen growth. We defined "clear" ascites fluid as negative for SBP, and "hazy", "cloudy", or "bloody" as positive. A physician clinical suspicion of "none" or "low" was considered negative for SBP, and an assessment of "moderate" or "high" was considered positive. The primary outcome measure was sensitivity of physician clinical impression and ascites appearance for SBP.

Results

There were 348 cases enrolled, with SBP diagnosed in 43 (12%). Physician clinical suspicion had a sensitivity of 42% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29–55%) for the detection of SBP. Fluid appearance had a sensitivity of 72% (95% CI 58–83%).

Conclusion

Physician clinical impression, which included an assessment of fluid appearance, had poor sensitivity for the detection of SBP and cannot be used to exclude the diagnosis. Routine laboratory fluid analysis is indicated after ED paracentesis, even in patients considered to have a low degree of suspicion for SBP.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114MFieE]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute kidney injury (AKI), and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) — diagnosis and treatment notes include the following: Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage against both gram-positive and negative organisms should be commenced in children with ascites PMN count > 250/mm³, or children with suspected SBP in whom diagnostic paracentesis cannot be achieved. Children with proven or suspected SBP should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic cover against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. No recommendation can be given for the management of AKI and HRS in children with cirrhosis because of the absence of relevant definitions and lack of data on treatment and outcomes. HRS was identified in 6% of children waiting for LT in one center.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111RuPDB]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) initial management — First-line empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired SBP/SBE is IV third-generation cephalosporin, whereas in patients with a health care–associated or nosocomial infection or recent exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics or who are admitted with sepsis or septic shock, empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as the first line. Response to empirical antibiotic therapy may be assessed by repeating diagnostic paracentesis/thoracentesis 2 days after initiation, and a decrease in fluid PMN < 25% from baseline indicates lack of response and should lead to broadening of antibiotic coverage and further evaluation to rule out secondary bacterial peritonitis. Patients with SBP should be treated with IV albumin in addition to antibiotics (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3), and patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and/or jaundice at time of diagnosis of SBP are more likely to benefit from albumin. Nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs) should be temporarily held in patients with SBP who develop hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 65 mm Hg) or AKI.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm³ confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

In Reply: For reasons similar to those outlined by Dr De Gottardi, we chose to resolve the clinical scenario with the diagnostic test that had a high positive likelihood ratio and is recommended by current guidelines, 1 the PMN count. Our article focused on the diagnostic accuracy of white blood cell count, PMN count, pH, and pH gradient. Although several studies have examined the accuracy of reagent strips to detect PMN count in ascitic fluid, they lacked standardization — different manufacturers, different numbers of grading scales, and different cut-offs for each grade. 2, 3 The assessment of reagent strips and several other less commonly reported tests of ascites such as lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and glucose that have been studied in SBP4-6 were beyond the focus of our review. We agree with De Gottardi that reagent strips may be an economical, timely, and feasible tool for the clinician that should be subject to systematic review of the literature to determine their accuracy.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the multistix 8 SG reagent strip in diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^112xjSo3]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Recent studies have shown that the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) can be rapidly obtained using leukocyte esterase reagent strips. However, published studies were restricted to one or two centers, and the number of patients with SBP was thus limited. The aims of the current prospective multicenter study were: (1) to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Multistix 8SG urine test for the diagnosis of SBP; and (2) to assess the prevalence of SBP. From January to May 2004, 2 reactive strips were tested independently in inpatients with cirrhosis and in outpatients undergoing paracentesis. Cultures of ascitic fluid were performed at the bedside using aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Two thousand one hundred twenty-three paracenteses were performed in 1,041 patients from 70 centers. One hundred seventeen samples, obtained from 91 patients, had ascites polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) counts ≥ 250/μL (range, 250–34,000), among which 56 were associated with positive ascitic fluid cultures. The prevalence of SBP was 5.5% in the whole population, 9% in inpatients, and 1.3% in outpatients (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of SBP was 0.57% in asymptomatic outpatients versus 2.4% in symptomatic outpatients (P = 0.04). Using a threshold of 2+ for positivity of the reagent strip, sensitivity was 45.3% for the diagnosis of SBP, specificity was 99.2%, positive predictive value was 77.9%, and negative predictive value was 96.9%.

Conclusion

This study confirms the low prevalence of SBP in asymptomatic outpatients according to a priori defined criteria, and indicates an absence of diagnostic efficacy for this specific strip test.

### Incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis among asymptomatic cirrhosis patients undergoing outpatient paracentesis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113M7qmM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis with high morbidity and mortality rate. There is a paucity of evidence regarding the incidence of SBP in asymptomatic liver cirrhosis patients undergoing routine out-patient large-volume paracentesis (LVP). The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the incidence of SBP among asymptomatic decompensated cirrhosis patients undergoing routine outpatient LVP.

Methods

A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science and CENTRAL electronic databases was performed in January 2021, along with a manual search of reference lists of retrieved articles. Data were extracted to determine the incidence of SBP [polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) greater than 250 PMNs/mm³ with or without positive culture] and the incidence of all positive paracentesis (SBP or bacterascites-positive ascitic culture but no elevation in PMNs).

Results

A total of 504 studies were retrieved with 16 studies being included in the review. A total of 1532 patients were included with a total of 4016 paracentesis performed. The incidence of a positive paracentesis (SBP and/or bacterascitis) was 4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 3–6%]. However, the incidence of definite SBP was 2% (95% CI, 1–3%).

Conclusion

The incidence of SBP in asymptomatic outpatients with decompensated cirrhosis requiring LVP is low. The benefit of routine analysis of all paracentesis samples in this population is questionable. Further studies are required to determine the cost-effectiveness of routine analysis and to determine if certain subgroups are at higher risk of SBP that require routine analysis.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part II. complications and treatment [^112RxNzd]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Major complications of cirrhosis include ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome. Diagnostic studies on ascitic fluid should include a differential leukocyte count, total protein level, a serum-ascites albumin gradient, and fluid cultures. Therapy consists of sodium restriction, diuretics, and complete abstention from alcohol. Patients with ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of 250 cells per mm³ or greater should receive empiric prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis with cefotaxime and albumin. Patients who survive an episode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should receive long-term prophylaxis with norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage and cirrhosis should receive norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole twice daily for seven days. Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy is directed toward improving mental status levels with lactulose; protein restriction is no longer recommended. Patients with cirrhosis and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding should undergo upper endoscopy to evaluate for varices. Endoscopic banding is the standard treatment, but sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors (e.g., octreotide) also may be used. Prophylaxis with propranolol is recommended in patients with cirrhosis once varices have been identified. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt has been effective in reducing portal hypertension and improving symptoms of hepatorenal syndrome, and can reduce gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. When medical therapy for treatment of cirrhosis has failed, liver transplantation should be considered. Survival rates in transplant recipients have improved as a result of advances in immunosuppression and proper risk stratification using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scoring systems.

### Clinical outcomes and care for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a national cohort study [^116zJJij]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) leads to high rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatorenal syndrome, and mortality. Population-based studies on contemporary SBP epidemiology are needed to inform care. In a large, national cohort of patients diagnosed with SBP and confirmed by ascitic fluid criteria, we characterized ascitic fluid characteristics, in-hospital and 12-month mortality, AKI, and recurrent SBP.

Approach and Results

We investigated how individual and bundled quality measures for SBP associated with outcomes after multi-level adjustment for health-system, patient clinical factors, and quality measures. Individual and bundled quality metrics were inpatient antibiotics within 48 hours, i.v. albumin, repeat paracentesis within 48 hours, recognition of SBP, and prophylactic antibiotics upon discharge. Among 4330 patients with newly diagnosed SBP, in-hospital mortality was 15.5%, and 12-month mortality was 56.6%. The incidence of stage 1 AKI was 26.6%, 15.7% for stage 2, and 22.8% for stage 3. The cumulative incidence of recurrent SBP was 10.3%. Guideline-recommended albumin was the only individual metric associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59–0.91). Receipt of a higher number of metrics from the SBP bundle was associated with progressively lower 12-month post-discharge mortality: patients who received 3, 4, and 5 SBP bundle components had 20%, 38%, and 56% lower hazard of mortality, respectively, relative to those receiving 2 or fewer (all p < 0.001). The SBP bundle was associated with a lower incidence of stage 3 versus stage 0–2 AKI (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51–0.86).

Conclusions

Prospective implementation of evidence-based SBP bundles may improve care outcomes and mortality in SBP.

### Usefulness of ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels in patients with liver cirrhosis [^113Km2rS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Correlation of ascitic fluid lactoferrin level with laboratory parameters

The correlations between ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels with laboratory parameters are summarized in Table 2. In all patients, ascitic fluid lactoferrin levels correlated with ascitic WBC count (r = 0.529, p < 0.001), ascitic PMN count (r = 0.633, p < 0.001), serum PMN level (r = 0.200, p = 0.044), serum platelet count (r = −0.253, p = 0.018), serum CRP level (r = 0.355, p < 0.001), serum PT-INR (r = 0.232, p = 0.019), and the Child-Pugh score (r = 0.248, p = 0.012). In ascitic fluid or blood cultures, 13 of the 24 SBP patients (54.2%) showed positive culture results for Escherichia coli (5, 20.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 16.7%), Streptococcus species (2, 8.3%), Candida albicans (1, 4.2%), and Clostridium Perfringens (1, 4.2%). The distribution of positive findings in patients with SBP is summarized in Table 3. In the 24 patients with SBP, there was no significant difference in ascitic fluid lactoferrin level between culture positive SBP and culture negative SBP (median 126.3 ng/ml vs. 104.0 ng/ml, p = 0.122).

### Serum and ascitic fluid bacterial DNA: a new independent prognostic factor in noninfected patients with cirrhosis [^116HLnLS]. Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We tested the hypothesis that the presence of bacterial DNA (bactDNA) in ascitic fluid and serum is associated with decreased survival in patients with cirrhosis. In a prospective, multicenter study, we analyzed the clinical evolution of 156 patients with cirrhosis and ascites (first or recurrence) with lower than 250 polymorphonuclear cells (PMN)/muL, negative ascites bacteriological culture, and absence of other bacterial infections being admitted for evaluation of large-volume paracentesis, according to the presence of bactDNA at admission. Survival, causes of death, and successive hospital admissions were determined during a 12-month follow-up period. BactDNA was detected in 48 patients. The most prevalent identified bactDNA corresponded to Escherichia coli (n = 32/48 patients, 66.6%). Patients were followed for 12 months after inclusion and in this period 34 patients died: 16 of 108 (15%) bactDNA negative versus 18 of 48 (38%) bactDNA positive (P = 0.003). The most frequent cause of death was acute-on-chronic liver failure in both groups (7/16 and 9/18 in patients without or with bactDNA, respectively), although more prevalent in the first month of follow-up in patients with presence of bactDNA (0 versus 4/7). When considering patients with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score less than 15, mortality was significantly higher in those with presence of bactDNA. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis developed similarly in patients with or without bactDNA at admission.

Conclusion

The presence of bactDNA in a patient with cirrhosis during an ascitic episode is an indicator of poor prognosis. This fact may be related to the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure at short term and does not predict the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of a rapid urine-screening test (multistix8SG) in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^111H42cu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid urine-screening test (Multistix8SG) for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

Seventy-two consecutive patients (44 males, 28 females; mean age 61.6 years) with cirrhosis and ascites were included in the study. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed on hospital admission in all patients and 2 days after antibiotic treatment in the case of SBP (polymorphonuclear [PMN] count over 250/mm in ascitic fluid). Each fresh sample of ascitic fluid was also tested using the Multistix8SG urine test, and the results were scored as negative, trace or positive.

Results

Nine of the 72 patients had SBP and the Multistix8SG urine test was positive. After 48 h of antibiotic therapy, the PMN count of three of these nine patients was still above 250/mm and the Multistix8SG test remained positive. In three other patients with SBP, the PMN count dropped below 250/mm and the Multistix8SG test result had become negative. Two of the nine SBP patients died before 48 h, and paracentesis was not performed in the ninth case. In the other 63 patients, the PMN count in ascitic fluid was below 250/mm; the Multistix8SG test revealed 17 trace results and 46 negative results. At the threshold of 250 PMN/mm in ascitic fluid, this test had a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%.

Conclusion

A positive Multistix8SG urine test result in ascitic fluid appears to be an indication for antibiotic treatment.

### As a causative agent of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^112tBM2n]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of liver cirrhosis and abdominal ascites, usually caused by organisms from the Enterobacteriaceae family. A woman in her 40s with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis presented to the hospital with dyspnoea, abdominal distention and diffuse abdominal pain. She was found to have sepsis and abdominal ascites, with elevated ascitic fluid neutrophil counts consistent with SBP. Culture of ascitic fluid revealed Salmonella typhimurium Further investigation revealed that the patient shared her home with a pet bearded dragon, a reptile known to carry Salmonella spp. She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral ciprofloxacin for a total of 14 days. S. typhimurium, likely transmitted to the patient from the pet reptile, is a rare pathogen in SBP and highlights the importance of environmental exposures in the management of this condition.

### Sensitivity of a bedside reagent strip for the detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in ED patients with ascites [^113YqHwA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the sensitivity of a highly sensitive bedside leukocyte esterase reagent strip (RS) for detection of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in emergency department (ED) ascites patients undergoing paracentesis.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of ED ascites patients undergoing paracentesis at two academic facilities. Two practitioners, blinded to each other's results, did a bedside RS analysis of the peritoneal fluid in each patient and documented the RS reading at 3-min according to manufacturer-specified colorimetric strip reading as either "negative", "trace", "small", or "large". The primary outcome measure was sensitivity of the RS strip for SBP (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³) at the "trace" threshold (positive equals trace or greater).

Results

There were 330 cases enrolled, with 635 fluid analyses performed. Of these, 40 fluid samples had SBP (6%). Bedside RS had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI 82%-99%), 48% (95% CI 44%-52%), 11% (95% CI 10%-11%), and 99% (95% CI 97%-99%) respectively at the "trace" threshold for the detection of SBP.

Conclusion

Bedside use of the RS in ED ascites patients demonstrated high sensitivity for SBP. Given the wide confidence intervals, we cannot currently recommend it as a stand-alone test. We recommend further study with a larger number of SBP patients, potentially combining a negative RS result with low clinical suspicion to effectively rule out SBP without formal laboratory analysis.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116xctRG]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for ascites, more specifically with respect to diagnostic paracentesis, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to use ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count as the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP. Consider measuring ascitic neutrophil count either by manual microscopy or using flow cytometry-based automated methods for counting and differentiating cells.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^116sj21P]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Diagnostic paracentesis should be carried out without a delay to rule out SBP in all cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm³ count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate, Recommendation: strong)
Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong, Recommendation: strong)
Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)

### Diagnostic model for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a multicenter cohort study [^1126wk4a]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a potentially life-threatening complication of cirrhotic ascites. Early diagnosis and treatment of SBP are essential to improve the survival rates and prognosis of patients. We aimed to identify the predictors of SBP to establish a new noninvasive early diagnostic tool.

Methods

We screened 1618 patients who underwent paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites between January 2017 and December 2018 in three hospitals. We evaluated the symptomatic, clinical, and laboratory parameters to identify the predictors of SBP. The primary diagnostic model was displayed as a nomogram.

Results

The model included abdominal pain, diarrhea, white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score. The model's diagnostic performance was good, with an AUC of 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.81–0.87] in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, the diagnostic ability was also good, with AUCs of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83–0.91) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94) for inner and outer validation queues, respectively. Moreover, the decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram model. In addition, we developed a Microsoft Excel calculation model to allow convenient adoption of the model in clinical practice.

Conclusion

We developed good performing diagnostic models for SBP.

### Elevated C-reactive protein and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in children with chronic liver disease and ascites [^111HjSkR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to compare laboratory indices of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and noninfected ascites in children with chronic liver disease and to determine the infectious agents involved in SBP.

Methods

The medical records of 90 children with chronic liver disease and ascites studied between January 2005 and August 2011 were reviewed for laboratory data of diagnostic significance in SBP. Standard laboratory tests included blood cell count, coagulation indices, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum sodium concentration, serum albumin, and serum cultures. Ascitic fluid obtained from 152 paracentesis procedures was assayed for cytology, Gram stains, neutrophil counts, and bacteriological cultures.

Results

The SBP group manifested significantly lower albumin levels and elevated CRP levels, prothrombin times, international normalized ratios, and leukocyte number (P < 0.05 in each case). CRP was shown to be an independent variable in the prediction of SBP. Values of serum creatinine, sodium concentration, urea, total bilirubin and differential leukocyte shift were comparable in SBP and noninfected ascites. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most prevalent infectious agent in the ascitic fluid (44%).

Conclusions

CRP may be useful in early detection and monitoring of SBP in children with liver disease.
