## Question

When are thyroglobulin and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies useful

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) are useful and how to interpret them across surveillance, assay selection, and special contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biology of Tg and the interference caused by TgAb. Then, I should define best practices for DTC surveillance in TgAb-negative vs TgAb-positive patients. Next, I need to review assay methodologies, interference pitfalls, and reflex strategies. After that, I will examine how to interpret TgAb trends and discuss variability between assays. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy and pregnancy influences on thyroid autoimmunity, and finish with a practical, verification-oriented approach to clinical decision-making [^114rf9rg] [^114JFjKy].

> Let me first confirm the biological premise: Tg is a large glycoprotein synthesized only by thyroid follicular cells and co-secreted with thyroid hormones; after total thyroidectomy (with or without ablation), Tg should be very low or undetectable, which is why it serves as a tissue-specific tumor marker for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) surveillance, but wait, I need to ensure we account for TgAb because they can mask Tg in immunometric assays and yield falsely low or undetectable results, especially when true Tg is low and TgAb are high [^114rf9rg] [^114JFjKy] [^116sZpGW].

> Hold on, I should verify the core operational rule before proceeding: every single specimen sent for Tg must be accompanied by TgAb testing, because even low-level TgAb can interfere and TgAb status can change over time, making it unsafe to interpret Tg without knowing antibody status; method and laboratory consistency are also crucial for serial monitoring to be meaningful [^114mUkmC] [^112hN2cd].

> Now, I will examine Tg as the principal tumor marker in TgAb-negative patients: ultrasensitive immunometric assays provide high analytical sensitivity, and longitudinal Tg trends (including Tg velocity) are often more informative than single values for detecting residual or recurrent disease; however, I need to check whether TSH-stimulated Tg is still needed — modern ultrasensitive methods have reduced reliance on stimulation, but clinical context and risk stratification should guide its use rather than assuming it is obsolete outright [^112JCWcW] [^1151ERQz].

> Wait, I initially implied stimulated Tg has been largely replaced; let me correct that to be precise: ultrasensitive Tg has decreased — but not eliminated — the need for TSH stimulation in many low- and intermediate-risk contexts, and clinicians should individualize stimulation decisions based on dynamic risk stratification and assay performance characteristics rather than abandoning it categorically [^112JCWcW].

> Next, I should review what to do when TgAb are present: I will now examine TgAb behavior as a surrogate marker when Tg is unreliable; rising or persistently elevated TgAb after treatment tends to correlate with persistent or recurrent disease, whereas declining TgAb — especially to negativity — tracks with remission; notably, in a cohort with undetectable Tg, TgAb positivity carried higher recurrence risk and TgAb trend strata showed graded recurrence rates from 0% (> 50% decrease) to 37% (increasing), which operationalizes TgAb kinetics for follow-up decisions [^113FhPXL] [^111sc1r3] [^113f8vcn].

> But wait, what if TgAb positivity before surgery implies a more aggressive tumor biology — does that independently predict outcomes? Let me consider the evidence carefully: preoperative TgAb positivity is associated with adverse features such as lymphatic invasion and nodal metastases, but on multivariable analyses it often does not independently predict persistence or recurrence over time; this suggests its main utility is to alert the team that postoperative surveillance must incorporate TgAb trend interpretation and method consistency rather than relying on absolute Tg alone [^112izesM] [^112Av16b].

> Next, I should review assay methodology and interference patterns: immunometric Tg assays (IMA) are automated and sensitive but are the most vulnerable to TgAb interference, typically underestimating Tg and sometimes rendering it undetectable; RIA is less prone to TgAb-driven underestimation but can show false-high bias at low Tg; mass spectrometry (Tg-MS) resists TgAb interference and can detect Tg in a meaningful fraction of TgAb-positive cases missed by IMA, though between-method differences and tumor Tg heterogeneity still matter for interpretation [^112JCWcW] [^114rf9rg] [^116sZpGW].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical sequencing strategy for cost and accuracy: a reflex pathway that screens all samples with TgAb, then runs Tg by routine IMA if TgAb is negative, and reflexes TgAb-positive samples to Tg-MS (or RIA if MS is not available) balances analytic fidelity with resource use; this approach has been shown to save costs at scale while preserving diagnostic accuracy where interference is most consequential [^113SFq1Q] [^114mUkmC].

> I need to ensure we address method continuity and inter-assay variability: Tg and TgAb assays vary substantially across platforms; switching assays mid-course can reclassify TgAb status and disrupt longitudinal interpretation; therefore, I should confirm that serial measurements use the same method in the same lab whenever possible, and if a change is unavoidable, I should double-check trends with clinical and imaging correlation to avoid misclassification [^111KYdAu] [^117AbqsX].

> Let me think about non-TgAb interferences and artifacts that can mislead decisions: heterophile antibodies can cause spurious Tg elevation on IMA, so if Tg behaves paradoxically (for example, detectable but nonresponsive to TSH stimulation, or unexpectedly higher when suppressed), I should verify with MS and consider heterophile blocking studies; additionally, passive transfer of exogenous antibodies via IVIG can distort TgAb measurement and confound surveillance temporarily, requiring cautious interpretation and, if needed, delayed reassessment [^1123qNCp] [^116YVu9G].

> Next, I should review special contexts where TgAb status adds predictive value outside classic DTC surveillance: in patients starting PD-1 inhibitors, baseline TgAb and/or TPOAb positivity markedly increases the risk of thyroid immune-related adverse events, allowing preemptive monitoring strategies; in pregnancy, both TPOAb and TgAb are associated with shifts in thyroid function and a higher likelihood of dysfunction, though TPOAb remains the primary marker emphasized in guidelines, so I need to ensure timing and interpretation account for gestational changes and postpartum dynamics [^113Nm5ys] [^111Uorua].

> I will now synthesize a pragmatic, verification-oriented approach: first, always order Tg and TgAb together and document the exact assay used; if TgAb is negative, follow Tg with the same IMA over time and act on significant upward trends, reserving stimulation for selected scenarios; if TgAb is positive, rely on serial TgAb trends as a surrogate while reflexing Tg to Tg-MS (or RIA) to capture otherwise undetected Tg, and interpret kinetics across the same methods; at any sign of analytic discordance, I should verify with alternative methodology and imaging rather than jumping to conclusions [^114mUkmC] [^112hN2cd] [^112JCWcW].

> Finally, I should confirm key guardrails: never interpret Tg without contemporaneous TgAb; maintain assay continuity; use reflex MS strategically; consider heterophile and IVIG-related interferences when results defy physiology; and remember that declining TgAb — especially to negativity — supports remission, whereas rising or persistently elevated TgAb warrants closer imaging surveillance and risk re-stratification, keeping in mind that my earlier statement about stimulated Tg being "replaced" needed correction to "used selectively" rather than "abandoned" [^113FhPXL] [^113f8vcn] [^1123qNCp].

Thyroglobulin (Tg) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) are most useful in the **postoperative surveillance of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)** [^114mUkmC], where Tg is the primary tumor marker [^116sZpGW] and TgAb must be measured with every Tg [^112hN2cd] to detect interference [^114JFjKy]. TgAb can cause falsely low or undetectable Tg [^114JFjKy], so **TgAb trends serve as a surrogate marker** [^113FhPXL], with rising TgAb suggesting recurrence [^111sc1r3], while falling or negative TgAb supports remission [^113f8vcn]. TgAb are also measured to confirm autoimmune thyroiditis, especially when anti-TPO is negative or in atypical cases [^111Tk7da] [^112xsnU2]. In DTC follow-up, always interpret Tg and TgAb together, use the same assays over time [^111KYdAu] [^114mUkmC], and consider mass spectrometry or RIA when TgAb are present [^112JCWcW] [^112hN2cd].

## Clinical utility of thyroglobulin (Tg)

### Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) surveillance

- **Primary tumor marker**: Tg is the main biochemical marker for detecting residual, recurrent, or metastatic DTC [^114mUkmC] after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation [^116sZpGW].

- **Postoperative monitoring**: Serial Tg measurements track disease status and treatment response [^114mUkmC]; rising Tg indicates recurrence or persistence [^112JCWcW], while undetectable Tg suggests remission.

- **Assay selection**: Immunometric assays (IMA) are standard but prone to TgAb interference [^116sZpGW]; mass spectrometry (MS) or radioimmunoassay (RIA) are alternatives when TgAb are present [^112JCWcW] [^112hN2cd].

---

## Clinical utility of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb)

### Interference with Tg measurement

Assay interference: TgAb can cause **falsely low or undetectable Tg**, complicating DTC surveillance [^114JFjKy] [^112hN2cd]. Therefore, **mandatory concomitant testing** is required — TgAb should always be measured with Tg to identify interference and enable accurate interpretation [^114mUkmC] [^116sZpGW].

---

### Surrogate marker for DTC recurrence

As a surrogate marker for DTC recurrence, **TgAb trends** are informative [^113FhPXL]: rising TgAb suggests recurrence or persistence [^111sc1r3], whereas falling or negative TgAb supports remission [^113f8vcn]. Their **prognostic value** is reflected in the association of persistent or increasing TgAb with higher recurrence risk and worse outcomes [^114JFjKy].

---

### Diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease

For the diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease, **Hashimoto's thyroiditis** is supported by TgAb, which help confirm autoimmune thyroiditis — especially when anti-TPO is negative or in atypical cases [^111Tk7da] — whereas in **Graves' disease**, TgAb may be present but are less specific than TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) for diagnosis [^115HUrWg] [^111WGmTK].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Tg and TgAb are useful

| **Clinical scenario** | **Tg utility** | **TgAb utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Differentiated thyroid cancer surveillance [^114mUkmC] | Primary tumor marker for recurrence detection | Identify interference <br/> Surrogate marker for recurrence |
| Autoimmune thyroid disease diagnosis | Limited utility | Confirm autoimmune thyroiditis <br/> Especially when anti-TPO is negative [^111Tk7da] |
| Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of suspicious lymph nodes | Detect metastatic thyroid tissue in FNA washouts | Identify interference with FNA-Tg measurements |
| Pregnancy and postpartum thyroiditis [^113ysmUG] | Limited utility | Monitor autoimmune thyroiditis progression or recurrence |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Tg and TgAb assays vary [^111KYdAu]; use the same assays for serial monitoring [^114mUkmC] [^117AbqsX].

- **False positives/negatives**: TgAb can cause false Tg results; interpret with clinical and imaging data [^114JFjKy].

- **Alternative methods**: Use MS or RIA [^112JCWcW] when TgAb interfere with IMA Tg measurements [^112hN2cd] [^116sZpGW].

---

## Summary of key points

- **Tg is the primary tumor marker** for DTC surveillance [^116sZpGW].

- **TgAb must be measured with Tg** to detect interference [^114mUkmC].

- **TgAb trends are a surrogate marker** for recurrence in TgAb-positive patients [^113FhPXL].

- **TgAb help confirm autoimmune thyroiditis**, especially when anti-TPO is negative [^111Tk7da].

- **Use consistent assays** and consider MS or RIA when TgAb are present [^112JCWcW].

### Clinical review: Clinical utility of thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) measurements for patients with differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) [^114JFjKy]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) are primarily measured in serum in conjunction with thyroglobulin (Tg), the primary tumor marker used to monitor patients with differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC). Every specimen requires TgAb testing to ensure that the Tg measurement is not compromised by TgAb interference. When present, TgAb concentrations can be monitored as a surrogate tumor marker.

- **Objectives**: The aims of the study were: 1) To review published reports concerning the associations between DTC, thyroid autoimmunity (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), and the presence of TgAb; and 2) to evaluate the methodological factors that influence TgAb interference with serum Tg testing.

- **Data sources**: PubMed was used to identify studies published over the last 55 years that focused on DTC relationships with thyroid autoimmunity and the presence of thyroid autoantibodies.

- **Results**: Many studies have reported significant associations between papillary thyroid cancer and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which may have favorable prognostic significance. TgAb is detected in approximately 20% of DTC patients and may be a more specific thyroid tumor marker than thyroid peroxidase antibodies. TgAb interferes with Tg immunometric assay (IMA) measurements, causing falsely low or undetectable Tg values, especially when TgAb concentrations are high, and serum Tg concentrations (measured by RIA) are low. TgAb concentrations respond to changes in Tg-secreting thyroid tissue, indicating that the TgAb trend can be used as a more reliable surrogate DTC tumor marker than Tg IMA.

### Paediatric differentiated thyroid carcinoma: A UK national clinical practice consensus guideline [^114mUkmC]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

- **Measure thyroglobulin antibody in conjunction with serum thyroglobulin**: Even very low thyroglobulin antibody concentrations can interfere with assay results, and thyroglobulin antibodies are found in up to 25% of adult patients. Each specimen sent for thyroglobulin measurement requires concomitant thyroglobulin antibody testing because thyroglobulin antibody status can change over time. As variability exists between different thyroglobulin assays, there is a need to use the same assay for serial measurements. Thyroglobulin antibody titres can also correlate with disease burden.

- **Use the baseline risk grouping and subsequent dynamic risk stratification to determine the frequency and duration of follow-up**:
	- There is a lack of high-level paediatric evidence on which to make clear-cut and highly detailed follow-up recommendations, but it is reasonable and pragmatic to base the long-term follow-up schedule of CYP evidence from adults with DTC. Prognostic stratification will be based on both the baseline risk group and the results of dynamic risk assessment after treatment (see Table 4). CYP will be followed up until transition to adult services, and for low-risk adult patients, a decision can be taken about discharge to primary care. Lifelong follow-up is advised in high-risk groups, given that recurrence of DTC can occur 40 years after the initial disease. The suggested follow-up schedule is given in Table 4.

### Change of serum antithyroglobulin antibody levels is useful for prediction of clinical recurrence in thyroglobulin-negative patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^113FhPXL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of the antithyroglobulin autoantibody (TgAb) value at 6–12 months after remnant ablation in predicting recurrence in differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients who had undetectable thyroglobulin (Tg) values. The change in TgAb concentration measured between the time of remnant ablation (TgAb1) and 6–12 months thereafter (TgAb2) was also evaluated as a possible prognostic indicator.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent total thyroidectomy followed by \(^{131}\)I remnant ablation between 1995 and 2003 at the Asan Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) were enrolled. Of these, 824 patients with undetectable Tg at 6–12 months after remnant ablation during thyroid hormone withdrawal were the subjects of this study.

- **Results**: TgAb2 was positive in 56 patients. Ten of 56 patients (18%) with positive TgAb2 had recurrence, whereas only 10 of 768 patients (1%) with negative TgAb2 had recurrence during 73.6 months of follow-up (P < 0.001). The change between TgAb1 and TgAb2 levels was evaluated in patients with positive TgAb2. TgAb concentration decreased by more than 50% in 21 patients (group 1) and by less than 50% in 16 patients (group 2), and it increased in 19 patients (group 3). The recurrence rates in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 0%, 19%, and 37%, respectively (P = 0.016).

- **Conclusions**: Serum TgAb levels measured at 6–12 months after remnant ablation could predict recurrence in patients with undetectable Tg values. In patients with undetectable Tg and positive TgAb values, a change in TgAb levels serves as a valuable prognostic indicator.

### Thyroglobulin (Tg) testing revisited: Tg assays, TgAb assays, and correlation of results with clinical outcomes [^112JCWcW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of thyroglobulin (Tg) by mass spectrometry (Tg-MS) is emerging as a tool for accurate Tg quantification in patients with anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAbs).

- **Objective**: The objective of the study was to perform analytical and clinical evaluations of two Tg-MS assays in comparison with immunometric Tg assays (Tg-IAs) and Tg RIAs (Tg-RIAs) in a cohort of thyroid cancer patients.

- **Methods**: A total of 589 samples from 495 patients, 243 TgAb- and 252 TgAb+, were tested by Beckman, Roche, Siemens-Immulite, and Thermo-Brahms Tg and TgAb assays, two Tg-RIAs, and two Tg-MS assays.

- **Results**: The frequency of TgAb+ was 58%, 41%, 27%, and 39% for Roche, Beckman, Siemens-Immulite, and Thermo-Brahms, respectively. In TgAb- samples, clinical sensitivities and specificities of 100% and 74%-100%, respectively, were observed across all assays. In TgAb+ samples, all Tg-IAs demonstrated assay-dependent Tg underestimation, ranging from 41% to 86%. In TgAb+ samples, the use of a common cutoff (0.5 ng/mL) for the Tg-MS, three Tg-IAs, and the USC-RIA improved the sensitivity for the Tg-MSs and Tg-RIAs when compared with the Tg-IAs. In up to 20% of TgAb+ cases, Tg-IAs failed to detect Tg that was detectable by Tg-MS. In Tg-RIAs, false-high biases were observed in TgAb+ samples containing low Tg concentrations.

- **Conclusions**: Tg-IAs remain the method of choice for Tg quantitation in TgAb- patients. In TgAb+ patients with undetectable Tg by immunometric assay, the Tg-MS will detect Tg in up to 20% additional cases. The Tg-RIA will detect Tg in approximately 35% of cases, but a significant proportion of cases were undetected.

### Comparison of some different methods for analysis of thyroid autoantibodies: Importance of thyroglobulin autoantibodies [^111Tk7da]. Thyroid (2001). Low credibility.

Blood samples from 141 children and adolescents were used to evaluate differences between commercial kits and radioimmunoassay (RIA) methods for detecting thyroid autoantibodies. Thyroglobulin autoantibodies (Tg-Ab) were analyzed with a hemagglutination kit and a RIA; thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPO-Ab) were measured with a gel agglutination assay and a RIA. The results of the antibody tests were compared with thyroid function tests, including triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and thyrotropin (TSH), as well as with ultrasound results of the thyroid in antibody-positive patients. The correlation of antibody levels between the two methods was higher for TPO-Ab than for Tg-Ab. Moderate to high levels of TPO-Ab correlated with elevated TSH levels. Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) was found in 6 of the 141 children; the RIA-based thyroglobulin assay was the only test that identified autoantibodies in all 6 cases. In contrast, the hemagglutination kit thyroglobulin assay failed to identify 4 of the 6 AIT cases.

### Sequential changes of serum antithyroglobulin antibody levels are a good predictor of disease activity in thyroglobulin-negative patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma [^111sc1r3]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

To investigate whether elevated and sequential changes in serum antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) levels are indicators of recurrence or persistence of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in patients with undetectable thyroglobulin, we conducted a study involving 56 patients who were followed for more than 7 years. We recorded all serum TgAb levels, except those determined within one year after (131)I therapy or diagnostic scans, and evaluated the patients' disease status. All patients had undergone total thyroidectomy and remnant ablation by (131)I; they were positive for TgAb and had undetectable thyroglobulin during follow-up. The sequential changes of TgAb levels were categorized as persistently high, increasing, persistently medium, decreasing, and decreasing to negative.

Recurrence or persistence of PTC was defined as active disease, assessed by (131)I scanning, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or surgical examination. Among the 56 patients, 10 had persistent PTC and 12 experienced recurrence at more than one year after total thyroidectomy and (131)I therapy. TgAb levels were persistently high in 4 patients (3 with active PTC), increasing in 6 patients (4 with active PTC), persistently medium in 16 patients (12 with active PTC), decreasing in 5 patients (none with active PTC), and decreased to negative in 25 patients (3 with active PTC). According to the trend analysis, patients with persistently high TgAb, increasing TgAb, and persistently medium TgAb had active disease more often (p < 0.001).

### Prognostic value of preoperative anti-thyroglobulin antibody in differentiated thyroid cancer [^112izesM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2017). Low credibility.

The coexistence of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and thyroid autoimmune disease could represent a better or worse prognosis. This study investigated the prognostic importance of preoperative anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) in DTC patients.

This retrospective hospital-cohort study enrolled 1,171 consecutive DTC patients with preoperative TgAb data, who underwent total thyroidectomy between January 2006 and December 2011. Clinical parameters studied included demographics, primary tumor characteristics, radioiodine therapy, thyroid function tests, preoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) and TgAb levels, and cancer persistence or recurrence.

In the results, a total of 254 (21.7%) patients were preoperatively TgAb positive. The percentage positive for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody and lymphocytic thyroiditis was significantly higher in the TgAb-positive group. The TgAb-positive group had a significantly higher rate of lymphatic invasion and lymph node metastasis, both overall and in patients without TPOAb and lymphocytic thyroiditis (non-HT group). The mean number of total and central lymph nodes dissected and the rate of lateral lymph node dissection were significantly higher in the TgAb-positive group, both overall and in non-HT patients. In regression analysis, preoperative TgAb was an independent risk factor for lateral lymph node metastasis. Over 50.2 ± 14.5 months of follow-up, disease persistence or recurrence was not significantly different between patients with and without TgAb, both overall and in non-HT patients. Preoperative TgAb showed no significant differences in these outcomes.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: Role of TRAbs [^115HUrWg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

At the time of their first discovery in 1956, TSAbs were named 'long-acting thyroid stimulators' (LATS). Over the next two decades, the association of TSAbs with Graves' disease (GD) became stronger through consistent observation of elevated TSAbs levels among GD patients. It was also established that the TSAbs bind to the same leucine-rich domain on the A-subunit of the TSH receptor, onto which TSH binds physiologically. The downstream effects of binding of both TSH and TSAbs were also found to be similar. This included the generation of cAMP, leading to stimulation of thyroid follicular epithelium proliferation, thyroid growth, release of both thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), and suppression of TSH release from the pituitary, which was actually mediated through negative feedback suppression through T3 and T4.

The core clinical features of GD include palpitations, heat intolerance, and weight loss due to TSAbs-induced thyrotoxicosis. The diagnostic laboratory findings of GD include a typical serum picture of elevated T3 and T4 with suppressed TSH and detectable levels of TRAbs (specifically, TSAbs). The TSAbs are considered specific biomarkers for GD. In contrast, TBAbs bind to TSH receptors and block the action of TSH; these have been associated with the hypothyroidism caused by certain forms of autoimmune thyroiditis, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Finally, the neutral antibodies do not appear to affect cAMP generation despite binding to TSH receptors but may induce thyroid cell apoptosis.

### Risk of thyroid dysfunction in PD-1 blockade is stratified by the pattern of TgAb and TPOAb positivity at baseline [^113Nm5ys]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Positive antithyroglobulin (TgAb) and/or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) at baseline indicate a high risk of thyroid immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by antiprogrammed cell death-1 antibodies (anti-PD-1-Ab). However, whether the positivity patterns of both antibodies are associated with the risk of thyroid irAEs is unknown.

- **Objective**: The aim of the present study was to clarify the association of the pattern of TgAb and TPOAb positivity at baseline with the risk of thyroid irAEs induced by anti-PD-1-Ab.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 516) were evaluated for TgAb and TPOAb at baseline and prospectively for thyroid function every 6 weeks for 24 weeks after initiating anti-PD-1-Ab.

- **Results**: Fifty-one (9.9%) patients developed thyroid irAEs (thyrotoxicosis in 34, hypothyroidism without prior thyrotoxicosis in 17). Twenty-five patients subsequently developed hypothyroidism following thyrotoxicosis. The cumulative incidence of thyroid irAEs differed among four groups classified by the presence of TgAb/TPOAb at baseline as follows: Group 1: TgAb(-)/TPOAb(-), 4.6% [19/415]; Group 2: TgAb(-)/TPOAb(+), 15.8% [9/57]; Group 3: TgAb(+)/TPOAb(-), 42.1% [8/19]; Group 4: TgAb(+)/TPOAb(+), 60.0% [15/25]. There were significant differences among groups: Group 1 vs groups 2–4 (P ≤ .001) and Group 2 vs groups 3 (P = 0.008) and 4 (P < .001). Rates of thyrotoxicosis varied (Groups 1–4: 3.1%, 5.3%, 31.6%, 48.0%, respectively; P < .001) with significant differences between groups 1 vs 3 and 4, and groups 2 vs 3 and 4. The incidence of hypothyroidism was also different (Groups 1–4: 2.9%, 15.8%, 31.6%, 60.0%, respectively; P < .001) in Group 1 vs groups 2 to 4, and Group 2 vs other groups.

### Data-driven thyroglobulin cutoffs for low- and intermediate-risk thyroid cancer follow-up: ITCO real-world analysis [^1167PUFS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The Italian Thyroid Cancer Observatory (ITCO), a web-based database, was initiated in 2013 at the Thyroid Cancer Center of Sapienza University of Rome, serving as the network's coordinating center. The dataset includes prospectively collected data from more than 12,000 patients with histologically confirmed diagnoses of differentiated, poorly differentiated, anaplastic, and medullary thyroid cancer from 51 participating thyroid cancer centers.

The registered prospective study (NCT04031339) has received ethical approval from the Coordinating Center Ethics Committee (Sapienza University of Rome, ref. 3366), as well as from the individual ethics committees associated with each participating center. Cases are included in the database at the time of initial treatment by the reporting ITCO center, or when the patient begins follow-up in the reporting center within 12 months after undergoing initial treatment in a non-ITCO center, after signing the informed consent form.

We have already reported assessments of the baseline risk estimates on the first patients reaching early follow-up evaluations and analyzed the role of extrathyroidal extension and autoimmune thyroiditis. For this study, we reviewed all records available in the ITCO database and selected consecutive cases that satisfied the following criteria: (1) histological diagnosis of DTC; (2) initial treatment including total thyroidectomy (including patients who underwent completion thyroidectomy following thyroid lobectomy) with or without subsequent radioiodine treatment; (3) low or intermediate-risk classification.

### Significance of low levels of thyroglobulin autoantibodies associated with undetectable thyroglobulin after thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^112iKv4Q]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

The management of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) showing low levels of serum thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) and undetectable Tg after thyroidectomy is unsettled. This study sought to elucidate the clinical significance of low levels of TgAb and to evaluate their interference with Tg measurement in vitro.

- **Methods**: Tg and TgAb levels were correlated with the post-thyroidectomy staging of 177 consecutive DTC patients undergoing (131)I ablation after total thyroidectomy (clinical study). Tg was measured by an immunometric assay (functional sensitivity: 0.1 ng/mL), and TgAb were evaluated by six assays (functional sensitivities: 1.2–96 IU/mL; positive cutoffs: 4–150 IU/mL). The changes in Tg concentration (Tg recovery) of diluted specimens from DTC patients were also measured after incubation with 67 sera from DTC patients with undetectable Tg and low levels of TgAb (in vitro study). DTC sera containing Tg were diluted serially (from 330 to 0.1 ng/mL) and incubated with TgAb samples; Tg was then measured.

- **Results**: In the clinical study, all patients had residual thyroid tissue, and 10 had metastatic disease. Depending on the TgAb assay, median Tg values were 7.0–10.9, 0.0–5.3, and 0.0–0.0 ng/mL in patients with undetectable, borderline (between functional sensitivities and positive cutoffs), and positive TgAb, respectively (p < 0.001). An undetectable Tg value was associated with borderline levels of TgAb in five assays. Only two patients with metastatic disease had undetectable Tg; both were TgAb positive by three or more assays. Conversely…

### Multiplexed immunoassay of thyroglobulin autoantibodies in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^117LqPwm]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies (TgAb) screening is recommended in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) to validate Tg measurements. We compared a new multiplexed and two conventional TgAb immunoassays in patients with DTC and healthy controls.

- **Methods**: TgAb were measured by two conventional automated immunoassays and a multiplexed immunoassay in sera from 163 patients with DTC and 64 controls.

- **Results**: No significant differences were found between the different assays when the suggested manufacturer cutoffs were used. The positive rate of the multiplexed assay, but not of conventional assays, significantly increased when limits of detection were used as cutoff.

- **Conclusion**: Further technical evaluations are necessary to explain the very high rate of detectable TgAb values in both patients with DTC and controls by the multiplexed assay. For the moment, we suggest caution in using such methods in clinical practice.

### Measuring thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin autoantibody in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^114rf9rg]. Nature Clinical Practice Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum thyroglobulin is primarily used as a tumor marker in the postoperative management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Unfortunately, the technical quality of thyroglobulin assay methods varies and influences the clinical utility of this test. Two different methodological approaches are used to measure serum thyroglobulin: the original competitive radioimmunoassay methodology and noncompetitive immunometric assay methods.

Although the newer immunometric assays offer the technical benefits of eliminating the use of isotopes, using smaller specimen volumes, and having higher sensitivity potential, shorter turnaround times and the convenience of automation, immunometric assays also have a higher propensity for interference from both thyroglobulin autoantibodies and heterophilic antibodies if present in the specimen. It is critical that physicians understand the technical limitations inherent in thyroglobulin measurement in order to effectively use this test for the postoperative management of patients with differentiated thyroid cancers.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood, treatment or only follow-up [^111X6vAc]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

It is known that autoimmunity is a key factor that determines the major progression to hypothyroidism. In our study, almost all patients in Group 3 met this condition, and 71.4% were women, which is a distribution that already occurs in most autoimmune diseases. Our results are in agreement with Wasnieska et al, who studied the long-term evolution of a large cohort of girls with subclinical hypothyroidism and found that underlying Hashimoto thyroiditis was the main factor leading to becoming overtly hypothyroid or requiring L-T4 treatment. In fact, it has been reported that in children with Hashimoto thyroiditis, the evolution of thyroid status is frequently characterized by a spontaneous worsening over time, even in cases initially presenting with a mild biochemical picture. Lazarus et al. analyzed the results of seven observational studies and showed that elevated TgAb and TPOAb at diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of progression in some, but not all, studies.

Treatment with levothyroxine was initiated in all patients who presented with TSH levels ≥ 10μUI/mL or TSH levels between 5–10μUI/mL and positive TPOAb/TgAb (Group 3). The dilemma arises in deciding whether patients with maintained mildly elevated TSH (Group 2) should be treated with levothyroxine and what benefits it can bring against the possible consequences of subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), since good-quality studies examining the effect of treating SH in children are lacking. In our case, no patients were treated since none presented with associated symptoms or alterations that could be related to it.

### Clinical aggressiveness and long-term outcome in patients with papillary thyroid cancer and circulating anti-thyroglobulin autoantibodies [^112Av16b]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

The association between papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis is widely recognized, but less is known about the possible link between circulating anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) titers and PTC aggressiveness. To shed light on this issue, we retrospectively examined a large series of PTC patients with and without positive TgAb.

- **Methods**: Data on 220 TgAb-positive PTC patients (study cohort) were retrospectively collected in 10 hospital-based referral centers. All the patients had undergone near-total thyroidectomy with or without radioiodine remnant ablation. Tumor characteristics and long-term outcomes (follow-up range: 2.5–24.8 years) were compared with those recently reported in 1020 TgAb-negative PTC patients with similar demographic characteristics. We also assessed the impact on clinical outcome of early titer disappearance in the TgAb-positive group.

- **Results**: At baseline, the study cohort (mean age 45.9 years, range 12.5–84.1 years; 85% female) had a significantly higher prevalence of high-risk patients (6.9% vs. 3.2%, p < 0.05) and extrathyroidal tumor extension (28.2% vs. 24%; p < 0.0001) than TgAb-negative controls. Study cohort patients were also more likely than controls to have persistent disease at the 1-year visit (13.6% vs. 7.0%, p = 0.001) or recurrence during subsequent follow-up (5.8% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.0001). At the final follow-up visit, the percentage of patients with either persistent or recurrent disease in the two cohorts was significantly different (6.4% of TgAb-positive patients vs. 1.7% in the TgAb-negative group, p < 0.0001).

### Clinical impact of thyroglobulin (Tg) and Tg autoantibody method differences on the management of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas [^111KYdAu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Changes in thyroglobulin (Tg) and/or Tg antibody (TgAb) methods can disrupt the serial monitoring of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients.

- **Objective**: This study compared Tg measurements made in TgAb-negative and TgAb-positive sera using four radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ten immunometric assay (IMA) methods.

- **Design**: TgAb detection using a panel of 12 direct methods was contrasted with four Tg recovery tests. Sera from 110 normal euthyroid subjects (68 TgAb negative/42 TgAb positive) and 131 TgAb-negative DTC patients had Tg and/or TgAb analyses made by ten laboratories in four countries. Euthyroid controls were used to compare Tg and TgAb ranges, sensitivities, and TgAb interference, whereas DTC patients were used to study Tg assay specificities, hook effects, and the influence of high Tg levels on TgAb measurements.

- **Results**: Tg methods exhibited high between-method variability [47 ± 3% (± sem)], which was only marginally reduced by CRM-457 standardization (37 ± 3%). All methods had suboptimal sensitivity, with some failing to detect Tg in normal euthyroid controls. Direct TgAb measurements proved more reliable than exogenous recovery tests, yet TgAb status was concordant in only 65% of sera. Only four of 42 (9.5%) sera containing TgAb had antibodies detected by all direct methods. All IMA methods reported paradoxically undetectable Tg for many TgAb-positive euthyroid controls, suggesting TgAb interference, whereas RIA methods reported appropriate normal range values. Some sera displaying interference had TgAb detected by only a minority of methods.

### Diagnostic confusion attributable to spurious elevation of both total thyroid hormone and thyroid hormone uptake measurements in the setting of autoantibodies: case report and review of related literature [^1141qfQ5]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To review the effect of thyroid autoantibodies on thyroid function assays and to present a case in which thyroid autoantibodies resulted in spurious assay readings for both total thyroid hormone levels and thyroid hormone uptake measurements, we present a detailed case, including serial laboratory data, and review the relevant literature.

A 61-year-old man with a history of autoimmune disease presented for evaluation of abnormal results of thyroid function tests. The patient had been treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and was noted to have an elevated total thyroxine (T4) level in the setting of a low total triiodothyronine (T3) value and a mildly elevated thyrotropin concentration. He had been referred for evaluation of a presumed deiodinase deficiency that impaired conversion of T4 to T3. During treatment with levothyroxine, these test results were confirmed, and the patient was also found to have an elevated T4 uptake. These findings were initially thought to be due to an excess of transthyretin; however, more extensive testing revealed that the patient had an autoantibody to T4 that interfered with the assays for both T4 and T4 uptake.

Autoantibodies to both T3 and T4 have been described. Such antibodies are not uncommon in patients with thyroid disease. On rare occasions, these antibodies may cause spurious assay readings and obscure the diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which both the total T4 level and the T4 uptake were elevated because of the presence of autoantibodies.

### Association of thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies with thyroid function in pregnancy: An individual participant data meta-analysis [^111Uorua]. Thyroid (2022). Low credibility.

Thyroid autoimmunity is common in pregnant women and is associated with thyroid dysfunction and adverse obstetric outcomes. Most studies focus on thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) assessed by a negative-positive dichotomy and rarely take into account thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs). This study aimed to determine the association of TPOAbs and TgAbs, respectively, and interdependently, with maternal thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a meta-analysis of individual participant cross-sectional data from 20 cohorts in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Women with multiple pregnancies, pregnancies by assisted reproductive technology, a history of thyroid disease, or use of thyroid interfering medication were excluded. Associations of (log2) TPOAbs and TgAbs (with/without mutual adjustment) with cohort-specific z-scores of (log2) thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (fT4), total thyroxine (TT4), or triiodothyronine:thyroxine (T3:T4) ratio were evaluated in a linear mixed model.

- **Results**: In total, 51,138 women participated (51,094 had TPOAb data and 27,874 had TgAb data). Isolated TPOAb positivity was present in 4.1% [95% confidence interval, CI: 3.0 to 5.2], isolated TgAb positivity in 4.8% [CI: 2.9 to 6.6], and positivity for both antibodies in 4.7% [CI: 3.1 to 6.3]. Compared with antibody-negative women, TSH was higher in women with isolated TPOAb positivity (z-score increment 0.40, CI: 0.16 to 0.64) and TgAb positivity (0.21, CI: 0.10 to 0.32), but highest in those positive for both antibodies (0.54, CI: 0.

### Immunoglobulin preparations can mislead clinical decision-making in follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer [^116YVu9G]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulins are commonly used for immune substitution or as immune modulators in various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Exogenous thyroid-specific thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies present in the donor plasma may interfere with the interpretation of measurements of Tg autoantibodies (Tg-Abs) in the recipient's plasma and potentially trigger an immune response in the recipient's immune cells. The levels of antibodies causing bioassay interferences or those leading to clinically relevant changes in patient outcomes are not known. Tg is used as a biomarker in the long-term surveillance of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) following total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine ablation. However, the presence of Tg-Abs in the circulation interferes with Tg measurements. Assessment of levels of Tg-Abs is thus recommended as part of the standard follow-up of DTC, together with Tg testing.

To understand the potential mechanisms and pathophysiologic significance of interferences associated with the administration of immunoglobulin preparations and Tg measurement, we reviewed the interactions between Tg autoimmunity and immunoglobulin preparations. We illustrate diagnostic challenges and perspectives for the follow-up of patients with DTC treated with exogenous immunoglobulins.

In patients with DTC treated with immunoglobulin preparations, monitoring of thyroid cancer using Tg and Tg-Abs is challenging due to possible analytical interferences through passive transfer of exogenous antibodies.

### The detection of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies and differentiated thyroid cancer recurrence [^114KviK5]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

The prevalence and clinical significance of de novo detection of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) during the follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is unknown. We utilized the National Thyroid Cancer Treatment Cooperative Study registry from 1987 to 2012. Patients registered after 1996 (n = 3318) were analyzed. We identified 1545 subjects who had available TgAb status (TgAb cohort) between 1996 and 2012, of whom 1325 were TgAb negative at the first postoperative follow-up testing. From this initial TgAb-negative group, we excluded 513 patients: 423 patients who had less than 3 years of follow-up and/or fewer than three follow-up visits, 86 patients with persistent disease after initial treatment, and 4 patients with data entry errors.

The remaining 812 patients were included for analysis, comprising the TgAb persistently negative group (defined as TgAb negative for at least 3 consecutive follow-up visits and at least 3 years of follow-up) (n = 772) and the de novo TgAb-positive group in whom TgAbs became detectable (n = 40). We then assessed whether the de novo appearance of TgAb was associated with DTC structural recurrence by using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results: The de novo detection of TgAb occurred in 5% of DTC patients. Recurrence of DTC in the TgAb persistently negative group compared with the de novo TgAb-positive group did not differ significantly (9.6% vs. 15.0%, p = 0.23). Baseline characteristics, histology, history of radiation exposure, staging, and median duration of follow-up were similar between the two groups.

### Influence of thyroglobulin autoantibodies on thyroglobulin levels measured by different methodologies: IMA, LC-MS/MS, and RIA [^112hN2cd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

The persistent problem of TgAb interference has prompted guidelines to mandate TgAb screening before serum Tg measurement is undertaken. Some laboratories selectively reflex TgAb+ specimens to a non-IMA methodology considered more resistant to TgAb interference — usually MS or RIA. Serum TgAb levels tend to decline in response to successful treatment and rise with DTC progression. Since the reliability of Tg measurements made in the presence of TgAb is often uncertain, the TgAb trend is increasingly being used as a surrogate DTC tumor marker, provided that TgAb is measured by the same method in preferably the same laboratory. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether the presence of TgAb influences the clinical sensitivity of Tg measured by different methodologies (IMA, MS, or RIA) in patients in whom a detectable serum Tg would be expected as a result of DTC with distant metastatic disease (DMD) or hyperthyroidism (HY).

### Is there a role for unstimulated thyroglobulin velocity in predicting recurrence in papillary thyroid carcinoma patients with detectable thyroglobulin after radioiodine ablation [^1151ERQz]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Our results are yet to be validated in a separate cohort. Whether clinical outcome can be improved when treatment decision is based on TgV has not been addressed. Finally, the role of TgV in patients with subtotal thyroidectomy, in those without radioiodine ablation, and in those with metastatic disease should be investigated in further studies.

In conclusion, TgV predicts recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity, and it is a prognosticator of survival in postthyroidectomy and postablation PTC patients with detectable Tg. Determination of TgV is simple and clinically applicable, while avoiding adverse effects and patient inconvenience associated with TSH stimulation. However, further studies are necessary to validate our results, and supplementary clinical and radiological examinations remain essential in the follow-up of PTC patients.

### Prospective trial of functional thyrotropin receptor antibodies in Graves disease [^114X6XUd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, a large percentage of patients with GD either do not go into remission or relapse after stopping medical treatment with antithyroid drugs (ATD). Therefore, any test that would predict which patients would remain in remission and which patients would relapse before stopping the ATD would be useful. Sparse data regarding the clinical relevance of TSAb and/or TBAb during GD treatment are available, and the feasibility of the use of bioassays for TSAb and TBAb has not yet been proven in a clinical setting.

Therefore, there is a need for a specific biomarker for the management of GD, and evidence suggests that TSAb is a better predictor of patients' response to ATD treatment than predicate TBII assays. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and predictive value of TSAb and TBAb in the management of GD. We prospectively tested the ability of two bioassays for the measurement of functional antibodies to serve as sensitive indices of remission or relapse of GD after treatment with ATD.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: A pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^116ss6pH]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Baseline data are expressed as the number of participants (percentage) for categorical characteristics or as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range [IQR]) for continuous characteristics. In line with the protocol and first reports, the primary analysis considered all participants in the intention-to-treat population who had the 1-year follow-up visit within the protocol-specified window.

In this study, only participants with an anti-TPO status at baseline were included. Between-group comparisons on the difference between 1-year follow-up and baseline values were performed using linear mixed-effects regression models. This involved an interaction term between the treatment group and baseline anti-TPO status, with adjustment for stratification variables (sex, country, and randomization dose) and the respective baseline values. The randomization was not stratified by baseline antibody status, as measured after the trial end, and the study was used as a random effect.

Basing the effect size for the interaction (i.e. the difference between the differences between the treatment groups) on the SD of the difference between the treatment groups in both anti-TPO groups, and averaging the patient numbers within both groups, a difference in the difference of 6.9 points on the scale could be detected significantly with 80% power at a two-sided alpha of 0.05. The analysis was repeated for the per-protocol population, including all participants who pursued the trial regimen (i.e. were on treatment at the time of the analysis being conducted).

### Effect of thyroglobulin autoantibodies on the metabolic clearance of serum thyroglobulin [^115K7xio]. Thyroid (2018). Low credibility.

In order to establish whether thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) influence the metabolic clearance of thyroglobulin (Tg) in humans, serum Tg and TgAb were correlated shortly after radioiodine (131 I) treatment.

- **Methods**: Samples were collected from 30 consecutive patients undergoing 131 I activity for Graves' hyperthyroidism at the time of treatment and every 15 days thereafter, up to 90 days. Tg and TgAb were measured by immunometric assays (functional sensitivities: 0.1 ng/mL and 8 IU/mL).

- **Results**: Tg was detectable in all patients at day 0. Tg concentrations rose from a mean of 33.2 ng/mL [confidence interval (CI) 17.8–61.0 ng/mL] at day 0 to a mean of 214.6 ng/mL [CI 116.9–393.4 ng/mL] at day 30 and then steadily decreased, reaching the lowest concentration at day 90 (M = 10.9 ng/mL [CI 5.5–20.9 ng/mL]). Compared to their levels at day 0 (M = 23.6 IU/mL [CI 10.5–52.9 IU/mL]), TgAb remained stable through day 15 and then gradually increased up to a mean of 116.6 IU/mL [CI 51.9–262.2 IU/mL] at day 90. Patients were then split into two groups according to their TgAb status at day 0: undetectable (< 8 IU/mL; 9 patients) or detectable (≥ 8 IU/mL; 21 patients) TgAb. Compared to the other cohort, patients with detectable TgAb showed significantly lower Tg concentrations at day 0 (M = 20.3 ng/mL [CI 10.1–40.2 ng/mL] vs. M = 101.8 ng/mL [CI 36.6–279.8 ng/mL]), similar at day 15, lower levels at day 30 (M = 146.5 ng/mL [CI 74.3–287.8 ng/mL] vs. M = 514.8 ng/mL [CI 187.8–1407.9 ng/mL]), at day 45 (M = 87.5 ng/mL [CI 43.1–176.6 ng/mL] vs. M = 337.9 ng/mL [CI 120.1–947.0 ng/mL]), and at day 60…

### A longitudinal study of thyroid autoantibodies in pregnancy: The importance of test timing [^113ysmUG]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) are frequently measured to investigate thyroid dysfunction in pregnancy. Despite the recognized decrease of these autoantibodies during pregnancy, there is limited guidance on the optimal timing of such testing. This study assessed the optimal test timing for TPOAb and TGAb to detect Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD).

- **Design**: Prospective longitudinal study with recruitment in the first trimester.

- **Patients**: Healthy women ≤ 13 weeks' gestation from Mercy Hospital for Women, a tertiary obstetric hospital in Melbourne.

- **Measurements**: Serum levels of TPOAb, TGAb, TSH, and fT4 were measured during the first trimester (T1), second trimester (T2), third trimester (T3), and postpartum (PP) in each participant. Postpartum thyroid dysfunction (PPTD) was defined based on TSH deviation from the assay's nonpregnant reference interval. Longitudinal random-effect logistic regression was employed to investigate the association between time and positive/negative thyroid autoantibody status.

- **Results**: Samples from 140 women at T1 (12.0: 10.3–13.0; median: IQR weeks' gestation), 95 at T2 (24.3: 23.0–25.9), 79 at T3 (35.9: 34.8–36.7), and 83 at PP (12.4: 10.8–14.6 weeks postpartum) were collected. At T1, 13 (9%) and 15 (11%) women had positive TPOAb and TGAb, respectively. The odds of having a positive TPOAb were 96% lower at T2 [OR = 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02–0.8; P = 0.03)] and 97% lower at T3 [OR = 0.03 (95% CI: 0.001–0.6; P = 0.02)] than at T1. Similarly, the odds of having a positive TGAb were 99.4% lower [OR = 0.006 (95% CI: 0–0.3; P = 0.01)] at T2.

### Autoimmune thyroid disease: A risk factor for thyroid cancer [^111PRmKx]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

To examine the relationship between clinical markers of autoimmune thyroid disease and the risk of thyroid cancer in patients with thyroid nodules, a retrospective cohort analysis was conducted in a single clinical practice. Among 2,500 consecutive patients, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed on all 3,658 ultrasonography-positive thyroid nodules that were either ≥ 1.0 cm in diameter or ≥ 0.5 cm in diameter with ultrasound features suspicious for thyroid cancer. Serum concentrations of thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured before FNAB. The diagnosis of thyroid cancer was confirmed based on the pathologic analysis of thyroidectomy tissue. The associations of thyroid cancer with independent variables were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis and reported as the adjusted odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).

There were 202 patients with malignant thyroid nodules and 51 patients with microscopic unsuspected thyroid cancer distal to the nodule under investigation (found at thyroidectomy). Additionally, there were 2,247 patients with benign thyroid nodules. To evaluate the association of clinical markers for autoimmune thyroid disease with thyroid cancer, all 253 patients with thyroid cancer were included in the malignant cohort. Thyroid cancer was associated with elevated levels of TgAb (OR = 1.57; CI = 1.11 to 2.23) and age under 55 years (OR = 2.01; CI = 1.45 to 2.78). A strong trend was also observed for an association with male sex (OR = 1.45; CI = 0.99 to 2.12).

### False positives in thyroglobulin determinations due to the presence of heterophile antibodies: An underrecognized and consequential clinical problem [^1123qNCp]. Endocrine Practice (2021). High credibility.

The objective of this study is to report a case series of thyroid cancer patients in whom false positive results in immunometric assays for thyroglobulin (TgIMA) were caused by heterophilic antibody interference. This study describes the clinical scenario in which this interference should be suspected and recommends methods to demonstrate the interference.

Three patients with unexpectedly elevated thyroglobulin results (range, 1.6–75 ng/mL) were studied. In the first patient, thyroglobulin was elevated despite the presence of Tg antibody. In the second patient, suppressed thyroglobulin was higher than a recent stimulated thyroglobulin. In the third patient, thyroglobulin became detectable years after treatment and did not change after thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation. TgIMA concentration determination was compared to determination by a mass spectrometry method (TgMS). Thyroglobulin was also remeasured after preabsorption with heterophile antibody blocking reagents and after serial dilutions.

The results indicated that in all cases, thyroglobulin was undetectable by TgMS. In 2 of 3 patients, dilutions provided nonlinear thyroglobulin results. After blocking agent preabsorption, thyroglobulin dropped by 35%, 45%, and 91% in the three samples.

In conclusion, false positive thyroglobulin concentrations from heterophilic antibody interference have a significant impact on the management of thyroid cancer. This study demonstrates that TgMS assays can be used to rule out heterophilic antibody interference. This interference should be suspected when detectable thyroglobulin by TgIMA does not respond to thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^116i7NnS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the activation of the TSH receptor by stimulatory autoantibodies (TSH Receptor Antibodies, or TRAbs), leading to unregulated thyroid hormone production. Diagnosis is largely based on the typical clinical picture and laboratory thyroid panel. Establishment of elevated serum levels of TRAbs by competitive binding assay or cell-binding assay plays a unique role in the diagnosis and management of GD, especially in the differential diagnosis, therapy selection, prognostication, evaluation of thyroid function during pregnancy, peri-conceptional and neonatal thyroid workup, and in certain special situations. Inclusion of TRAbs in GD diagnostic algorithm can improve cost-effectiveness of GD management.

The best practice guidelines were developed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of TRAbs in GD management for healthcare providers in South Asia. A panel of endocrinologists with a minimum of 10 years of clinical experience in thyroid disorders reviewed existing literature and their quality. After deliberation and discussion, they developed 21 recommendations surrounding the best practices regarding the role of TRAbs in GD management.

### Thyroglobulin antibody screen prior to mass spectrometry provides measurable cost savings and optimal laboratory utilization [^113SFq1Q]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods that allow accurate quantitation of thyroglobulin (Tg) in the presence of Tg antibodies (TgAbs) have recently become available. Due to cost differences between LC-MS/MS and immunoassay, some laboratories now offer a reflex test strategy that uses LC-MS/MS only for TgAb-positive samples. The goal of this study was to examine the utilization of Tg testing strategies and cost savings.

Test ordering patterns were examined for over 150,000 orders for TgAb and Tg in our laboratory. The average list price was determined from three separate commercial laboratories offering this testing.

Data showed that 89% of orders for Tg used the reflex test option, resulting in savings of over $3 million compared with testing all samples by LC-MS/MS. Of the Tg by LC-MS/MS orders not using the reflex option, 1,663 also included a separate order for TgAb on the same patient sample, representing approximately $170,000 in potentially unnecessary costs from TgAb-negative samples.

Identifying situations to use more expensive testing methods (e.g. LC-MS/MS) only when necessary, such as for TgAb-positive patients, leads to considerable cost savings and a more economical use of valuable health care resources.

### Influence of thyroglobulin autoantibodies on thyroglobulin levels measured by different methodologies: IMA, LC-MS/MS, and RIA [^117LsSih]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measured by immunometric assay (IMA) is prone to underestimation due to Tg autoantibody (TgAb) interference, often prompting reflex Tg measurement by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (MS) or radioimmunoassay (RIA).

IMA, MS, and RIA methodologies were used to measure serum Tg in TgAb-negative (TgAb−) and TgAb-positive (TgAb+) patients with either distant metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) or hyperthyroidism (HY) — patients in whom a detectable serum Tg would be expected.

When TgAb was absent, all methodologies detected Tg in the sera of all DTC and HY patients and reported appropriate Tg trends and treatment responses for DTC patients with progressive distant metastatic disease, albeit with high between-method variability (> 30% coefficient of variability). When TgAb was present, all methodologies reported lower serum Tg levels for both DTC and HY groups compared to their respective TgAb− group. No Tg was detected by IMA or MS in approximately 50% of TgAb+ DTC patients (6% had no Tg detected by RIA). Surprisingly, 5% of TgAb+ HY patients also had no Tg detected by IMA or MS. The inverse log TgAb/log Tg correlations seen for the TgAb+ HY patient group with all methods suggested the presence of a TgAb-associated serum Tg-lowering effect.

- **Conclusion**: (i) Between-method Tg variability necessitates method continuity when monitoring the Tg trends of TgAb− DTC patients. (ii) The presence and concentration of TgAb appeared to have a lowering effect on serum Tg measured by all methodologies (IMA, MS, and RIA).

### Point-of-care assays for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and to thyroglobulin [^112xsnU2]. Thyroid (2005). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) assays for autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and to thyroglobulin (TgAb) are described. Both assays are based on the ability of autoantibodies in test samples (whole blood, plasma, or sera) to inhibit the binding of monoclonal antibodies to TPO or Tg. The assays require no special equipment and provide results in 10 minutes. Analysis of samples from healthy blood donors (n = 80), patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (n = 97), and non-thyroid autoimmune diseases (n = 20) showed that results with the POC tests compared well to those obtained by agglutination assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The reference immunoprecipitation assays (IPA), based on 125I-labeled TPO or Tg, were more sensitive than the POC tests, particularly in the case of TgAb measurements. However, no samples were found positive by the POC test and negative by IPA, emphasizing the high specificity of the POC assays. Our results suggest that POC testing for TPOAb and TgAb with assays such as those we describe could be useful in certain situations, including the prediction of postpartum thyroiditis and the development of interferon-alpha-related thyroid disease.

### Clinical consequences of a change in anti-thyroglobulin antibody assays during the follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^117AbqsX]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Thyroglobulin (Tg) quantitation by immunometric assays is compromised by anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), potentially resulting in falsely low Tg concentrations. TgAb screening is recommended when measuring Tg, but TgAb immunoassays do not detect all possible TgAbs in circulation. We assessed the impact of a change in TgAb assay on the apparent disease status of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC).

Patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, for follow-up of DTC, who had been tested using two different TgAb assays (Beckman Access and Roche Elecsys) were identified. Electronic medical records were reviewed to evaluate any impact the change in TgAb assay had on clinical disease status assessment and follow-up.

A total of 1,457 patients were tested using both assays. A change in TgAb status was found in 124 (8.5%) patients; a total of 117 patients who were TgAb-negative on the Beckman assay became TgAb-positive with the Roche assay. Additional testing was performed in 5 of these patients. Seven patients previously considered TgAb-positive were now TgAb-negative. In all 7 cases, physicians documented that they considered these patients now to be truly TgAb-negative and free of disease.

Discrepancies in TgAb status are seen when using different TgAb assays. Relying on Tg and TgAb measurements to determine disease status may lead to underestimation of residual cancer. A multimodal (clinical, biochemical, and radiologic) approach to follow up on patients with DTC should be continued, pending further development.

### French endocrine society guidance on endocrine side effects of immunotherapy [^113eXp1H]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

- **Treatment and follow-up of thyroid dysfunction**: Thyrotoxicosis is most often transitory, and its treatment depends on clinical severity and etiological diagnosis. Treatment must be decided upon in agreement between the treating endocrinologist and oncologist or specialist. Corticosteroid therapy should be considered only in clinically severe cases of thyrotoxicosis.

	- Hypothyroidism most often appears as a second phase after thyrotoxicosis induced by silent inflammatory thyroiditis. The decision to treat should take into account the patient's general state, the presence of comorbidities — especially cardiac comorbidity — as well as the clinical and biochemical severity of the hypothyroidism. The evolution of hypothyroidism after withdrawal of ICPI is not well known. Thyroid hormones are usually necessary on a long-term basis in patients with hypothyroidism following a transitory thyrotoxicosis, but follow-up is not consensual.

	- **R4.3a**: The treatment strategy for thyroid abnormalities in the course of ICPI for cancer should be agreed upon by the treating endocrinologist and the clinician prescribing ICPI.

	- **R4.3b**: In cases of asymptomatic thyrotoxicosis, clinical and hormonal monitoring can be proposed. In the case of symptomatic thyrotoxicosis, we recommend treatment with beta-blockers in the absence of contraindications.

	- **R4.3c**: The treatment of ICPI-induced hypothyroidism is based on levothyroxine. This is justified in the case of TSH concentrations superior to 10 mIU/L and should be discussed with TSH between 5 and 10 mIU/L (found on two consecutive assays).

### Epitope recognition patterns of thyroglobulin antibody in sera from patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis on different thyroid functional status [^115DdY2F]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) is a diagnostic serological marker of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). The pathogenesis of HT progression from euthyroidism to hypothyroidism remains unclear. Epitope recognition patterns of TgAb differ among individuals who are euthyroid and those with clinical disease. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of thyroglobulin (Tg) epitope specificities in HT progression.

Sera from 107 patients with newly diagnosed HT were collected and divided into three groups: patients with hypothyroidism (H, n = 39), subclinical hypothyroidism (sH, n = 31), and euthyroidism (Eu, n = 37). A panel of Tg murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb: PB2, 5E6, 1D4, 5F9, Tg6) and a hircine polyclonal antibody (pAb: N15) were used as probe antibodies to define the antigenic determinants recognized by HT sera via competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

Eight out of 39 sera samples in the H group and seven out of 31 in the sH group inhibited PB2 binding, whereas none did in the Eu group. The ratio of sera samples inhibiting PB2 binding in the Eu group was significantly lower than in the H (P = 0.011) and sH groups (P = 0.008). For N15, five of 39 sera samples in the H group, six of 31 in the sH group, and 15 of 37 in the Eu group inhibited its binding. The ratio of sera samples inhibiting N15 binding in the Eu group was significantly higher than in the H group (P = 0.013).

Our study demonstrated that HT patients with different thyroid functional statuses exhibited distinct Tg epitope recognition patterns. These epitope patterns of TgAb might serve as a predictive marker for HT progression.

### TSH receptor antibodies: Relevance & utility [^1161R6p8]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Antibodies (Abs) to the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor (TSH-R) play an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD). We define the complex terminology that has arisen to describe TSH-R-Abs, review the mechanisms of action of the various types of TSH-R-Abs, and discuss significant advances that have been made in the development of clinically useful TSH-R-Ab assays.

- **Methods**: Literature review and discussion.

- **Results**: TSH-R-Abs may mimic or block the action of TSH or be functionally neutral. Stimulating TSH-R-Abs are specific biomarkers for Graves disease (GD) and responsible for many of its clinical manifestations. TSH-R-Abs may also be found in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis, in whom they may contribute to the hypothyroidism of the disease. Measurement of TSH-R-Abs in general, and functional Abs in particular, is recommended for the rapid diagnosis of GD, differential diagnosis, and management of patients with AITD, especially during pregnancy, and in AITD patients with extrathyroidal manifestations such as orbitopathy.

Measurement of TSH-R-Abs can be done with either immunoassays that detect the specific binding of Abs to the TSH-R or cell-based bioassays that also provide information on their functional activity and potency. The application of molecular cloning techniques has led to significant advances in methodology that have enabled the development of clinically useful bioassays. When ordering TSH-R-Ab, clinicians should be aware of the different tests available and how to interpret results based on which assay is performed.

### Thyroglobulin antibodies could be a potential predictive marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma [^111Np5JZ]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is associated with an increased risk of developing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and cancer remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether preoperative TgAb could be a potential predictor of PTC in patients with thyroid nodules and to assess whether there is an association of preoperative TgAb with lymph node metastases.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, nonrandomized study included 854 patients who underwent standard total thyroidectomy. Benign thyroid nodules were diagnosed in 447 patients, and 407 presented with malignant nodules. The examined parameters included the clinical characteristics, preoperative TSH and TgAb levels, and the histopathological characteristics of the tumor.

- **Results**: Tumor size > 10 mm (p = 0.01), the presence of PTC (p < 0.001), and elevated TgAb levels > 3.4 μU/ml (p = 0.038) were independent risk factors for PTC based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis.

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that TgAb positivity was an independent risk factor for PTC. A positive correlation between TgAb and PTC in patients with indeterminate nodules was observed. Additionally, a positive correlation existed between TgAb and lymph node metastases in patients with PTC.

### Thyroid autoimmunity, thyroglobulin autoantibodies, and thyroid cancer prognosis [^113f8vcn]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2023). High credibility.

The relevance of thyroid autoimmunity to the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma is still unsettled. We decided to investigate the impact of thyroid autoimmunity on the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma and the handling of TgAbs. We evaluated the clinical course of a large group of patients according to the presence (PTC-LT) or absence (PTC) of lymphocytic thyroiditis at histology.

We studied 194 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of PTC and treated them with total thyroidectomy plus ¹³¹I ablation between 2007 and 2009. The median follow-up (with 25th-75th percentiles) was 84.0 (56.4–118.0) months. The remission criteria were: basal Tg < 0.2 ng/mL (or stimulated Tg: < 1), TgAbs < 8 IU/mL (otherwise 'decreasing TgAb trend', a decline of ≥ 20% in sequential TgAb measurements), and unremarkable imaging.

PTC-LT and PTC patients had comparable treatment. TgAbs were detectable in 72.5% of PTC-LT and 16.5% of PTC patients. Time to remission was longer in the detectable than in the undetectable TgAb cohort (28.5 vs 7.5 months, median; HR: 0.54, CI: 0.35–0.83, P = 0.005). When comparing PTC-LT to PTC patients, the difference was maintained in the detectable TgAb group (29.3 vs 13.0 months; HR: 0.38, CI: 0.18–0.80; P = 0.01) but not in the undetectable TgAb cohort (7.7 vs 7.3 months; HR: 0.90, CI: 0.55–1.47; P = 0.68).

Using the decreasing TgAb trend, the influence of detectable TgAbs on time to remission was abolished. Thyroid autoimmunity does not influence the prognosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. A decreasing TgAb trend seems an appropriate criterion to establish remission.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^113cT9y7]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Graves' disease (GD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by activation of the TSH receptor by stimulatory autoantibodies, known as TSH Receptor Antibodies (TRAbs), leading to unregulated thyroid hormone production. Diagnosis is largely based on the typical clinical presentation and laboratory thyroid panel. The establishment of elevated serum levels of TRAbs, through competitive binding or cell-binding assays, plays a unique role in the diagnosis and management of GD. This is particularly important in differential diagnosis, therapy selection, prognostication, evaluation of thyroid function during pregnancy, peri-conceptional and neonatal thyroid workup, and in certain special situations.

Inclusion of TRAbs in the GD diagnostic algorithm can improve the cost-effectiveness of GD management. Best practice guidelines have been developed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of TRAbs in GD management specifically for healthcare providers in South Asia. A panel of endocrinologists, each with a minimum of 10 years of clinical experience in thyroid disorders, reviewed existing literature and its quality. After deliberation and discussion, they developed 21 recommendations regarding the best practices for the role of TRAbs in GD management.

### Clinical significance of thyroid autoantibodies in differential diagnosis and predicting the course of programmed cell death protein-1 inhibitor-induced thyroid dysfunction [^116FqPs7]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Thyroid immune-related thyrotoxicosis is one of the most common adverse effects in patients treated with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. We investigated the significance of levels of serum anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs), and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs) in the identification of anti-PD-1-induced thyroid thyrotoxicosis.

- **Methods**: We divided 161 patients with thyroid dysfunction who received PD-1 inhibitors at our hospital between January 2022 and June 2024 into 3 groups: primary hypothyroidism group, primary hyperthyroidism group, and destructive thyroiditis group. The characteristics of the 3 groups were determined, and the positivity rates of serum TgAbs, TPOAbs, and TRAbs were assessed. An additional 42 patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis were selected as the control group for PD-1 inhibition-induced destructive thyroiditis. Age, sex, and time of transition from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism in the 2 groups were compared.

- **Results**: In the primary hypothyroidism group, only 1 case was TPOAbs-positive (1/1%). In the destructive thyroiditis group, the positivity rate for TPOAbs or TgAbs was 92.9%, and TPOAbs and TgAbs were negative in the primary hyperthyroidism group. TRAbs were undetectable in all 3 groups. There were statistically significant differences in age, sex, and time from thyrotoxicosis to hypothyroidism in the PD-1-induced destructive thyroiditis and Hashimoto's thyroiditis groups.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with thyrotoxicosis caused by PD-

Regarding specific circumstances for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly with respect to pregnant patients, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend measuring total T4 or a free T4 index, in addition to TSH, to assess thyroid status during pregnancy. Direct immunoassay measurement of free T4 should be obtained, due to the wide variation in results of different free T4 assays, only when method-specific and trimester-specific reference ranges for serum free T4 are available.

### Best practices in the laboratory diagnosis, prognostication, prediction, and monitoring of Graves' disease: role of TRAbs [^111Nyqhk]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Different professional bodies have published detailed guidelines pertaining to various facets of management of Graves' disease, such as the 2016 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines and the 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism, the 2017 ATA guidelines for the management of peripartum GD, the 2022 ETA guidelines, and the 2016 Japanese guidelines for the management of pediatric GD. However, apart from the 2011 guidelines on the management of Indian patients with thyroid nodules, guidelines specific to the management of patients with thyroid disorders in the South Asian region, including the Indian subcontinent, have not been published.

Studies exploring ethnic differences in autoimmune disorders in general and autoimmune thyroid disorders, in particular, have unearthed a higher risk and an earlier age of onset of these conditions among South Asians. Thus, the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of autoimmune disorders such as GD are better informed by regional guidelines. Further, considering the improved knowledge of the role of TRAbs in GD and the availability of reliable laboratory tests to measure TRAbs, the need was felt to develop a dedicated recommendation exploring the role of TRAbs in diagnosis, prognosis, risk prediction, and management of GD.

Thyroid autoimmunity may result from the formation of autoantibodies that target different thyroid antigens, including thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), or more importantly, the TSH receptor. All antibodies targeting the TSH receptor are called by the

### Anatabine supplementation decreases thyroglobulin antibodies in patients with chronic lymphocytic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^115YWtqd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). High credibility.

Treatment for chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis involves thyroxine replacement when hypothyroidism develops. Tobacco smoking has numerous effects on thyroid volume, function, and disease, and it exerts a protective effect on the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid antibodies. While nicotine has anti-inflammatory effects, it is not recommended due to its addictive and toxic nature. Anatabine, another Solanaceae alkaloid with a similar chemical structure, may possess immunomodulatory properties. In a mouse model of thyroiditis, anatabine reduced the incidence and severity of the condition and lowered the levels of thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs). We designed a clinical trial to assess the effects of anatabine dietary supplementation in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

### Influence of thyroglobulin autoantibodies on thyroglobulin levels measured by different methodologies: IMA, LC-MS/MS, and RIA [^116sZpGW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Thyroglobulin (Tg), the large (~660 kDa) glycoprotein serving as a thyroid hormone precursor, is uniquely synthesized by thyroid follicular cells and co-secreted with thyroid hormones in proportion to the thyroid tissue mass (~1 µg/L Tg per gram). The tissue-specific origin of Tg has prompted the use of serum Tg as a postoperative tumor marker for patients with treated differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Three methodologies (immunometric assay [IMA], mass spectrometry [MS], and radioimmunoassay [RIA]) are currently available for Tg measurement. Sensitive automated IMA methods that use proprietary monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to detect conformational epitopes on the dimeric Tg protein have mostly replaced the older competitive RIA methods, which employ polyclonal antibodies that detect a wider range of epitopes than MAbs. The MS methods that have become available use trypsin digestion to release a Tg-specific peptide, which is immunocaptured and quantified by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Most thyroid tumors synthesize and secrete Tg protein, although the efficiency of neoplastic Tg secretion can be abnormal. Furthermore, there can be molecular heterogeneity and conformational abnormalities in neoplastic Tg resulting from differences in mRNA splicing, glycosylation, and/or iodine content. Such abnormalities in the tertiary Tg protein structure have the potential to disrupt the conformational epitope targets of both IMA and RIA assays, causing between-method differences. In contrast, polymorphisms and post-translational modifications have the potential to pro

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: Cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^115fCCwd]. Endocrine Practice (2012). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, particularly concerning thyroid replacement therapy, the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering treatment based on individual factors. Treatment initiation is suggested for patients with TSH levels between the upper limit of a given laboratory's reference range and 10 mIU/L, especially if patients exhibit symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, have positive anti-TPO antibodies, or show evidence of ASCVD, HF, or associated risk factors for these diseases.
