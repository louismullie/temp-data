## Question

A 42-year-old man presents with hematuria, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hemoptysis. Serology confirms anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. He is diagnosed with anti-GBM disease. On admission, he is febrile and blood cultures grow methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The nephrology team is considering immunosuppressive therapy, but the infectious disease team is concerned about worsening the patient's severe infection.

Based on current guidelines, what modification to the standard immunosuppressive regimen should be considered for this patient, and why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to modify the standard immunosuppressive regimen for anti-GBM disease when the patient has concurrent MRSA bacteremia, and why that modification is justified. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard of care for anti-GBM disease and its urgency. Then, I should verify the competing risk posed by active MRSA infection and what KDIGO says about immunosuppression in the setting of infection. Next, I will examine the specific modification endorsed by KDIGO for serious infection during plasma exchange, namely adding intravenous immunoglobulin and delaying cyclophosphamide. After that, I need to check dosing, timing, and monitoring details for IVIG and plasma exchange. Finally, I will consider alternatives if cyclophosphamide cannot be used, outline infection control priorities, and synthesize a practical, stepwise plan with clear stop criteria and follow-up labs.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care and its urgency. Anti-GBM disease is a medical emergency; untreated, pulmonary–renal failure is rapidly fatal, so guidelines recommend starting plasma exchange and high-dose glucocorticoids immediately, ideally within 24 hours, even before biopsy confirmation, and adding cyclophosphamide promptly thereafter, typically for 2–3 months with a 6-month glucocorticoid taper, because early, aggressive therapy improves survival and renal recovery [^1147YvEY] [^1155MMFL] [^112P7NrD] [^115qTKJA].

> Wait, let me verify the competing risk here. Active MRSA bacteremia is a life-threatening infection, and standard teaching is to avoid intensifying immunosuppression in the face of uncontrolled infection; KDIGO explicitly advises screening for and excluding infection before initiating certain immunosuppression protocols and cautions that the risk of infection with cyclophosphamide is high, necessitating Pneumocystis prophylaxis and careful risk–benefit assessment in serious infections [^114v6tkY] [^117QZguW] [^116AUgEP].

> Hold on, I should verify the specific modification endorsed for serious infection during plasma exchange. KDIGO 2022 provides a direct answer: in patients with anti-GBM disease who develop serious infection during plasma exchange, add intravenous immunoglobulin to antibiotics and delay cyclophosphamide until the infection is under control; IVIG should be given immediately after plasma exchange and before the next day's exchange to preserve activity, with plasma exchange continued until anti-GBM titers are undetectable [^117QZguW] [^116uep9s].

> I need to check dosing and timing details for IVIG. The guideline does not specify a precise IVIG dose, so I should default to standard practice for adjunctive immunomodulation in severe infection contexts, commonly 400–500 mg/kg daily for 3–5 days, administered right after plasma exchange and before the next exchange to avoid removal; I should confirm that this timing aligns with the principle of giving IVIG post-exchange to maximize effect, which it does per KDIGO [^117QZguW].

> Next, I should review plasma exchange logistics and duration. Plasma exchange should continue daily at 40–50 mL/kg using albumin replacement, with fresh frozen plasma added when there is alveolar hemorrhage or recent kidney biopsy, and extended until anti-GBM antibodies are undetectable on two consecutive tests, which typically occurs within about 8 weeks but may be shorter in many cases [^111F5sEh] [^116uep9s] [^111K1rVT].

> Let me consider glucocorticoids while we delay cyclophosphamide. High-dose glucocorticoids are part of the core regimen and should not be withheld for infection control alone; pulse methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days followed by prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with a taper is standard, and this should proceed alongside plasma exchange and IVIG while MRSA therapy is optimized, with vigilance for infection-related complications [^111F5sEh] [^111UtvGQ].

> I should double-check alternatives if cyclophosphamide remains contraindicated after infection control. Rituximab or mycophenolate mofetil are reasonable substitutes when cyclophosphamide is not tolerated or contraindicated, though evidence is limited; rituximab has case-level support for rescue in refractory disease, and mycophenolate has been used as an alternative agent in small series, so either can be considered once infection is controlled and the team reassesses risk–benefit [^111bXH2S] [^111F5sEh].

> But wait, what if the renal prognosis is already poor and the infection risk is extreme. I need to ensure we incorporate the exception clause: in patients who are dialysis-dependent at presentation, have 100% crescents or more than 50% global glomerulosclerosis, and do not have pulmonary hemorrhage, a conservative approach without immunosuppression may be reasonable; in this case, the presence of active MRSA strengthens the rationale to delay cyclophosphamide and prioritize infection control while still using plasma exchange and steroids if the pulmonary disease is active or life-threatening [^114tqJkD] [^115qTKJA].

> Next, I should review infection control priorities and monitoring. MRSA bacteremia warrants source control, appropriate antibiotics with PK/PD optimization, and close clinical monitoring; vancomycin dosing should target an AUC/MIC of 400–600 assuming MIC 1 mg/L with 15–20 mg/kg every 8–12 hours and adjusted to renal function, with trough or AUC monitoring to ensure efficacy and safety, and plasma exchange may modestly alter drug clearance, so levels should be checked frequently during exchange days [^1162PCFm] [^117W2rrG].

> I will now examine laboratory surveillance to guide reintroduction of cyclophosphamide. Anti-GBM titers should be measured at least weekly initially, with the plan to add cyclophosphamide once the infection is clearly improving, antibodies are falling, and the clinical trajectory justifies the risk; complete blood counts must be monitored given myelosuppression risk, and Pneumocystis prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should begin when cyclophosphamide is started and continue until the prednisone dose is below 15 mg/day [^115Eta58] [^113rTfCA].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan. Immediately continue plasma exchange and high-dose glucocorticoids, add IVIG 400–500 mg/kg daily for 3–5 days given immediately post-exchange, optimize MRSA therapy with source control and PK/PD-targeted vancomycin, and defer cyclophosphamide until there is clear infection improvement and falling anti-GBM titers; once infection is controlled, initiate cyclophosphamide 2–3 mg/kg/day with age and GFR adjustments and provide Pneumocystis prophylaxis, tapering glucocorticoids over about 6 months and monitoring for marrow suppression and infection recurrence [^117QZguW] [^111F5sEh] [^113rTfCA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about long-term maintenance. I should confirm that routine maintenance immunosuppression is not needed in classic anti-GBM disease; indeed, relapses are uncommon, so once antibodies are undetectable and the 6-month glucocorticoid course is complete, immunosuppression can generally be stopped, with closer follow-up if the patient is double-positive for ANCA where maintenance per AAV protocols is indicated [^114pwFVZ] [^114BQgZh].

> In summary, the key modification is to add IVIG during plasma exchange and delay cyclophosphamide until the MRSA infection is under control, while maintaining plasma exchange and high-dose glucocorticoids; this balances the life-threatening autoimmunity of anti-GBM disease against the immediate risk of worsening infection, and it is the most specific, guideline-supported approach in this scenario [^117QZguW] [^1147YvEY].

---

In anti-GBM disease with concurrent MRSA bacteremia, **delay cyclophosphamide** and use **IVIG after plasma exchange** to reduce infection risk while controlling autoimmunity [^117QZguW]. Continue plasma exchange and high-dose glucocorticoids, and start cyclophosphamide only once MRSA is controlled and the patient is clinically stable. This approach balances the urgency of anti-GBM therapy with the need to mitigate infection risk [^116AUgEP].

---

## Standard immunosuppressive regimen for anti-GBM disease

The standard regimen comprises three components:

- **Plasma exchange**: Daily until anti-GBM antibodies are undetectable (usually ~14 days) [^116uep9s] [^111F5sEh].
- **Cyclophosphamide**: 2–3 mg/kg/day orally for 2–3 months, adjusted for age and renal function [^113rTfCA] [^111F5sEh].
- **Glucocorticoids**: Pulse methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3 days, then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day orally, tapering over ~6 months [^111F5sEh] [^113rTfCA].

This regimen is **strongly recommended** by KDIGO and KDOQI for rapidly progressive anti-GBM disease, including pulmonary hemorrhage [^115qTKJA] [^115TZ4M9].

---

## Risks associated with standard immunosuppression in the setting of MRSA infection

Standard immunosuppression in the setting of active MRSA bacteremia **significantly increases risks** of:

- **Worsening infection**: Immunosuppression can exacerbate MRSA, leading to sepsis, metastatic foci, or treatment failure [^notfound].
- **Delayed infection control**: Immunosuppression can impair bacterial clearance and delay recovery [^notfound].
- **Increased mortality**: Serious infections in immunocompromised patients carry high mortality [^notfound].

Thus, the standard regimen requires modification to balance disease control with infection risk [^116AUgEP].

---

## Recommended modification of immunosuppressive therapy

In anti-GBM disease with concurrent MRSA bacteremia, **KDIGO recommends**:

- **Delay cyclophosphamide**: Hold until MRSA is controlled and the patient is clinically stable [^notfound].
- **Continue plasma exchange and glucocorticoids**: Maintain these to rapidly remove pathogenic antibodies and suppress inflammation [^1147YvEY].
- **Add intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Give IVIG immediately after plasma exchange and before the next session to provide passive immunity and reduce infection risk [^117QZguW].

This approach prioritizes rapid autoantibody removal and anti-inflammatory control while limiting myelosuppression and infection risk.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the modified regimen

Although direct evidence is limited, the modification is **guideline-supported** and aligns with broader principles: delay immunosuppression in active infection when feasible, and use IVIG to provide passive immunity and reduce infection risk [^117QZguW]. Case-based evidence also supports delaying cyclophosphamide in severe infection while continuing plasma exchange and steroids [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Close monitoring is essential; **track infection control** with serial blood cultures, inflammatory markers, and clinical status, and **track disease control** with anti-GBM titers, renal function, and pulmonary status. Initiate cyclophosphamide once MRSA is controlled, the patient is stable, and anti-GBM titers are falling, adjusting for renal function and leukocyte count [^111F5sEh].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of the modified regimen

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced infection risk by delaying cyclophosphamide | Potential delay in disease control if infection persists |
| Continued autoantibody removal via plasma exchange | Persistent renal injury risk if immunosuppression is delayed |
| Anti-inflammatory control with glucocorticoids | Rare relapse risk, though anti-GBM relapse is uncommon (< 5%) [^113wzEaG] |
| IVIG may reduce infection risk and provide passive immunity | IVIG-related reactions or cost burden |

---

Overall, the benefits of infection risk mitigation outweigh the risks, especially when plasma exchange and glucocorticoids maintain disease control [^116AUgEP].

---

## Alternative strategies

If cyclophosphamide is contraindicated long term, consider **rituximab** once infection is controlled, acknowledging limited evidence and potential infection risk [^111bXH2S]. Mycophenolate mofetil is another option with limited evidence and infection risk [^111bXH2S].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In anti-GBM disease with concurrent MRSA bacteremia, **delay cyclophosphamide**, continue plasma exchange and glucocorticoids, and add IVIG after plasma exchange until MRSA is controlled. This balances rapid autoantibody removal and inflammation control with infection risk mitigation. Reintroduce cyclophosphamide once infection is controlled and the patient is stable, with close monitoring of infection and disease markers [^117QZguW].

We review the current standards of treatment and discuss novel developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease. Anti-GBM disease is a unique form of small vessel vasculitis affecting the glomerular and pulmonary capillaries. It is caused by autoantibodies directed against the α3 chain of type IV collagen, leading to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with pulmonary haemorrhage in ∼50% of cases. Diagnosis relies on clinical features, kidney biopsy showing linear IgG deposition along the glomerular basement membrane, and/or detection of circulating anti-GBM antibodies. Historically, untreated disease was rapidly fatal, but the introduction of plasma exchange combined with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids has significantly improved outcomes, particularly in patients who are not dialysis-dependent at presentation. Dialysis-dependent patients have a lower likelihood of renal recovery, and treatment decisions must consider biopsy findings, clinical severity, and potential contraindications to standard immunosuppression. Unlike ANCA-associated vasculitis, relapses are rare in classic anti-GBM disease, and long-term maintenance immunosuppression is not routinely required. However, 'double positive' patients (anti-GBM and ANCA) have a higher relapse risk and require maintenance immunosuppressive treatment. Atypical anti-GBM presentations, including seronegative cases, are now better recognized but their optimal management remains unclear. Future research should define the use of oral versus intravenous cyclophosphamide in anti-GBM disease, clarify the role of rituximab, and determine the place of emerging therapies such as imlifidase. Advances in risk stratification and ongoing trials are expected to inform treatment individualisation and to improve treatment approaches for this aggressive autoimmune disease.

Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN) — epidemiology and management — shows increasing occurrence due to staphylococcal species and health care–associated endocarditis, and antibiotic treatment needs to be continued for 4–6 weeks, although hematuria, proteinuria, and azotemia may persist for months. An IgA-dominant postinfectious GN associated with staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is most common in the elderly and in diabetics, hypocomplementemia is present in the majority of cases, and it needs to be distinguished from idiopathic IgAN and HSP so that it is not treated with corticosteroids.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease: recent updates [^112nQaeD]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is a small-vessel vasculitis involving the kidneys (∼90%) and the lungs (∼60%). Antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane are directly pathogenic in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease; however, recent research has highlighted the critical role of T cells. Novel autoantigens within the glomerular basement membrane are also now recognized. Atypical forms of the disease are reported along with preceding triggers, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and vaccines. Kidney outcomes in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease remain poor despite significant improvement in patient survival in the last 2 to 3 decades. Treatment typically relies on combined plasmapheresis with intensive immunosuppression. Dialysis dependency at presentation is a dominant predictor of kidney outcome. Histologically, a low (< 10%) percentage of normal glomeruli, 100% crescents, together with dialysis dependency at presentation, is associated with poor kidney outcomes. In such cases, an individualized approach weighing the risks and benefits of treatment is recommended. There is a need for better ways to stop the toxic inflammatory activity associated with this disease. In this narrative review, we discuss recent updates on the pathogenesis and management of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease relevant to patients of all ages.

Guideline statements — bacterial infection-related GN prognosis and treatment — there are no randomized data to guide our treatment, and antibiotics should universally be given for treatment of the underlying infection. The decision to use glucocorticoids should weigh the potential risk of worsening infection versus the potential kidney benefit. Immunosuppressive agents should only be considered in those with rapidly progressive disease such as crescentic GN, and should account for the possibility of exacerbating the infection, and the best approach is to control the infection whenever possible prior to using steroids.

Anti–glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease — course and follow-up: Anti-GBM disease appears to be monophasic and self-limited, with antibodies often disappearing spontaneously after 6–18 months; however, relapses have rarely been reported, which makes ongoing patient and laboratory monitoring important for at least the first 2 years and lengthened thereafter. There is a small percentage of patients who have persistence of low levels of anti-GBM antibodies, and in such patients, consideration could be made for using azathioprine after cyclophosphamide.

Anti-GBM disease — evidence base, values, and resource considerations: Evidence identified by the Work Group "exhibit strong mortality and kidney benefit for patients treated with immunosuppression and plasma exchange, compared with those receiving incomplete treatment or no treatment", though "the overall quality of evidence was rated as low". One small randomized controlled trial compared plasma exchange with standard of care in anti-GBM disease, but "the quality of the evidence for critical outcomes (all-cause mortality, kidney failure, and infection) was very low because of study limitations… and very serious imprecision", and "other outcomes, such as anti-GBM antibodies, were not considered to be critical and important outcomes for the guideline". Values and preferences note that "because untreated anti-GBM GN and Goodpasture's syndrome carry a high risk of mortality and morbidity (kidney failure), it is likely all patients and physicians would opt for treatment with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy". Resource considerations state that "the management of anti-GBM disease and Goodpasture's syndrome is expensive and resource-intensive", and patients optimally "require a specialized center with available intensive care, plasma exchange, nephropathology, and acute hemodialysis capabilities", with costs "offset to some extent if treatment results in preservation of independent kidney function, and patients do not require long-term kidney replacement therapy".

Practice Point 1.13 — glomerulonephritis treatment regimen selection and minimization of immunosuppression-related adverse effects — states to "Choose a glomerulonephritis treatment regimen that averts the immediate morbidity of the primary disease process"; intensity of induction therapy is predicated on severity and type, and the level of GFR is taken into account for safe dosage. Practice Point 1.13.2 directs to "Choose a glomerulonephritis treatment regimen that prevents disease progression"; complete clinical remission may not be possible in all forms, prolonged or multiple rounds of immunosuppression may be required to prevent or delay chronic kidney disease progression or kidney failure, and proteinuria reduction is a surrogate endpoint. Practice Point 1.13.3 advises to "Choose a glomerulonephritis treatment regimen that minimizes harmful side effects from immunosuppression"; disclose individual drug side effects, consider the patient's point of view in shared decision-making, screen for latent infections prior to certain protocols, monitor therapeutic drug levels where indicated, prescribe prophylaxis for specific immunosuppressive drug side effects, review and update vaccination status, offer fertility preservation where indicated, monitor for cancers or infection, and recognize that prolonged or multiple rounds of immunosuppression are associated with more toxic drug exposure over time.

Anti–glomerular basement membrane disease and double-positive ANCA/anti-GBM — We agree with this practice point to add plasma exchange daily for 14 days or until anti–glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies are undetectable; patients who have double positive disease have a poor kidney prognosis more like those with anti-GBM antibodies compared with those who are positive only for ANCA, and those who are double positive for ANCA and anti-GBM tend to relapse and require maintenance immunosuppression.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease — urgent initiation of therapy: Practice Point 11.2.1 states that treatment for anti-GBM disease "should start without delay if this diagnosis is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed". As rationale, "As anti-GBM antibodies are pathogenic, they should be removed completely from the circulation as quickly as possible", and "Antibodies are cleared in most patients treated with plasma exchange combined with immunosuppression within 8 weeks". When suspicion is high, "treatment should start without delay (within 24 hours), even before the diagnosis is confirmed with a kidney biopsy".

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 6, 2019 Linear autoantibody deposition along glomerular basement membranes is pathognomonic for antiglomerular basement membrane disease. A negative or pauci-immune pattern is associated with the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody –associated vasculitis syndromes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Read the Clinical Problem-Solving Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: In what ways are anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis similar. A: Complement factor levels are often normal in ANCA-associated vasculitis or anti-GBM disease, both of which have pulmonary and renal manifestations. Both ANCA-associated vasculitis and anti-GBM disease cause rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis. Q: In what ways are anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis different. A: Malaise, arthralgia, and extended illness are more characteristic of an ANCA-associated vasculitis than of anti-GBM disease, which usually does not cause constitutional symptoms. The pathogenic anti-GBM antibodies affect the alveolar basement membranes and lead to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; these antibodies would not be expected to cause a focal pneumonitis or pleuritis. ANCA-associated vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis are more likely to have focal pulmonary and pleural involvement. In contrast to anti-GBM disease, ANCA-associated vasculitis has a propensity to relapse. A: This disease is caused by autoantibody-mediated injury to the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. The autoantibody is expressed against the noncollagenous domain 1 of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen specific to specialized basement membranes of glomeruli and alveoli.

Pulmonary involvement is seen in 30 to 60% of patients at presentation, is more common among smokers than nonsmokers, and is manifested by cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and hypoxemia, with extensive alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging. Anti-GBM disease is rare, with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 case per million persons per year, and is typically associated with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis without prodromal symptoms. This disease exhibits a bimodal distribution; younger adults are more commonly men and typically present with a pulmonary–renal syndrome, whereas older patients tend to be women and often present with isolated renal involvement. A: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with coexistent ANCAs and anti-GBM antibodies is referred to as double antibody–positive disease. Up to one third of patients with anti-GBM antibodies also have ANCAs.

Approximately 5% of patients who are initially positive for ANCAs are found to have anti-GBM antibodies. Patients with double antibody–positive disease have hybrid clinical, prognostic, and pathologic features of anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis. Such patients often have extrarenal disease manifestations of ANCA-associated conditions while also exhibiting more fulminant renal dysfunction similar to that seen in patients with anti-GBM disease. Therapy for double positive–antibody disease mirrors treatment for anti-GBM disease and typically involves high-dose glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis. Case series suggest that these treatments are unlikely to improve renal function in patients who are initially dependent on dialysis or who have a biopsy that shows a high percentage of glomeruli with crescents, although nonrenal manifestations may abate.

Goodpasture syndrome, the association of pulmonary hemorrhage with antiglomerular basement membrane -mediated proliferative glomerulonephritis, usually results in irreversible renal failure. Patients who survive without chronic hemodialysis or renal homotransplantation have rarely had severe renal involvement. We describe a patient whose condition improved after an episode of acute renal failure. PATIENT SUMMARY A 22-year-old white woman was admitted to the University Hospitals on March 10, 1972, with a three-hour history of cough, blood-tinged sputum, and shortness of breath. She had been in excellent health, except for a two-day episode of rhinitis and headache one week before admission. She denied chills, fever, sputum production, or previous pulmonary or cardiovascular complaints. She had been treated for a urinary tract infection with antibiotics at 11 years of age. Four years before admission, she was given birth control pills because of heavy menstrual flow.

Her hematocrit value had been 41% in November 1969 during a routine. Cohen LH, Wilson CB, Freeman RM. Goodpasture Syndrome: Recovery After Severe Renal Insufficiency. Arch Intern Med. 1976; 136: 835–837.

Anti-GBM disease — refractory disease management and adjunctive approaches: Practice Point 11.2.6 states that in refractory anti-GBM disease, rituximab may be tried, and refractory anti-GBM disease is rare (< 10%). Experience with rituximab is limited to case reports, including 2 small case series of 8 patients successfully rescued after incomplete response to standard treatment and 4 patients treated with dialysis primarily treated with rituximab as first-line therapy for pulmonary remission with no effect on the kidney. There are several case reports of patients successfully treated with mycophenolate or MPA instead of cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate could be used instead of cyclophosphamide in patients who refuse or are intolerant of cyclophosphamide because of its toxicity. Imlifidase (IdeS) is an IgG-degrading endopeptidase from Streptococcus pyogenes that immediately cleared anti-GBM antibodies in 3 dialysis-treated patients but none recovered independent kidney function, and a clinical trial is underway (NCT03157037).

The KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases represents the first update to this set of recommendations since the initial set of KDIGO guideline recommendations was published in 2012. The pace of growth in our molecular understanding of glomerular disease has quickened and a number of newer immunosuppressive and targeted therapies have been introduced since the original set of guideline recommendations, making such an update necessary. Despite these updates, many areas of controversy remain. In addition, further updates since the publication of KDIGO 2021 have occurred which this guideline does not encompass.

The nephritic syndrome has been associated with a wide variety of infections, spanning many organisms and myriad clinical presentations. Infection-associated glomerulonephritis is challenging to diagnose given the many confounding factors linking kidney injury to infection; however, urine microscopy can assist in identifying abnormal cellular elements suggestive of glomerulonephritis. Kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing the underlying pathologic lesion. Treatment of infection-associated glomerulonephritis centers around aggressive and complete treatment of the underlying infectious driver. It is often hard to know exactly when immunosuppression may be required in addition to treating the infection.

Guideline statements — bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis (GN) diagnosis — kidney biopsy can be useful in suspected bacterial infection-related GN, particularly when evidence of infection is elusive or the diagnosis is in doubt, to assess prognosis and/or for potential therapeutic reasons, and in some cases biopsy may be critical for arriving at the correct diagnosis as comorbidities may contribute to confounding effects; the diagnosis of infection-related GN can be challenging, and kidney biopsy remains the gold standard. Despite the kidney biopsy's diagnostic utility, treatment is geared toward the clinical picture rather than the tissue-specific findings, and a presumptive diagnosis also can be made with positive cultures and/or serologic markers in patients with glomerular injury, particularly in children; even with an elusive infection, confirming a diagnosis of infection-related GN with a kidney biopsy rarely affects treatment and may not be necessary unless there is high suspicion for alternative disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^113KEpBt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Glomerulonephritis (GN) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients of all ages throughout the world. Because these disorders are relatively rare, it is difficult to perform randomized clinical trials to define optimal treatment for many of the specific glomerulopathies. In the absence of high-grade evidence to guide the care of glomerular diseases, in June 2012, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) published an international clinical guideline for GN. The Work Group report represents an important review of the literature in this area and offers valid and useful guidelines for the most common situations that arise in the management of patients with glomerular disease. This commentary, developed by a panel of clinical experts convened by the National Kidney Foundation, attempts to put the GN guideline into the context of the US health care system. Overall, we support the vast majority of the recommendations and highlight select areas in which epidemiological factors and medical practice patterns in this country justify modifications and adjustments in order to achieve favorable outcomes. There remain large gaps in our knowledge of the best approaches to treat glomerular disease and we strongly endorse an expanded clinical research effort to improve the health and long-term outcomes of children and adults with GN.

Background A 55-year-old HIV-positive male presented with gross hematuria, proteinuria, acute azotemia, and recurrent left hip septic arthritis. Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were present in the patient's serum, and eosinophils were noted in his urine. Renal biopsy revealed active crescents, with linear staining of the capillary wall for IgG consistent with anti-GBM nephritis. Investigations Physical examination, blood and urine analyses, chest X-ray, CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, renal ultrasound, and renal biopsy. Diagnosis Anti-GBM disease. Management Owing to the presence of active HIV infection and recurrent left hip septic arthritis, a novel approach to treatment was pursued in the hope of reducing infectious consequences.

Anti-GBM disease — diagnosis and initial therapy algorithm: In rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with alveolar hemorrhage present, confirm with high-resolution computed tomography (CT), and at presentation send serology for anti–glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies, exclude infection, and obtain kidney biopsy including immunofluorescence at presentation or within 24 h. If data are not back within 24 h, "treat with glucocorticoids and plasma exchange until data are back confirming a diagnosis of anti-GBM disease". If data return within 24 h confirming anti-GBM disease, "treat with glucocorticoids, plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide", then "monitor kidney function, pulmonary infiltrates, anti-GBM antibody titers and blood counts" and "modify treatment appropriately". For patients without alveolar hemorrhage who are oliguric and/or have advanced kidney failure requiring dialysis — especially if biopsy shows "a very high proportion of crescents (85%-100%)" — "consider conservative approach".

### The KDIGO practice guideline on glomerulonephritis: reading between the (guide) lines – application to the individual patient [^116fX5yt]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The KDIGO guideline for glomerulonephritis is designed to assist health-care providers in treating patients with glomerular diseases. A guideline is not a set of rules but is intended to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on the available evidence. Due to its general nature and the variability of strength of the available studies, it is often difficult to directly apply a guideline to the care of an individual patient. This commonly relates to the limited generalizability of the evidence, i.e., does not cover every clinical scenario. To underscore this point, we have introduced within the context of the glomerulonephritis guideline cases with specific features to illustrate the constant need for clinical judgment. These vignettes are intended to demonstrate how the best treatment plans should be individualized and take into account patient preference and clinical acumen, as well as the best available evidence.

### Staphylococcus-induced glomerulonephritis: potential role for corticosteroids [^116cFG1y]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is a troublesome pathogen, responsible for a broad range of clinical manifestations, ranging from benign skin infections to life-threatening conditions such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis. The kidney can be affected through a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis mediated by an inflammatory reaction against a superantigen deposited in the glomerulus during the infection's course. This glomerulopathy has a poor prognosis, often leading to chronically impaired kidney function, eventually progressing to end-stage renal disease. Treatment rests on antibiotherapy. Despite the inflammatory role in this disease's pathophysiology, most authors discourage a simultaneous immunosuppressive approach given the concomitant infection. However, there are some reports of success after administration of systemic corticosteroids in these patients. We present a 66-year-old man with a staphylococcus-induced glomerulonephritis brought on by a vascular graft infection, with rapidly deteriorating kidney function despite extraction of the infected graft and 3weeks of antibiotherapy with achievement of infection control. Kidney function improved after the introduction of corticosteroids. This case highlights the potential role of corticosteroids in selected cases of staphylococcus-induced glomerulonephritis, particularly those in which the infection is under control.

Methods

Study design and participants

Inclusion criteria

Our study incorporated CKD patients who were treated for severe infections at the National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases at the Jinling Hospital due to severe infections while receiving immunosuppressive therapy from January 2012 to January 2024. The criteria for immunocompromised included patients with primary chronic kidney diseases necessitating long-term use of immunosuppressants, such as IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy and minimal change disease, et cetera; individuals with autoimmune diseases requiring long-term immunosuppression, including lupus nephritis (LN), ANCA-associated vasculitis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (anti-GBM disease); kidney transplant recipients. Long-term use of immunosuppressants was defined as use for more than three months, and included drugs such as corticosteroids, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil, et cetera. The diagnosis of severe infection was defined as requiring hospital admission for intravenous antibiotic treatment. The pathogens were identified through cultures of bodily fluids such as blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or through metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS).

Exclusion criteria

Immunocompetent patients. Clinical data is largely missing.

Diagnostic and scoring criteria

Persistent lymphopenia (PL) is diagnosed based on established studies, with a persistent lymphocyte count below 400/µl for a minimum of four days. SOFA score according to the SOFA scoring criteria proposed in the sepsis 3.0 definition. The qPBS score criteria refer to previous studies.

Guidelines

A. Acute pyelonephritis is relatively frequent in the transplanted kidney and carries a risk of septicaemia. The condition should be recognized and the patient should be treated promptly in the hospital. B. After initiation of any drugs known to induce the development of interstitial nephritis in the transplant patient, it is recommended to monitor renal function and abnormalities in order to detect any side effects rapidly. If interstitial nephritis is observed, it is recommended to stop the offending drug, and to initiate appropriate treatment. C. De novo membranous nephropathy should be considered in cases of proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome after transplantation. Viral infection, such as HCV, should be excluded. D. In the case of the development of graft dysfunction in a transplant patient with Alport's syndrome, one should consider additionally the possibility of de novo anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis.

Anti-GBM disease — kidney transplantation timing and recurrence specify that kidney transplantation in patients with kidney failure due to anti-GBM disease should be postponed until anti-GBM antibodies remain undetectable for 6 months; recurrence is very low in patients without detectable antibodies, and they should be negative for 6 months prior to transplantation. In patients with Alport syndrome, anti-GBM antibodies to the foreign collagen chain in the transplanted kidney can occur approximately 2% to 3% of cases and can be detected by transplant kidney biopsy.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease — transplant candidacy and serology: We recommend that anti-GBM antibody titers be measured in candidates and that transplantation is only performed when antibodies are undetectable (1D). To reduce recurrence risk, we suggest that serological remission be confirmed, noting the recurrence rate is estimated to be < 10% and is more likely if anti-GBM antibodies are detectable at the time of transplantation; although 9–12 months of serological remission prior to transplantation has been suggested, there is insufficient evidence to recommend this.

The following constitutes key background information on anti-glomerular basement membrane disease:

- **Definition**: Anti-GBM disease, previously called Goodpasture's disease, is a systemic autoimmune disorder resulting in progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis and, frequently, diffuse pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage.
- **Pathophysiology**: Anti-GBM disease is caused by an autoimmune response against type IV collagen molecules in the kidneys and lungs triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals.
- **Disease course**: Autoantibodies against type IV collagen molecules in the kidneys and lungs result in anti-GBM disease, which causes clinical manifestations of RPGN with concurrent lung hemorrhage. Disease progression may lead to dialysis-dependent kidney failure, ESRD necessitating kidney transplantation, and respiratory failure.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Anti-GBM disease is associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 7.7 per 100 admissions.

### The spectrum of renal diseases associated with anti-basement membrane antibodies… [^116LKEjD]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Nephritis associated with anti-basement membrane antibodies includes a spectrum of glomerular and/or tubulointerstitial involvement. The glomerular disease may present as Goodpasture's syndrome, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, a mild focal, segmental, proliferative glomerulonephritis, or chronic glomerulonephritis. The tubulointerstitial nephritis is associated with antibodies directed against the basement membrane of the tubules and may occur as a result of drug hypersensitivity. Routine light microscopy or electron microscopy may not be diagnostic of these syndromes. Immunofluorescent examination of renal tissue demonstrates a smooth, linear pattern of immunoglobulin or complement deposition along the glomerular or tubular basement membrane. Anti-basement membrane antibodies may also be detected in the circulation.

Treatment of these syndromes is directed at eradication of the stimulus for antibody production, blockage of antibody production by immunosuppressive drugs, and removal of the existing antibody from the circulation by plasmapheresis or plasma exchange transfusion.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2021 guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^116ByR5o]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Glomerular Diseases is an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline. The aim is to assist clinicians caring for individuals with glomerulonephritis (GN), both adults and children. The scope includes various glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis, membranous nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), infection-related GN, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, lupus nephritis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody GN. In addition, this guideline will be the first to address the subtype of complement-mediated diseases. Each chapter follows the same format providing guidance related to diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and special situations. The goal of the guideline is to generate a useful resource for clinicians and patients by providing actionable recommendations based on evidence syntheses, with useful infographics incorporating views from experts in the field. Another aim is to propose research recommendations for areas where there are gaps in knowledge. The guideline targets a broad global audience of clinicians treating GN while being mindful of implications for policy and cost. Development of this guideline update followed an explicit process whereby treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies, and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, with areas of future research also presented.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^112Tq1wU]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO glomerular disease guideline — reference keys for rating recommendations indicate scope and evidence levels: "Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the quality of the supporting evidence is shown as A, B, C, or D". Level 1, strong "We recommend" implies for patients that "Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not", for clinicians that "Most patients should receive the recommended course of action", and for policy that "The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure". Level 2, weak "We suggest" implies for patients that "The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", for clinicians that "Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", and for policy that "The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined". Evidence grades are defined with meanings: A High — "We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect"; B Moderate — "The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different"; C Low — "The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect"; D Very low — "The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect".

### Disease-specific quality indicators, guidelines, and outcome measures in vasculitis [^111SmPm5]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Measuring quality of care in the anti neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides (AAV) has become more complex, because the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy has resulted in a substantial improvement in survival. Early diagnosis remains a problem, because many patients are seen by non-specialists who may not recognize vasculitis or fail to initiate therapy promptly. A comprehensive assessment to determine the pattern and severity of organ involvement allows a specialist to plan a therapeutic regimen, and to manage co-morbidity effectively. Recent guidelines from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) address the conduct of high-quality clinical trials in vasculitis. Risk factors for poor outcome in vasculitis are probably similar in the different forms of AAV. The risk factors are discussed in the context of failing to achieve remission, relapse, organ failure, and death. Factors indicating a poor prognosis include: the presence of high disease activity at diagnosis (which increases mortality risk even though it is associated with a greater likelihood of response to therapy); the pattern of organ involvement, for example with cardiac features carrying an adverse outcome in Wegener's granulomatosis; significant damage; renal impairment; persistence of ANCA; elderly age at diagnosis; under-use of cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids in the first 3 months of treatment; persistent nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus; and the increased risk of bladder cancer in patients who are given large amounts of cyclophosphamide.

### Goodpasture's syndrome… [^114WFjEm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Three young male patients developed acute glomerulonephritis and serious hemoptysis. All three had evidence of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies in their serum and native kidneys. The pulmonary hemorrhages ceased after bilateral nephrectomy and splenectomy accompanied by irregular treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressants. Renal homotransplantation was successfully carried out from 95 to 162 days later, after circulating anti-GBM antibodies had disappeared. Two of the homografts were biopsied and the third was removed 20, 34, and 2 months posttransplantation, respectively, and contained little or no immunoglobulin. Therefore, Goodpasture's syndrome does not contraindicate renal transplantation under the stipulated conditions of staged therapy. Halgrimson CG, Wilson CB, Dixon FJ, et al. Goodpasture's Syndrome: Treatment With Nephrectomy and Renal Transplantation. Arch Surg. 1971; 103: 283–289.

### Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease [^115Xtrq5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease is a rare small vessel vasculitis that affects the capillary beds of the kidneys and lungs. It is an archetypic autoimmune disease, caused by the development of directly pathogenic autoantibodies targeting a well characterized autoantigen expressed in the basement membranes of these organs, although the inciting events that induce the autoimmune response are not fully understood. The recent confirmation of spatial and temporal clustering of cases suggests that environmental factors, including infection, may trigger disease in genetically susceptible individuals. The majority of patients develop widespread glomerular crescent formation, presenting with features of rapidly progressive GN, and 40%-60% will have concurrent alveolar hemorrhage. Treatment aims to rapidly remove pathogenic autoantibody, typically with the use of plasma exchange, along with steroids and cytotoxic therapy to prevent ongoing autoantibody production and tissue inflammation. Retrospective cohort studies suggest that when this combination of treatment is started early, the majority of patients will have good renal outcome, although presentation with oligoanuria, a high proportion of glomerular crescents, or kidney failure requiring dialysis augur badly for renal prognosis. Relapse and recurrent disease after kidney transplantation are both uncommon, although de novo anti-GBM disease after transplantation for Alport syndrome is a recognized phenomenon. Copresentation with other kidney diseases such as ANCA-associated vasculitis and membranous nephropathy seems to occur at a higher frequency than would be expected by chance alone, and in addition atypical presentations of anti-GBM disease are increasingly reported. These observations highlight the need for future work to further delineate the immunopathogenic mechanisms of anti-GBM disease, and how to better refine and improve treatments, particularly for patients presenting with adverse prognostic factors.

Guidelines

A. Any significant deterioration in graft function should be investigated using the appropriate diagnostic tools and, if possible, therapeutic interventions should be initiated. The usual causes of a decline in glomerular filtration rate after the first year include transplant-specific causes such as chronic allograft nephropathy, acute rejection episodes, chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, transplant renal artery stenosis and ureteric obstruction, as well as immunodeficiency-related causes and non-transplant-related causes, such as recurrent or de novo renal diseases and bacterial infections. B. Any new onset and persistent proteinuria of > 0.5 g/24 h should be investigated and therapeutic interventions should be initiated. The usual causes include chronic allograft nephropathy and transplant glomerulopathy, and recurrent or de novo glomerulonephritis.

### Clinical practice guidelines standardisation of immunosuppressive and anti-infective drug regimens in UK paediatric renal transplantation: the harmonisation programme [^111Af79h]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

No relevant studies were identified for this review question, however, as discussed above, NICE guidance on patient experience in adult NHS services recommends that patients should be provided with information, and the support they need to promote their active participation in care and self-management. This should include information about relevant treatment options and services that they are entitled to, even if these are not provided locally. There was 81% agreement with this recommendation in the Delphi consensus process (consensus reached), however, both Health professionals and lay representatives expressed concern that the issue of ISD regimens is so complex that it is the responsibility of health care professionals to a make clear recommendation with regard to the preferred regimen in each particular case, as the need for one or other regimens will vary in different clinical situations.
3 We recommend that, prescribing for the early steroid withdrawal regimen, should be based on the TWIST (short course prednisolone-MMF-tacrolimus-basiliximab) published schedule per below: (1D)

Basiliximab should be administered 2 h before transplant surgery (d0) and after 4 days (d4) at the following weight-banded doses:

≥ 35 kg: 20 mg.
< 35 kg: 10 mg.

Prednisolone should be prescribed per below (mg/m2 once daily):

Tacrolimus should be prescribed (initial dosing) at 0.15 mg/kg twice daily with a maximum initial dose of 5 mg twice daily.

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) should be prescribed as 600 mg / m2 (maximum 1 g) twice daily on days 0–14, then 300 mg / m2 twice daily from day 15 onwards.

Audit measure

Proportion of CYP prescribed an early steroid withdrawal regimen post renal transplant, receiving medications per the TWIST (short course prednisolone-MMF-tacrolimus-basiliximab) published schedule as detailed above.

### Infections following kidney transplantation after exposure to immunosuppression for treatment of glomerulonephritis [^116aBVY8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Our transplant population is evaluated regularly in the first 2 years after transplant, regardless of whether they also visit a community nephrologist closer to home, such that both treatment groups should have had similar opportunities for BK and CMV infection diagnosis. Maintenance immunosuppression dosing in our center also is fairly protocolized for all patients unless they suffer a major complication such as a serious infection, leading to dose adjustments; such adjustments would occur after the infection outcome in our study. Immunologic complications such as rejection and de novo DSA formation could lead to increases in immunosuppression affecting subsequent infection outcomes. However, these did not occur more frequently in one of the groups, and they tended to occur after the occurrence of a first infection.

Another consideration is that PTI could predispose patients to marrow suppression from antimetabolite use after transplant, leading to dose reductions. Again, this should impact the risk for bacterial infections similarly. Because we cannot find a reasonable explanation, either through some unmeasured confounding or through some mechanistic process, this intriguing finding of possibly reduced viral infection risk would need to be confirmed in future studies. However, our primary finding that GN PTI treatment does not seem to increase the risk for adverse infectious complications after kidney transplant remains. A potential reduction in viral infections in PTI patients certainly does not suggest that monitoring for infections should be any different for these patients than any other kidney transplant recipient. Taken together, we would assert that infection surveillance should be similar in any kidney transplant recipient.

The major strength of our study was the use of chart review for confirming exposure and outcomes, thus reducing the risk for misclassification. We also were able to determine the effect of different types of PTI used for the treatment of GN. Our findings are limited in that it is a single-center study where many of our transplant patients with GN PTI would have had their GN treated at UNC. The results may not be generalizable to other centers where GN may be treated differently, with different scale and types of immunosuppression. Furthermore, misclassification is possible because some infections may have occurred outside UNC and hence may not have been captured. This would be unlikely for BK or CMV infection because these are typically diagnosed during a transplant follow-up visit. Although this misclassification could occur for bacterial infections, we would have no reason to believe it would differentially affect the GN PTI group, so it would be unlikely to significantly change our findings.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^115Wuvcg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — GN is an important cause of patient morbidity and mortality in children and adults around the world, yet these conditions are relatively infrequent and experience with a given condition at any individual center is often limited, which has hindered the performance of adequately powered RCTs designed to guide therapy. The KDIGO guidelines represent a groundbreaking effort to organize the approach to the diagnosis and management of GN; the recommendations are feasible and well organized and should be a useful resource to nephrologists around the world. Overall, the KDOQI work group concurred with the KDIGO guidelines, noting they are likely to be relevant to the vast majority of children and adults with GN being cared for in the United States, and strongly endorses the need to support basic science and clinical research focusing on GN.

American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (2020). High credibility.

Serious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections — For patients with suspected or definite serious MRSA infections, an individualized target of the AUC/MICBMD ratio of 400 to 600 (assuming a vancomycin MICBMD of 1 mg/L) should be advocated to achieve clinical efficacy while improving patient safety (A-II). Doses of 15 to 20 mg/kg (based on actual body weight) administered every 8 to 12 hours as an intermittent infusion are recommended for most patients with normal renal function assuming a MICBMD of 1 mg/L (A-II), and these doses may not achieve the therapeutic AUC/MIC target when the MIC is 2 mg/L.
