## Question

In a newly stabilized patient after MI at elevated risk for heart failure, should I start sacubitril/valsartan instead of an ACE inhibitor to improve outcomes, based on PARADISE-MI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether sacubitril/valsartan should be started instead of an ACE inhibitor in a newly stabilized post–myocardial infarction patient at elevated risk for heart failure, and how PARADISE-MI informs that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the key results and limitations of PARADISE-MI. Next, I will compare sacubitril/valsartan with ACE inhibitors in this setting, including efficacy, safety, and guideline positions. After that, I should consider subgroup signals and practical implementation. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation with dosing and monitoring guidance, and I will double-check for any conflicting evidence or caveats before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk profile. A "newly stabilized" post-MI patient at "elevated risk for heart failure" typically includes those with LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion requiring IV therapy, without prior chronic heart failure, and hemodynamically stable enough for oral RAAS therapy, which matches the PARADISE-MI inclusion criteria and contemporary ACS risk frameworks [^0473bb8c] [^67d872c7].

> I need to check the primary outcome and magnitude of benefit in PARADISE-MI. The trial randomized 5,661 high-risk post-MI patients to sacubitril/valsartan versus ramipril and found a 10% relative risk reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, first heart failure hospitalization, or outpatient progression to heart failure, which did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78–1.04; P = 0.17), so the primary endpoint was neutral [^607aeaaa]. Wait, let me verify the exact hazard ratio and confidence interval; yes, that is correct, and the trial was powered for a larger effect than observed, explaining the lack of statistical significance despite a modest relative reduction [^607aeaaa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review key secondary and safety outcomes. Sacubitril/valsartan reduced the risk of first heart failure hospitalization by 21% (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58–1.04) and reduced NT-proBNP more than ramipril, but hypotension was more frequent and led to more dose reductions or discontinuations, which is clinically meaningful in the early post-MI period [^607aeaaa]. I should confirm the safety signal; yes, hypotension and renal adverse effects were more common with sacubitril/valsartan, reinforcing the need for careful selection and titration in this population [^607aeaaa].

> Next, I should review the broader evidence base to contextualize PARADISE-MI. In chronic HFrEF, PARADIGM-HF showed a robust 20% reduction in cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization with sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril, establishing ARNI superiority in that setting, but that trial excluded patients within 3 months of an acute coronary syndrome, so it does not directly inform early post-MI initiation [^03068d83] [^5600ca31]. Let me consider meta-analytic data; a recent meta-analysis suggests mortality benefit of sacubitril/valsartan over ACEi/ARB primarily in patients with EF < 40%, which aligns with the HFrEF signal rather than a post-MI-specific benefit [^3b841926].

> I should confirm guideline positions before recommending a change in practice. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline advises initiating an ACE inhibitor or ARB in appropriate patients after MI, and specifically notes that in patients early after MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion, sacubitril/valsartan did not significantly reduce cardiovascular death or incident heart failure versus an ACE inhibitor, while hypotensive events were more common; thus, it does not recommend substituting ARNI for ACEi in the early post-MI window, though initiation appears safe if a plan for HFrEF therapy is in place [^cb29f132] [^67d872c7]. I should double-check that wording; yes, that is the exact guidance, reflecting a Class 3 (no benefit) recommendation for routine early substitution in this context [^cb29f132].

> But wait, what if there are subgroup signals that change the calculus. Exploratory analyses from PARADISE-MI suggest potential benefit in patients with EF ≤ 40% or those with higher NT-proBNP, yet these are hypothesis-generating and not definitive for changing practice; still, they may inform individualized decisions in higher-risk phenotypes after discussing uncertainties and trade-offs [^607aeaaa] [^43462b39]. I should confirm that these are post hoc; yes, they are and should be interpreted cautiously.

> Let me think about practical implementation if, despite the neutral primary outcome, a clinician prefers ARNI in a high-risk post-MI patient with low EF. I need to ensure safe initiation: avoid starting within 36 hours of an ACE inhibitor, screen for hypotension risk, and consider a lower starting dose in those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or borderline blood pressure, with close monitoring of renal function and potassium, given the higher rates of hypotension and renal adverse effects seen in PARADISE-MI and labeling precautions [^f5aebba6] [^a10e38eb] [^924ad004]. Standard dosing is 49/51 mg twice daily, titrated to 97/103 mg twice daily as tolerated, which mirrors the trial protocol and FDA labeling [^21c2546f].

> I should also anchor the standard-of-care foundation. ACE inhibitors remain first-line after MI with LV dysfunction based on decades of evidence and multiple guidelines, with ramipril specifically showing a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality in the AIRE trial and broad endorsement in contemporary ACS guidance, whereas ARBs like valsartan are acceptable alternatives when ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, and dual RAAS blockade is discouraged due to harm without added benefit [^7b3da9a4] [^67d872c7] [^cb29f132]. Hold on, I should verify the dual RAAS warning; yes, guidelines explicitly advise against concomitant ACEi and ARB initiation post-MI, which is pertinent if considering sequential strategies [^cb29f132].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Based on PARADISE-MI and current guidelines, sacubitril/valsartan should not be started instead of an ACE inhibitor in the early post-MI period for the sole purpose of improving outcomes, because the trial's primary composite endpoint was not statistically significant and hypotension was more frequent; however, if the patient develops chronic HFrEF or is intolerant to ACE inhibitors, transitioning to or choosing sacubitril/valsartan is reasonable and supported by the HFrEF evidence base and guideline pathways for chronic HF management [^607aeaaa] [^cb29f132] [^03068d83]. I should double-check that this aligns with both efficacy and safety; yes, the balance of evidence and guidance supports ACE inhibitor initiation now, with ARNI reserved for established HFrEF or ACEi intolerance rather than routine early substitution post-MI [^cb29f132] [^67d872c7].

---

Based on PARADISE-MI, **sacubitril/valsartan is not superior to ramipril** for preventing cardiovascular death or heart failure after high-risk MI, and is not recommended as first-line therapy in this setting [^cb29f132]. Sacubitril/valsartan showed a modest, non-significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint and caused more hypotension, so **ACE inhibitors remain first-line** unless contraindicated. Consider sacubitril/valsartan only if the patient develops chronic HFrEF or cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors, and avoid early initiation within 36 hours of ACE inhibitor use [^f5aebba6].

---

## PARADISE-MI trial design and key findings

- **Design**: Double-blind, randomized trial comparing sacubitril/valsartan vs ramipril in 5,661 high-risk post-MI patients without prior HF, initiated 0.5–7 days after MI.
- **Primary endpoint**: Cardiovascular death, first HF hospitalization, or outpatient HF (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.78–1.04; P = 0.17) — no significant difference.
- **Secondary endpoints**: No significant differences in cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, or recurrent MI.
- **Safety**: More hypotension (14.1% vs 9.5%) and drug discontinuation due to hypotension (2.1% vs 0.7%) with sacubitril/valsartan.

---

## Clinical implications and guideline recommendations

Current ACC/AHA/ACEP guidelines state that **sacubitril/valsartan is not recommended as first-line therapy** in the early post-MI period because it did not significantly reduce cardiovascular death or incident HF versus ACE inhibitors and caused more hypotension [^cb29f132]. ACE inhibitors remain first-line unless contraindicated, with ARBs as alternatives; sacubitril/valsartan is reserved for patients who develop chronic HFrEF or cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors.

---

## Patient populations where sacubitril/valsartan may be considered

Sacubitril/valsartan may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Chronic HFrEF**: Patients who develop chronic HFrEF after MI benefit from sacubitril/valsartan per PARADIGM-HF [^03068d83].
- **ACE inhibitor intolerance**: Patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors may use sacubitril/valsartan as an alternative RAAS blockade strategy.
- **High-risk features**: Patients with persistent LV dysfunction, elevated natriuretic peptides, or recurrent HF events may be considered for sacubitril/valsartan on a case-by-case basis, acknowledging limited early post-MI evidence.

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

When initiating sacubitril/valsartan, clinicians should:

- **Monitor for hypotension**: Especially in patients with low SBP, elderly, or those on diuretics [^924ad004].
- **Monitor renal function and potassium**: Regularly check serum creatinine and potassium, particularly in patients with CKD or diabetes [^924ad004].
- **Avoid concomitant ACE inhibitors**: Do not coadminister with ACE inhibitors within 36 hours [^f5aebba6].

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Sacubitril/valsartan vs ramipril (paradise-mi)** |
|-|-|
| Primary composite endpoint (CV death, HF hospitalization, outpatient HF) | HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.78–1.04); P = 0.17 (non-significant) |
| Cardiovascular death | No significant difference |
| All-cause mortality | No significant difference |
| Recurrent MI | No significant difference |
| Hypotension | 14.1% vs 9.5% (P < 0.001) |
| Drug discontinuation due to hypotension | 2.1% vs 0.7% (P < 0.001) |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

PARADISE-MI shows **no superiority of sacubitril/valsartan over ramipril** in high-risk post-MI patients, with more hypotension. ACE inhibitors remain first-line; reserve sacubitril/valsartan for chronic HFrEF or ACE inhibitor intolerance, and avoid early initiation within 36 hours of ACE inhibitor use [^cb29f132] [^f5aebba6].

Discussion

The results from our meta-analysis include: 1) a reduction in all-cause mortality in the combined HF population; 2) subgroup analysis revealed a reduction in all-cause mortality exclusively in the population with EF < 40%; 3) no significant difference in CV-related deaths was observed; 4) SAV significantly reduced HF readmission rates across all baseline EFs; and 5) comparative safety analysis between SAV and ACEI/ARB indicated general similarity, barring an increased incidence of hypotension in the SAV-treated cohort (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
Overall Outcomes When Sacubitril/Valsartan Is Compared to ACEI/ARB

CV = cardiovascular; HF = heart failure; RCT = randomized clinical trial; other abbreviations as in Figure 4.

This meta-analysis highlights the superiority of SAV over ACEI/ARB in reducing all-cause mortality in the group with an EF of < 40%. This translates into clinical practice as a strong indication to initiate SAV in newly diagnosed individuals with EF < 40%, and in those with a longstanding history of ACEI/ARB use, the need to overcome the inertia of transitioning to SAV. The PARADIGM-HF trial likely drove our result, as it was the only positive trial of 14. However, the studies with relatively larger sample sizes (PARADISE-MI [Prospective ARNI vs. ACE Inhibitor Trial to Determine Superiority in Reducing Heart Failure Events After Myocardial Infarction], PARAGON-HF [Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction]) showed a statistically nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality. Hence, the negative trials suggest they were likely underpowered to detect a difference. Another plausible explanation for this result could be the design of the PARADIGM-HF trial, which excluded patients with a < 3 months history of acute coronary event, only included 5.1% of Black participants, and excluded patients with severe pulmonary disease. It is not completely understood how SAV confers mortality benefits in HFrEF. Perhaps this stems from the pathophysiology of HF, which, while not mutually exclusive, may differ at some molecular level between those with EF < 40% and > 40%, which enables SAV to confer benefit. As noted in existing studies, as EF increases in HF, other extracardiac factors or comorbidities become more impactful in mortality outcomes. Clinically, EF should be treated as a continuum except within the 50% to 55% range.

### NT-proBNP in the early convalescent phase after high-risk myocardial infarction is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes: the PARADISE-MI trial [^43462b39]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is associated with heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and death when measured during a myocardial infarction (MI). However, NT-proBNP concentrations change following the initial ischemic insult and less is known about the prognostic importance of NT-proBNP in the early convalescent phase.

Methods

PARADISE-MI randomized 5661 patients with MI complicated by LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion to sacubitril/valsartan or ramipril. Patients with available week 2 NT-proBNP concentrations and without-incident HF between randomization and week 2 (n = 1062) were analyzed. Associations of week 2 NT-proBNP with subsequent clinical outcomes were evaluated in landmark analyses using Cox models adjusted for clinical characteristics, including LVEF, baseline NT-proBNP and atrial fibrillation.

Results

Median 2-week NT-proBNP concentration was 1391 [676–2507] ng/L. Patients in the highest NT-proBNP quartile (≥ 2507 ng/L) were older, had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), higher Killip class, and more atrial fibrillation. Higher NT-proBNP concentrations were independently associated with greater risk of cardiovascular death or incident HF (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.65 per doubling of NT-proBNP; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31–2.09), HF hospitalization (aHR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.38–2.54), recurrent myocardial infarction (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09–1.95) and all-cause death (aHR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.35–2.53).

Conclusions

Patients with elevated NT-proBNP concentrations approximately 2 weeks after a high-risk myocardial infarction are at heightened risk of incident HF, recurrent coronary events, and death independent of baseline NT-proBNP concentrations and clinical characteristics. Elevations in NT-proBNP concentrations in the early convalescent phase may assist in risk stratification and the identification of patients in need of more advanced preventive treatment approaches.

### Differences in characteristics and clinical outcomes according to age in patients following high-risk myocardial infarction: insights from PARADISE-MI [^70536fe2]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of coronary heart disease is increasing in an aging population. A better understanding of how risk profiles and outcomes differ by age may allow for targeted treatment and prevention strategies. PARADISE-MI randomized 5661 adults without prior heart failure (HF) to sacubitril/valsartan versus ramipril within 0.5 to 7 days of a MI complicated by pulmonary congestion and/or LVEF ≤ 40%. Associations between age and clinical outcomes were analyzed using Cox models, adjusted for potential confounders. Mean age was 63.7 ± 11.5 years. Patients aged ≥ 75 years (n = 1051, 18.6%) were more often women, had more atrial fibrillation and lower eGFR. They more commonly presented with non-ST-segment elevation MI and were less likely to receive primary reperfusion and guideline-based medical therapies. Age was associated with all-cause death (HR 1.54 per 10-year increase; 95% CI, 1.41–1.68) and was more strongly associated with non-CV death (HR 2.09; 95% CI, 1.70–2.56) than with CV death (HR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.29–1.57). Age was associated with incident HF (HR 1.37; 95% CI, 1.25–1.49) and stroke (HR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11–1.54). These risk relationships were similar after multivariable adjustment. The treatment effect of sacubitril/valsartan versus ramipril was not significantly modified by age (p-interaction = 0.19) and tolerability did not differ by treatment arm. In conclusion, the heightened risk of death, HF and stroke after MI with advancing age was not explained by differences in clinical characteristics. Older patients may require closer surveillance and more guidelines-based therapies after MI to mitigate the elevated risk of death and HF. Trial Registration: NCT02924727.

### Impact of sodium ‒ glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with recent versus previous myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^64f9fb6d]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Drugs widely known to reduce mortality in patients with HF, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists, have demonstrated benefits when started in the acute phase of MI, whereas others, such as sacubitril-valsartan, have not, raising concerns about the optimal timing for initiating SGLT2 inhibitors after MI at high risk of developing HF. Patients with a history of previous MI may exhibit distinct baseline characteristics and risk profiles compared with those experiencing recent MI, which can lead to variability in treatment responses. However, including patients with both recent and previous MI can increase the generalizability of the findings, as they mirror real-world clinical scenarios where patients often present with diverse histories of CV events. Although patients who experienced recent MI may be at greater risk for developing CV death and HF events, our analysis demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors were also effective in lowering HF hospitalization rates in patients with previous MI (p = 0.56). This approach highlights the potential importance of early intervention, suggesting that incorporating SGLT2 inhibitors into the treatment plans of patients with a history of prior MI may contribute to improved long-term CV health. Our TSA analysis indicated that our meta-analysis met the RIS, supporting the robustness of our findings.

A limitation of previous studies is the lack of data regarding the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients without T2DM. Only 3 out of 10 studies in our meta-analysis included patients without T2DM. The DAPA-AMI trial, which included 4017 patients without T2DM and high CV risk, reported similar hospitalization for HF rates in dapagliflozin and placebo groups (1.3% vs 1.6%; RR 0.83 95% CI 0.5, 1.39). These findings were not consistent with those of a subgroup analysis of patients with (HR 0.91 95% CI 0.63, 1.32) and without diabetes (HR 0.68 95% CI 0.50, 0.93) in the EMPACT-MI trial. Therefore, we performed a subgroup analysis of HF hospitalization by comparing patients with and without T2DM. Our results suggested similar efficacy for both subgroups when treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. However, our TSA results suggested that, in patients without -T2DM, the conventional boundary for RIS was not met, requiring a larger sample size in this subgroup to confirm our findings. This suggests that additional data are needed to confirm the positive trend and draw a definitive conclusion for patients without T2DM.

### Sacubitril / valsartan partially alleviates myocardial infarction injury by activating the FGF21 signaling pathway via PPARs [^607aeaaa]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains a significant global health burden, accounting for approximately one-third of clinical deaths in developed nations and standing as the primary cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. AMI often leads to heart failure, arrhythmias, and various other comorbidities, necessitating multifaceted treatment strategies to mitigate the risk of cardiac death and post-infarction complications. Among these strategies, reperfusion therapy and pharmacological interventions are paramount in the management of AMI. While reperfusion therapy has gained widespread clinical acceptance, pharmacological treatments remain equally crucial.

Recently, the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) Sacubitril/Valsartan (Sac/Val) has garnered increasing interest in treating cardiac diseases. Although no statistical difference was achieved for the primary trial outcome in the PARADISE-MI trial, the risk of the primary endpoint events (cardiovascular death, first heart failure hospitalization, and outpatient progression to heart failure) was reduced by 10% in the ARNI group compared with the ramipril group. Thus Sac/Val remains an excellent drug for improving myocardial infarction. In other heart diseases, several animal studies have also shown promising cardioprotective effects of Sac/Val post-MI. However, the underlying mechanisms of how Sac/Val ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and oxidative stress following MI remain under-explored, necessitating further investigation.

### Sex differences in cardiac structure and function following acute myocardial infarction: insights from the PARADISE-MI echocardiographic substudy [^53278b0d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The incidence of heart failure hospitalization is higher in women than in men after myocardial infarction (MI). Sex-related differences in left ventricular (LV) remodelling may contribute to the differences in post-MI outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences in echocardiographic parameters post-MI, and whether the relationship between echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcomes differs by sex.

Methods and Results

In the PARADISE-MI trial, patients were randomized to sacubitril/valsartan or ramipril within 0.5 to 7days of high-risk MI. In the pre-specified echocardiographic substudy, 544 patients underwent echocardiography at the time of randomization and after 8months. We compared key echocardiographic parameters in men and women and their association with primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death or incident heart failure). At baseline, women had higher LV ejection fraction (LVEF), lower LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index, LV end-systolic volume (LVESV) index, and LV mass index. After adjusting for baseline clinical differences, changes in these echocardiographic parameters from baseline to 8months were not significantly different in women versus men. Lower LVEF, higher LVEDV, LVESV, left atrial volume index, and average E/e' were associated with a higher risk of the primary composite outcome. Sex did not modify the relationship between echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Despite baseline differences in measures of cardiac function between men and women following acute high-risk MI, there were no significant sex-related changes in chamber size or LV function. Sex did not modify the association between echocardiographic parameters and clinical outcome.

### Sacubitril / valsartan partially alleviates myocardial infarction injury by activating the FGF21 signaling pathway via PPARs [^b1bd139a]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the PARADISE-MI trial, the risk of the primary endpoint events (cardiovascular death, first heart failure hospitalization, and outpatient progression to heart failure) was reduced by 10% in the ARNI group compared with the ramipril group. Thus Sac/Val remains an excellent drug for improving myocardial infarction. Despite the clinical proficiency demonstrated by Sac/Val, a comprehensive elucidation of its underlying molecular mechanisms at the cellular level remains elusive. FGF21, initially identified as a modulator of glucolipid metabolism and insulin secretion, has garnered increasing attention in subsequent clinical studies. These investigations have revealed that FGF21 binds to FGFR1 in the heart, exhibiting autocrine or paracrine properties, and emerges as a promising biomarker for predicting cardiovascular diseases, such as AMI and coronary artery disease. Moreover, FGF21 exhibits potential therapeutic value in the prevention and rehabilitation of cardiovascular pathologies. The objective of the present study was to delve into the potential of Sac/Val to function as an agonist of FGF21, thereby mitigating the severity of MI.

### Association between body mass index and clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction and reduced systolic function: analysis of PARADISE-MI trial data [^9b9c7936]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The Prospective ARNI versus ACE Inhibitor Trial to Determine Superiority in Reducing HF Events after Myocardial Infarction (PARADISE‐MI)was a double‐blind, active‐controlled, randomized clinical trial designed to determine whether sacubitril/valsartan was superior to ramipril in improving the outcomes of patients with pre‐defined 'high‐risk' AMI characteristics (online supplementary Table S1). The current work is a post‐hoc analysis of PARADISE‐MI trial datadesigned to characterize the BMI distribution and its relationship with clinical outcomes in patients with AMI and pulmonary congestion and/or systolic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%. The second aim was to assess whether BMI impacted the effect of sacubitril/valsartan versus ramipril treatment.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cb29f132]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with heart failure (HF) or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% — either an oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be initiated in appropriate patients with AMI, and in patients with AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% and HF symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist reduced all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and should be given in the absence of advanced chronic kidney disease, hyperkalemia, or other contraindication. In patients early after MI with LVEF ≤ 40% and/or pulmonary congestion, sacubitril-valsartan did not significantly reduce cardiovascular death or incident HF compared with an ACEi, hypotensive events were more common, and initiation of this combination agent early after MI appears safe if treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction is planned. Concomitant initiation of both an ACEi and ARB in patients with AMI should be avoided due to an increase in adverse events without added benefit compared with either drug alone. In EPHESUS, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone reduced both all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in patients with AMI with LVEF < 40% who also had symptoms of HF and/or diabetes mellitus; evidence-based therapy use at enrollment was 86% for ACEi or ARB and 75% for a beta blocker, and patients with serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL or serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L were excluded. Supporting evidence includes an individual-patient meta-analysis of 98 496 patients with AMI reporting a 30-day mortality rate of 7.1% with ACEi compared with 7.6% with placebo (proportion reduction, 7% [95% CI, 2–11]; P = 0.004), and a trial of 1012 patients with acute STEMI without a history of HF in which eplerenone reduced the primary end point but the benefit was largely driven by a reduction in natriuretic peptides.

### Initiating empagliflozin and sacubitril / valsartan early after acute myocardial infarction: mechanistic study [^869fc40f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Research Perspectives

Despite improvements in reperfusion strategies and pharmacological advancements, morbidity and death remain significant after myocardial infarction (MI). Death during the chronic phase of MI is primarily associated with left ventricular (LV) adverse remodeling and the development of heart failure (HF) and ventricular arrhythmias (VAs).

Post‐MI cardiac remodeling is a complex process. Following MI, the injured myocardium triggers an acute inflammatory reaction, characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines and the subsequent infiltration of leukocytes into the myocardium. The first inflammatory peak evolves into a reparatory phase characterized by collagen deposition and scar formation. Although the scar maintains cardiac structural integrity, it also leads to adverse structural and electrical cardiac remodeling, contributing to cardiac dysfunction and VAs.

Recently, the introduction of new drugs such as sacubitril/valsartan and empagliflozin has markedly improved clinical outcomes in patients with HF. Sacubitril/valsartan inhibits the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and preserves endogenous natriuretic peptides from degradation, modulating systemic inflammation and enhancing favorable LV remodeling and myocardial fibrosis. Empagliflozin is a sodium/glucose cotransporter inhibitor (SGLT2i) and has demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, including reductions in cardiovascular death and recurrent HF hospitalizations in patients with HF. These effects are attributed to modulating inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, altering cardiac metabolism, and improving LV remodeling.

Both drugs have the potential to prevent arrhythmic events, with a reduction in sudden cardiac death and VA burden with sacubitril/valsartan, and in atrial fibrillation with the SGLT2i. The role of empagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan in HF thus is already established, but their efficacy in postacute MI remains largely unexplored. Recently published results of the EMPACT‐MI (Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial indicate that compared with placebo, empagliflozin after MI decreased the risk of first and total hospitalizations for HF, although it did not reduce the combined primary end point of HF hospitalization or all‐cause death. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of empagliflozin following MI is understudied, and its potential synergistic effect with sacubitril/valsartan remains unknown.

The aim of this post‐MI model study was to evaluate the impact of early administration of empagliflozin, with or without sacubitril/valsartan, on inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic changes, cardiac structural and electrical remodeling, and the likelihood of VAs.

### Sacubitril and valsartan [^e33ed50e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The population was 66% Caucasian, 18% Asian, and 5% Black; the mean age was 64 years and 78% were male. At randomization, 70% of patients were NYHA Class II, 24% were NYHA Class III, and 0.7% were NYHA Class IV. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29%. The underlying cause of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 60% of patients; 71% had a history of hypertension, 43% had a history of myocardial infarction, 37% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 35% had diabetes mellitus. Most patients were taking beta-blockers (94%), mineralocorticoid antagonists (58%), and diuretics (82%). Few patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (15%).

### Reconsidering sacubitril / valsartan dose strategies in HFrEF: evidence and implications from real-world practice-mini-review [^9269faa7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its central role in the management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the real-world use of sacubitril/valsartan remains fraught with uncertainty-particularly regarding optimal dosing. While guidelines emphasize uptitration to trial-validated target doses, emerging evidence suggests that submaximal doses may offer comparable clinical benefit across diverse patient populations. This commentary highlights the critical gap between randomized controlled trials and everyday practice, where comorbidities and tolerability frequently limit dose escalation. We synthesize key real-world studies that demonstrate consistent outcomes at lower or intermediate doses and challenge the prevailing "as high as tolerated" paradigm. Furthermore, we argue for a shift toward response-guided titration strategies based on biomarkers and functional outcomes, rather than rigid pharmacologic benchmarks. Recognizing the limitations of guideline rigidity, we advocate for a more nuanced, patient-centered approach to heart failure pharmacotherapy-one that prioritizes clinical effectiveness, safety, and individualized care-presented as a brief non-systematic narrative mini-review. In a nationwide HFrEF cohort (n = 3953), the adjusted risk of the composite of heart failure hospitalization or all-cause mortality did not differ across average-dose tertiles (highest vs lowest: HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74–1.06). Conversely, a multicenter cohort (n = 652) showed lower all-cause mortality at 49/51 and 97/103 mg twice daily versus 24/26 mg (24/26 vs 49/51 mg: HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07–2.59), suggesting that the most consistent gains occur when escalating from very-low to intermediate doses, with heterogeneous incremental benefit beyond that.

### Association between body mass index and clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction and reduced systolic function: analysis of PARADISE-MI trial data [^cb69cc56]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Demographics, race and ethnicity may impact adverse BMI‐associated CV outcomes. There has been controversy regarding the possibility of a geographic region effect. The current Z‐score analysis investigated a potential association between BMI and clinical outcomes in five UN‐defined geographic regions previously compared in the PARADISE‐MI, i.e. Asia/Pacific, Central Europe, Latin America, North America and Western Europe. A statistically significant, generally U‐shaped, relationship was identified, with the lowest event rates observed in the groups that were most normal relative to their region.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of ARNI compared to ramipril across various BMI categories in patients with AMI. Our findings revealed no significant interaction between BMI and the effectiveness of ARNI versus ramipril in reducing primary composite outcomes or secondary endpoints. Additionally, no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events were noted across the BMI subgroups.

While ARNI has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in HF patients, particularly in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM‐HF) trial, evidence specific to BMI subgroups remains limited. The PARADIGM‐HF trial demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan was superior to enalapril in reducing the risk of CV death and HF hospitalization, but the study did not focus explicitly on stratifying results by BMI categories. Similarly, the PARADISE‐MI trial compared ARNI to ramipril in post‐AMI patients, but subgroup analysis based on BMI was not a primary focus. On the other hand, ramipril has been extensively studied in the context of CV risk reduction, notably in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial. However, the impact of BMI on ramipril efficacy remains underexplored. Most studies involving ramipril have not systematically evaluated its efficacy across varying BMI subgroups, limiting the ability to draw clear conclusions about the drug performance in patients with higher or lower BMI.

### Empagliflozin to prevent worsening of left ventricular volumes and systolic function after myocardial infarction (EMPRESS-MI) [^2afa0869]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The development of heart failure following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. As such, the prevention of heart failure is an important therapeutic goal. Progressive adverse ventricular remodelling, characterized by ventricular dilatation and declining systolic function, is the precursor to heart failure after MI. Early reperfusion therapy and some of the drugs that reduce the risk of mortality and heart failure following MI prevent progressive adverse remodelling (e.g. angiotensin‐converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB], and beta‐blockers). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) eplerenone improved outcomes following MI, however was found to have a significant anti‐remodelling effect only after adjustment for baseline covariates. Sacubitril/valsartan did not reduce the risk of incident heart failure or cardiovascular mortality in high‐risk patients following MI and had a minimal anti‐remodelling effect.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of worsening heart failure and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure across the full spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). One of the mechanisms of action underlying the clinical benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a beneficial remodelling effect. Recently, the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin did not reduce the risk of the primary outcome of heart failure hospitalization or all‐cause mortality in high‐risk patients following acute MI. However, empagliflozin did reduce the risk of first and total heart failure hospitalizations and adverse heart failure events. Whether this is related to a beneficial remodelling effect is unknown. In lower risk post‐MI patients, dapagliflozin improved cardiometabolic outcomes, but not the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization.

We designed the EMpagliflozin to PREvent worSening of left ventricular volumes and Systolic function after Myocardial Infarction (EMPRESS‐MI) randomized, placebo‐controlled trial to test the hypothesis that empagliflozin, in addition to standard of care, would attenuate adverse left ventricular remodelling measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in high‐risk patients following acute MI.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Dosing in clinical trials was based on the total amount of both components of sacubitril and valsartan, i.e., 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg were referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, respectively.

14.1 Adult Heart Failure

PARADIGM-HF PARADIGM-HF was a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing sacubitril and valsartan and enalapril in 8,442 adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (NYHA class II–IV) and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%). Patients had to have been on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least four weeks and on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg at screening were excluded.

The primary objective of PARADIGM-HF was to determine whether sacubitril and valsartan, a combination of sacubitril and an RAS inhibitor (valsartan), was superior to an RAS inhibitor (enalapril) alone in reducing the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF).

After discontinuing their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, patients entered sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received enalapril 10 mg twice-daily, followed by sacubitril and valsartan 100 mg twice-daily, increasing to 200 mg twice daily. Patients who successfully completed the sequential run-in periods were randomized to receive either sacubitril and valsartan 200 mg (N = 4,209) twice-daily or enalapril 10 mg (N = 4,233) twice-daily. The primary endpoint was the first event in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for HF. The median follow-up duration was 27 months and patients were treated for up to 4.3 years.

### Sacubitril and valsartan (Entresto) [^92bcbc67]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The population was 81% Caucasian, 13% Asian, and 2% Black; the mean age was 73 years and 52% were female. At randomization, 77% of patients were NYHA Class II, 19% were NYHA Class III, and 0.4% were NYHA Class IV. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was 57%. The underlying cause of heart failure was of ischemic etiology in 36% of patients. Furthermore, 96% had a history of hypertension, 23% had a history of myocardial infarction, 46% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², and 43% had diabetes mellitus. Most patients were taking beta-blockers (80%) and diuretics (95%).

PARAGON-HF demonstrated that ENTRESTO had a numerical reduction in the rate of the composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations and CV death, based on an analysis using a proportional rates model (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI [0.75, 1.01], p = 0.06); see Table 5. The treatment effect was primarily driven by the reduction in total HF hospitalizations in patients randomized to ENTRESTO (RR 0.85; 95% CI [0.72, 1.00]).

Figure 5 shows the mean number of composite endpoint events of total HF hospitalizations and CV death over time.

### In-hospital or out-of-hospital initiation of sacubitril / valsartan versus valsartan in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction after A worsening heart failure event: the PARAGLIDE-HF trial [^730522e2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this predefined subgroup analysis of the PARAGLIDE‐HF trial, 324 (69.5%) patients were initiated in‐hospital, whereas 142 (30.5%) were initiated out‐of‐hospital. Compared with Val, the initiation of Sac/Val was well tolerated regardless of the location of initiation. Sac/Val showed a consistently greater reduction of NT‐proBNP compared with Val, irrespective of the timing and location of initiation relative to the qualifying WHF event. Likewise, the win ratio analyses numerically favored treatment with Sac/Val compared with Val. Moreover, tolerability and target dose reached was consistent with Sac/Val regardless of location of initiation.

Prior evidence has shown 30‐day readmission and mortality rates following HF hospitalization of approximately 25% and 10%, respectively. Unfortunately, limited evidence‐based strategies are available to reduce postdischarge outcomes in patients hospitalized for HF. However, a strong association between in‐hospital initiation of guideline‐recommended therapy and reduced the risk of readmission and mortality has been shown. As such, a post hoc analyses of PARAGON‐HF revealed that initiating treatment with Sac/Val early postdischarge was linked to a greater reduction in the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death in patients with HF with an EF ≥ 45%. The lack of significant interactions by location of initiation on treatment outcomes in the current data set highlights the potential of initiating Sac/Val in‐hospital for those with EF > 40%, while being mindful of the limited power for interaction testing resulting from the modest sample size in the current data set.

PARAGON-HF

PARAGON-HF, was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ENTRESTO and valsartan in 4,796 adult patients with symptomatic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%, and structural heart disease [either left atrial enlargement (LAE) or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)]. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 mmHg and patients with any prior echocardiographic LVEF less than 40% at screening were excluded.

The primary objective of PARAGON-HF was to determine whether ENTRESTO reduced the rate of the composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular (CV) death.

After discontinuing their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, patients entered sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received valsartan 80 mg twice-daily, followed by ENTRESTO 100 mg twice-daily. Patients on prior low doses of an ACEi or ARB began the run-in period receiving valsartan 40 mg twice-daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Patients who successfully completed the sequential run-in periods were randomized to receive either ENTRESTO 200 mg (N = 2,419) twice-daily or valsartan 160 mg (N = 2,403) twice-daily. The median follow-up duration was 35 months and patients were treated for up to 4.7 years.

Clinical Question Bottom Line Synopsis The investigators identified adults, 45 years and older, with symptomatic heart failure, elevated NT-proBNP levels, NYHA class II through IV, a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40%, and an impaired health-related quality of life as measured by a standard scoring tool. Patients taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker at baseline were required to have a history of hypertension. Eligible participants were initially assigned to one of three strata based on medication prescribed by their treating clinician: ACE inhibitor, ARB, or no RAS inhibitor. Within each stratum, patients randomly received sacubitril/valsartan or the background medication. Clinicians were instructed to up-titrate within four weeks to the maximally tolerated doses.

Patients, clinicians, and individuals assessing outcomes remained masked to treatment group assignment. Complete follow-up occurred for more than 99% of patients at 24 weeks. Using intention-to-treat analysis, patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group had a significantly greater reduction in NT-proBNP levels than the combined comparator group. However, at 24 weeks, no group differences occurred in median change from baseline in the six-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or improvement in NYHA class. Adverse events, including hypotension, albuminuria, and hyperkalemia, occurred more often in the sacubitril/valsartan group.

The VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion trial (VALIANT) was a randomized, controlled, multinational, double-blind study in 14,703 patients with acute myocardial infarction and either heart failure (signs, symptoms or radiological evidence) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction ≤ 40% by radionuclide ventriculography or ≤ 35% by echocardiography or ventricular contrast angiography). Patients were randomized within 12 hours to 10 days after the onset of myocardial infarction symptoms to one of three treatment groups: valsartan (titrated from 20 or 40 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 160 mg twice daily), the ACE inhibitor, captopril (titrated from 6.25 mg three times daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 50 mg three times daily), or the combination of valsartan plus captopril. In the combination group, the dose of valsartan was titrated from 20 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose up to a maximum of 80 mg twice daily; the dose of captopril was the same as for monotherapy. The population studied was 69% male, 94% Caucasian, and 53% were 65 years of age or older. Baseline therapy included aspirin (91%), beta-blockers (70%), ACE inhibitors (40%), thrombolytics (35%) and statins (34%). The mean treatment duration was 2 years. The mean daily dose of valsartan in the monotherapy group was 217 mg.

Statistical Analysis

Baseline characteristics of study participants are summarized according to location of initiation. Categorical variables are described with counts (percentages), and continuous variables are represented as median (25th–75th percentiles), unless stated otherwise.

Participants were included in the analysis based on their assigned treatment group following randomization adhering to the intent‐to‐treat principle. The primary outcome, the time‐averaged proportional change of NT‐proBNP from baseline, was examined using an analysis of covariance model that incorporated data from weeks 4 and 8. This method was used to compare the efficacy of the 2 treatments, Sac/Val versus Val, administered in 2 distinct settings (in‐hospital and out‐of‐hospital); thus, outcomes between patients randomized in‐hospital versus out‐of‐hospital were not assessed in this analysis. The model included treatment group, location of initiation, sex, and baseline EF (less than or equal to median, greater than median) as fixed‐effect factors. Additionally, age and the logarithmic baseline NT‐proBNP were incorporated as covariates along with the interaction of treatment by location of initiation. The estimated treatment effect in terms of ratios of geometric means, based on the least‐squares means from the model, and the corresponding 2‐sided 95% CIs were presented by initiation of location. To evaluate the potential impact of missing NT‐proBNP data on the time‐averaged proportional change from baseline to weeks 4 and 8, baseline characteristics were reported for those with missing and nonmissing NT‐proBNP data.

### Initiating empagliflozin and sacubitril / valsartan early after acute myocardial infarction: mechanistic study [^0adb615e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Early initiation of empagliflozin after MI exerts an acute immunomodulatory effect, modulates NO bioavailability and collagen composition of the scar, and increases cardioprotective lipid levels in the liver, without affecting cardiac function and VA inducibility. Combined treatment with empagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan promotes a reduction in collagen I and the collagen I/III ratio in the scar, stimulates favorable electrical and structural remodeling, and leads to reduced VT inducibility post‐MI.

Study Limitations

The study has several limitations that may impact its generalizability and translational relevance. First, the lack of clinical end points in the empagliflozin group and the relatively short follow‐up period (30 days) limit the applicability of the findings to long‐term clinical outcomes, such as death or hospitalization. Second, the use of a nonreperfused MI model, while useful for investigating fibrosis, cardiac remodeling, and VAs, does not align with current clinical practice, where reperfusion is the standard of care. Third, animals received only BB as baseline HF treatment, and it is unclear how the addition of other standard medications might have influenced the results. Finally, the subgroup analysis by sex was limited by the small sample size per group, reducing the statistical power to detect sex‐specific differences.

### Valsartan oral (valsartan) [^25ba195c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint was time to all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included (1) time to cardiovascular (CV) mortality, and (2) time to the first event of cardiovascular mortality, reinfarction, or hospitalization for heart failure. The results are summarized in the following table.

There was no difference in overall mortality among the three treatment groups. There was thus no evidence that combining the ACE inhibitor captopril and the angiotensin II blocker valsartan was of value.

The data were assessed to see whether the effectiveness of valsartan could be demonstrated by showing in a non-inferiority analysis that it preserved a fraction of the effect of captopril, a drug with a demonstrated survival effect in this setting. A conservative estimate of the effect of captopril (based on a pooled analysis of 3 post-infarction studies of captopril and 2 other ACE inhibitors) was a 14% to 16% reduction in mortality compared to placebo. Valsartan would be considered effective if it preserved a meaningful fraction of that effect and unequivocally preserved some of that effect. As shown in the table, the upper bound of the CI for the hazard ratio (valsartan/captopril) for overall or CV mortality is 1.09 to 1.11, a difference of about 9% to 11%, thus making it unlikely that valsartan has less than about half of the estimated effect of captopril and clearly demonstrating an effect of valsartan. The other secondary endpoints were consistent with this conclusion.

There were no clear differences in all-cause mortality based on age, gender, race, or baseline therapies, as shown in the figure above.

### Comprehensive analysis of the effects of sacubitril / valsartan according to sex among patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in PARADIGM-HF [^9c82d6d4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with heart failure (HF) ejection fraction appeared to respond more favorably to sacubitril/valsartan, compared with valsartan, than men in PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction), driven by a greater reduction in total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations. Sex-specific efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan in PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) remain unreported.

Methods and Results

This post hoc analysis of PARADIGM-HF examined sex-based outcomes in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction randomized to sacubitril/valsartan or enalapril. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. Secondary and exploratory efficacy outcomes, biomarker changes, and safety outcomes were also assessed. Among 8399 participants, 1832 (21.8%) were women. Women were older, had worse New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores, more symptoms of HF, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, yet had lower rates of HF hospitalization (and other worsening of HF) and cardiovascular death than men. Compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan reduced the risk of the primary end point to a similar extent in both sexes: hazard ratios, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.62–0.94) in women and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.73–0.89) in men (P -interaction = 0.62). Results were consistent for the individual components of the primary outcome. The rate ratio for total HF hospitalizations was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48–0.89) in women and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.69–0.94) in men (P -interaction = 0.25). Randomized treatment discontinuation and adverse effects of interest were similar in women and men.

Conclusions

In PARADIGM-HF, sacubitril/valsartan, compared with enalapril, reduced the risk of HF hospitalizations, death from cardiovascular causes, and death from any cause similarly in women and men with HF with reduced ejection fraction. In addition, sacubitril/valsartan was safe and well tolerated, irrespective of sex.

### Initiating empagliflozin and sacubitril / valsartan early after acute myocardial infarction: mechanistic study [^7b908b68]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Empagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan are established in heart failure treatment, but their effects after myocardial infarction (MI) are less clear. This study evaluated early empagliflozin initiation, with or without sacubitril/valsartan, on post-MI inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolism, fibrosis, cardiac function, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) risk in a pig model.

Methods

A total of 24 of 30 pigs survived the MI procedure and were subsequently randomized to receive beta-blocker treatment alone (control-MI), beta-blocker+empagliflozin, or beta-blocker+empagliflozin+sacubitril/valsartan. Immune response, metabolic profile, and cardiac function were monitored. At 30days after MI, programmed electrical stimulation and high-density mapping were performed and VT inducibility was assessed. Tissue samples were collected for cardiac inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic analyses.

Results

Empagliflozin reduced circulating leukocytes at 2 and 15days after MI (P = 0.010 and P = 0.050, respectively) and decreased C-C chemokine receptor 2+ monocytes at 15days (P = 0.049). Nitric oxide bioavailability increased in remote myocardium (P = 0.059), along with cardioprotective liver lipids and collagen III in the myocardial scar (P = 0.023). No effect on cardiac function or VT inducibility was observed at 30days. With empagliflozin+sacubitril/valsartan, scar collagen I decreased (P = 0.082), left ventricular compliance improved (P = 0.029), electrophysiological remodeling improved (reduced border-zone corridors [P = 0.006] and deceleration zones [P = 0.008]), and VT inducibility decreased (P = 0.025).

Conclusions

In this pig model of nonreperfused MI treated with beta-blocker, early initiation of empagliflozin reduced inflammation, improved nitric oxide bioavailability, increased protective liver lipids, and modified scar composition without affecting cardiac function or VT risk. With empagliflozin+sacubitril/valsartan treatment, scar collagen I and VT inducibility declined and left ventricular remodeling was enhanced.

### Empagliflozin to prevent worsening of left ventricular volumes and systolic function after myocardial infarction (EMPRESS-MI) [^14ca7122]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The neutral findings of this trial should be seen in the context of previous trials that have examined the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients following MI. The EMMY (EMpagliflozin in patients with acute MYocardial infarction) trial randomized 476 patients to empagliflozin or placebo within 72 h of PCI for an acute MI with creatine kinase > 800 IU/L or a troponin > 10 times higher than the upper local laboratory limit of normal. There was no eligibility requirement for either elevated left ventricular volumes or low LVEF. In EMMY, empagliflozin reduced the primary endpoint of NT‐proBNP, increased LVEF measured using echocardiography by 1.5%, and reduced both LVESVI and LVEDVI by 3.2 ml/m² and 3.9 ml/m², respectively. Several features point to the EMMY cohort being at a lower risk of progressive adverse remodelling than that recruited in EMPRESS‐MI; in EMMY the ventricular volumes were almost half of those in EMPRESS‐MI, LVEF was substantially higher (49% vs. 36% in the placebo group) and baseline troponin T and NT‐proBNP were lower than in EMPRESS‐MI. Indeed, in the recent EMPACT‐MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, the rate of heart failure hospitalization in patients with an LVEF > 45% was around a third of that of those with LVEF < 35%. Despite this, the pattern of remodelling was divergent between EMMY and EMPRESS‐MI; in EMMY there was evidence of progressive adverse remodelling with an increase in LVESVI and LVEDVI in the placebo group by 2.3 ml/m² and 7.1 ml/m², respectively. Why there is such an apparent discordance between the trajectory of ventricular remodelling in the two trials (and PARADISE‐MI) is unclear. The background use of evidence‐based pharmacologic therapy was similar and other characteristics known to be associated with the risk of progressive adverse remodelling and risk of incident heart failure such as age, sex and a history of diabetes were similar between EMMY and EMPRESS‐MI. One potential explanation is that there was a substantial difference between the trials in the time from MI to the assessment of LVEF (potentially resulting in less reversible myocardial stunning in EMMY), however this was not recorded in EMMY. Given the presence of a significant treatment effect of empagliflozin on attenuating progressive remodelling in EMMY, and the absence of such an effect in EMPRESS‐MI, then it is possible that empagliflozin has favourable effects on left ventricular structure and function when added to standard of care in patients in whom the natural history is one of progressive adverse remodelling. However, that clinical course and treatment effect was not observed in EMPRESS‐MI.

### Initiating empagliflozin and sacubitril / valsartan early after acute myocardial infarction: mechanistic study [^eb022846]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammasomes are large multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes that play a crucial role in the acute MI inflammation process, activating release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL‐1β and IL‐18, which are involved in IL‐1 receptor activation. IL‐1 receptor activation is linked to inflammation and results in cardiomyocyte apoptosis via caspase‐1–dependent death (pyroptosis), contributing to adverse cardiac remodeling and post‐MI HF development. The IL‐1 pathway represents a potential target for interventions to modulate the post‐MI inflammatory response. Different recombinant IL‐1 receptor antagonists have been developed that yield improvements in post‐MI healing and prevent adverse remodeling, as well as HF progression. Our results suggest that empagliflozin could attenuate inflammasome activation, with a remarkable trend toward reduced IL‐1β and IL‐18 and increased secretion of an antagonist of IL‐1R (IL‐1Ra). This effect also has been reported in other preclinical, and clinicalstudies, in HF and cardiotoxicity scenarios, constituting one of the proposed mechanisms of action of empagliflozin in inflammatory pathways. Although we did not observe further immunomodulatory effects in our swine experimental model, other studies have shown additional anti‐inflammatory effects of empagliflozin, including reductions in inflammatory C‐reactive protein, IL‐6, TNF‐α, monocyte‐chemotactic protein‐1, and interferon‐γ, as well as decreased macrophage infiltration in the heart.

The reason for the lack of these anti‐inflammatory effects in the combined treatment group (empagliflozin+sacubitril/valsartan) is unclear. In a previous study, we found that sacubitril/valsartan alone exerted an acute anti‐inflammatory response after MI, and we thus predicted a more powerful anti‐inflammatory effect in the combined group. Given that empagliflozin and sacubitril/valsartan target different pathways, a negative synergistic effect between them seems unlikely. Future studies are needed to elucidate this finding.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% — angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) outcomes and exclusions are as follows: Randomized trials show a reduction in all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with ACEi addition in AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% and anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and an individual-patient meta-analysis of 98 496 AMI patients showed survival benefit with greatest absolute benefit in hypertension, diabetes, and anterior STEMI. In VALIANT, an ARB was statistically noninferior to an ACEi and all-cause death rates were similar, whereas concomitant ACEi+ARB initiation in AMI should be avoided due to increased adverse events without added benefit. In EPHESUS, eplerenone reduced all-cause death and MACE during a mean follow-up of 16 months in AMI with LVEF ≤ 40% with heart failure (HF) symptoms and/or diabetes mellitus, with high background therapy use (86% ACEi/ARB and 75% beta blocker at enrollment) and exclusion of advanced chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL) or hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L). In 1012 acute STEMI patients without prior HF, eplerenone reduced the primary endpoint versus placebo, largely driven by natriuretic peptide reduction. An ACEi collaborative meta-analysis of 98 496 AMI patients reported 30-day mortality 7.1% with ACEi versus 7.6% with placebo (proportion reduction, 7% [95% CI, 2–11]; P = 0.004), with benefit irrespective of baseline risk, and ACEi reduced nonfatal cardiac failure versus placebo.

### Sacubitril / valsartan and prevention of cardiac dysfunction during adjuvant breast cancer therapy: the PRADA II randomized clinical trial [^40d05892]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

The enzyme neprilysin contributes to the degradation of natriuretic peptides and would therefore be expected to result in increased circulating concentrations of BNP. In PRADA II, the concentrations of NT-proBNP, which is degraded via mechanisms other than neprilysin, were measured. Accordingly, the NT-proBNP concentration changes observed should be interpreted in the context of myocardial stress and not as secondary to pharmaceutical interference with NT-proBNP degradation. Although the NT-proBNP results are encouraging, a central question is whether the observed effects can be considered clinically relevant. Given that the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology recently stated that an NT-proBNP concentration > 75 ng/L in asymptomatic patients 50 to 75 years of age with risk factors means "rule in" for "heart stress", an increase in mean NT-proBNP concentration in the placebo group from 61 to 94 ng/L and an absolute between-group difference in change in NT-proBNP of 38 ng/L appears to be clinically relevant. The current NT-proBNP result, combined with the apparent prevention of the reduction in echocardiographic left ventricular global longitudinal strain and attenuation of the increase in cardiac troponin I, suggests that sacubitril/valsartan may prevent chronic cardiac injury and stress induced by anthracyclines and potentially reduces the risk of transition from stage A to B heart failure. These observations appear to contrast with findings of recent randomized clinical trials of angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. No significant effect of sacubitril/valsartan on cardiac troponin T concentration was observed. The reason for the different effect on cardiac troponin T and I is unclear but may be related to the stronger association between cardiac troponin I and changes in cardiac structure and functionand its apparent higher degree of cardiac specificity.

### Race in heart Failure: a pooled participant-level analysis of the global PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF trials [^f6cc062d]. JACC: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanisms of disease pathobiology, prognosis, and potentially treatment responses might vary by race in patients with heart failure (HF).

Objectives

The authors aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan among patients with HF by self-reported race.

Methods

PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) and PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HF With Preserved Ejection Fraction) were global, randomized clinical trials testing sacubitril/valsartan against a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) (enalapril or valsartan, respectively) in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% (PARADIGM-HF) or left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% (PARAGON-HF). Patients with self-reported race were categorized as White, Asian, or Black. We assessed the composite of first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death, its components, and angioedema across races.

Results

Among 12,097 participants, 9,451 (78.1%) were White, 2,116 (17.5%) were Asian, and 530 (4.4%) were Black. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, Black (adjusted HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.42–1.98) and Asian patients (adjusted HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.18–1.47) experienced higher risks of the primary outcome compared with White patients. Treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan vs RASi on the primary endpoint were consistent among White (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.77–0.91), Asian (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.78–1.10), and Black patients (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58–1.07; P interaction = 0.58). Rates of severe angioedema were higher with sacubitril/valsartan vs RASi (White: 0.2% vs 0.1%; Black: 1.5% vs 0.0%; Asian: 0.1% vs 0.1%).

Conclusions

In a pooled experience of 2 global trials, Black and Asian patients exhibited a higher risk of cardiovascular events than White patients. The benefits of sacubitril/valsartan were consistent across races. Risks of severe angioedema were low but numerically higher with sacubitril/valsartan.

### Valsartan oral (valsartan) [^57ff2993]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Valsartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and children six years and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including the class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials in hypertensive patients demonstrating risk reduction with valsartan.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Valsartan may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Prevention of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction [^7cca0327]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

This Series paper highlights the substantial progress made in understanding and preventing heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Improving global standards of care for management of acute myocardial infarction with timelier reperfusion has led to stepwise reductions in risk of incident heart failure. Landmark clinical trials have established the role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, β blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to specifically reduce the risk of incident heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, residual risk of heart failure persists in many individuals, even after revascularisation and standard medical therapies. We review recent epidemiological trends from the past four decades, evolving understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying incident heart failure, and modern risk stratification tools. We then propose a treatment pathway tailored to individual patient risk and discuss potential future strategies to incrementally improve the risk of development of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

5.3 Hypotension

Sacubitril and valsartan lowers blood pressure and may cause symptomatic hypotension [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients (e.g., those being treated with high doses of diuretics), are at greater risk. Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of sacubitril and valsartan or start at a lower dose. If hypotension occurs, consider dose adjustment of diuretics, concomitant antihypertensive drugs, and treatment of other causes of hypotension (e.g., hypovolemia). If hypotension persists despite such measures, reduce the dosage or temporarily discontinue sacubitril and valsartan. Permanent discontinuation of therapy is usually not required.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), decreases in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals treated with sacubitril and valsartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In patients whose renal function depends upon the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g., patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria, progressive azotemia and, rarely, acute renal failure and death. Closely monitor serum creatinine, and down-titrate or interrupt sacubitril and valsartan in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

As with all drugs that affect the RAAS, sacubitril and valsartan may increase blood urea and serum creatinine levels in patients with bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis. In patients with renal artery stenosis, monitor renal function.

5.5 Hyperkalemia

Through its actions on the RAAS, hyperkalemia may occur with sacubitril and valsartan [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately, especially in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia such as severe renal impairment, diabetes, hypoaldosteronism, or a high potassium diet. Dosage reduction or interruption of sacubitril and valsartan may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].

Patients with systemic right ventricle, single ventricle, restrictive cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were excluded from the trial. Efficacy of sacubitril and valsartan in patients less than 1 year old was not established. At Week 52, there were 144 sacubitril and valsartan and 133 enalapril patients with a post-baseline assessment of NT-proBNP. The estimated least squares mean percent reduction from baseline in NT-proBNP was 65% and 62% in the sacubitril and valsartan and enalapril groups, respectively. While the between-group difference was not nominally statistically significant, the reductions for sacubitril and valsartan and enalapril were larger than what was seen in adults; these reductions did not appear to be attributable to post-baseline changes in background therapy.

Because sacubitril and valsartan improved outcomes and reduced NT-proBNP in adults in PARADIGM-HF, the effect on NT¬proBNP was the basis to infer improved cardiovascular outcomes in pediatric patients.

### Valsartan (Diovan) [^9e5b9cb9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Diovan®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adults and pediatric patients one year of age and older. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials in hypertensive patients demonstrating risk reduction with Diovan.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (e.g., patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Diovan may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Valsartan oral (valsartan) [^d86460da]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Heart Failure

The valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) was a multinational, double-blind study in which 5,010 patients with NYHA class II (62%) to IV (2%) heart failure and LVEF < 40%, on baseline therapy chosen by their physicians, were randomized to placebo or valsartan (titrated from 40 mg twice daily to the highest tolerated dose or 160 mg twice daily) and followed for a mean of about 2 years. The VAL-HeFT study was conducted with a formulation of valsartan that is not therapeutically equivalent to valsartan oral solution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Although Val-HeFT's primary goal was to examine the effect of valsartan when added to an ACE inhibitor, about 7% were not receiving an ACE inhibitor. Other background therapy included diuretics (86%), digoxin (67%), and beta-blockers (36%). The population studied was 80% male, 46% 65 years or older and 89% Caucasian. At the end of the trial, patients in the valsartan group had a blood pressure that was 4 mmHg systolic and 2 mmHg diastolic lower than the placebo group. There were two primary end points, both assessed as time to first event: all-cause mortality and heart failure morbidity, the latter defined as all-cause mortality, sudden death with resuscitation, hospitalization for heart failure, and the need for intravenous inotropic or vasodilatory drugs for at least 4 hours. These results are summarized in the following table.

Although the overall morbidity result favored valsartan, this result was largely driven by the 7% of patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor, as shown in the following table.

The modest favorable trend in the group receiving an ACE inhibitor was largely driven by the patients receiving less than the recommended dose of ACE inhibitor. Thus, there is little evidence of further clinical benefit when valsartan is added to an adequate dose of ACE inhibitor.

Secondary end points in the subgroup not receiving ACE inhibitors were as follows.

In patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor, valsartan-treated patients had an increase in ejection fraction and reduction in left ventricular internal diastolic diameter (LVIDD).

Effects were generally consistent across subgroups defined by age and gender for the population of patients not receiving an ACE inhibitor. The number of black patients was small and does not permit a meaningful assessment in this subset of patients.

### Impact of sodium ‒ glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with recent versus previous myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c7c14296]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myocardial infarction (MI) remains the main cause of death in the world. The prognosis of MI has improved due to the implementation of early reperfusion, effective pharmacological therapy, evidence-based management of complications, and individualized treatment for specific populations. Despite these advances, there has been a slowdown in improvements in more recent years, with limited new treatment options and a persistent high residual risk of cardiovascular (CV) events after MI.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as new and widely studied drugs in cardiology because of their positive effects in a wide spectrum of CV and metabolic parameters Recently, SGLT2 inhibitors have been recommended in heart failure (HF) guidelines to reduce cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization caused by HF exacerbations. Additionally, they have proven benefit in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with or at risk of atherosclerotic CV disease, based on several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses.

Previous meta-analyses of patients with acute MI demonstrated a reduction in HF hospitalization with SGLT2 inhibitors but no statistically significant decrease in the other CV outcomes. However, large RCTs testing SGLT2 inhibitors have included subgroup analyses of patients with a history of MI, which warrants further exploration. Moreover, the optimal timing for initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in MI patients remains controversial. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to reassess the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with MI and compare the outcomes between patients with recent versus previous MI.

### Ramipril [^7b3da9a4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

Ramipril was studied in the AIRE trial. This was a multinational (mainly European) 161-center, 2006-patient, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing ramipril to placebo in stable patients, 2 to 9 days after an acute myocardial infarction, who had shown clinical signs of congestive heart failure at any time after the myocardial infarction. Patients in severe (NYHA class IV) heart failure, patients with unstable angina, patients with heart failure of congenital or valvular etiology, and patients with contraindications to ACE inhibitors were all excluded. The majority of patients had received thrombolytic therapy at the time of the index infarction, and the average time between infarction and initiation of treatment was 5 days.

Patients randomized to ramipril treatment were given an initial dose of 2.5 mg twice daily. If the initial regimen caused undue hypotension, the dose was reduced to 1.25 mg, but in either event doses were titrated upward (as tolerated) to a target regimen (achieved in 77% of patients randomized to ramipril) of 5 mg twice daily. Patients were then followed for an average of 15 months, with the range of follow-up between 6 and 46 months.

The use of ramipril was associated with a 27% reduction (p = 0.002) in the risk of death from any cause; about 90% of the deaths that occurred were cardiovascular, mainly sudden death. The risks of progression to severe heart failure and of congestive heart failure-related hospitalization were also reduced, by 23% (p = 0.017) and 26% (p = 0.011), respectively. The benefits of ramipril therapy were seen in both genders, and they were not affected by the exact timing of the initiation of therapy, but older patients may have had a greater benefit than those under 65. The benefits were seen in patients on (and not on) various concomitant medications. At the time of randomization these included aspirin (about 80% of patients), diuretics (about 60%), organic nitrates (about 55%), beta-blockers (about 20%), calcium channel blockers (about 15%), and digoxin (about 12%).

Candesartan was studied in two heart failure outcome studies: 1. The Candesartan in Heart failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity trial in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors (CHARM–Alternative), 2. CHARM– Added in patients already receiving ACE inhibitors. Both studies were international double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with NYHA class II -IV heart failure and LVEF ≤ 40%. In both trials, patients were randomized to placebo or candesartan cilexetil (initially 4–8 mg once daily, titrated as tolerated to 32 mg once daily) and followed for up to 4 years. Patients with serum creatinine > 3 mg/dL, serum potassium > 5.5 mEq/L, symptomatic hypotension or known bilateral renal artery stenosis were excluded. The primary end point in both trials was time to either cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure.

CHARM–Alternative included 2028 subjects not receiving an ACE inhibitor due to intolerance. The mean age was 67 years and 32% were female, 48% were NYHA II, 49% were NYHA III, 4% were NYHA IV, and the mean ejection fraction was 30%. Sixty-two percent had a history of myocardial infarction, 50% had a history of hypertension, and 27% had diabetes. Concomitant drugs at baseline were diuretics (85%), digoxin (46%), beta-blockers (55%), and spironolactone (24%). The mean daily dose of candesartan cilexetil was approximately 23 mg and 59% of subjects on treatment received 32 mg once daily.

The FDA has approved Entresto, an oral fixed-dose combination of the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril and the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Sacubitril is the first neprilysin inhibitor to become available in the US. Patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction generally take an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta blocker, and an aldosterone antagonist. If volume overloaded, they may take a diuretic as well. An ARB is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors preceding ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: global proteomics and pathobiological insights [^0b2d7224]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

While advances in the care of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have led to a substantial reduction in post infarction morbidity and mortality, patients continue to remain at increased risk for adverse left ventricular remodeling, dysfunction, and congestive heart failure. Sodium-glucose cotransport 2 receptor inhibitors (SGLT2i) have significantly improved cardiovascular outcomes both in patients with and at an increased risk for heart failure. In fact, in patients at risk of heart failure postacute myocardial infarction (MI), dapaglifozin (an SGLT2i) significantly lowered the risk of adverse cardiometabolic outcomes (but did not result in differences in cardiovascular death or hospitalizations for heart failure). Empaglifozin, another SGLT2i, similarly reduced the risk of heart failure in a similar at-risk post-MI patient population.

Our understanding of how SGLT2i exactly impact cardiovascular outcomes in general, and following an acute MI in particular, remains unclear. Hypotheses suggest an interplay of pathways, not exclusive to, myocyte sodium and calcium handling, energy production, and inflammation. While there is some understanding of how SGLT2i associate with protein pathways following an acute MI, very little information exists on how pathobiological pathways (such as those involved in left ventricular remodeling, inflammation, fibrosis, etc.) differ in patients who are already on an SGLT2i preceding an acute MI. By determining protein profiling and differential protein expression using mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we aim to improve our mechanistic understanding of how pathways related to "upfront" SGLT2i use associate with "downstream" outcomes such as post infarct left ventricular remodeling, and further our insights into additional therapeutic targets aimed at mitigating adverse post-MI cardiovascular outcomes and residual cardiovascular risk. To complement the clinical outcomes noted in the recent post-MI SGLT2i trials, this exploratory analysis aims to describe how proteomics pathways differ in patients with diabetes who were already on vs not on an SGLT2i at the time of their STEMI presentation.

Acute coronary syndromes — early discharge and risk stratification after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are characterized as follows: available data suggest that an early discharge strategy of < 3 days from admission is not associated with increased mortality for low-risk patients after STEMI who have undergone PCI; the Zwolle score has been recommended to identify low-risk patients after primary PCI (PPCI) in STEMI, with low-risk patients, score ≤ 3, who can potentially be discharged earlier from the hospital (48 to 72 hours); small retrospective studies have suggested safety of very early or same-day discharge after PCI for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), with most (71%) of same-day discharge being troponin-negative; patients being considered for early discharge should be clinically stable without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute kidney injury, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, heart failure (HF), and procedural complications and with adequate postdischarge support, and hospitals and care providers should ensure access to postdischarge prescription medications and adequate follow-up.

### Valsartan oral (valsartan) [^6204bcd6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Fetal Toxicity

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue valsartan oral solution as soon as possible [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.2 Hypotension

In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin system, such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics, symptomatic hypotension may occur. This condition should be corrected prior to administration of valsartan, or the treatment should start under close medical supervision.

Peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are higher following administration of valsartan oral solution and may result in increased risk of hypotension as compared to administration of valsartan tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients given valsartan tablets in clinical trials commonly had some reduction in blood pressure. Only use valsartan oral solution in heart failure or post-myocardial infarction patients who are unable to swallow valsartan tablets. In clinical trials of valsartan tablets, discontinuation of therapy because of continuing symptomatic hypotension usually was not necessary. In controlled trials in heart failure patients, the incidence of hypotension in valsartan-treated patients was 5.5% compared to 1.8% in placebo-treated patients. In the valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (VALIANT), hypotension in post-myocardial infarction patients led to permanent discontinuation of therapy in 1.4% of valsartan-treated patients and 0.8% of captopril-treated patients.

If symptomatic hypotension occurs, place the patient in the supine position and, if necessary, give an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further treatment, which usually can be continued without difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized.

### Effects of sacubitril / valsartan on all-cause hospitalizations in heart failure… [^2fb505e1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Number needed to treat was 48 patient-years to prevent 1 hospitalization. The incidence rate of first all-cause hospitalization was 25 per 100 patient-years in the sacubitril/valsartan arm and 27 per 100 patient-years in the RASi arm. HR indicates hazard ratio; RASi, renin-angiotensin system inhibitor. Question What are the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on hospitalizations of any cause in patients with heart failure. Findings In this post hoc pooled analysis of the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF randomized clinical trials including 13 194 patients, sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalization, primarily driven by lower rates of cardiac and pulmonary hospitalization. These benefits were most apparent in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction below normal.

Meaning Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced hospitalization for any reason in patients with HF, with benefits most apparent in patients with an LVEF below normal. Importance Sacubitril/valsartan is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with chronic HF. However, many of these patients are older and have multiple comorbidities that increase the risk of hospitalization for causes other than HF. Participants with chronic HF, New York Heart Association classes II through IV symptoms, and elevated natriuretic peptides were randomized to treatment with either sacubitril/valsartan or a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor — enalapril in the PARADIGM-HF trial or valsartan in the PARAGON-HF trial. Intervention Sacubitril/valsartan vs RASi.

Main Outcomes and Measures The effects of sacubitril/valsartan on time to first investigator-reported all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations were examined using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by geographic region and trial. Effect modification by LVEF as a continuous function was examined. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalization compared with RASi over a median follow-up period of 2. 5 years. The incidence rate of first ACH was 25 per 100 patient-years in the sacubitril/valsartan arm and 27 per 100 patient-years in the RASi arm. The absolute risk reduction was 2. 1 per 100 patient-years, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 48 patient-years of treatment exposure to prevent 1 ACH.

Conclusions and Relevance In this post hoc pooled analysis of 13 194 patients with chronic HF in the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF randomized clinical trials, sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced hospitalization for any reason, with benefits most apparent in patients with an LVEF below normal. This reduction appeared to be principally driven by lower rates of cardiac and pulmonary hospitalizations. The effects of sacubitril/valsartan on all-cause hospitalizations have not been comprehensively described, and it is unclear whether the benefits of sacubitril/valsartan in lowering HF hospitalizations may be offset by an increase in noncardiovascular hospitalizations. In this post hoc participant-level pooled analysis of the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF randomized clinical trials, the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on ACH and the main causes of hospitalization were assessed across the LVEF spectrum.

### Eplerenone (Inspra) [^b11e210d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Heart Failure Post-Myocardial Infarction

The eplerenone post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS) was a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients clinically stable 3 to 14 days after an acute MI with LV dysfunction (as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] ≤ 40%) and either diabetes or clinical evidence of HF (pulmonary congestion by exam or chest x-ray or S3). Patients with HF of valvular or congenital etiology, patients with unstable post-infarct angina, and patients with serum potassium > 5.0 mEq/L or serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL were to be excluded. Patients were allowed to receive standard post-MI drug therapy and to undergo revascularization by angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Patients randomized to INSPRA were given an initial dose of 25 mg once daily and titrated to the target dose of 50 mg once daily after 4 weeks if serum potassium was < 5.0 mEq/L. Dosage was reduced or suspended anytime during the study if serum potassium levels were ≥ 5.5 mEq/L [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

EPHESUS randomized 6,632 patients (9.3% U.S.) at 671 centers in 27 countries. The study population was primarily white (90%, with 1% Black, 1% Asian, 6% Hispanic, 2% other) and male (71%). The mean age was 64 years (range, 22 to 94 years). The majority of patients had pulmonary congestion (75%) by exam or x-ray and were Killip Class II (64%). The mean ejection fraction was 33%. The average time to enrollment was 7 days post-MI. Medical histories prior to the index MI included hypertension (60%), coronary artery disease (62%), dyslipidemia (48%), angina (41%), type 2 diabetes (30%), previous MI (27%), and HF (15%).

Risk stratification and selective testing versus routine invasive strategy in NSTE-ACS: Although some trials have demonstrated a reduction in MACE with a routine invasive approach in NSTE-ACS, others have not demonstrated a significant benefit when compared with a selective approach that involves further risk stratification; the GRACE 2.0 risk calculator and TIMI Risk Score for unstable angina/NSTEMI may help identify patients at increased risk of MACE who benefit more from a routine invasive approach, and low-risk patients with normal cardiac biomarkers in whom a diagnosis of an ACS is suspect should preferentially undergo noninvasive stress testing or coronary CT angiography prior to hospital discharge, while patients with suspected ongoing ischemic symptoms should be considered for coronary angiography.

### Sacubitril-valsartan in patients requiring hemodialysis… [^4faf2122]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Participants were eligible for enrollment from 2015 to 2020, and analysis used an intention-to-treat approach. ACEI indicates angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; CV, cardiovascular; and HF, heart failure. Question Is the use of sacubitril-valsartan associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality and hospitalization among individuals requiring hemodialysis for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Findings In this comparative effectiveness research study of 1434 patient pairs, initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy was associated with a statistically significant 18% reduction in all-cause mortality and 14% reduction in all-cause hospitalization. Meaning These findings suggest sacubitril-valsartan therapy may benefit individuals with HFrEF requiring hemodialysis.

Importance Randomized clinical trials have shown that sacubitril-valsartan reduces the risks of mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis were excluded. Objective To investigate the comparative effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan vs angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with HFrEF requiring hemodialysis. Exposures New use of sacubitril-valsartan vs new or continued use of ACEIs or ARBs. Main Outcomes and Measures The associations between initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF hospitalization were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models in a propensity score–matched sample. Sacubitril-valsartan therapy was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalization but not cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization. Sacubitril-valsartan, a first-in-class ARNI, was shown to be superior to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure trial, 2 and for those with HF with reduced ejection fraction, initiation of sacubitril-valsartan therapy is a class I recommendation by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Failure Society of America guidelines. 5 In addition to improvements in CV mortality, sacubitril.

We used the target trial emulation framework comparing new users of sacubitril-valsartan vs new or continued users of ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers among patients with HFrEF receiving hemodialysis. We included individuals with a history of ACEI or ARB use, as sacubitril-valsartan is a first-in-class medication, and landmark trials of sacubitril-valsartan enrolled patients with2 and without23 recent ACEI or ARB use. We used both Cox proportional hazards regression and Poisson regression on the 1: 1 matched cohort to assess sacubitril-valsartan therapy initiation and risk of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and HF hospitalization.

### Treatment with sacubitril / valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure and reduced ejection fraction… [^59409c04]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with advanced chronic heart failure. Findings In this randomized clinical trial including 335 patients with advanced heart failure, the area under the curve for the ratio of N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide relative to baseline through 24 weeks of therapy was not significantly different in 167 patients in the sacubitril/valsartan treatment arm compared with 168 patients in the valsartan treatment arm. Intervention Patients were randomized to receive sacubitril/valsartan or valsartan in addition to recommended therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The area under the curve for the ratio of N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide compared with baseline measured through 24 weeks of therapy. The estimated ratio of change in the NT-proBNP AUC was 0.95.

Compared with valsartan, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan did not improve the clinical composite of number of days alive, out of hospital, and free from heart failure events. Aside from a statistically significant increase in non–life-threatening hyperkalemia in the sacubitril/valsartan arm, there were no observed safety concerns. Inhibitor With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure trial reported that, compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor, reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations by 20% in ambulatory patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction.
5.

The LIFE trial tested the hypothesis that sacubitril/valsartan is superior to valsartan alone in lowering N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide levels in patients with advanced heart failure. The LIFE trial was a 24-week, prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator phase 4 clinical trial designed to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan compared with valsartan in patients with advanced chronic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and recent NYHA class IV symptoms. The initial doses were selected based on guidelines for initiating sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan. 9 Patients also received a placebo that resembled either valsartan or sacubitril/valsartan. The study drug was titrated to attempt to reach a target dose of sacubitril/valsartan, 97/103 mg, twice daily or valsartan, 160 mg, twice daily.

9 Dose adjustments of the study drug were performed every 2 weeks by doubling the dose of study medication up to the target or maximally tolerated subtarget dose. The secondary efficacy end point of the number of patient-days alive, out of hospital, and without heart failure events was numerically higher in the valsartan arm compared with the sacubitril/valsartan arm. Furthermore, there were no informative differences in other tolerability or serious adverse events between the treatment arms. The number of patients who discontinued the study drug in the sacubitril/valsartan arm compared with the valsartan treatment arm was not significantly different.

### Treat or not treat COVID-19 with combined renin-angiotensin system and neprilysin inhibition: have we found a solution? [^17004582]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

All these described changes can result in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — particularly in those patients with underlying risk factors as hypertension, obesity or diabetes — or unmask subclinical preexisting HFpEF. Consecutively, its adequate diagnostics and treatment are essential. As quantitative markers of cardiomyocyte injury and haemodynamic myocardial stress measurement of hs‐cTnT and N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) should not be delayed. These biomarkers are common, accurate and easy to perform. In cohort studies, they were independently associated with adverse outcome in acute COVID‐19, as well as in long‐term cardiac injury, strengthening their relevance for precise prognostic risk stratification.

At the beginning of the pandemic, arterial hypertension was rapidly revealed as one of the most prevalent risk factor for COVID‐19‐associated cardiovascular events. As renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), including ACE inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are the basis for antihypertensive (and HF) treatment and are known to increase the tissue levels of ACE2, they have been claimed to be responsible for adverse outcomes in individuals with arterial hypertension and COVID‐19. It was stated that the treatment with RASi may promote SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, therefore being detrimental in patients who are exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2. But up to now, this hypothesis has not been confirmed and epidemiological studies showed that there is no clear evidence that ACEi or ARBs affect the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. On the contrary, randomized controlled trials on patients on RASi hospitalized for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection showed that stopping the treatment with ACEi or ARBs resulted in a rise of natriuretic peptides and increasing the risk of acute HF compared to treatment continuation. Additionally, it has been shown that the discontinuation of ACEi and ARBs (and beta‐blockers) increases the risk of adverse outcomes (Table 1). In a meta‐analysis compromising data of 11 randomized controlled trials which enrolled a total of 1838 participants, continuation versus discontinuation of RASi showed no difference in all‐cause mortality and a non‐significant reduction in acute myocardial infarction, but an increased risk of acute kidney injury. While trials focusing on sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in COVID‐19 showed a treatment benefitand those on mineralocorticoid receptor antagonistswere neutral, data on sacubitril/valsartan (angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor [ARNI]) are sparse. Sacubitril increases neprilysin‐degraded peptides, such as natriuretic peptides and angiotensin 1–7 by neprilysin inhibition. These peptides are associated with anti‐inflammatory, antihypertrophic and antifibrotic effects.
