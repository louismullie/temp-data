## Question

My patent has a needle stick injury from an unknown patient who won't be available for testing. Do they need hiv prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be given after a needlestick injury from an unknown patient, and how to manage this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exposure type and baseline risk. Then, I should verify the timing since injury. Next, I will assess risk modifiers that increase or decrease transmission risk. After that, I need to check guideline-based indications for PEP when the source is unknown. Then, I should review preferred PEP regimens and dosing. Finally, I will outline baseline and follow-up testing, counseling, and when to stop PEP if the source tests negative, while considering special populations and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the exposure category and baseline risk. A percutaneous needlestick from an unknown source is an occupational exposure with an estimated HIV transmission risk of about 0.3% when the source is HIV-positive, which is low but not negligible, and the risk is higher with hollow-bore needles, deep injury, visible blood, or a source with high viral load, so I should not dismiss it outright even if the source status is unknown [^111aL6dz] [^114QnuxF].

> Wait, let me verify the timing because that drives whether PEP is even an option. PEP should be initiated as soon as possible and no later than 72 hours after exposure; beyond 72 hours, PEP is not recommended because efficacy drops and the window for preventing systemic infection closes, so I need to act urgently if we are within that window [^1157H7AP] [^1142wzPD] [^111Bry8M].

> I will now examine risk modifiers that could shift the decision toward or away from PEP. Higher risk features include deep injury, visible blood on the device, a needle placed in a vein or artery, and exposure to a source with advanced HIV or high viral load. Conversely, lower risk features include a solid needle, superficial scratch, no visible blood, or a source with sustained viral suppression on effective ART, though in this case the source status is unknown so I cannot rely on viral suppression to lower risk [^111aL6dz] [^113eKxJj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm what the guidelines say for unknown-source occupational exposures. The US Public Health Service advises that when the source is unknown, PEP decisions should be individualized based on the severity of exposure and the epidemiologic likelihood of HIV in the source population, and importantly, PEP should not be delayed while waiting for source testing if it will take time to obtain results, so I should err on the side of starting if the exposure is substantial and we are within 72 hours [^115CRJAR] [^111ZwsmN].

> Let me think about the practical implication here. Given a needlestick injury with at least moderate severity and an unknown source, and assuming presentation within 72 hours, the balance of risk and benefit favors empiric PEP initiation with a plan to discontinue if the source later tests negative, rather than risking a missed window for prevention. This aligns with occupational guidance and with operational data showing that rapid source testing reduces unnecessary PEP without compromising safety [^115BLTzF] [^114c41Sc].

> Next, I should review the PEP regimen. For occupational exposures, a three-drug antiretroviral regimen is standard. Preferred options include bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide as a single-tablet regimen or dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir, with consideration of source resistance risk if information becomes available, but I should not delay the first dose to gather resistance data when the source is unknown [^113oetku] [^113UwRrJ].

> I need to ensure baseline and follow-up testing are planned. Baseline HIV testing should be obtained in the exposed person, and if the source becomes available, rapid HIV testing of the source can guide whether to continue PEP; follow-up HIV testing for the exposed person is typically at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months, though with fourth-generation Ag/Ab assays, follow-up can be concluded at 4 months if a validated fourth-generation test is used consistently, and PEP should be stopped immediately if the source is determined to be HIV-negative [^115VXzgk] [^115BLTzF].

> But wait, what if the exposure was low risk, such as a superficial scratch with a solid needle and no visible blood, and the epidemiologic context suggests very low HIV prevalence in the likely source population? In that scenario, observation without PEP may be reasonable after shared decision-making, whereas if any high-risk features are present or the worker prefers PEP given the potential consequences of HIV, I should honor that preference and initiate treatment within the 72-hour window [^115CRJAR] [^111ZwsmN].

> I should double-check special populations and drug safety. Pregnancy or breastfeeding should not delay PEP, and nevirapine should be avoided in PEP regimens due to serious hepatotoxicity. Counseling on adherence, side effects, and the need to complete the 28-day course is essential, with early follow-up within 72 hours to reassess tolerance and indication, and consideration of PrEP after PEP completion if ongoing occupational exposures are anticipated [^111ZwsmN] [^111AFYa6] [^116AiG57] [^11671FUW].

> Let me summarize the decision pathway to ensure nothing is missed. If within 72 hours of a substantial needlestick from an unknown source, I recommend initiating a three-drug PEP regimen promptly, arranging baseline labs, and planning follow-up testing. If the source is later found to be HIV-negative, stop PEP and end HIV follow-up, whereas if the source is unavailable or untestable, complete the 28-day course and continue standard serologic follow-up, documenting the risk assessment, counseling, and rationale for PEP in the occupational health record [^111ZwsmN] [^115VXzgk] [^115BLTzF].

In general, **HIV PEP is indicated** for a needlestick injury from an unknown source if the exposure occurred within the last 72 hours and the injury is high risk (deep, hollow-bore, or visibly bloody) [^111aL6dz] or the local HIV prevalence is high [^115CRJAR]. If the injury is low risk (superficial, solid needle, minimal blood) and the local prevalence is low, **PEP is not routinely indicated** but can be considered case-by-case [^115CRJAR]. Initiate PEP as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours, and stop if the source is later confirmed HIV-negative [^111PGcUm] [^115BLTzF]. Use a three-drug regimen (e.g. tenofovir/emtricitabine plus dolutegravir) for 28 days, and arrange follow-up HIV testing at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months [^113oetku] [^115VXzgk].

## Risk of HIV transmission from needlestick injuries

The average risk of HIV transmission after a percutaneous needlestick exposure to HIV-infected blood is approximately **0.3% (3 per 1,000)** [^111aL6dz] [^112TaFwf]. This risk varies with the following factors:

- **Depth of injury**: Deep injuries carry a higher risk than superficial injuries [^111aL6dz].
- **Visible blood on device**: Presence of visible blood increases risk [^111aL6dz].
- **Hollow-bore needles**: Higher risk compared to solid needles [^112TaFwf].
- **Source patient's viral load**: Higher viral load increases risk [^112TaFwf].

## Guidelines for HIV PEP after needlestick injury from an unknown source

The decision to initiate HIV PEP after a needlestick injury from an unknown source **depends on several factors**, including the severity of the injury, the local prevalence of HIV, and the timing of the exposure [^115CRJAR].

---

### Occupational exposures

For occupational exposures, the **U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) guidelines** recommend:

- **High-risk injuries**: Deep injury, hollow-bore needle, visible blood, or high local HIV prevalence warrant PEP initiation as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours [^111PGcUm].
- **Low-risk injuries**: Superficial injury, solid needle, minimal blood, and low local HIV prevalence may not require PEP, but case-by-case consideration is advised [^notfound].
- **Unknown source**: If the source patient's HIV status is unknown, PEP should be initiated if the injury is high risk or if local HIV prevalence is high. PEP should not be delayed while awaiting source testing results [^115BLTzF].

---

### Non-occupational exposures

For non-occupational exposures (e.g. community needlestick injuries), the **CDC guidelines** recommend:

- **High-risk exposures**: Freshly discarded needles with visible blood or high local HIV prevalence warrant PEP initiation [^116LwJCu].
- **Low-risk exposures**: Old, rusty needles without visible blood and low local HIV prevalence generally do not require PEP [^1133JoBo].
- **Unknown source**: PEP is not routinely recommended for community needlestick injuries unless exceptional circumstances are present [^116LwJCu].

---

## Timing and effectiveness of HIV PEP

HIV PEP is most effective when initiated **within 72 hours** of exposure, with the greatest efficacy when started as early as possible, ideally within 2 hours [^111ZwsmN]. Starting PEP after 72 hours is generally not recommended, as its effectiveness significantly decreases beyond this window [^111Bry8M].

---

## Recommended HIV PEP regimens

Current guidelines recommend the following **HIV PEP regimens**:

| **Regimen** | **Components** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Preferred | Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) + emtricitabine (FTC) + dolutegravir (DTG) | 28 days |
| Alternative | TDF + FTC + raltegravir (RAL) | 28 days |
| Alternative | TDF + FTC + boosted protease inhibitor (e.g. darunavir) | 28 days |

---

These regimens are generally well tolerated, with manageable side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, fatigue, and headache [^115CjEXp].

---

## Follow-up testing and monitoring

Individuals who receive HIV PEP should undergo follow-up testing at the following intervals:

- **Baseline**: HIV antibody test at the time of exposure [^115VXzgk].
- **6 weeks**: HIV antibody test [^115VXzgk].
- **12 weeks**: HIV antibody test [^115VXzgk].
- **6 months**: HIV antibody test (final test) [^115VXzgk].

Additional testing for hepatitis B and C is also recommended, as these viruses are more easily transmitted than HIV through needlestick injuries [^113bW8z8] [^112TaFwf].

---

## Psychological and emotional considerations

Needlestick injuries often cause significant anxiety, stress, and **psychological distress** [^116AiG57]. Healthcare workers may experience fear of **HIV infection**, concern about disclosure, and anxiety about follow-up testing. Psychological support and counseling should be integral to **post-exposure management** [^116AiG57].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **HIV PEP is indicated** for needlestick injuries from unknown sources when the injury is high risk or the local HIV prevalence is high. PEP should be initiated as soon as possible, ideally within 2 hours, and continued for 28 days. Follow-up HIV testing should be conducted at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months post-exposure. Psychological support and counseling are essential components of post-exposure management.

### Human immunodeficiency virus postexposure prophylaxis for adolescents and children [^114EpPma]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Transmission occurs through perinatal exposures, injecting drug use, consensual and nonconsensual sex, needle-stick and sharp injuries, and possibly some unusual contacts. Youth engaging in high-risk sexual activities are especially endangered. Half of the estimated worldwide 5.3 million new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24. Of 20 000 known new adult and adolescent cases in the United States, 25% involve 13- to 21-year-olds. More than 1.4 million children worldwide (aged 15 and younger) are believed to be infected, and > 1640 new cases are diagnosed daily. Of the 432 000 people reported to be living with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States, 5575 are children under 13. HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a form of secondary HIV prevention that may reduce the incidence of HIV infections. HIV PEP is commonly conceived of as 2 types: occupational and nonoccupational. Occupational HIV PEP is an accepted form of therapy for health care workers exposed to HIV through their jobs. A landmark study of healthcare workers concluded that occupational HIV PEP may be efficacious. Well-established US national guidelines for occupational HIV PEP exist for this at-risk population. Nonoccupational HIV PEP includes all other forms of HIV PEP, such as that given after sexual assault and consensual sex, injecting drug use, and needle-stick and sharp injuries in non-health care persons. Pediatric HIV PEP is typically the nonoccupational type. The efficacy of nonoccupational HIV PEP is unknown. The presumed efficacy is based on a collection of animal and human data concerning occupational, perinatal, and nonoccupational exposures to HIV. In contrast to occupational HIV PEP, there are no national US guidelines for nonoccupational HIV PEP, and few recommendations are available for its use for adolescents and children. Regardless of this absence, there is encouraging evidence supporting the value of HIV PEP in its various forms in pediatrics. Although unproven, the presumed mechanism for HIV PEP comes from animal and human work suggesting that shortly after an exposure to HIV, a window period exists during which the viral load is small enough to be controlled by the body's immune system. Antiretroviral medications given during this period may help to diminish or end viral replication, thereby reducing the viral inoculum to a more potentially manageable target for the host's defenses. HIV PEP is accepted practice in the perinatal setting and for health care workers with occupational injuries. The medical literature supports prescribing HIV PEP after community needle-stick and sharp injuries and after sexual assault from sources known or likely to be HIV-infected. HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between HIV sero-opposite partners has had growing use in the adult population, and can probably be utilized for children and adolescents. There is less documented experience and support for HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between partners of unknown HIV status, after prolonged or multiple episodes of sexual abuse from an assailant of unknown HIV status, after bites, and after the sharing of personal hygiene items or exposure to wounds of HIV-infected individuals. There are no formal guidelines for HIV PEP in adolescents and children. A few groups have commented on its provision in pediatrics, and some preliminary studies have been released. Our article provides a discussion of the data available on HIV transmission and HIV PEP in pediatrics. In our article, we propose an HIV PEP approach for adolescents and children. We recommend a stratified regimen, based on the work of Gerberding and Katz and other authors, that attempts to match seroconversion risk with an appropriate number of medications, while taking into account adverse side-effects and the amount of information that is typically available upon initial presentation. Twice daily regimens should be used when possible, and may improve compliance. HIV PEP should be administered within 1 hour of exposure. We strongly recommend that physicians trained in this form of therapy review the indications for HIV PEP within 72 hours of its provision. We advocate that due diligence in determining level of risk and appropriateness of drug selection be conducted as soon as possible after an exposure has occurred. When such information is not immediately available, we recommend the rapid treatment using the maximum level of care followed by careful investigation and reconsideration in follow-up or whenever possible. HIV PEP may be initiated provisionally after an exposure and then discontinued if the exposure source is confirmed to not be HIV-infected. In most cases, consultations with the experts in HIV care can occur after the rapid start of therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

### Needlestick transmission of hepatitis C [^115PMfWw]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission following a needlestick is an important threat to health care workers. We present the case of a 29-year-old medical intern who sustained a needlestick injury from a source patient known to be infected with both human immunodeficiency virus and HCV. The case patient subsequently developed acute HCV infection. The optimal strategy for diagnosing HCV infection after occupational exposures has not been defined. At a minimum, HCV antibody and alanine aminotransferase testing should be done within several days of exposure (to assess if the health care worker is already infected with HCV) and 6 months after percutaneous, mucosal, or nonintact skin exposure to blood or infectious body fluids from an HCV-infected patient. Currently, it is not possible to prevent HCV infection after exposure. However, recent data suggest that early treatment of acute HCV infection with interferon alpha may be highly effective in preventing chronic HCV infection. These data underscore the importance of identifying persons with acute HCV infection and promptly referring them to experienced clinicians who can provide updated counseling and treatment.

### Needlestick injury… [^116TzZ1U]. Wikipedia (2025). Medium credibility.

needlestick injury is the penetration of the skin by a hypodermic needle or other sharp object that has been in contact with blood, tissue or other body fluids before the exposure. Even though the acute physiological effects of a needlestick injury are generally negligible, these injuries can lead to transmission of blood-borne diseases, placing those exposed at increased risk of infection from disease-causing pathogens, such as the hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Health effects While needlestick injuries have the potential to transmit bacteria, protozoa, viruses and prions, the risk of contracting hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV is the highest. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2000, 66, 000 hepatitis B, 16, 000 hepatitis C, and 1, 000 HIV infections were caused by needlestick injuries.

In places with higher rates of blood-borne diseases in the general population, healthcare workers are more susceptible to contracting these diseases from a needlestick injury. The transmission rate of hepatitis C has been reported at 1. 8%, but newer, larger surveys have shown only a
0. 5% transmission rate. The overall risk of HIV infection after percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected material in the health care setting is 0. 3%. Individualized risk of blood-borne infection from a used biomedical sharp is further dependent upon additional factors. In cases where an injury was sustained with a clean needle, the likelihood of infection is generally minimal. Nonetheless, workers are often obligated to report the incident as per the facility's protocol regarding occupational safety.

Hollow-bore needles pose a greater risk of injury than solid needles, but hollow-bore needle injuries are highly preventable: 25% of hollow-bore needle injuries to healthcare professionals can be prevented by using safer needles. Gloves can also provide better protection against injuries from tapered-tip as opposed to sharp-tipped needles. However, these safety systems can increase the risk of exposure to splashed blood. Education with training for at-risk healthcare workers can reduce their risk of needlestick injuries. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has a campaign to educate at-risk healthcare workers. Treatment After a needlestick injury, certain procedures can minimize the risk of infection. Lab tests of the recipient should be obtained for baseline studies, including HIV, acute hepatitis panel and for immunized individuals, HB surface antibody.

Unless already known, the infectious status of the source needs to be determined. Unless the source is known to be negative for HBV, HCV, and HIV, post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated, ideally within one hour of the injury. HIV The risk of HIV transmission with a skin puncture is estimated at 0. 3%. If the status of the source patient is unknown, their blood should be tested for HIV as soon as possible following exposure. The injured person can start antiretroviral drugs for PEP as soon as possible, preferably within three days of exposure. There is no vaccine for HIV. When the source of blood is known to be HIV positive, a 3-drug regimen is recommended by the CDC; those exposed to blood with a low viral load or otherwise low risk can use a 2-drug protocol.

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^114moaMc]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Even if none of the retrieved studies included HCV-RNA testing in post-exposure protocols, it is recommended as alternative strategy in the United States and is strongly supported in a cost-effectiveness analysis. HCV-RNA testing at 1 month, at an average cost of Int$242 per exposure, leads to earlier detection of HCV transmission and lowers the risk of progression to chronic hepatitis. Consequently, NSI management costs could also increase, and even more in the future, if direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C are used in PEP, which would add a significant cost to treating these frequent events.

Are these costs truly representative of this issue? The costs of treating an occupational infection were not included in the calculation of average NSI costs, nor were those of litigation and compensation. Bloodborne infections other than HBV, HCV, or HIV were not considered, though many different pathogens can be, and have been, occasionally transmitted through an NSI. Most importantly, intangible costs arising from an NSI were not evaluated. The single willingness-to-pay analysis identified in the literature reported that the high median amount HCP were willing to pay to avoid a sharps-related injury were Int$828 in the base case and Int$1,237 when exposed to HIV or HCV. This finding suggests that the costs of intangible aspects of HCP injuries, such as anxiety and distress, could equal costs associated with the medical evaluation of these injuries. However, in this study, the median time from injury to interview was 3 days. Thus, the interviewed subjects had not yet experienced the impact of being at risk of developing a bloodborne infection or the effects on personal and family life, sexual relationships, reproductive plans, breastfeeding, or professional expectations, which would increase the amounts reported above.

In conclusion, NSIs generate significant direct, indirect, potential, and intangible costs. While the costs for their prevention may seem high in the beginning, ultimately they prove to be the opposite. The economic expenditures directed toward enhancing interventions to prevent occupational exposures and infections, including provision of SEDs, will likely decrease over time, while enhancing HCP perception of their own value and affecting the quality of the care they provide. As highlighted in the preamble of the EU Directive, "Health and safety of workers is paramount and is closely linked to the health of patients".

### Postexposure prophylaxis for common infectious diseases [^113bW8z8]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective in preventing illness after potential or documented exposure to a variety of microbial pathogens and in reducing the risk of secondary spread of infection. Guidelines have been published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for proper use of PEP for bloodborne pathogens, for microorganisms transmitted by either airborne or droplet spread or through direct contact, and for infections acquired after traumatic injuries. Depending on the type of exposure, different forms of PEP are available, including vaccines, immune globulins, antibiotics, and antiviral medications. Physicians should assess a patient's potential need for PEP based on several factors, including the type of exposure, the timing and severity of illness in the source patient, the exposed person's susceptibility to infectious diseases of concern, and the relative risks and benefits of the PEP regimen in an individual situation. Immunity to certain infectious diseases can be ensured with prior infection or vaccination, and by serologic testing in patients with a negative or uncertain history. PEP should be given to persons exposed to index cases of pertussis and invasive meningococcal infection regardless of immunization history, and should be given following rabies and tetanus exposure regardless of the length of delay. In general, PEP should be given as soon as possible following a high-risk exposure. Persons exposed to bloodborne pathogens should have baseline testing for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus antibodies, and follow-up testing at six weeks, three months, and six months postexposure.

### Postexposure prophylaxis against human immunodeficiency virus [^113NT4UL]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Family physicians often encounter situations in which postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiretroviral medications against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be indicated. When the exposure source's HIV status is unknown and testing of the source is possible, use of a rapid HIV test kit may facilitate decision making at the point of care. When PEP is given, timing and duration are important, with data showing PEP to be most effective when initiated within 72 hours of exposure and continued for four weeks. Although two-drug PEP regimens are an option for some lower risk occupational exposures, three-drug regimens are advised for nonoccupational exposures. Sexual assault survivors should be given three-drug PEP regardless of assailant characteristics. In complicated situations, such as exposure of a pregnant woman or when a source is known to be infected with HIV, expert consultation is advised. In most cases, PEP is not indicated after an accidental needlestick in the community setting. Health care volunteers working abroad, particularly in areas of high HIV prevalence or where preferred PEP regimens may not be readily available, often choose to travel with personal supplies of PEP. Patients presenting for care after HIV exposure should have baseline testing for HIV antibodies, and follow-up HIV antibody testing at four to six weeks, three months, and six months after exposure.

### Public health service guidelines for the management of… [^116DVvR8]. CDC (1998). Low credibility.

The decision to recommend HIV postexposure prophylaxis must take into account the nature of the exposure and the amount of blood or body fluid involved in the exposure. Other considerations include pregnancy in the HCW and exposure to virus known or suspected to be resistant to antiretroviral drugs. Assessments of the risk for infection resulting from the exposure and of the infectivity of the exposure source are key determinants of offering PEP. Systems should be in place for the timely evaluation and management of exposed HCWs and for consultation with experts in the treatment of HIV when using PEP. INTRODUCTION Although preventing blood exposures is the primary means of preventing occupationally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection, appropriate postexposure management is an important element of workplace safety.

In January 1990, CDC issued a statement on the management of HIV exposures that included considerations for zidovudine use for postexposure prophylaxis. At that time, data were insufficient to assess the efficacy of ZDV as a prophylactic agent in humans or the toxicity of this drug in persons not infected with HIV. Although there are still only limited data to assess safety and efficacy, additional information is now available that is relevant to this issue. This information, along with data on ZDV efficacy in preventing perinatal transmission and evidence that PEP prevented or ameliorated retroviral infection in some studies in animals, prompted a Public Health Service interagency working group *, with expert consultation, in June 1996 to issue provisional recommendations for PEP for HCWs after occupational HIV exposure.

In addition, questions have been raised about the use of chemoprophylaxis in situations not fully addressed in the 1996 recommendations, including when not to offer PEP, what to do when the source of exposure or the HIV status of the source person is unknown, how to approach PEP in HCWs who are or may be pregnant, and considerations for PEP regimens when the source person's virus is known or suspected to be resistant to one or more of the antiretroviral agents recommended for PEP. An "exposure" that may place an HCW at risk for HIV infection and therefore requires consideration of PEP is defined as a percutaneous injury, contact of mucous membrane or nonintact skin, or contact with intact skin when the duration of contact is prolonged or involves an extensive area, with blood, tissue, or other body fluids.

In addition, any direct contact to concentrated HIV in a research laboratory or production facility is considered an "exposure" that requires clinical evaluation and consideration of the need for PEP. Although one nonoccupational episode of HIV transmission has been attributed to contact with blood-contaminated saliva, this incident involved intimate kissing between sexual partners and is not similar to contact with saliva that may occur during the provision of health-care services. The route of exposure for one person exposed to concentrated virus is uncertain. Of the percutaneous exposures, the objects involved included a hollow-bore needle, a broken glass vial, a scalpel, and an unknown sharp object. Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that several factors may affect the risk for HIV transmission after an occupational exposure.

At a glance Management of Potentially Infectious Exposures and Illnesses from the Infection Control in Healthcare Personnel: Infrastructure and Routine Practices for Occupational Infection Prevention and Control Services guideline. Recommendations For healthcare organization leaders and administrators Number Recommendation For occupational health services leaders and staff Number Recommendation
- **Counseling about**:

- risk of exposure or illness,
- testing,
- options for and risks and benefits of postexposure prophylaxis or treatment,
- need for specialty care,
- follow-up testing and treatment,
- work restrictions, if indicated,
- risk of transmitting infections to others and methods to prevent transmission, and
- signs and symptoms of illness to report after an exposure, including potential side effects of prophylaxis.

Background HCP can be exposed to potentially infectious blood, tissues, secretions, other body fluids, contaminated medical supplies, devices, and equipment, environmental surfaces, or air in healthcare settings. Mechanisms of occupational exposures include percutaneous injuries such as needlesticks, mucous membrane or non-intact skin contact via splashes or sprays, and inhalation of aerosols. HCP can also be exposed to infectious diseases in the community and risk transmitting them to others at work. Appropriate management of potentially infectious exposures and illnesses among HCP can prevent the development and transmission of infections. Effective management of exposures and illnesses includes promptly assessing exposures and diagnosing illness, monitoring for the development of signs and symptoms of disease, and providing appropriate postexposure or illness management.

Providing exposure and illness management services also affords the opportunity for counseling to address HCP concerns about issues such as potential infection, adverse effects of postexposure prophylaxis, and work restrictions. Exposure management A substantial number of potentially infectious exposures occur in the workplace, despite longstanding regulations and guidelines in place for their prevention, and providing timely and effective exposure management services can be challenging. Bloodborne pathogen exposures among HCP subpopulations, including trainees, technicians, surgeons, medical staff, and nurses, are significantly underreported. Time constraints, fear of reprimand, lack of information on how to report exposures, and cost coverage of exposure management have been identified as factors in not reporting exposures.

While many HCP may be guaranteed cost coverage for job-related exposure and illness by workers' compensation laws, not all HCP, such as volunteers and trainees, may have this benefit. Off-site services can be a barrier to accessing care if they are inconveniently located. When timeliness is critical for provision of prophylaxis or expert consultation and management, such as after a needlestick injury from an HIV-infected source, off-site services may not be sufficient. Identifying whether an exposure to an infectious disease has occurred can be challenging and depends upon eliciting the circumstances of the exposure incident, including where, when, and how the exposure occurred, the duration and extent of the exposure, and whether appropriate PPE was used and functioned correctly. Some guidelines provide disease-specific guidance on how to determine if an occupational exposure has occurred.

nPEP regimen parameters and expected effects — Evidence accumulated since then suggests that nPEP, when used as currently recommended, including a 72-hour initiation window, a 28-day duration, and a newer generation 3-drug ART regimen, is safe, generally well tolerated, and likely to reduce the risk for HIV acquisition.

HIV status of the source — timing and continuation decisions: If a person potentially exposed to HIV does not know the source's HIV status, the clinician should proceed with determining whether nPEP is indicated based on the available information. HIV nPEP should not be delayed for the purpose of investigating the source's HIV status, and the first dose of HIV nPEP should be given to the exposed person as soon as possible. HIV nPEP should be stopped if the source is determined to not have HIV.

TABLE 5
Description of Cost Items Included in 14 Studies of Economic Analysis on Occupational Needlestick and Sharps Injuries Among Healthcare Personnel, 1997–2013

Regarding HCP, in 4 studies, HCV-Ab and HIV-Ab were always performed; in 6 studies, based on the source serostatus; and in 2 studies, the tests were based on HCP anxiety or other factor. HBV baseline screening varied; HBsAb was performed in vaccinated HCP regardless of the source, in case of a HBsAg-positive source, or following exposure to a positive or unknown source. In 1 study, unvaccinated HCP, or vaccinated HCP with unknown or negative response, were tested for HBsAg, HBcAb, and HBsAb when exposed to an HBsAg-positive or unknown source. In another study, all HCP were tested only for HBcAb. Finally, in 4 studies, HBV markers (usually HBsAg and Ab) were performed regardless of the HCP vaccinal status or source serostatus.,

Furthermore, in a single study, the source and HCP were also screened for syphilis, and in some cases, the source was screened for hepatitis A virus. These tests account respectively for 13.4% and 1.7% of the total tests performed in the study period.

The antiretroviral HIV PEP regimen was specified in 8 of 13 studies. In 6 studies conducted between 1990 and 2003, a zidovudine-based regimen was adopted alone (in 1 study)or in combination with lamivudine, including a protease inhibitor according to risk (indinavir in 3 studies; nelfinavir in 2 studies). In 2 more recent modeling studies (2006 and 2013), a protease inhibitor-based regimen with lopinavir/ritonavir was considered, adding zidovudine/lamivudineor tenofovir/emtricitabine(Table 5).

### Prevention of human immunodeficiency virus and AIDS: postexposure prophylaxis (including health care workers) [^112HQRD1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is designed to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection after an exposure, is one of several strategies for HIV prevention. PEP was first used after occupational HIV exposures in the late 1980s, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issuing the first set of guidelines that included considerations regarding the use of antiretroviral agents for PEP after occupational HIV exposures in 1990. Use of PEP has been extended to nonoccupational exposures, including after sexual contact or injection-drug use. This article provides a rationale for PEP, assessment of the need for PEP, and details of its implementation.

### HIV postexposure prophylaxis practices by US ED practitioners [^114q6zH6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To determine how often US ED practitioners have prescribed HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (HIV PEP) and to discern how willing they are to offer it to patients, the authors surveyed 600 ED practitioners attending a national conference. According to their self-report, 11% had taken HIV PEP themselves. Sixty-eight percent had prescribed HIV PEP at some time. Of these, 92% had treated needlestick-injured health care workers, 48% sexual assault survivors, and 49% nonhealth care needlestick-injured persons. ED practitioners were more willing to offer HIV PEP after exposures to HIV-infected or high-risk sources than unknown or low- risk sources, as well as after sexual assault than consensual sex. Female practitioners, those who had themselves taken HIV PEP, resident physicians, and ED practitioners with fewer than 6 years of clinical practice were generally more apt to offer HIV PEP. Educational campaigns appear to be necessary to help ED practitioners determine when HIV PEP is appropriate.

### Guidance for occupational health services in medical centers [^111PGcUm]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure risk and post-exposure management for health care workers — Routine patient contact has not been found to increase worker risk of acquiring HIV, and health care workers should be trained, retrained and mandated to follow CDC standard precautions guidelines, with personnel minimizing exposure to potentially infectious body fluids and appropriate personal protective equipment and training available and mandated. A 0.3% risk of HIV infection following needlestick exposures is commonly quoted, and risk of seroconversion following mucous membrane exposure has been estimated at 0.09%, with higher-risk circumstances including deep injury, visible blood on the device, placement directly into an artery or vein, or exposure to a source with elevated viral titers. For postexposure prophylaxis, the need for antiretroviral medications should be evaluated on an individual basis by the employee health physician, and drugs should be made quickly available (preferably within 1 or 2 hours) in accordance with U.S. Public Health Service guidance and provided free of charge. After the initial baseline HIV antibody is drawn, the employee should receive recall notices for follow-up HIV antibody testing at appropriate intervals for at least 6 months unless the source patient has been identified as not having HIV or another bloodborne pathogen, and a follow-up period of 4 months is regarded as adequate when 4th generation blood testing is used for follow-up.

### Postexposure prophylaxis for HIV [^111tqccL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Health care workers are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other infectious pathogens through exposure to blood and body fluids. Antiretroviral medications have been prescribed for postexposure prophylaxis following occupational exposure to the HIV since the early 1990s. This practice has since been extended to nonoccupational situations, such as sexual assaults. The efficacy of prophylactic therapy may be highly time-dependent and should be initiated as soon as possible. Wound care management and referral for social, medical, or advocacy services remain important for all cases.

Data are not available to determine all scenarios in which the HIV prevention benefits of nPEP exceed any potential harms. Notably, contemporary ARVs now available for nPEP regimens are both safer and more tolerable than earlier ARVs. These advances have substantially reduced potential harms associated with a time-limited exposure to these drugs when used as nPEP. Common exposure scenarios and nPEP considerations are provided (Appendix A). Each nPEP evaluation requires individual risk assessment and counseling.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^113eKxJj]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

Source evaluation and testing in nPEP — "HIV testing for the source should be provided if they are available, are unaware or unsure of their HIV status, and agree to testing". For persons being tested, "clinicians should also assess for behaviors associated with HIV exposure and transmission, ensure confirmatory testing is conducted, link the person to care if the test result is positive, and provide HIV PrEP counseling and services if the HIV test result is negative". If "the source is known to have HIV", details on "current viral load and adherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART), history of ARV treatment regimens, and HIV resistance testing are relevant for the care of the exposed person", and when consented and immediately available, "the clinician should consider whether the source has sustained viral suppression and, therefore, is not expected to transmit HIV". When "nPEP is indicated, clinicians should consider all available information as described to design an nPEP regimen most likely to be active against the HIV to which the person was exposed".

### Serious adverse events attributed to nevirapine regimens for postexposure prophylaxis after HIV exposures – worldwide, 1997–2000 [^111AFYa6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2001). Low credibility.

In September 2000, two instances of life-threatening hepatotoxicity were reported in health-care workers taking nevirapine (NVP) for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) after occupational human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure. In one case, a 43-year-old female health-care worker required liver transplantation after developing fulminant hepatitis and end-stage hepatic failure while taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine as PEP following a needlestick injury (1). In the second case, a 38-year-old male physician was hospitalized with life-threatening fulminant hepatitis while taking NVP, zidovudine, and lamivudine as PEP following a mucous membrane exposure. To characterize NVP-associated PEP toxicity, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed MedWatch reports of serious adverse events in persons taking NVP for PEP received by FDA (Figure 1). This report summarizes the results of that analysis and indicates that healthy persons taking abbreviated 4-week NVP regimens for PEP are at risk for serious adverse events. Clinicians should use recommended PEP guidelines and dosing instructions to reduce the risk for serious adverse events.

### Blood and body fluid exposures in the French military [^112vapqa]. Occupational Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Occupational exposure to blood and body fluids (BBFs) is a hazard of many occupations, particularly hospital-based health care providers. However, non-hospital-based health care workers (HCWs) and other personnel not providing health care are also at risk.

Aims

To present the results of surveillance of accidental exposure to BBFs among non-hospital-based French military personnel between 2007 and 2009, comparing different occupational categories.

Methods

The study population included all French military personnel subjected to occupational BBF exposure in a non-hospital setting. BBF exposure was defined as any percutaneous (needlestick injury, scalpel cut, etc.) or mucocutaneous (splash to mucosa, eyes or non-intact skin) exposure to blood, a biological fluid contaminated with blood or a fluid known to transmit blood-borne pathogens.

Results

Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009, 704 occupational BBF exposures were reported in non-hospital-based French military personnel. Annualized BBF exposure incidence rates were statistically different among health care workers in non-hospital settings, firefighters, 'gendarmes' and other military personnel, with respectively 38.7, 5.4, 0.8 and 0.1 exposures per 1000 persons per year. Among the 97 cases of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) initiated, the source patient's HIV status was unknown in 78 cases (84%).

Conclusions

These results suggest that the appropriateness of HIV PEP initiation in the French military should be reviewed. Adapting French guidelines for managing BBF exposure, for non-hospital-based environments should be considered.

### A survey of the management of needlestick injuries from incapacitated patients in intensive care units [^111SzGhh]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

The Human Tissue Act 2004 and Mental Capacity Act 2005 resulted in a change in the management of needlestick injuries sustained from incapacitated patients. It appears unlawful to test for blood-borne viruses without a patient's consent for the sole benefit of the healthcare worker. This survey of intensive care units within England, Wales and Northern Ireland investigated how needlestick injuries from incapacitated patients had been managed within the previous year. Of the 225 intensive care units surveyed, 99 (44%) responded. Sixty-two (62.6%) reported a needlestick injury to a healthcare worker from an incapacitated patient. Thirty-six (64.3%) patients were tested for blood-borne viruses without consent. Sixteen (25.8%) patients tested positive for blood-borne viruses. Only 19 (30.6%) healthcare workers took post-exposure prophylaxis following the injury. These results show that needlestick injuries from incapacitated patients are common and that the majority of patients were tested for blood-borne viruses without consent.

### Seroconversion to HIV-1 following a needlestick injury despite combination post-exposure prophylaxis [^117V3Rdv]. The Journal of Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Post-exposure prophylaxis with antiretroviral drugs for at-risk needlestick injuries has become routine practice and is usually empirical. With increasing numbers of treatment-experienced patients, the choice of antiretroviral may need to be individually tailored. Infection can still occur despite attempts to optimize the drug combination used.

### Needlestick injuries in radiology: prevention and management [^115qqdxT]. Clinical Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Needlestick injuries are common and often underreported in invasive radiological procedures. Prior needlestick injuries have been reported in 86–91% of interventional radiologists, and on average, one needlestick injury occurs for every 5 years of practice. Of those that have had a needlestick injury, only 58% had formal education on needlestick injury prevention. Needlestick injuries can often result in long-term debility if not properly managed. Injuries can result in transmission of blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus. Preventative measures, such as vaccination, proper sharps selection, handling, and disposal during radiological procedures, minimising procedure time, and team communication, can decrease the risk of needlestick injuries and pathogen transmission rate. Initial management involves proper cleaning of the wound and activating the injury reporting system. Further lab testing and post-exposure prophylaxis will depend on the serology status of the source and exposed patient. Needlestick injuries with pathogen transmission can result in long-term health issues and psychological damage, therefore, it is imperative for radiologists to understand factors that increase the risk for transmission, methods to prevent injury, and how to manage an injury when it occurs.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^113fbscM]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) counseling and emergency department implementation — Counseling should cover the plan for follow-up and HIV testing, how and when to take postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) medications, how to obtain medications if the full 28-day course is not provided, and recognition of acute HIV symptoms with instruction to seek care and request HIV testing if these occur in the months after exposure; risk-reduction counseling during the nPEP period should include avoiding condomless sex, sharing injection equipment, and not donating blood or tissues until guideline discontinuation criteria are met. In emergency departments, implementation of protocols and multidisciplinary programs can improve evaluation, testing, medication provision, and follow-up, yet after implementation of a multidisciplinary PEP program in a U.S. emergency department only 11% of PEP patients attended their 4-week follow-up appointment; programs that provide the first dose at initial evaluation and medication in hand before discharge with either the full course or a starter pack "should be considered". Health care professionals should use a culturally sensitive, empathetic, trauma-informed approach, and factors that might improve adherence and completion include clinician encouragement to take nPEP; co-located services with HIV testing and nPEP provision at initial consultation, knowledge that the perpetrator has HIV infection, transportation support, counseling, and treatment reminders.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^116AiG57]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Follow-up of exposed health care personnel (HCP) — importance and 72-hour evaluation are emphasized as follows: HCP who have experienced occupational exposure to HIV should receive follow-up counseling, postexposure testing, and medical evaluation regardless of whether they take PEP. Greater emphasis is placed upon the importance of follow-up of HCP on HIV PEP within 72 hours of exposure. Careful attention to follow-up evaluation within 72 hours of exposure can 1) provide another opportunity to ask questions and ensure understanding of risks for infection and the risks and benefits of PEP, 2) ensure that continued treatment with PEP is indicated, 3) increase adherence to HIV PEP regimens, 4) manage associated symptoms and side-effects more effectively, 5) provide an early opportunity for ancillary medications or regimen changes, 6) improve detection of serious adverse effects, and 7) improve the likelihood of follow-up serologic testing for a larger proportion of exposed personnel to detect infection. Closer follow-up should in turn reassure HCP who become anxious after these events, and the psychological impact of needlesticks or exposure to blood or body fluid should not be underestimated for HCP.

Resistance considerations and timing of nPEP initiation — when source HIV history is available, the regimen can be individualized; expert consultation might be useful but initiation should not be delayed, and if the source's history is unavailable administration of the first dose should not be delayed; if resistance data emerge during PEP, discuss potential regimen modification; resistance to newer generation INSTIs is uncommon and INSTIs are preferred when concern for a drug‑resistant virus exists, although selection of resistant virus is theoretically possible and the likelihood of resistance is unknown because of limited literature.

### Emergency department blood or body fluid exposure evaluations and HIV postexposure prophylaxis usage [^111C8ThS]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the frequency and type of patient visits for blood or body fluid exposures to a large, urban emergency department (ED); to ascertain the frequency that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was prescribed for these exposures; and to compare HIV PEP usage by patient group, occupation, and exposure type.

Methods

Retrospective medical record review of ED patient visits (January 1, 1995, through June 30, 2001) extracted from two separate billing record computerized databases using 14 ICD-9 codes that defined blood or body fluid exposures.

Results

Of the 1,436 visits, 22% were by health care workers (HCWs) and 78% by non-HCW adults, adolescents, or children. Sixty percent of the HCWs sustained needlestick or sharp injuries, 73% of non-HCW adults had human bites, and 81% of adolescents and children had sexual exposures. Nurses were the largest group of HCWs, whereas police, correction officers, and security guards were the largest group of non-HCWs exposed at work. HCWs and non-HCW adults who sustained nonsexual exposures were much more likely to present for an evaluation within 24 hours than adolescents or children who suffered sexual assault (p < 0.001). HIV PEP was prescribed 143 times: 92 to HCWs and 51 to all other patients. HIV PEP was most often prescribed to HCWs sustaining needlestick injuries.

Conclusions

The majority of patients were not HCWs, which attests to the need for national, nonoccupational blood or body fluid management guidelines. There may be particular groups who would benefit from educational campaigns informing them of the need for early-intervention, postexposure measures to prevent an HIV infection.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis with a maraviroc-containing regimen after occupational exposure to a multi-resistant HIV-infected source person [^115xZWNr]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

We report the case of a health care worker who received a post-exposure prophylaxis including an investigational drug, maraviroc, after a needle stick percutaneous injury to an HIV-infected patient with late-stage disease and harboring a multi-drug resistant virus. Post-exposure prophylaxis including maraviroc was pursued for a total of 28 days, with a weekly clinical and biological evaluation. Post-exposure prophylaxis was well tolerated, with no increase in liver function tests. The health care worker remained HIV-negative after a 6-month follow-up.

Estimated per-act probability of acquiring HIV from an infected source — Risk for HIV acquisition (per 10,000 exposures) includes sexual exposures: Receptive anal intercourse 138, Insertive anal intercourse 11, Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse 8, Insertive penile-vaginal intercourse 4, and Receptive oral intercourse Low§ and Insertive oral intercourse Low§; parenteral exposures: Blood transfusion 9,250, Needle sharing during injection drug use 63, and Percutaneous (needle stick) 23; and other exposures: Biting Negligible, Spitting Negligible, and Sharing sex toys Negligible. Risk is considered low relative to the other sexual exposures, but it is not zero; sample size in the study was too small to generate a precise point estimate.

### Occupational malaria following needlestick injury [^111DcfBR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

P. falciparum is a bloodborne pathogen, and malaria is a well-documented complication of transfusion. Malaria has also been diagnosed after intravenous drug use and breaches in infection control procedures, as well as occupational exposures. Occupational P. falciparum infection after a needlestick injury may be rare; however, such an injury can be potentially severe in nonimmune healthcare workers in countries where malaria is not endemic, especially if the occupationally infected person is pregnant. This situation may also become more common as malaria spreads and as increasing international travel brings potential source patients to hospitals in malaria-endemic countries.

HBV, HCV, and HIV are the pathogens most often transmitted in documented cases of occupational infection following needlestick injuries in industrialized countries. Testing for infection by these pathogens does not include all the possible infections that can result from occupational exposure. Although conducting a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding any needlestick injury is a challenge in the daily clinical setting, an investigation should always be carried out. As in this case-patient, the treatment of occupational P. falciparum infection may be delayed because physicians do not immediately consider malaria as a possible diagnosis. Furthermore, healthcare workers with neurologic symptoms caused by P. falciparum malaria may be too ill to tell the treating physician about their occupational exposure. Such infections must be diagnosed promptly as they are potentially lethal, and presumptive treatment is readily available and well tolerated. Clinicians managing healthcare or laboratory workers with a febrile illness or in a postexposure setting should consider the probability of occupational P. falciparum malaria.

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^111v58HR]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Occupational exposures of healthcare personnel (HCP), especially nurses and surgeons, to bloodborne pathogens are frequent events in hospitals. In Italy every day, ~300 HCP sustain an injury involving a contaminated needle or sharp medical device (needlestick and sharps injuries, NSIs), totaling > 100,000 accidents per year, but only an estimated 45% are officially reported. Similar figures are available for the United States where, before legislation mandated widespread implementation of needlestick-prevention devices incorporating a safety mechanism to cover the tip after use (safety-engineered devices, SEDs), 385,000 NSIs were estimated to occur annually, 60% of which were unreported. Available data from other European countries and all continents clearly demonstrate the high NSI burden worldwide. –

These NSIs have the potential to transmit virtually every pathogen present in human blood, either transiently or persistently. However, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), all bearing significant morbidity and mortality, together account for the vast majority of occupational infections reported in healthcare. In 2000, in the absence of interventions to prevent NSIs, these agents were estimated to have caused > 80,000 new infections among HCP per year worldwide.

Therefore, administrative, behavioral, and technical interventions aiming to reduce NSI frequency have been progressively introduced, including recommendations to prevent improper needle manipulations, education, provision of sharps containers for appropriate elimination of used devices, and SEDs. Each intervention has contributed to decreasing NSI frequency, but the best preventative strategy (ie, incorporating all these elements), requires significant investments of time, resources, and effort, which has limited their widespread implementation.

### Biomedical prevention: state of the science [^112S1cf4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

THE CHALLENGE OF NO TRIAL: POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS

The evidence base for PEPSE is at the bottom of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system for rating evidence, relying heavily on preclinical data and cohort data (mainly following occupational injury). Despite this, it is widely available in all countries using ARV drugs licensed for the treatment of HIV. The 72-hour limit for starting PEPSE after exposure is derived from preclinical data but endorsed by clinical data collected after known exposure. Earlier is clearly better. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assess time to start in a randomized trial; however, surely it is time to assess shorter regimens given the evidence that HIV is disseminated 5–10 days after exposure.

HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) algorithm for other exposures — For ≤ 72 hours since exposure, blood or infectious body fluid splash to non-intact skin or mucous membranes is "Case-by-case determination"; injury from discarded needle in the community is "nPEP not recommended unless exceptional circumstances (e.g., freshly bloody discarded needle)"; kissing, mutual masturbation, exposure to body fluids not associated with HIV (e.g., tears, sweat, urine, nasal secretions, saliva) and human bites are "nPEP not routinely recommended". When > 72 hours since exposure, nPEP is "not recommended".

### Brief report: needlestick injury and inadequate post-exposure practice in medical students [^111BfTcz]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Medical students are at a particularly high risk for needlestick injury and its consequences because of their relative inexperience and lack of disability insurance.

Objective

To determine the risk of needlestick injury and the use of post-exposure prophylaxis among medical students.

Design

Internet-based survey.

Participants

The 2003 graduating medical school class at the University of Toronto.

Measurements

Number of needlestick injuries, circumstances surrounding those incidents, and post-exposure actions.

Results

The response rate was 88% (157/178). Over one third (55/157) of respondents suffered at least 1 needlestick injury. In more than half the high-risk injuries, the students continued working and did not seek medical advice. Six students who suffered a needlestick injury began prophylactic human immunodeficiency virus medications. Of those students who suffered an injury, 15% had purchased disability insurance prior to the incident.

Conclusions

Poor use of post-exposure procedures and a lack of disability insurance leave medical students at high risk for career and life-altering consequences from a needlestick injury.

RESULTS

In total, 14 studies from Europe, America, Asia, and Australia published from 1997 to 2013 met all the inclusion criteria., – Their characteristics are reported in Tables 1 and 2.

TABLE 1
Characteristics of the Studies of Economic Analysis of Occupational Needlestick and Sharps Injuries (NSIs) Among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) Included in the Systematic Review, 1997–2013

TABLE 2
Economic Characteristics of the Studies of Economic Analysis on Occupational Needlestick and Sharps Injuries Among Healthcare Personnel Included in the Systematic Review, 1997–2013 (Temporal Publication Order)

Cost Analysis

Of the 14 studies estimating costs, 8 studies were data driven, while 6 studies used modeling (Table 3); 11 studies provided both direct and indirect costs (aggregated or disaggregated), while 3 studies only analyzed direct costs (Tables 2 and 3).

TABLE 3
Distribution of Studies of Economic Analysis on Occupational Needlestick and Sharps Injuries Among Healthcare Personnel According to Type of Provided Costs and Study Approach

Costs were analyzed mainly from a hospital or university perspective in 7 studies; 3 studies adopted the National Health System (NHS) perspective; and 1 study adopted both. A societal perspective was considered in 2 studies, and a national insurance perspective was considered in 1 study.

Direct costs included testing the source and exposed HCP as well as post-exposure medical visits and treatment (ie, prophylaxis). Costs to treat an occupational infection were included in 2 studies only, which reported annual treatment costsand lifetime medical costsfor HBV (Int$3,600 and Int$31,306, respectively), HCV (Int$24,424 and Int$23,173, respectively), and HIV infection (Int$35,745 and Int$441,342, respectively). These were excluded from the calculation of average NSI costs.

### HIV postexposure prophylaxis in the 21st century [^116UCSNw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The administration of postexposure prophylaxis has become the standard of care for occupational exposures to HIV. We have learned a great deal about the safety and potential efficacy of these agents, as well as the optimal management of health-care workers occupationally exposed to HIV. This article describes the current state of knowledge in this field, identifies substantive questions to be answered, and summarizes basic principles of postexposure management.

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^115ifd9b]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite these issues, this review confirms that the economic impact of managing NSIs is not negligible, and our analysis provides clues about where to reduce costs.

Protocols should be optimized based on the source; HCP vaccination should increase, and the response should be appropriately evaluated post-vaccination and readily available in case of injury. This recommendation is clearly demonstrated in the high-quality study by Armadans Gil et al, where most exposures involved vaccinated HCP exposed to known sources who tested negative for HCV and HIV; the mean NSI management cost (direct + indirect) was Int$418.

Additional strategies to reduce costs could include the following: using rapid HIV tests to assess the source serostatus, thus avoiding unnecessary PEP, tests, and anxiety for the exposed HCP, and implementing tests for the early detection of bloodborne infections, which can shorten follow-up periods (eg, HIV-Ab/Ag test) and allow for early diagnosis at a lower cost (eg, HCV core-antigen testing replacing HCV-RNA).

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^116JmfGh]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To provide an overview of the economic aspects of needlestick and sharps injury (NSI) management among healthcare personnel (HCP) within a Health Technology Assessment project to evaluate the impact of safety-engineered devices on health care

METHODS

A systematic review of economic analyses related to NSIs was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement and by searching PubMed and Scopus databases (January 1997–February 2015). Mean costs were stratified by study approach (modeling or data driven) and type of cost (direct or indirect). Costs were evaluated using the CDC operative definition and converted to 2015 International US dollars (Int$).

RESULTS

A total of 14 studies were retrieved: 8 data-driven studies and 6 modeling studies. Among them, 11 studies provided direct and indirect costs and 3 studies provided only direct costs. The median of the means for aggregate (direct + indirect) costs was Int$747 (range, Int$199–Int$1,691). The medians of the means for disaggregated costs were Int$425 (range, Int$48–Int$1,516) for direct costs (9 studies) and Int$322 (range, Int$152–Int$413) for indirect costs (6 studies). When compared with data-driven studies, modeling studies had higher disaggregated and aggregated costs, but data-driven studies showed greater variability. Indirect costs were consistent between studies, mostly referring to lost productivity, while direct costs varied widely within and between studies according to source infectivity, HCP susceptibility, and post-exposure diagnostic and prophylactic protocols. Costs of treating infections were not included, and intangible costs could equal those associated with NSI medical evaluations.

CONCLUSIONS

NSIs generate significant direct, indirect, potential, and intangible costs, possibly increasing over time. Economic efforts directed at preventing occupational exposures and infections, including provision of safety-engineered devices, may be offset by the savings from a lower incidence of NSIs.

### Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113pGHTH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

HIV prevention — behavioral counseling, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are outlined as follows: The USPSTF recognizes that the most effective strategy is primary prevention, or avoidance of exposure, and it recommends providing intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Prophylactic intervention with antiretroviral medications, both preexposure and postexposure, can prevent HIV infection. Postexposure prophylaxis is used in persons without HIV after possible exposure via sexual contact, occupational or nonoccupational needle stick or other injury, or sharing injection drug equipment and, when initiated soon after possible exposure, can prevent HIV infection. Preexposure prophylaxis is used in persons without HIV who are at high risk, consists of antiretroviral medication taken every day before potential exposure, and the USPSTF recommends offering preexposure prophylaxis to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^114xdykp]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) for HIV is recommended when a nonoccupational (e.g. sexual, needle, or other) exposure to nonintact skin or mucous membranes that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission has occurred, and the source has HIV without sustained viral suppression or their viral suppression information is not known. A rapid HIV test (also referred to as point-of-care) or laboratory-based antigen/antibody combination HIV test is recommended before nPEP initiation. Health care professionals should ensure the first dose of nPEP is provided as soon as possible, and ideally within 24 hours, but no later than 72 hours after exposure. The initial nPEP dose should not be delayed due to pending results of any laboratory-based testing, and the recommended length of nPEP course is 28 days.

The recommendations in these guidelines update the 2016 nPEP guidelines (CDC. Updated guidelines for antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV — United States, 2016. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC; 2017). These 2025 nPEP guidelines update recommendations and considerations for use of HIV nPEP in the United States to include newer antiretroviral (ARV) agents, updated nPEP indication considerations, and emerging nPEP implementation strategies. The guidelines also include considerations for testing and nPEP regimens for persons exposed who have received long-acting injectable ARVs in the past. Lastly, testing recommendations for persons who experienced sexual assault were updated to align with the most recent CDC sexually transmitted infection treatment guidelines.

These guidelines are divided into two sections: Recommendations and CDC Guidance. The preferred regimens for most adults and adolescents are now bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide or dolutegravir plus (tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus (emtricitabine or lamivudine). However, the regimen can be tailored to the clinical circumstances. Medical follow-up for persons prescribed nPEP also should be tailored to the clinical situation; recommended follow-up includes a visit at 24 hours (remote or in person) with a medical provider, and clinical follow-up 4–6 weeks and 12 weeks after exposure for laboratory testing. Persons initiating nPEP should be informed that pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV if they will have repeat or continuing exposure to HIV after the end of the nPEP course. Health care professionals should offer PrEP options to persons with ongoing indications for PrEP and create an nPEP-to-PrEP transition plan for persons who accept PrEP.

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^112oSNcg]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The overall aggregate direct + indirect costs for managing an NSI ranged from Int$650 to Int$750, considering the median and mean value of the mean costs borne by the hospital or NHS to manage exposures with different scenarios. These values were derived from both modeling and data-driven studies conducted across different countries and continents over a period of approximately 20 years.

Indirect costs are relatively consistent between studies; they mostly refer to lost productivity, which is usually calculated in minutes spent in baseline and follow-up visits by the exposed HCP and more rarely on days of staff absence; the median and mean values of the mean indirect costs ranged between Int$175 and Int$350.

Direct costs vary. The wide range of possible scenarios regarding the infectivity of the source, the susceptibility of the exposed HCP, and the post-exposure diagnostic and prophylactic protocol account for the differences in the average direct costs within and between considered studies, particularly when analyzing studies using a different approach. In modeling studies, the source and exposed HCP are tested according to an optimized protocol. Prophylaxes are provided to all susceptible HCP, and those protocols are always considered to have been completed. All exposed HCP attend follow-up visits and testing. In real life, HCP anxiety can influence the choice of baseline and follow-up testing, or the source situation may be more complicated (eg, multiple possible sources, need for supplemental, confirmatory testing, etc.). Acceptance, adherence, and completion rate of prophylactic treatments may be suboptimal; regimens may vary and cause adverse reactions requiring additional interventions; and compliance with follow-up protocols may differ.

### Zika vaccines and therapeutics: landscape analysis and challenges ahead [^111VtRKM]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

(2) To prevent Guillain–Barre Syndrome or other ZIKV infection-related neurological complications.

Prophylaxis throughout the duration of exposure (e.g. travel to a Zika endemic area).

Early post-exposure prophylaxis after known exposure to a Zika case (e.g. sexual exposure, nosocomial exposure such as needle stick injury, living in same household of a current Zika case).

INDICATION 2. THERAPY TO ACCELERATE RESOLUTION OF INFECTION
Examples of this approach for Zika. A pregnant woman, who lives in a setting where ZIKV is known to circulate, presents to a clinic with clinical signs and symptoms that could represent ZIKV infection. Out of an abundance of caution, empiric treatment commences before the results of laboratory tests are known (if such tests are available). The purpose of treatment is to accelerate clearance of virus infection from the maternal tissues and mitigate the likelihood of intrauterine or peri- or postnatal virus infection. A second example of treatment is for neonates who have acquired ZIKV from intrauterine exposure or perinatally.
Challenges. As for prophylaxis, the use of a therapeutic agent must be balanced by the safety and cost profile of the drug and the likelihood that treatment will deliver clinical benefits to the fetus, i.e. prevent or modify intrauterine infection. For many Zika cases, viremia is already in rapid decline, or even undetectable by the time the patient presents to healthcare providers. An additional delay is created if treatment is guided by laboratory diagnostics rather than an empiric approach.
Examples of this approach for other infectious diseases. There are no examples for acute viral infections, but in the setting of chronic infections such as HIV, it is well accepted that vertical transmission is RNA copy number-dependent, with higher rates occurring with increasing viral loads present in the mother. Treatment of pregnant women has been demonstrated to drastically reduce the incidence of vertical transmission in women undergoing treatment with a combination of antiretroviral compounds.

### Antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for occupational HIV exposure [^112wpHuv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Populations such as healthcare workers (HCWs), injection drug users (IDUs), and people engaging in unprotected sex are all at risk of being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Animal models show that after initial exposure, HIV replicates within dendritic cells of the skin and mucosa before spreading through lymphatic vessels and developing into a systemic infection (CDC 2001). This delay in systemic spread leaves a "window of opportunity" for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using antiretroviral drugs designed to block replication of HIV (CDC 2001). PEP aims to inhibit the replication of the initial inoculum of virus and thereby prevent establishment of chronic HIV infection.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of antiretroviral PEP post-occupational exposure to HIV.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSearch, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness were searched from 1985 to January 2005 to identify controlled trials. There were no language restrictions. Because no controlled clinical trials were retrieved, the search was repeated on 31 May 2005 in MEDLINE, AIDSearch and EMBASE using a search strategy to identify analytic observational studies. Handsearches of the reference lists of all pertinent reviews and studies found were also undertaken. Experts in the field of HIV prevention were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Types of studies: All controlled trials (including randomized clinical trials and controlled clinical trials). If no controlled trials were found, analytic studies (e.g. cohort and case-control studies) were considered. Descriptive studies (i.e. studies with no comparison groups) were excluded. Types of participants included:HCWs exposed to any known or potentially HIV contaminated product; anyone exposed to a needlestick contaminated by known or potentially HIV-infected blood or other bodily fluid in an occupational setting; andanyone exposed through the mucous membranes to an HIV-infected or potentially infected substance in occupational setting. Excluded: Sex workers (PEP post-sexual exposure is addressed in another Cochrane review (Martín 2005)). Types of interventions: Any intervention that administered single or combinations of antiretrovirals as PEP to people exposed to HIV through percutaneous injuries and/or occupational mucous membrane exposures when the HIV status of the source patient was positive or unknown. Studies comparing two types of PEP regimens were considered, as were studies comparing PEP with no intervention. Types of outcome measures:Incidence of HIV infection in those given PEP versus those given placebo or a different PEP regimen; Adherence to PEP; Complications of PEPTypes of outcome measures: Incidence of HIV infection in those given PEP versus those given placebo or a different PEP regimen; Adherence to PEP; Complications of PEP DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data concerning outcomes, details of the interventions, and other study characteristics were extracted by two independent authors (TY and JA) using a standardized data extraction form (Table 04). A third author (GK) resolved disagreements. The following information was gathered from each included study: location of study, date, publication status, demographics (e.g. age, gender, occupation, risk behavior, etc.) of participants/exposure modality, form of PEP used, duration of use, and outcomes. Odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as the measure of effect. A meta-analysis was performed for adverse events where two-drug regimens were compared with three-drug regimens. Due to overlap between Puro 2000 and Puro 2005, the former was not included in the combined analysis.

Main Results

Effect of PEP on HIV seroconversionNo randomized controlled trials were identified. Only one case-control study was included. HIV transmission was significantly associated with deep injury (OR 15, 95% CI 6.0 to 41), visible blood on the device (OR 6.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 21), procedures involving a needle placed in the source patient's blood vessel (OR 4.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 12), and terminal illness in the source patient (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.0 to 16). After controlling for these risk factors, no differences were detected in the rates at which cases and controls were offered post-exposure prophylaxis with zidovudine. However, cases had significantly lower odds of having taken zidovudine after exposure compared to controls (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.52). No studies were found that evaluated the effect of two or more antiretroviral drugs for occupational PEP. Adherence to and complications with PEPEight reports from observational comparative studies confirmed findings that adverse events were higher with a three-drug regimen, especially one containing indinavir. However, discontinuation rates were not significantly different.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of occupational PEP is based on limited direct evidence of effect. However, it is highly unlikely that a definitive placebo-controlled trial will ever be conducted, and, therefore, on the basis of results from a single case-control study, a four-week regimen of PEP should be initiated as soon as possible after exposure, depending on the risk of seroconversion. There is no direct evidence to support the use of multi-drug antiretroviral regimens following occupational exposure to HIV. However, due to the success of combination therapies in treating HIV-infected individuals, a combination of antiretroviral drugs should be used for PEP. Healthcare workers should be counseled about expected adverse events and the strategies for managing these. They should also be advised that PEP is not 100% effective in preventing HIV seroconversion. A randomized controlled clinical trial is neither ethical nor practical. Due to the low risk of HIV seroconversion, a very large sample size would be required to have enough power to show an effect. More rigorous evaluation of adverse events, especially in the developing world, are required. Seeing that current practice is partly based on results from individual primary animal studies, we recommend a formal systematic review of all relevant animal studies.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^113UwRrJ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US Public Health Service occupational HIV exposure — postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) selection, timing, and expert involvement states that when the source patient's virus is known or suspected to be resistant to one or more PEP drugs, the selection of drugs to which the source person's virus is unlikely to be resistant is recommended; again, expert consultation is strongly advised. If resistance information is not immediately available, the initiation of PEP, if indicated, should not be delayed; the regimen can be modified after PEP has been initiated, whenever such modifications are deemed appropriate. For HCP who initiate PEP, re-evaluation of the exposed person should occur within 72 hours postexposure, and regular consultation with experts in antiretroviral therapy and HIV transmission is strongly recommended. Preferably, a process for involvement of an expert consultant should be formalized in advance of an exposure incident, and at a minimum, expert consultation is recommended for the situations described in Box 1.

### Formulating the future research agenda for postexposure prophylaxis for HIV: methodological challenges and potential approaches [^116zddju]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

During a World Health Organization-convened Guideline Development Group meeting, recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for human immunodeficiency virus were made and research gaps identified.

Methods

We used the PEP clinical management pathway and the Grading of Evidence, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system as a framework to formulate future research questions, describe the most feasible study design, and identify potential biases.

Results

Three key study design formats were identified to address 12 research questions: (1) survey- and interview-driven research to identify barriers to access to PEP and related clinical care; (2) establishment of a global PEP registry to generate data to inform the choice of an optimal PEP drug regimen, record drug toxicities arising from specific PEP regimens, and track follow-up and linkage to care (including transition from PEP to preexposure prophylaxis); and (3) randomized controlled trials to determine the optimal adherence promotion strategies necessary for successful outcomes following PEP.

Conclusions

Positioning key clinical and programmatic research questions within the GRADE framework facilitates the formulation of an evidence-based research agenda and future revisions of guidelines.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^113oetku]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) for HIV is recommended when a nonoccupational (e.g., sexual, needle, or other) exposure to nonintact skin or mucous membranes that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission has occurred, and the source has HIV without sustained viral suppression or their viral suppression information is not known. A rapid HIV test (also referred to as point-of-care) or laboratory-based antigen/antibody combination HIV test is recommended before nPEP initiation. Health care professionals should ensure the first dose of nPEP is provided as soon as possible, and ideally within 24 hours, but no later than 72 hours after exposure. The initial nPEP dose should not be delayed due to pending results of any laboratory-based testing, and the recommended length of nPEP course is 28 days. The recommendations in these guidelines update the 2016 nPEP guidelines (CDC. Updated guidelines for antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV - United States, 2016. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC; 2017). These 2025 nPEP guidelines update recommendations and considerations for use of HIV nPEP in the United States to include newer antiretroviral (ARV) agents, updated nPEP indication considerations, and emerging nPEP implementation strategies. The guidelines also include considerations for testing and nPEP regimens for persons exposed who have received long-acting injectable ARVs in the past. Lastly, testing recommendations for persons who experienced sexual assault were updated to align with the most recent CDC sexually transmitted infection treatment guidelines. These guidelines are divided into two sections: Recommendations and CDC Guidance. The preferred regimens for most adults and adolescents are now bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide or dolutegravir plus (tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) plus (emtricitabine or lamivudine). However, the regimen can be tailored to the clinical circumstances. Medical follow-up for persons prescribed nPEP also should be tailored to the clinical situation; recommended follow-up includes a visit at 24 hours (remote or in person) with a medical provider, and clinical follow-up 4–6 weeks and 12 weeks after exposure for laboratory testing. Persons initiating nPEP should be informed that pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV if they will have repeat or continuing exposure to HIV after the end of the nPEP course. Health care professionals should offer PrEP options to persons with ongoing indications for PrEP and create an nPEP-to-PrEP transition plan for persons who accept PrEP.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^111PvuLU]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US PHS guidelines for occupational exposures to HIV — introduction emphasize that preventing exposures to blood and body fluids is the most important strategy and that healthcare providers and institutions should work to ensure adherence to Standard Precautions, with appropriate work practices, controls, and personal protective equipment; when exposure occurs, appropriate postexposure management is an important element of workplace safety. Antiretrovirals as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) were first considered in CDC guidelines in 1990; in 1996 the first PHS recommendations advocating PEP after occupational exposure were published, and these recommendations have been updated three times, with the most recent guidelines in 2005, after which several new antiretroviral agents were approved by the FDA and additional information on prior agents' use and safety became available. After 7 years' experience with the 2005 guidelines, identified challenges included determining levels of risk for individual incidents, deciding between two- versus three- (or more) drugs in PEP regimens, the high frequency of side effects and toxicities with previously recommended drugs, and initial management of healthcare personnel when the source patient's HIV status was unknown. The PHS working group attempted to address new information and these implementation challenges in this update, and this report encourages using HIV PEP regimens that are optimally tolerated and eliminates the recommendation to assess the level of risk associated with individual exposures.

### Blood-borne viruses in health care workers: prevention and management [^112dTtZT]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Three pathogens account for most cases of occupationally acquired blood-borne infection: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The highest proportion of occupational transmission is due to percutaneous injury (PI) via hollow-bore needles with vascular access. We briefly review prevention and management of blood-borne pathogens in health care workers (HCWs) in developed countries. HCW compliance with standard precautions is necessary for prevention of PI. Safety-engineered devices are now being increasingly promoted as an approach to decreasing the rate of PI. Prevention of HBV transmission requires HCW immunization through vaccination against HBV. In non-vaccinated HCWs (or HCWs with an unknown antibody response to vaccination) exposed to an HbsAg-positive or an untested source patient, post-exposure prophylaxis with HBV vaccine, hepatitis B immunoglobulin or both must be started as soon as possible. Although no available prophylaxis exists for HCV, it is crucial to identify HCV exposure and infection in health care settings and to consequently propose early treatment when transmission occurs. Following occupational exposure with potential for HIV transmission, use of antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis must be evaluated. Patients need to be protected from blood-borne pathogen-infected HCWs, and especially surgeons performing exposure-prone procedures (EPPs) with risk of transmission to the patient. However, HCWs not performing EPPs should be protected from arbitrary administrative decisions that would restrict their practice rights. Finally, it must be emphasized that occupational blood exposure is of great concern in developing countries, with higher risk of exposure to blood-borne viruses because of a higher prevalence of the latter than in developed countries, re-use of needles and syringes and greater risk of sustaining PI, since injection routes are more frequently used for drug administration than in developed countries.

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^1153TgZ5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Data were analyzed by computing mean, median, and standard deviation (SD) as well as minimum and maximum mean costs abstracted from each article. The weighted mean was used to account for the different proportion of resources used according to the type of event. The findings were stratified by study approach and type of cost (direct and/or indirect). All data used in this analysis were true cost data.

Direct and indirect costs of an NSI were evaluated using the CDC operative definitions:

1. Direct costs: Costs generally borne by a healthcare organization when an NSI occurs: baseline and follow-up laboratory testing, PEP, and other treatment eventually provided, including PEP side-effect management. According to which costs are borne by the organization, in certain circumstances, workers' compensation or the management of occupationally exposed HCP may be included with direct costs.

2. Indirect costs: These costs include time and wages diverted to receiving or providing exposure-related care: lost productivity associated with reporting and receiving initial and follow-up treatment for the exposure; healthcare provider time to evaluate and treat an employee; and healthcare provider time to evaluate and test the source, including obtaining informed consent for testing if applicable. For occupational health and infection control practitioners, these measures are part of their job responsibilities and therefore are not considered a diversion. Moreover, when staff absence and compensation are borne by a third-party payer, these may not be included with indirect costs.

When analyzing in detail the items included within direct and indirect costs in each study, the authors originally assigned baseline and follow-up post-exposure visits differently according to the study context. However, when stratifying the study findings, the post-exposure visits, when disaggregated, were always considered as a direct cost and were assigned accordingly.

The quality of each study was evaluated using Drummond's checklist modified by La Torre et al.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^115BLTzF]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Source patient HIV testing — management of occupational HIV exposures: Whenever possible, the HIV status of the exposure source patient should be determined to guide appropriate use of HIV PEP. Investigation of whether a source patient might be in the window period is unnecessary for determining whether HIV PEP is indicated unless acute retroviral syndrome is clinically suspected, and to date, no such instances of occupational transmission have been detected in the United States. Rapid HIV testing facilitates decision-making after exposures to sources whose HIV status is unknown; FDA-approved rapid tests can produce HIV test results within 30 minutes with sensitivities and specificities similar to those of first and second generation enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Third generation chemiluminescent immunoassays can detect HIV specific antibodies two weeks sooner than conventional EIAs and generate test results in an hour or less, and fourth-generation combination p24 antigen-HIV antibody (Ag/Ab) tests allow identification of most infections during the window period. Regardless of test type, all of the above tests are acceptable for determination of source patient HIV status. Administration of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should not be delayed while waiting for test results; if the source patient is determined to be HIV-negative, PEP should be discontinued and no follow-up HIV testing for the exposed provider is indicated.

### Postexposure prophylaxis in children and adolescents for nonoccupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus [^112DrUqy]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can occur in a number of situations unique to, or more common among, children and adolescents. Guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for occupational and nonoccupational (eg, sexual, needle-sharing) exposures to HIV have been published by the US Public Health Service, but they do not directly address nonoccupational HIV exposures unique to children (such as accidental exposure to human milk from a woman infected with HIV or a puncture wound from a discarded needle on a playground), and they do not provide antiretroviral drug information relevant to PEP in children. This clinical report reviews issues of potential exposure of children and adolescents to HIV and gives recommendations for PEP in those situations. The risk of HIV transmission from nonoccupational, nonperinatal exposure is generally low. Transmission risk is modified by factors related to the source and extent of exposure. Determination of the HIV infection status of the exposure source may not be possible, and data on transmission risk by exposure type may not exist. Except in the setting of perinatal transmission, no studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of postexposure use of antiretroviral drugs for the prevention of HIV transmission in nonoccupational settings. Antiretroviral therapy used for PEP is associated with significant toxicity. The decision to initiate prophylaxis needs to be made in consultation with the patient, the family, and a clinician with experience in treatment of persons with HIV infection. If instituted, therapy should be started as soon as possible after an exposure-no later than 72 hours-and continued for 28 days. Many clinicians would use 3 drugs for PEP regimens, although 2 drugs may be considered in certain circumstances. Instruction for avoiding secondary transmission should be given. Careful follow-up is needed for psychologic support, encouragement of medication adherence, toxicity monitoring, and serial HIV antibody testing.

### Should blood-borne virus testing be part of operative consent? When the doctor becomes the patient [^114x2xJt]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Point-of-care testing (POCT) is a sensitive, specific and rapid form of testing for the presence of HIV antibodies. Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV infection can reduce seroconversion rates by up to 80%. Needlestick injuries are the second commonest cause of occupational injury in the NHS and 20% of these occur during operations. In the NHS, in order to protect staff and patients from the risk of bloodborne viruses such as HIV, it is mandatory to report such injuries; however, numerous studies have shown that many groups, particularly doctors, are reluctant to do so. This article outlines the arguments for and against the introduction of preoperatively seeking consent from patients to have their blood tested for HIV via POCT in order to improve the reporting rates of needlestick injuries incurred during surgery and to protect staff from infection.

### World Health Organization guidelines on postexposure prophylaxis for HIV: recommendations for a public health approach [^116ehyzU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) developed recommendations for PEP irrespective of exposure source in recognition of the need to simplify eligibility assessment and prescribing practices. Traditionally, separate PEP guidelines have been developed according to exposure type, with difference guidelines for occupational exposure, nonoccupational exposure, and sexual assault. Recognizing the need to improve uptake and completion rates for PEP, the WHO 2014 guideline does not differentiate between exposure sources, but rather provides recommendations across all exposures. Recommendations for simplifying prescribing approaches and supporting adherence are also provided. In translating this guidance into national PEP guidelines, countries are encouraged to consider the need to provide PEP in a way that maximizes uptake and completion rates.

### Transmission of drug-resistant HIV after an occupational exposure despite postexposure prophylaxis with a combination drug regimen [^115ecHcf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2002). Low credibility.

We documented a case of occupational human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) despite postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with a combination drug regimen after percutaneous injury with a needle from a sharps disposal container in the hospital room of an HIV-infected patient. This failure of PEP with a combination drug regimen may have been related to antiretroviral drug resistance, other factors, or both. This case highlights the importance of preventing injury to prevent occupational transmission of HIV.

### Spare post-exposure prophylaxis with round-the-clock HIV testing of the source patient [^113vZmBe]. AIDS (2001). Low credibility.

After occupational exposures, immediate HIV testing of source patients may avoid the unnecessary use of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Two time periods were compared. Before the availability of 24 h a day immediate testing, PEP was initiated after 12.6% of exposures, compared with 3.7% during the second period. The adjusted relative odds ratio of PEP during the second compared with the first period, was 0.23. The availability of immediate HIV testing limits unnecessary occupational PEP.

### The impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on outcome and practice in trauma: past, present and future [^117YV3JR]. Injury (2006). Low credibility.

Since the initial description of a concentrated outbreak of pneumocystis carnii pneumonia in 1981, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has accounted for nearly 25 million deaths worldwide. This review focuses on estimations of prevalence by geographic region and identification of high-risk populations within each region, outcome for trauma patients with HIV and AIDS and risk management for health care workers who sustain occupational exposures. Trauma surgeons are more likely to encounter patients infected with HIV in geographic areas where HIV prevalence is high or in areas where intravenous drug use, high-risk sexual behaviours and penetrating trauma are more common. Patients with HIV may be expected to have higher rates of infectious and respiratory complications if they have active AIDS and/or liver disease caused by one of the hepatitis viruses. Certain aspects of therapy may change in this group of patients. Clinicians should be aware that highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) might produce complications. Occupational exposure among healthcare workers is uncommon. Cases of infection in healthcare workers from needlesticks are rare. Certain precautions regarding body fluid and needlestick exposures have been widely adopted over the past decade. When percutaneous injury results in known exposure to HIV, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be used and can be expected to be effective in preventing infection in the large majority of cases.

### Management of needlestick injuries: a house officer who has a needlestick [^111uYxJ8]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Since its identification in 1985, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has challenged several aspects of health care delivery. Because HIV is a blood-borne infectious disease, from the early days of the epidemic, concern was raised about risks of occupational exposures and infections among health care workers. Despite the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy, which has effectively modulated HIV into a chronic disease in many settings, risks of occupational infection with 3 blood-borne pathogens remain in the health care workplace. Using the case of a house officer who has a needlestick during a resuscitation attempt, prevention of needlesticks including universal precautions and postexposure management of occupational HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C exposures is discussed.

### Two drugs or three? Balancing efficacy, toxicity, and resistance in postexposure prophylaxis for occupational exposure to HIV [^111NePuQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Thousands of health care workers are potentially exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) each year via occupationally acquired needlesticks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) advise health care workers who experience a high-risk occupational exposure from an HIV-infected patient to begin receiving multidrug antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible, preferably within 36 h after exposure. Although the need to prescribe antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis in a timely fashion is common, few data exist regarding the efficacy and optimal regimen for prophylaxis to prevent transmission. Our objectives were to examine the limited human and animal data on postexposure prophylaxis, to elucidate the factors that affect the choice of 2 versus 3 drugs as the optimal prophylactic drug regimen, and to place these findings within a mathematical framework to help guide the prescription of PEP.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^115VXzgk]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US Public Health Service occupational HIV exposure — postexposure testing schedules — HIV testing should be used to monitor HCP for seroconversion after occupational HIV exposure. After baseline testing at the time of exposure, follow-up testing should be performed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure. Use of fourth generation HIV Ag/Ab combination immunoassays allow for earlier detection of HIV infection, and if a provider is certain that a fourth generation combination HIV Ag/Ab test is used, HIV follow-up testing could be concluded earlier than 6 months after exposure with an alternative schedule of baseline testing, 6 weeks, and then concluded at 4 months after the exposure. Extended HIV follow-up (e.g., for 12 months) is recommended for HCP who become infected with HCV after exposure to a source co-infected with HIV and HCV; whether extended follow-up is indicated in other circumstances is unknown, routine extension is not warranted, and decisions to extend should be based on the clinical judgment of the exposed person's health-care provider and should not be precluded because of HCP anxiety.

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

In addition to improving the care of patients living with HIV, current public health efforts emphasize the usage of PrEP and PEP to prevent HIV transmission. Pre-exposure prophylaxis includes use of ART to prevent transmission of HIV to exposed individuals. It has been studied in multiple settings and is safe and effective for individuals with potential ongoing exposure to HIV. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of PrEP since 2015 and the United States Preventive Services Task Force/Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS) has recommended it since 2019. Pre-exposure prophylaxis regimens include both oral options and long-acting injectables (LAI) for those at risk of sexual transmission (Table 1A). The oral regimens, but not the LAI regimens have been established for individuals who inject drugs. To reduce the stigma of HIV exposure and treatment and to ensure effective treatment is provided, PrEP should be offered without requiring explicit discussion an individual's risk for HIV risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis is indicated in any patient who requests it and is appropriately educated about the risks and benefits associated with use. A systematic review of randomized trials and observational studies demonstrated that the risk of HIV infection reduced from 4.2% to 2.4% with typical use and 1% when adherence was at least 70%.

Table 1A.
First Line Regimens for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) From the United States Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS) and World Health Organization (WHO). a

Post-exposure prophylaxis consists of giving an exposed person a fully active HIV regimen within the first 72 hours following exposure to prevent systemic infection. The practice of giving PEP to exposed health care workers began in the 1990s and has expanded to include nonoccupational exposures since the early 2000s, becoming fully incorporated into national guidelines in the United States in 2005 and WHO recommendations since 2014. Post-exposure prophylaxis is used in isolated event driven situations and in infants born to HIV-infected mothers to disrupt vertical transmission. Outside of a health care occupational exposure, PEP can be used after unprotected sex, a condom breaking during sex, sexual assault, and after sharing needles to inject drugs. Sexual assault is not uncommon with 25% of women and 4% of men having experienced completed or attempted sexual assault in their lifetime in the United States. Unfortunately, women with epilepsy or on ASMs reported higher rates of sexual assault than women without epilepsy (53% vs 32%).

### Recommendations for identification and public health management of persons with chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^116SCZK8]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Early identification of persons with chronic HBV infection enables infected persons to receive necessary care to prevent or delay onset of liver disease, and enables the identification and vaccination of susceptible household contacts and sex partners, interrupting ongoing transmission. Testing has been recommended previously to enable primary prevention of HBV infection among close contacts for pregnant women, household contacts and sex partners of HBV-infected persons, persons born in countries with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence of more than 8%, persons who are the source of blood or body fluid exposures that might warrant postexposure prophylaxis (e.g., needlestick injury to a healthcare worker or sexual assault), and to enable appropriate treatment for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Recently, with the increasing availability of efficacious hepatitis B treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new recommendations for public health evaluation and management for chronically infected persons and their contacts and extended testing recommendations to include persons born in geographic regions with HBsAg prevalence of greater than 2%, men who have sex with men, and injection drug users. Patient and provider education, developing partnerships between health departments and community organizations, and other resources will be needed to assure appropriate populations are tested and care provided for persons newly identified as HBsAg-positive.

HIV Testing and nPEP

Laboratory testing is required to 1) document HIV status of the person seeking an nPEP evaluation (and the exposure source when available and consent has been granted), 2) identify and clinically manage any other conditions that could result from sexual or injection-related exposure to potentially contaminated body fluids, 3) identify any conditions that would affect selection of the nPEP medication regimen, and 4) monitor for safety or toxicities related to the regimen prescribed. Types of HIV tests include nucleic acid tests (NATs) that detect HIV RNA; antigen/antibody combination (Ag/Ab) tests that detect the HIV p24 antigen as well as HIV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies; and antibody (Ab) tests that detect HIV IgM antibodies, IgG antibodies, or both. Different types of HIV tests have different window periods (time between HIV exposure and ability to detect HIV infection) and different sensitivities to detect HIV in the setting of recent ARV exposure. Resources are available to provide additional information about HIV testing.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^111aL6dz]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US PHS occupational HIV exposure risks and modifiers — Risk of transmission after occupational exposures is estimated to be approximately 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2% — 0.5%), and after a mucous membrane exposure, approximately 0.09% (CI = 0.006% — 0.5%). Although episodes after nonintact skin exposure have been documented, the average risk for transmission by this route has not been precisely quantified but is estimated to be less than the risk for mucous membrane exposures. The risk for transmission after exposure to fluids or tissues other than HIV-infected blood also has not been quantified but is probably considerably lower than for blood exposures. Epidemiologic and laboratory studies suggest that multiple factors might affect the risk for HIV transmission after an occupational exposure; in a retrospective case-control study of health care personnel (HCP) with percutaneous exposure, increased risk was associated with 1) a device visibly contaminated with the patient's blood, 2) a needle placed directly in a vein or artery, or 3) a deep injury, and risk also was increased for exposure to blood from source persons with terminal illness; a laboratory study further demonstrated that more blood is transferred by deeper injuries and hollow-bore needles, supporting an inoculum effect. Exposure to a source patient with an undetectable serum viral load does not eliminate the possibility of HIV transmission or the need for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and follow-up testing.

### Updated US public health service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis [^111ZwsmN]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2013). Medium credibility.

US PHS occupational HIV exposure — timing and duration of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) are as follows: PEP should be initiated as soon as possible, preferably within hours of exposure, and occupational exposures to HIV should be considered urgent medical concerns and treated immediately; if the source patient's HIV status is unknown and resolution may require hours or days, antiretroviral medications should be started immediately rather than delayed. Although animal studies show PEP is likely to be less effective when started more than 72 hours postexposure and the interval after which no benefit is gained from PEP for humans is undefined, initiating therapy after a longer interval (e.g., 1 week) might still be considered for exposures that represent an extremely high risk for transmission; if initiation of PEP is delayed, the likelihood increases that benefit might not outweigh the risks inherent in taking antiretroviral medications. The optimal duration of PEP is unknown; because 4 weeks of PEP appeared protective in in vitro, animal and occupational studies, PEP should be administered for 4 weeks, if tolerated.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^112KspcG]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

Injection drug exposure — nPEP considerations by source status are as follows: For exposure to the source's blood when the source has sustained HIV viral suppression (HIV treatment > 6 mos, consistent high level of ART adherence, and HIV RNA < 200 copies/mL or undetectable on all laboratory assessments in the last year, with the most recent HIV RNA test result within 1–2 mos of exposure), case-by-case determination applies; extrapolated data suggest HIV transmission is not expected in this setting, health care professionals should establish that the source has continued to have a high level of ART adherence in the time since the last HIV RNA test, and nPEP decisions must be based on an individual risk assessment and shared decision-making. When the source has HIV with detectable viremia or unknown viral suppression status, nPEP recommended because the scenario represents a substantial risk for HIV acquisition. When it is not known whether the source has HIV, case-by-case determination applies; quantifying the risk for HIV acquisition is not possible when the HIV status of injection partners is unknown, sharing needles and other drug injection equipment that results in blood exposure is associated with increased risk for HIV transmission compared with injection drug use without sharing, and the high level of safety and tolerability of newer nPEP regimens also might factor into discussions when the risk for HIV acquisition is unknown.

Introduction

With advances in HIV prevention and care efforts in the United States, estimated new HIV infections have declined from a peak of 130,000 annually in the mid-1980s to 32,800 in 2022. Further progress in preventing new infections is critical to ending the HIV epidemic. One tool to prevent HIV infection is HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). This effective intervention uses antiretroviral (ARV) medications to reduce the likelihood of HIV acquisition after high-risk exposures. PEP can be nonoccupational (nPEP, e.g. after sexual, needle, or other exposure) or occupational (oPEP, e.g. after needlestick injury during surgery). Although the medications prescribed for nPEP and oPEP are identical, populations of nPEP and oPEP users differ substantially. For instance, oPEP users are typically health care providers or first responders, whereas nPEP users are persons who were exposed to HIV during sexual or injection drug use behavior. As a result, special considerations are needed for the care of nPEP populations and are addressed in these guidelines.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) first provided nPEP recommendations in 2005, which were updated in 2016 to include newer ARV regimens, their side-effect profiles, and cost-effectiveness of nPEP to prevent HIV infection for different exposure types. These 2025 nPEP guidelines update recommendations and considerations for use of HIV nPEP in the United States to include newer ARV agents, updated nPEP indication considerations (e.g. for persons taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] and exposed to HIV), and emerging nPEP implementation strategies. This update also includes considerations for testing and nPEP regimens for persons exposed who have received long-acting injectable ARVs in the past. Lastly, testing recommendations for persons who experienced sexual assault were updated to align with the most recent CDC sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment guidelines. A detailed list of updates is presented (Box 1). These recommendations are intended to guide U.S. health care professionals' clinical management of adults and children potentially exposed to HIV outside of occupational settings.

HIV occupational exposure postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) — expert consultation is recommended for delayed (i.e., later than 72 hours) exposure report, for which the interval after which benefits from PEP are undefined; exposures from an unknown source (e.g., needle in sharps disposal container or laundry) where use of PEP to be decided on a case-by-case basis, consider severity of exposure and epidemiologic likelihood of HIV exposure, and do not test needles or other sharp instruments for HIV; known or suspected pregnancy or breastfeeding in the exposed person, for which provision of PEP should not be delayed while awaiting expert consultation; known or suspected resistance of the source virus to antiretroviral agents, for which selection of drugs to which the source person's virus is unlikely to be resistant recommended and do not delay initiation of PEP while awaiting any results of resistance testing of the source person's virus; toxicity of the initial PEP regimen, where symptoms (e.g. GI symptoms and others) often manageable without changing PEP regimen by prescribing antimotility or antiemetic agents and counseling and support for management of side effects is very important; and serious medical illness in the exposed person, as significant underlying illness (e.g. renal disease) or an exposed provider already taking multiple medications may increase the risk of drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions; expert consultation can be made with local experts or by calling the National Clinicians' Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEPline) at 888–448–4911.

Other exposures — nPEP guidance includes: For human bites, nPEP not routinely recommended; HIV transmission through human bites is rare but has been reported, human bites with no blood exposure are not an indication for nPEP, and exposure to visibly bloody saliva presents some risk for HIV acquisition, in such cases nPEP should be considered; clinical evaluation of human bites should include the possibility that both the bitten person and the person biting might have been exposed to HIV and other bloodborne pathogens such as HCV. For oral-oral exposure (kissing), mutual masturbation, and exposure to body fluids not associated with HIV transmission, nPEP not routinely recommended, because other than exceptional circumstances where blood contamination is visible and the exposed person's mucous membranes or non-intact skin were affected, these exposures represent negligible risk for HIV transmission and nPEP is not indicated. For blood or other infectious body fluid splash to non-intact skin or mucous membranes, case-by-case determination applies; rare cases of HIV acquisition from mucocutaneous exposure to splashed infectious body fluids have been described, and mucus membrane or non-intact skin exposure to blood or infectious body fluid from a source with known detectable HIV viremia is an indication for nPEP, whereas splashes from body fluids not associated with HIV transmission when not visibly bloody are not an indication for nPEP. For injury from a discarded needle in the community, nPEP not recommended unless exceptional circumstances, with no confirmed reports available of HIV acquisition from this route of exposure.

### One-year study of occupational human immunodeficiency virus postexposure prophylaxis [^1149xyja]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

A 12-month experience with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) in a tertiary care center was evaluated for timeliness of treatment and adherence to treatment recommendations. Forty-six health care workers were started on HIV PEP. Risk status of the source patient, rather than type of exposure, was a significant determinant for both initiating and completing treatment. Of those exposed to HIV-positive sources, 79% completed the full 28 days of therapy. Only 22% of all health care workers who started PEP discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. Excluding three cases with significant delays in reporting and one in which treatment was controversial, the mean time from exposure to first dose of PEP was 1 hour and 46 minutes. The use of a defined treatment protocol, with supporting educational material and PEP medication immediately available, is an effective way of managing HIV exposures.

Appendix A — condomless intercourse and oral–genital contact: For "Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom when the source has HIV with detectable viremia or unknown viral suppression status", the rationale states "The recommendation to routinely offer nPEP in this scenario is based on the potential for HIV acquisition (Table 2) and the overall safety and tolerability of current nPEP regimens (17)". When the scenario is "Anal or vaginal intercourse without a condom when it is not known whether the source has HIV", the table indicates Case-by-case determination, noting "Quantifying the likelihood of HIV acquisition in this scenario is not possible. The decision to initiate nPEP must be based on individual risk assessment and shared decision-making", and specifically that "HIV nPEP should be offered to survivors of sexual assault as part of comprehensive post-assault services when the assault included any contact associated with substantial risk for HIV transmission and the source's HIV status is unknown (21)". For "Oral–genital sexual contact without a condom, regardless of source's HIV status", the table states nPEP not routinely recommended and explains "The likelihood of HIV transmission with oral–genital sexual contact is low (22). On the basis of the individual risk assessment, health care professionals might choose to offer nPEP in the presence of other factors that might increase the risk for HIV transmission (e.g., trauma with blood exposure, non-intact mucous membranes, or high-level viremia) (23)".

### HIV prevention in clinical care settings: 2014 recommendations of the international antiviral society-USA panel [^115zmmUm]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emerging data warrant the integration of biomedical and behavioral recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention in clinical care settings.

Objective

To provide current recommendations for the prevention of HIV infection in adults and adolescents for integration in clinical care settings.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Synthesis

Data published or presented as abstracts at scientific conferences (past 17 years) were systematically searched and reviewed by the International Antiviral (formerly AIDS) Society-USA HIV Prevention Recommendations Panel. Panel members supplied additional relevant publications, reviewed available data, and formed recommendations by full-panel consensus.

Results

Testing for HIV is recommended at least once for all adults and adolescents, with repeated testing for those at increased risk of acquiring HIV. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of acute HIV infection and promptly pursue diagnostic testing if suspected. At diagnosis of HIV, all individuals should be linked to care for timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Support for adherence and retention in care, individualized risk assessment and counseling, assistance with partner notification, and periodic screening for common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is recommended for HIV-infected individuals as part of care. In HIV-uninfected patients, those persons at high risk of HIV infection should be prioritized for delivery of interventions such as preexposure prophylaxis and individualized counseling on risk reduction. Daily emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is recommended as preexposure prophylaxis for persons at high risk for HIV based on background incidence or recent diagnosis of incident STIs, use of injection drugs or shared needles, or recent use of nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis; ongoing use of preexposure prophylaxis should be guided by regular risk assessment. For persons who inject drugs, harm reduction services should be provided (needle and syringe exchange programs, supervised injection, and available medically assisted therapies, including opioid agonists and antagonists); low-threshold detoxification and drug cessation programs should be made available. Postexposure prophylaxis is recommended for all persons who have sustained a mucosal or parenteral exposure to HIV from a known infected source and should be initiated as soon as possible.

Conclusions and Relevance

Data support the integration of biomedical and behavioral approaches for prevention of HIV infection in clinical care settings. A concerted effort to implement combination strategies for HIV prevention is needed to realize the goal of an AIDS-free generation.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV [^117HQ4zS]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2011). Low credibility.

Definite or suspected occupational exposure of healthcare workers to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a medical emergency. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with antiretroviral drugs is widely available following such exposure, aiming to prevent HIV infection. PEP following non-occupational exposure (nPEP) is also increasingly being provided. The term PEPSE (PEP following sexual exposure) is also commonly used, recognising that most non-occupational exposure is sexual. Here we discuss the evidence supporting the use of PEP and nPEP and advice in current guidelines.

### 'Stat' workflow modifications to expedite care after needlestick injuries [^114c41Sc]. Occupational Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is recommended to start within hours of needlestick injuries (NSIs) among healthcare workers (HCWs). Delays associated with awaiting the results of testing from the source patient (whose blood was involved in the NSI) can lead to psychological consequences for the exposed HCW as well as symptomatic toxicities from empiric PEP.

Aims

After developing a 'stat' (immediate) workflow that prioritized phlebotomy and resulting of source patient bloodwork for immediate handling and processing, we retrospectively investigated whether our new workflow had (i) decreased HIV order-result interval times for source patient HIV bloodwork and (ii) decreased the frequency of HIV PEP prescriptions being dispensed to exposed HCWs.

Methods

We retrospectively analysed NSI records to identify source patient HIV order-result intervals and PEP dispensing frequencies across a 6-year period (encompassing a 54-month pre-intervention period and 16-month post-intervention period).

Results

We identified 251 NSIs, which occurred at similar frequencies before versus after our intervention (means 3.54 NSIs and 3.75 NSIs per month, respectively). Median HIV order-result intervals decreased significantly (P < 0.05) from 195 to 156 min after our intervention, while the proportion of HCWs who received one or more doses of PEP decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from 50% (96/191) to 23% (14/60).

Conclusion

Using a 'stat' workflow to prioritize source patient testing after NSIs, we achieved a modest decrease in order-result intervals and a dramatic decrease in HIV PEP dispensing rates. This simple intervention may improve HCWs' physical and psychological health during a traumatic time.

### Seroconversion rate among health care workers exposed to HIV-contaminated body fluids: the university of Pittsburgh 13-year experience [^116RQUwZ]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The studies enumerating the risk of HIV transmission to health care workers (HCWs) as 0.3% after percutaneous exposure to HIV-positive blood, and 0.09% after a mucous membrane exposure, are weakened by dated literature. Our study aims to demonstrate the seroconversion rate after exposure to HIV-contaminated body fluids in a major academic center in the United States.

Methods

A prospectively maintained database of reported occupational injuries occurring between 2002 and 2015 at an academic medical center was analyzed. Data collected included the type of injury, injured body part, type of fluid, contamination of sharps, involvement of resident physicians, use of postexposure prophylaxis, and patients' HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus status.

Results

A total of 266 cases were included in the study. Most exposures were caused by percutaneous injuries (52.6%), followed by 43.2% mucocutaneous injuries. Of the injuries, 52.6% were to the hand and 33.5% to the face and neck. Blood exposure accounted for 64.3% of all cases. Of the patients, 21.1% received postexposure prophylaxis. None of the HCWs exposed to HIV-contaminated body fluids seroconverted (seroconversion rate,0%).

Conclusions

HIV does not seem to be as easily transmitted by needlestick, laceration, or splash injuries as previously surmised. Further large-scale and multicenter studies are needed for a more accurate estimation of the risk of transmission of HIV in U.S. health care workers.

Recommendations

The following section provides recommendations to clinicians from the beginning of the nPEP evaluation to the completion of nPEP therapy (Box 2). "HIV nPEP Indications" details the situations in which nPEP should and should not be administered. "Time to Initiation of HIV nPEP" stresses rapid initiation of nPEP and explains the rationale behind this recommendation. "HIV nPEP Regimens" provides preferred and alternative nPEP regimens. "Laboratory Testing and nPEP Follow-Up" outlines initial and monitoring laboratory tests recommended for nPEP. Finally, "Transitioning to PrEP after PEP" outlines the indications for and management of transitioning persons from nPEP to PrEP.

BOX 2
CDC recommendations for HIV nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis, United States, 2025

HIV nPEP Indications

nPEP is recommended when an exposure has occurred within the past 72 hours that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission and the source has HIV without sustained viral suppression or their viral suppression information is not known (good practice statement, existing recommendation).
A case-by-case determination is required when an exposure has occurred within the past 72 hours that presents a substantial risk for HIV transmission, but it is not known whether the source has HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation).
nPEP is not recommended if the exposure presents no substantial risk for HIV transmission (good practice statement, existing recommendation).
nPEP should be stopped if at any point during the course the source is found to not have HIV (good practice statement, existing recommendation).

### Occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens in IR – risks, prevention, and recommendations: a joint guideline of the Society of Interventional Radiology and cardiovascular and interventional radiological society of Europe [^112TaFwf]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) occupational exposure risk and postexposure resources — HIV is transmitted similarly to HBV and HCV but with the lowest efficiency, with an estimated risk of 0.3% after needlestick from an HIV-contaminated needle and 0.1% after intact mucosal contact with HIV-positive blood; risk increases with hollow needles, larger inoculum or higher viral load, and compromised HCW immunity, and physicians can check specified Web sites for updated information and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) protocols.

### How much do needlestick injuries cost? A systematic review of the economic evaluations of needlestick and sharps injuries among healthcare personnel [^114KHs3T]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Low credibility.

Moreover, regardless of the approach, treatment costs vary between studies: the standard antiretroviral PEP regimen changed significantly over time, including different combinations and newer, more tolerable and expensive drugs in recent studies. Variations in HBIG dosage among protocols increased costs up to 4-fold, and diagnostic tests evolved over time. Two recent modeling studies considering direct and indirect costs and using newer antiretrovirals had a median cost of Int$1,187 (range, Int$1,049–Int$1,324); however, too few recent studies are available to define a real and current overall cost.

Notwithstanding all the observed differences, comparisons between studies also identified significant similarities. Therefore, considering the wide range of possible situations, settings, and behaviors covered in selected studies, this overall amount (including direct and indirect costs) should represent a reliable estimate of the actual average cost for managing an NSI. However, the wide range of observed values should be taken into due account to avoid under- or overestimating the economic costs of managing these incidents or the potential savings resulting from their prevention.

A cautious interpretation of these findings is warranted. The literature search may be incomplete; moreover, different periods, countries, and study designs were compared. Part of the heterogeneity due to the approach and type of estimated costs was controlled by stratifying the studies. Furthermore, weighted means were calculated where disaggregated costs were available. However, this was not possible for all the studies considered. The effect of this heterogeneity is evident in the high variability (SD of the mean and width of the range) of the estimates. In addition, Drummond's checklist was designed to include all possible aspects concerning economic evaluations, but in this review, different study designs were compared, and it was not possible to apply all items to all articles. To eliminate disparities between the studies, a quality score was calculated based on the items considered appropriate for each study.

### Notes from the field: occupationally acquired HIV infection among health care workers-United States, 1985–2013 [^115KarNr]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During 1985–2013, 58 confirmed and 150 possible cases of occupationally acquired HIV infection among HCWs were reported to CDC; since 1999, only one confirmed case (a laboratory technician sustaining a needle puncture while working with a live HIV culture in 2008) has been reported (1; Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, CDC, unpublished data, 2014) (Figure). Among the 58 confirmed cases, the routes of exposure resulting in infection were: percutaneous puncture or cut (49 cases), mucocutaneous exposure (five), both percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposure (two), and unknown (two). A total of 49 HCWs were exposed to HIV-infected blood, four to concentrated virus in a laboratory, one to visibly bloody fluid, and four to unspecified body fluids. Occupations of the HCWs with confirmed or possible HIV infection have varied widely (Table).

CDC recommends the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure of HCWs to potentially infectious body fluids when working with any patient, whether known to be infected with HIV or not. HCWs should assume that body fluids from all patients are infectious even if the patients are not known to be infected with HIV. Proper implementation of standard precautions (e.g. use of safety devices and barriers such as gloves and goggles) minimizes exposure risk. To prevent unintentional puncture injuries, CDC recommends a comprehensive prevention program consistent with requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's bloodborne pathogens standard. * Medical devices engineered for sharps † protection (e.g. needleless systems) should be used. Used devices such as syringes or other sharp instruments should be disposed of in sharps containers without any attempt to recap needles. HCWs should immediately wash hands and other skin surfaces after contact with blood or body fluids. Although preventing exposures to blood and body fluids is the most important strategy for preventing occupationally acquired HIV, when occupational exposures do occur, appropriate postexposure management is critical. Guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to HIV and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis have been published.

### Antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis after sexual, injection drug use, or other nonoccupational exposure to HIV recommendations, United States, 2025 [^113H6J67]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). High credibility.

Nonoccupational HIV postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) — counseling and follow-up: Health care professionals should ensure that persons seeking nPEP services are provided with necessary counseling and education about nPEP and HIV prevention, and the prescriber or support staff should follow up within 24 hours of the initial visit to confirm access to medications and assess initial tolerability and adherence. Medical follow-up should include at minimum a visit at 24 hours (remote or in person) with a medical provider, and clinical follow-up 4–6 weeks and 12 weeks after exposure for laboratory testing. Counseling should include topics such as the likelihood that the person was exposed to HIV and their risk for infection, indication and timeline for nPEP initiation, and the importance of taking the first dose as soon as possible, taking the medication daily, and taking the full course unless instructed to stop by a health care professional.

Additional routes of HIV transmission and testing recommendation — Additional routes of HIV transmission in children include sexual abuse, receipt of contaminated blood products, and needlestick with contaminated needles, and acquisition of HIV in older children is possible through accidental needlestick injuries, sexual transmission, or injection drug use. Therefore, age-appropriate HIV testing is recommended for infants and children with signs and/or symptoms of HIV infection, even in the absence of documented or suspected perinatal or non-perinatal HIV exposure.
