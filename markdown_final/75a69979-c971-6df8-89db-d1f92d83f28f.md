## Question

Delayed cord clamping purpose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the purpose of delayed cord clamping. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core physiological rationale and mechanism. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by gestational age, especially preterm versus term outcomes. Next, I will quantify benefits and weigh risks, including maternal safety. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations and how they differ by context. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, implementation nuances, and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental purpose: delayed cord clamping allows continued blood transfer from the placenta to the newborn, increasing circulating blood volume by roughly 25–30 mL/kg, which improves preload, cardiac output, and oxygen-carrying capacity during the critical transition from fetal to neonatal circulation. This placental transfusion also delivers iron and stem cells that may support neurodevelopment and organ function, so the purpose is both hemodynamic stabilization and nutritional/developmental enrichment [^117N1YiC] [^114z5VMb] [^115FjVNw].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence in preterm infants, because that's where the mortality signal is most compelling. High-certainty data show deferred cord clamping reduces death before discharge in preterm infants, with an odds ratio around 0.68 and consistent effects across subgroups; longer delays (≥ 120 seconds) appear to confer the greatest mortality reduction, and benefits extend to fewer transfusions and improved hematologic measures, supporting a strong recommendation to delay clamping when feasible [^113K82BB] [^117Jrme9] [^1179dhkx].

> I should confirm the magnitude of benefit in the most vulnerable subgroup. In infants ≤ 28 weeks, deferred clamping reduced hospital mortality with a risk ratio near 0.70 and a number needed to benefit around 20, reinforcing the clinical importance of this practice in extremely preterm births when resuscitation can proceed with the cord intact or with minimal delay [^116J8Mbh] [^117Jrme9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about term infants; I need to check the balance of benefits and risks. In term neonates, delayed clamping increases hemoglobin at birth and improves iron stores for up to 6 months, with potential neurodevelopmental advantages in fine motor and social domains, but there is a modest increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy; importantly, maternal outcomes are not adversely affected, including no increase in postpartum hemorrhage or blood loss, so the net benefit remains favorable when systems are in place to manage jaundice [^1179dhkx] [^117XNpgT] [^116J8Mbh].

> Let me consider the physiologic rationale more deeply, because mechanism informs timing. Experimental and translational work suggests that clamping after lung aeration and spontaneous breathing improves hemodynamic transition; this is the basis for physiological-based cord clamping, where clamping is deferred until the infant achieves stable respirations and adequate oxygenation, which may further optimize outcomes in preterm infants requiring support [^114oX7kn] [^113JVyjU] [^112GgiFt].

> Next, I should review guideline convergence to ensure my recommendations align with best practice. ACOG recommends 30–60 seconds for vigorous term and preterm infants, WHO advises ≥ 60 seconds when resuscitation is not required, AAP/AHA endorse at least 60 seconds for preterm infants and consider ≥ 60 seconds for term infants, and SOGC recommends 60–120 seconds for preterm and 60 seconds for term infants, with shared emphasis on individualized decisions when resuscitation is needed [^116J8Mbh] [^1128tcU3] [^113aAspb] [^11412mgi] [^114xUSs7] [^114oX7kn].

> But wait, what if the infant is non-vigorous or requires resuscitation? I should double-check the stance on intact-cord resuscitation. Emerging evidence and guidelines support considering resuscitation with an intact cord when appropriate equipment and training are available, while acknowledging that many centers still default to immediate clamping; cord milking is an alternative when DCC is not feasible, though data are less consistent for mortality and safety concerns persist in extremely preterm infants, so shared decision-making and local protocols are essential [^111ecqP5] [^113WGPrL] [^114z5VMb] [^112LLawh].

> I need to ensure I address maternal safety and special delivery contexts. Randomized and meta-analytic data show no increase in maternal blood loss or postpartum hemorrhage with delayed clamping, including at cesarean delivery, and neonatal hematocrit is higher with DCC at cesarean, supporting implementation in operative births when feasible; however, cord blood banking yields are reduced with DCC, so families should be counseled accordingly [^1146fDXx] [^116P8Mhy] [^116NJBhf] [^116G4VQC].

> Let me reconsider potential contraindications and modifiers so I don't overgeneralize. Absolute contraindications include the need for immediate maternal or neonatal resuscitation, disrupted utero-placental circulation such as vasa previa with bleeding, and twin-twin transfusion physiology; relative cautions include marked hyperbilirubinemia risk, severe IUGR, and certain twin scenarios, where individualized risk–benefit assessment and documentation of timing are advised [^116jEZF3] [^1157Fv1w].

> I should confirm practical implementation details that influence volume of placental transfusion. Positioning the infant at or below the level of the placenta or cesarean incision is reasonable, and gravity effects are modest; recording the exact clamping time and ensuring neonatal readiness for transition are key steps to standardize practice and capture outcomes [^116fYz9e] [^113Rxwsc].

> In summary, the purpose of delayed cord clamping is to facilitate placental transfusion, stabilize neonatal hemodynamics, reduce the need for transfusions, and improve survival in preterm infants, while enhancing iron stores and potentially neurodevelopment in term infants, with minimal maternal risk when implemented thoughtfully; aligning with major guidelines, a delay of 30–60 seconds is reasonable in vigorous infants, with 60–120 seconds favored when feasible, and longer, physiology-based delays considered in preterm infants requiring support, always balancing exceptions and local capacity [^113K82BB] [^117Jrme9] [^116J8Mbh] [^1128tcU3] [^114xUSs7].

Delayed cord clamping (DCC) delays clamping the umbilical cord for **30–60 seconds** [^116J8Mbh] after birth to allow placental transfusion of blood, increasing neonatal blood volume, hemoglobin, and iron stores [^112zjnoz]. In preterm infants, DCC reduces mortality [^113K82BB], intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and the need for transfusions [^116J8Mbh]; in term infants, it improves iron status and may benefit neurodevelopment [^1179dhkx], with a small increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy [^116J8Mbh]. DCC is recommended for most vigorous infants, but not when immediate resuscitation is needed or in specific maternal–fetal conditions [^116jEZF3].

---

## Physiological rationale

DCC allows continued placental transfusion, transferring **~30% of the fetal–placental blood volume** to the newborn, which:

- **Increases blood volume**: Improves circulatory stability and organ perfusion [^117N1YiC].
- **Raises hemoglobin and iron**: Enhances oxygen-carrying capacity and reduces anemia risk [^112zjnoz].
- **Supports transition**: Facilitates pulmonary circulation and lung aeration [^114oX7kn].

---

## Clinical benefits

### Preterm infants

In preterm infants, DCC provides **significant benefits**:

| **Outcome** | **Effect of dcc** |
|-|-|
| Mortality | Reduced by ~28% (OR 0.68) [^113K82BB] |
| Intraventricular hemorrhage | Reduced incidence [^1148sW8L] |
| Necrotizing enterocolitis | Lower risk [^116J8Mbh] |
| Need for transfusion | Decreased requirement [^1148sW8L] |

---

### Term infants

In term infants, DCC offers **modest but meaningful benefits**:

- **Iron stores**: Improved hematologic status and reduced anemia at 4–6 months [^112zjnoz] [^117XNpgT].
- **Neurodevelopment**: Possible improvements in fine motor and social domains at 4 years [^1179dhkx].
- **Polycythemia**: Small increase, usually benign and manageable [^112zjnoz].

---

## Potential risks

DCC is generally safe; the main risk is a **small increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy**, which is manageable with standard care [^116J8Mbh] [^115tFdcE]. No increase in maternal postpartum hemorrhage or neonatal infection has been observed [^116J8Mbh] [^117XNpgT].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major organizations recommend DCC for **30–60 seconds** in vigorous infants:

- **ACOG**: ≥ 30–60 seconds for term and preterm infants not requiring immediate resuscitation [^116J8Mbh].
- **WHO**: ≥ 60 seconds when resuscitation is not needed [^1128tcU3].
- **AAP/AHA**: ≥ 60 seconds for preterm; consider ≥ 60 seconds for term infants [^113aAspb] [^11412mgi].

---

## Situations where delayed cord clamping may not be appropriate

DCC should be avoided or modified in the following scenarios:

- **Immediate resuscitation**: Non-vigorous infants needing urgent support [^116jEZF3].
- **Maternal instability**: Hemodynamic instability or active hemorrhage [^111Dnar2].
- **Specific conditions**: Placental abruption, vasa previa, twin-twin transfusion, or severe fetal growth restriction [^116jEZF3] [^1157Fv1w].

---

## Alternative strategies

When DCC is not feasible, **umbilical cord milking** can be considered, especially in preterm infants, though evidence is less robust and it is not preferred over DCC in preterm infants [^112LLawh] [^113K82BB].

---

Delayed cord clamping is a simple, low-cost intervention that **improves hematologic and developmental outcomes** in term infants and reduces mortality and morbidity in preterm infants, with minimal risks when guidelines are followed [^113K82BB] [^112zjnoz].

## References

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^116J8Mbh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion 814 — delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth — states that in term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes, and in preterm infants it is associated with significant neonatal benefits including improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. It notes a small increase in the incidence of jaundice that requires phototherapy in term infants undergoing delayed umbilical cord clamping, and consequently obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers adopting delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants should ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor and treat neonatal jaundice. Delayed umbilical cord clamping was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage or increased blood loss at delivery, nor was it associated with a difference in postpartum hemoglobin levels or the need for blood transfusion. Given these benefits, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in vigorous term and preterm infants for at least 30–60 seconds after birth, and also states that the ability to provide delayed umbilical cord clamping may vary among institutions and settings; decisions in those circumstances are best made by the team caring for the mother–infant dyad.

### Delayed vs early umbilical cord clamping for preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1148sW8L]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of delayed cord clamping of the umbilical cord in preterm infants are unclear.

Objective

We sought to compare the effects of delayed vs early cord clamping on hospital mortality (primary outcome) and morbidity in preterm infants using Cochrane Collaboration neonatal review group methodology.

Study Design

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Chinese articles, cross-referencing citations, expert informants, and trial registries to July 31, 2017, for randomized controlled trials of delayed (≥ 30 seconds) vs early (< 30 seconds) clamping in infants born < 37 weeks' gestation. Before searching the literature, we specified that trials estimated to have cord milking in > 20% of infants in any arm would be ineligible. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed bias, and extracted data. Relative risk (ie, risk ratio), risk difference, and mean difference with 95% confidence intervals were assessed by fixed effects models, heterogeneity by I² statistics, and the quality of evidence by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations.

Results

Eighteen randomized controlled trials compared delayed vs early clamping in 2834 infants. Most infants allocated to have delayed clamping were assigned a delay of ≥ 60 seconds. Delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–0.90; risk difference, -0.03; 95% confidence interval, -0.05 to -0.01; P = 0.005; number needed to benefit, 33; 95% confidence interval, 20–100; Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations = high, with I² = 0 indicating no heterogeneity). In 3 trials in 996 infants ≤ 28 weeks' gestation, delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.95; risk difference, -0.05; 95% confidence interval, -0.09 to -0.01; P = 0.02, number needed to benefit, 20; 95% confidence interval, 11–100; I² = 0). In subgroup analyses, delayed clamping reduced the incidence of low Apgar score at 1 minute, but not at 5 minutes, and did not reduce the incidence of intubation for resuscitation, admission temperature, mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, brain injury, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, late onset sepsis or retinopathy of prematurity. Delayed clamping increased peak hematocrit by 2.73 percentage points (95% confidence interval, 1.94–3.52; P < .00001) and reduced the proportion of infants having blood transfusion by 10% (95% confidence interval, 6–13%; P < .00001). Potential harms of delayed clamping included polycythemia and hyperbilirubinemia.

Conclusion

This systematic review provides high-quality evidence that delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality, which supports current guidelines recommending delayed clamping in preterm infants. This review does not evaluate cord milking, which may also be of benefit. Analyses of individual patient data in these and other randomized controlled trials will be critically important in reliably evaluating important secondary outcomes.

### Committee opinion no.543: timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth [^115HDpB6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The optimal timing for clamping the umbilical cord after birth has been a subject of controversy and debate. Although many randomized controlled trials in term and preterm infants have evaluated the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping versus immediate umbilical cord clamping, the ideal timing for cord clamping has yet to be established. Several systematic reviews have suggested that clamping the umbilical cord in all births should be delayed for at least 30–60 seconds, with the infant maintained at or below the level of the placenta because of the associated neonatal benefits, including increased blood volume, reduced need for blood transfusion, decreased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants, and lower frequency of iron deficiency anemia in term infants. Evidence exists to support delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants, when feasible. The single most important clinical benefit for preterm infants is the possibility for a nearly 50% reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage. However, currently, evidence is insufficient to confirm or refute the potential for benefits from delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants, especially in settings with rich resources.

### A review of different resuscitation platforms during delayed cord clamping [^111ecqP5]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

There is a large body of evidence demonstrating that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord provides benefits for term and preterm infants. These benefits include reductions in mortality in preterm infants and improved developmental scores at 4 years of age in term infants. However, non-breathing or non-vigorous infants at birth are excluded due to the perceived need for immediate resuscitation. Recent studies have demonstrated early physiological benefits in both human and animal models if resuscitation is performed with an intact cord, but this is still an active area of research. Given the large number of ongoing and planned trials, we have brought together an international group that have been intimately involved in the development or use of resuscitation equipment designed to be used while the cord is still intact. In this review, we will present the benefits and limitations of devices that have been developed or are in use. Published trials or ongoing studies using their respective devices will also be reviewed.

### A global perspective of delayed cord clamping in infants [^115FjVNw]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping, DCC, a practice in which the umbilical cord is not clamped immediately after birth, promotes placental transfusion to preterm and term neonates. DCC may improve outcomes in preterm neonates by reducing mortality and blood transfusion requirements and increasing iron stores. Despite the recommendations from multiple governing bodies, including the World Health Organization, research on DCC in LMICs remains limited. Given that iron deficiency is prevalent, and most neonatal deaths occur in LMICs, DCC has the potential to improve outcomes in these settings. This article aims to provide a global perspective on DCC in LMICs and to identify knowledge gaps that offer future research opportunities.

### Clamping of the umbilical cord and placental transfusion (scientific impact paper no. 14) [^115tFdcE]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to considerations for delayed cord clamping, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to delay umbilical cord clamping in healthy term infants, as this appears to improve iron stores in infancy. Recognize that jaundice may be more common after delayed umbilical cord clamping but this management is likely to be beneficial as long as phototherapy for jaundice is available.

### Timing of cord clamping in very preterm infants: more evidence is needed [^112YayRx]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

In December 2012, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists published a Committee Opinion entitled "Timing of umbilical cord clamping after birth". It stated that "evidence exists to support delayed cord clamping in preterm infants, when feasible. The single most important benefit for preterm infants is the possibility for a nearly 50% reduction in IVH". However, the Committee Opinion added that the ideal timing of umbilical cord clamping has yet to be determined and recommended that large clinical trials be conducted in the most preterm infants. Published randomized controlled trials include < 200 infants of < 30 weeks' gestation, with assessments of neurodevelopmental outcome in less than one-half of the children. This is a major gap in the evidence. Without reliable data from randomized controlled trials that optimally include childhood follow-up evaluations, we will not know whether delayed cord clamping may do more overall harm than good. Ongoing trials of delayed cord clamping plan to report childhood outcomes in > 2000 additional very preterm infants. Current recommendations may need to change when these results become available. Greater international collaboration could accelerate resolution of whether this promising intervention will improve disability-free survival in about 1 million infants who will be born very preterm globally each year.

### Committee opinion no. 684: delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth [^115MBkeS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping appears to be beneficial for term and preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes. There is a small increase in jaundice that requires phototherapy in this group of infants. Consequently, health care providers adopting delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants should ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor for and treat neonatal jaundice. In preterm infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with significant neonatal benefits, including improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. Delayed umbilical cord clamping was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage or increased blood loss at delivery, nor was it associated with a difference in postpartum hemoglobin levels or the need for blood transfusion. Given the benefits to most newborns and concordant with other professional organizations, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in vigorous term and preterm infants for at least 30–60 seconds after birth. The ability to provide delayed umbilical cord clamping may vary among institutions and settings; decisions in those circumstances are best made by the team caring for the mother-infant dyad.

### Late vs early clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates: systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^112zjnoz]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

With few exceptions, the umbilical cord of every newborn is clamped and cut at birth, yet the optimal timing for this intervention remains controversial.

Objective

To compare the potential benefits and harms of late vs early cord clamping in term infants.

Data Sources

Search of 6 electronic databases (on November 15, 2006, starting from the beginning of each): the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Neonatal Group trials register, the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINHAL; hand search of secondary references in relevant studies; and contact of investigators about relevant published research.

Study Selection

Controlled trials comparing late vs early cord clamping following birth in infants born at 37 or more weeks' gestation.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data for outcomes of interest: infant hematologic status; iron status; and risk of adverse events such as jaundice, polycythemia, and respiratory distress.

Data Synthesis

The meta-analysis included 15 controlled trials (1912 newborns). Late cord clamping was delayed for at least 2 minutes (n = 1001 newborns), while early clamping in most trials (n = 911 newborns) was performed immediately after birth. Benefits over ages 2 to 6 months associated with late cord clamping include improved hematologic status measured as hematocrit (weighted mean difference [WMD], 3.70%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00%-5.40%); iron status as measured by ferritin concentration (WMD, 17.89; 95% CI, 16.58–19.21) and stored iron (WMD, 19.90; 95% CI, 7.67–32.13); and a clinically important reduction in the risk of anemia (relative risk (RR), 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.70). Neonates with late clamping were at increased risk of experiencing asymptomatic polycythemia (7 studies [403 neonates]: RR, 3.82; 95% CI, 1.11–13.21; 2 high-quality studies only [281 infants]: RR, 3.91; 95% CI, 1.00–15.36).

Conclusions

Delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates for a minimum of 2 minutes following birth is beneficial to the newborn, extending into infancy. Although there was an increase in polycythemia among infants in whom cord clamping was delayed, this condition appeared to be benign.

### Randomised trial of cord clamping at very preterm birth: outcomes at 2 years [^116sGz1C]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2020). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

A short delay in umbilical code clamping may reduce the risk of death before hospital discharge at very preterm birth.
Immediate neonatal care can be provided with the cord intact, allowing cord clamping to be deferred for longer in babies requiring resuscitation at birth.
Previous trials have been small, and few have reported outcomes beyond discharge from hospital.

What this study adds?

Neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years corrected age is feasible using a range of strategies, including routine clinical data.
Deferred clamping with immediate neonatal care, if needed, may reduce the risk of death or adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age.
Large high-quality trials and meta-analysis of individual participant data from these trials are needed to confirm the true benefits and harms.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on delayed umbilical cord clamping [^1175zNPN]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RECOMMENDATIONS

Delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity. In term‐born babies, it also seems to improve the short‐ and long‐term outcomes and showed favorable scores in the fine motor and social domains at 4 years of age.

However, there is insufficient evidence to show what duration of delay is best. The current evidence supports not clamping the cord before 30 seconds for preterm births. Future trials could compare different lengths of delay. Until then, at term a period of 30 seconds to 3 minutes seems justified or until the cord is collapsed and white.

For both preterm and term‐born babies, during the cord clamping delay, attempts should be made to get them to breathe spontaneously. Additional research is needed to examine the long‐term child outcome related to the timing of umbilical cord clamping and the developing brain.

### Clinical aspects of incorporating cord clamping into stabilisation of preterm infants [^1168h6WK]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2018). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Delayed cord clamping is beneficial for term and preterm infants and is recommended in current clinical guidelines.
Preterm infants requiring stabilisation or resuscitation at birth generally are excluded from delayed cord clamping.
Experimental studies have shown positive effects if respiratory support is started prior to umbilical cord clamping.

What this study adds?

Multiple practical issues must be addressed before cord clamping can be incorporated into stabilisation of preterm infants.
Using the infant's transitional status as key determinant for the timing of cord clamping may result in true physiological-based cord clamping (PBCC).
PBCC may be able to reduce major morbidities and mortality in preterm infants.

### Physiological-based cord clamping in preterm infants using a new purpose-built resuscitation table: a feasibility study [^116WmJ7L]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Preterm infants requiring stabilisation or resuscitation are excluded from the beneficial effects of delayed cord clamping.
Clinical approaches in providing respiratory support prior to cord clamping still used a fixed time point for clamping.
Changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation of preterm infants before cord clamping are currently unknown.

What this study adds?

Physiological-based cord clamping using a new purpose-built resuscitation table is feasible and without adverse events for mother and infant.
Using the infant's condition and transitional status as key determinant for the timing of cord clamping results in considerably later cord clamping than described previously.
Physiological-based cord clamping is associated with stable heart rate and improved oxygen saturation during transition in preterm infants.

### Clamping of the umbilical cord and placental transfusion (scientific impact paper no. 14) [^116fYz9e]. RCOG (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for umbilical cord management, more specifically with respect to considerations for delayed cord clamping, RCOG 2015 guidelines recommend to consider placing term infants on the mother's abdomen or chest following a vaginal birth without influencing the volume of placental transfusion while the cord is intact. Do not lift infants higher than this while the cord is intact owing to the influence of gravity on placental transfusion. Record the timing of cord clamping in medical notes routinely.

### Assisted ventilation prior to umbilical cord clamping: potential benefits, challenges, and research studies [^116TeE9V]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Delayed cord clamping (DCC) is beneficial for many infants, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends at least 30–60 seconds of DCC for both term and preterm vigorous infants. For newly born infants that are not vigorous, some evidence in animal models suggests that providing assisted ventilation prior to cord clamping (V-DCC) leads to a more stable transition of cerebral, pulmonary and systemic circulation and oxygenation and may confer not only short-term physiologic benefits but perhaps also improvement in clinically important outcomes. This review is based around 7 questions to help the reader understand the physiologic underpinnings and challenges of V-DCC as well as the published and ongoing research studies aimed at determining whether V-DCC is beneficial for preterm or term infants.

This Clinical Practice Update provides guidance related to management of the umbilical cord at birth based on recently published data regarding short, medium, and long deferral of cord clamping; cord milking; and immediate cord clamping in preterm neonates. In this document, the terms "deferred" and "delayed" are used interchangeably as they relate to management of the cord at birth. This document updates Committee Opinion No. 814, Delayed Umbilical Cord Clamping After Birth (Obstet Gynecol 2020;136:e100-6).

### FIGO good practice recommendations on delayed umbilical cord clamping [^114gARxA]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity. In term-born babies, it also seems to improve both the short- and long-term outcomes and shows favorable scores in fine motor and social domains. However, there is insufficient evidence to show what duration of delay is best. The current evidence supports not clamping the cord before 30 seconds for preterm births. Future trials could compare different lengths of delay. Until then, a period of 30 seconds to 3 minutes seems justified for term-born babies.

### Early versus delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants [^116stDDE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal timing for clamping of the umbilical cord at birth is unclear. Early clamping allows for immediate resuscitation of the newborn. Delaying clamping may facilitate transfusion of blood between the placenta and the baby.

Objectives

To delineate the short- and long-term effects for infants born at less than 37 completed weeks' gestation, and their mothers, of early compared to delayed clamping of the umbilical cord at birth.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (2 February 2004), the Cochrane Neonatal Group trials register (2 February 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2004), PubMed (1966 to 2 February 2004) and EMBASE (1974 to 2 February 2004).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing early with delayed (30 seconds or more) clamping of the umbilical cord for infants born before 37 completed weeks' gestation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three reviewers assessed eligibility and trial quality.

Main Results

Seven studies (297 infants) were eligible for inclusion. The maximum delay in cord clamping was 120 seconds. Delayed cord clamping was associated with a higher hematocrit four hours after birth (four trials, 134 infants; weighted mean difference 5.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.42 to 7.19), fewer transfusions for anaemia (three trials, 111 infants; relative risk (RR) 2.01, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.27) or low blood pressure (two trials, 58 infants; RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.67) and less intraventricular haemorrhage (five trials, 225 infants; RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.81) than early clamping.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Delaying cord clamping by 30 to 120 seconds, rather than early clamping, seems to be associated with less need for transfusion and less intraventricular haemorrhage. There are no clear differences in other outcomes.

### Effect of delayed vs immediate umbilical cord clamping on maternal blood loss in term cesarean delivery: a randomized clinical trial [^1146fDXx]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in term neonates for at least 30 to 60 seconds after birth. Most literature supporting this practice is from low-risk vaginal deliveries. There are no published data specific to cesarean delivery.

Objective

To compare maternal blood loss with immediate cord clamping vs delayed cord clamping in scheduled cesarean deliveries at term (≥ 37 weeks).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial performed at 2 hospitals within a tertiary academic medical center in New York City from October 2017 to February 2018 (follow-up completed March 15, 2018). A total of 113 women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery of term singleton gestations were included.

Interventions

In the immediate cord clamping group (n = 56), cord clamping was within 15 seconds after birth. In the delayed cord clamping group (n = 57), cord clamping was at 60 seconds after birth.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was change in maternal hemoglobin level from preoperative to postoperative day 1, which was used as a proxy for maternal blood loss. Secondary outcomes included neonatal hemoglobin level at 24 to 72 hours of life.

Results

All of the 113 women who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 32.6 [5.2] years) completed the trial. The mean preoperative hemoglobin level was 12.0 g/dL in the delayed and 11.6 g/dL in the immediate cord clamping group. The mean postoperative day 1 hemoglobin level was 10.1 g/dL in the delayed group and 9.8 g/dL in the immediate group. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, with a mean hemoglobin change of -1.90 g/dL (95% CI, -2.14 to -1.66) and -1.78 g/dL (95% CI, -2.03 to -1.54) in the delayed and immediate cord clamping groups, respectively (mean difference, 0.12 g/dL [95% CI, -0.22 to 0.46]; P = 0.49). Of 19 prespecified secondary outcomes analyzed, 15 showed no significant difference. The mean neonatal hemoglobin level, available for 90 neonates (79.6%), was significantly higher with delayed (18.1 g/dL [95% CI, 17.4 to 18.8]) compared with immediate (16.4 g/dL [95% CI, 15.9 to 17.0]) cord clamping (mean difference, 1.67 g/dL [95% CI, 0.75 to 2.59]; P < .001). There was 1 unplanned hysterectomy in each group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among women undergoing scheduled cesarean delivery of term singleton pregnancies, delayed umbilical cord clamping, compared with immediate cord clamping, resulted in no significant difference in the change in maternal hemoglobin level at postoperative day 1.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^116bCAv9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping appears to be beneficial for term and preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, which may have a favorable effect on developmental outcomes. There is a small increase in the incidence of jaundice that requires phototherapy in term infants undergoing delayed umbilical cord clamping. Consequently, obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric care providers adopting delayed umbilical cord clamping in term infants should ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor and treat neonatal jaundice. In preterm infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with significant neonatal benefits, including improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage. Delayed umbilical cord clamping was not associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage or increased blood loss at delivery, nor was it associated with a difference in postpartum hemoglobin levels or the need for blood transfusion. Given the benefits to most newborns and concordant with other professional organizations, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping in vigorous term and preterm infants for at least 30–60 seconds after birth. The ability to provide delayed umbilical cord clamping may vary among institutions and settings; decisions in those circumstances are best made by the team caring for the mother-infant dyad.

2 CLINICAL SCENARIOS

2.1 Delayed cord clamping at preterm birth

Systematic reviews provide moderate‐quality evidence that delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity.

Delayed clamping reduced hospital mortality (risk ratio [RR] 0.68; 95% CI 0.52–0.90; risk difference –0.03; 95% CI –0.05 to –0.01; P = 0.005; number needed to benefit 33; 95% CI 20–100). In three trials including 996 infants at or before 28 weeks of gestation, delayed cord clamping reduced hospital mortality (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.51–0.95; risk difference –0.05; 95% CI –0.09 to –0.01; P = 0.02; number needed to benefit 20; 95% CI 11–100). Delayed clamping reduced the incidence of a low Apgar score at 1 minute, but not at 5 minutes, and did not reduce the incidence of intubation for resuscitation, admission temperature, mechanical ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, brain injury, chronic lung disease, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, late‐onset sepsis, or retinopathy of prematurity.

2.2 Delayed cord clamping at term birth

Although not the focus of these recommendations, there is also evidence that expectant management in full‐term babies is beneficial in the third stage of labor in the short and long term. In the short term, delayed cord clamping increases early hemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants. In the long term, delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available.

A randomized trial of full‐term infants from low‐risk pregnancies in a high‐income country assessed neurodevelopment at 4 years and compared delayed versus early cord clamping. Favorable scores for delayed cord clamping were found in the fine motor and social domains at 4 years of age, especially in boys. Prevention of iron deficiency in infancy may promote neurodevelopment. Delayed umbilical cord clamping prevents iron deficiency at 4–6 months of age, and long‐term effects have yet to be reported. Some trials have also followed the impact of cord clamping on the early developing brain at 12 months in a healthy population, concluding that infants who received delayed cord clamping had greater myelin content in brain regions involving motor, function, visual, spatial, and sensory processing.

Abstract

Delayed cord clamping in the first minute in preterm infants born before 34 weeks of gestation improves neonatal hematologic measures and may reduce mortality without increasing any other morbidity. In term‐born babies, it also seems to improve both the short‐ and long‐term outcomes and shows favorable scores in fine motor and social domains.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^111Dnar2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping — implementation and physiologic effects — includes initiating early newborn care while awaiting clamping and facilitating an interval of at least 30–60 seconds between birth and cord clamp. It should not interfere with active management of the third stage of labor, and immediate cord clamping is appropriate if the placental circulation is not intact or if maternal hemodynamic instability or the need for immediate resuscitation of the newborn on the warmer exists. Institutional ability may vary and timing decisions should be individualized, including in fetal growth restriction with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler studies where neonatal and obstetric teams can weigh risks and benefits. Regarding cord blood gases, two studies suggest a decrease of approximately 0.03 in umbilical artery pH with delayed clamping, whereas a larger study of 116 infants found no difference in umbilical cord pH and an increase in umbilical artery pO₂; these studies included infants who did not require resuscitation at birth.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^113LGCX1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping in term and preterm infants — delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds is recommended in term and preterm infants except when immediate umbilical cord clamping is necessary because of neonatal or maternal indications, and evidence also supports delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds in preterm infants. In term infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping increases hemoglobin levels at birth and improves iron stores in the first several months of life, with a small increase in jaundice requiring phototherapy, and obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric care providers adopting delayed cord clamping in term infants should ensure that mechanisms are in place to monitor and treat neonatal jaundice. In preterm infants, delayed umbilical cord clamping is associated with improved transitional circulation, better establishment of red blood cell volume, decreased need for blood transfusion, and lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, and in terms of maternal outcomes it does not increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage or the need for blood transfusion, and postpartum maternal hemoglobin levels are not affected by delayed compared with immediate umbilical cord clamping.

### Time to implement delayed cord clamping [^1161sQUC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Immediate umbilical cord clamping after delivery is routine in the United States despite little evidence to support this practice. Numerous trials in both term and preterm neonates have demonstrated the safety and benefit of delayed cord clamping. In premature neonates, delayed cord clamping has been shown to stabilize transitional circulation, lessening needs for inotropic medications and reducing blood transfusions, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage. In term neonates, delayed cord clamping has been associated with decreased iron-deficient anemia and increased iron stores with potential valuable effects that extend beyond the newborn period, including improvements in long-term neurodevelopment. The failure to more broadly implement delayed cord clamping in neonates ignores published benefits of increased placental blood transfusion at birth and may represent an unnecessary harm for vulnerable neonates.

### Effect of timing of umbilical cord clamping of term infants on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^117XNpgT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Policies for timing of cord clamping vary, with early cord clamping generally carried out in the first 60 seconds after birth, whereas later cord clamping usually involves clamping the umbilical cord more than one minute after the birth or when cord pulsation has ceased. The benefits and potential harms of each policy are debated.

Objectives

To determine the effects of early cord clamping compared with late cord clamping after birth on maternal and neonatal outcomes

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (13 February 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing early and late cord clamping.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving a total of 3911 women and infant pairs. We judged the trials to have an overall moderate risk of bias. Maternal outcomes: No studies in this review reported on maternal death or on severe maternal morbidity. There were no significant differences between early versus late cord clamping groups for the primary outcome of severe postpartum haemorrhage (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 1.65; five trials with data for 2066 women with a late clamping event rate (LCER) of ~3.5%, I(2) 0%) or for postpartum haemorrhage of 500 mL or more (RR 1.17 95% CI 0.94 to 1.44; five trials, 2260 women with a LCER of ~12%, I(2) 0%). There were no significant differences between subgroups depending on the use of uterotonic drugs. Mean blood loss was reported in only two trials with data for 1345 women, with no significant differences seen between groups; or for maternal haemoglobin values (mean difference (MD) -0.12 g/dL; 95% CI -0.30 to 0.06, I(2) 0%) at 24 to 72 hours after the birth in three trials. Neonatal outcomes: There were no significant differences between early and late clamping for the primary outcome of neonatal mortality (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.41, two trials, 381 infants with a LCER of ~1%), or for most other neonatal morbidity outcomes, such as Apgar score less than seven at five minutes or admission to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit. Mean birthweight was significantly higher in the late, compared with early, cord clamping (101 g increase 95% CI 45 to 157, random-effects model, 12 trials, 3139 infants, I² 62%). Fewer infants in the early cord clamping group required phototherapy for jaundice than in the late cord clamping group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96, data from seven trials, 2324 infants with a LCER of 4.36%, I(2) 0%). Haemoglobin concentration in infants at 24 to 48 hours was significantly lower in the early cord clamping group (MD -1.49 g/dL, 95% CI -1.78 to -1.21; 884 infants, I² 59%). This difference in haemoglobin concentration was not seen at subsequent assessments. However, improvement in iron stores appeared to persist, with infants in the early cord clamping over twice as likely to be iron deficient at three to six months compared with infants whose cord clamping was delayed (RR 2.65 95% CI 1.04 to 6.73, five trials, 1152 infants, I(2) 82%). In the only trial to report longer-term neurodevelopmental outcomes so far, no overall differences between early and late clamping were seen for Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores.

Authors' Conclusions

A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants. Delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available.

### Physiological-based cord clamping: when the baby is ready for clamping [^113JVyjU]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The timing of cord clamping has become a focal point for neonatal caregivers due to the promising outcomes associated with delayed cord clamping, which is a simple and cost-effective method to enhance the survival and well-being of preterm infants. While initially the rationale behind delaying clamping was to facilitate increased placental transfusion, research has unveiled additional hemodynamic benefits.

Summary

Experimental studies have demonstrated improved circulatory transition when clamping is postponed until the lungs are adequately aerated. This suggests that infants requiring assistance during the transition phase may benefit from stabilization while still attached to the cord. The Aeration, Breathing, and then Clamping (ABC) project aimed to translate these experimental findings into clinical practice.

Key Message

In this review, we will discuss the insights gained and lessons learned from the project's implementation.

### Immediate compared with delayed cord clamping in the preterm neonate: a randomized controlled trial [^115G5ps1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The comparative risks and benefits of early compared with delayed cord clamping in the preterm neonate remain unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the short-term effects of delayed clamping of the umbilical cord in preterm neonates.

Methods

We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing immediate with delayed cord clamping among preterm neonates born between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation. The primary study outcome was the need for blood transfusion. To detect a 33% reduction in this outcome (from 65 to 43.5%) with a two-tailed α of 0.5 and β of 0.8 required 178 patients equally divided into two groups.

Results

A total of 200 women were randomized, 99 to the delayed and 101 to the immediate clamp group. The groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics. The mean gestational age at delivery was 30.8 ± 3.1 weeks in the delayed compared with 30.7 ± 2.8 weeks in the immediate clamp group (P = 0.64). There was no statistically significant difference between groups with regard to the need for blood transfusion: 25 of 99 (25.3%) in the delayed cord clamp group received one or more blood transfusion compared with 24 of 101 (23.7%) in the immediate clamp group (P = 0.8). The rates of various neonatal outcomes including respiratory distress syndrome, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, anemia of prematurity, and neonatal morality did not differ significantly between the groups. However, the mean initial hemoglobin (17.4 ± 2.5 compared with 16.3 ± 2.3 g/dL, P = 0.001) and hematocrit (51.3 ± 7.3 compared with 47.4 ± 7.3, P = 0.001) was significantly higher in the delayed group. In the delayed clamp group, 11.1% (11/99) of neonates had intraventricular hemorrhage compared with 19.8% (20/101) in the immediate clamp group (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Delayed cord clamping for 30 seconds did not decrease the need for blood transfusion among preterm neonates.

### Implementing delayed cord clamping in premature infants [^115JhViK]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

The practice of delayed cord clamping (DCC) in premature infants has proven benefit to the neonate. In a community-based perinatal centre, the practice of DCC for more than 60 s for premature infants with gestational age of < 35 weeks was identified to occur infrequently at 20% in 2013. The perinatology group in conjunction with nursery, labour and delivery, and obstetric staff sought to improve adherence to the best practice of DCC for premature infants. In an effort to achieve this goal, we developed an evidence-based clinical practice guideline, included key stakeholders in its development and provided timely feedback to delivery providers about DCC performance. The frequency of DCC for this population improved from 19.5% in 2013 to 85% in 2017. The success in improving this best practice is attributed to the involvement of the multidisciplinary team who developed the guideline, and the sustained improvement was encouraged with the continued reaffirmation of DCC goals to delivery providers.

### Delayed clamping vs milking of umbilical cord in preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial [^111AfT7j]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been established that delayed umbilical cord clamping in preterm infants results in improvement in neonatal anemia, need for transfusion, incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage by increasing neonatal circulating blood volume. However, the effects of umbilical cord milking as an alternative to delayed clamping in preterm infants are unclear.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare the effect of delayed clamping vs milking of the umbilical cord on the initial hematocrit concentration in preterm births (23–34 weeks gestation). In addition, we sought to compare the effects of delayed clamping vs milking on the incidences of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and need for transfusion (secondary objectives).

Study Design

The study was an unblinded randomized controlled trial of singleton preterm infants who were born 23 weeks 0 days to 34 weeks 6 days gestation and were assigned to 1 of 2 controlled study groups: delayed cord clamping for 60 seconds or milking of the cord towards the infant 4 times before clamping. Randomization occurred via block randomization with an allocation ratio of 1 to 1. The patients' third stage of delivery was standardized for route of delivery and randomization arm. All comparisons were preformed with an intent-to-treat analysis approach. The study was powered at 80% with a probability value of .05 for the primary outcome measure of a hematocrit difference of 3% between the 2 groups.

Results

Of the 204 randomized patients, 104 were assigned to the delayed subgroup, and 100 were assigned to the milking subgroup. There were no significant differences in baseline maternal characteristics noted between groups. Though there was not any statistically significant difference in neonatal outcomes between the cord clamping and milking groups, the occurrences of transfusion (15.5% vs 9.1%; P = 0.24), necrotizing enterocolitis (5.8% vs 3.0%; P = 0.49), and intraventricular hemorrhage (15.5% vs 10.1%; P = 0.35) were all lower in the milking group. The milking group had higher initial hematocrit concentration compared with the delayed clamping group, although this was not significant (51.8 [6.2%] vs 49.9 [7.7%]; P = 0.07]. Peak bilirubin levels and need for phototherapy were similar between groups.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that milking the umbilical cord may be an acceptable alternative to delayed cord clamping because there were similar effects on neonatal hematocrit concentrations and the need for neonatal transfusions and no increased risk for complications or neonatal morbidity. The present data support the concept that milking of the umbilical cord may offer an efficient and timely method of providing increased blood volume to the infant.

### Umbilical cord milking versus delayed cord clamping in term infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1176oiWF]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Delayed cord clamping (DCC) is recommended for healthy term infants. However, the effectiveness of umbilical cord milking (UCM) in term infants remains unknown. The study aimed to compare the effects of UCM versus DCC on term infants.

Study Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted which included individual and clustered RCTs comparing UCM with DCC for infants born at ≥ 37 weeks of gestation.

Results

Three trials (650 term infants) were included. Compared with DCC, UCM was associated with higher hemoglobin levels at 6 weeks after birth [infants, 621; mean difference, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.29] and had no statistical differences in hemoglobin levels at birth, serum bilirubin levels at 48h after birth, or hematocrit levels at 48h after birth.

Conclusion

This study suggested that UCM might be as beneficial as DCC in term infants, however, further RCTs are required to accurately assess the outcomes.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of a brief delay in clamping the umbilical cord of preterm infants [^112peWdF]. Neonatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of clamping the umbilical cord in preterm infants at birth is the subject of continuing debate.

Objective

To investigate the effects of a brief delay in cord clamping on the outcome of babies born prematurely.

Methods

A retrospective meta-analysis of randomised trials in preterm infants was conducted. Data were collected from published studies identified by a structured literature search in EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. All infants born below 37 weeks gestation and enrolled into a randomised study of delayed cord clamping (30 s or more) versus immediate cord clamping (less than 20 s) after birth were included. Systematic search and analysis of the data were done according to the methodology of the Cochrane collaboration.

Results

Ten studies describing a total of 454 preterm infants were identified which met the inclusion and assessment criteria. Major benefits of the intervention were higher circulating blood volume during the first 24 h of life, less need for blood transfusions (p = 0.004) and less incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The procedure of a delayed cord clamping time of at least 30 s is safe to use and does not compromise the preterm infant in the initial post-partum adaptation phase.

### Delayed cord clamping versus early cord clamping in elective cesarean section: a randomized controlled trial [^116NJBhf]. Neonatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Delaying cord clamping is recommended in order to assure placental transfusion. However, the evidence on cord management in elective cesarean section (CS) is limited.

Objective

To compare delayed cord clamping (DCC) with early cord clamping (ECC) with regard to postnatal adaptation in neonates born through elective CS.

Methods

All neonates born ≥ 39 weeks' gestation born through elective CS were assigned to either the DCC or the ECC arm at a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated, randomized sequence. The primary outcome was the hematocrit at day 2 of life. Secondary outcomes included: preductal oxygen saturation and heart rate during the first 10 min of life; transcutaneous bilirubin at day 3; and neonatal blood pressures in the first 3 days of life. Additional outcomes included: time to first spontaneous breath; temperature at admission to normal nursery; weight at discharge; and maternal blood losses.

Results

Eighty neonates were randomized to the DCC (n = 40) or the ECC (n = 40) arm. The hematocrit at day 2 was significantly higher in the DCC arm than in the ECC arm (mean difference: 6%; 95% CI 3–8; p < 0.0001). The secondary outcome measures were not statistically different between the two arms. No infants needed phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia during their hospital stay.

Conclusions

Delaying cord clamping beyond 60 s increases the hematocrit at day 2 in neonates born through elective CS, without affecting maternal blood losses. Our findings suggest that DCC should be recommended in elective CS, but further studies are warranted to assess long-term outcomes.

### Physiological-based cord clamping: when the baby is ready for clamping [^113UcE7g]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The timing of cord clamping has become a focal point for neonatal caregivers due to the promising outcomes associated with delayed cord clamping, which is a simple and cost-effective method to enhance the survival and well-being of preterm infants. While initially the rationale behind delaying clamping was to facilitate increased placental transfusion, research has unveiled additional hemodynamic benefits.

Summary

Experimental studies have demonstrated improved circulatory transition when clamping is postponed until the lungs are adequately aerated. This suggests that infants requiring assistance during the transition phase may benefit from stabilization while still attached to the cord. The Aeration, Breathing, and then Clamping (ABC) project aimed to translate these experimental findings into clinical practice.

Key Message

In this review, we will discuss the insights gained and lessons learned from the project's implementation.

Introduction

Debate about the consequences of umbilical cord clamping at birth and its optimal timing has been ongoing throughout history. Over the centuries, both well-known and lesser-known historical figures have indicated that immediate cord clamping after birth might not be in the best interest of the newborn. While waiting to clamp the cord has been, and still is, commonly practiced by some midwives and obstetricians, it is not entirely clear when or why early cord clamping became the standard of care worldwide. Early cord clamping was incorporated into clinical guidelines as part of active management of the third stage of labor to reduce the risk of maternal blood loss after birth. However, this occurred despite a significant reduction in infant birth weight after immediate clamping and a meta-analysis showing no difference in maternal blood loss between early and late cord clamping. But even before guidance around active management of the third stage of labor, early cord clamping became the standard of care in the early 20th century which also coincided with an increase in hospital births.

It took some time before the policy of immediate cord clamping was corrected. Studies in the 1960s found that delaying cord clamping resulted in higher blood volumes in newborns, suggesting that blood is transferred from the placenta into the infant (placental transfusion), which was confirmed by meta-analyses showing an increase in birth weight. Other meta-analyses over the last 2 decades have shown that delaying cord clamping (by at least 30 s) compared to immediate cord clamping (0–30 s) provides significant health benefits for (near) term newborns. These include higher birth weight and hematocrit and lower incidence of anemia and iron deficiency. For preterm infants, there was a greater chance of survival, higher hematocrit with fewer blood transfusions, and a trend toward fewer brain hemorrhages. This led to the recommendation in international guidelines to wait at least 60 s before clamping the cord in newborns who do not require assistance with breathing, whereas if stabilization or resuscitation is necessary, immediate cord clamping is recommended. In addition, the latest meta-analysis comparing different clamping strategies demonstrated the effect on increased survival was greatest when clamping was delayed by 2 min or longer.

### Maternal and neonatal outcomes after delayed vs early cord clamping at cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116P8Mhy]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically review maternal and neonatal outcomes after delayed cord clamping compared with early cord clamping at the time of cesarean delivery.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception through October 5, 2023.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Our population included childbearing people undergoing cesarean delivery, and neonates delivered via cesarean delivery after 23 weeks of gestation. Our intervention was delayed cord clamping (> 30 seconds after birth) compared with early cord clamping. Randomized controlled trials and prospective and retrospective comparative studies were included.

Methods

Abstracts and potentially relevant full-text articles were doubly screened, and accepted articles were doubly extracted. Of the 736 abstracts screened, 222 full-text articles were assessed, and 25 studies were included. Fifteen studies reported maternal outcomes, 20 reported neonatal outcomes, and 10 assessed both neonatal and maternal outcomes. Data were extracted by 9 reviewers, and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Random-effects meta-analyses of pooled proportions were conducted. Maternal outcomes included were estimated blood loss, postoperative hematocrit reduction, total surgical time, postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, uterotonic administration, postoperative hemoglobin reduction, and incidence of hysterectomy. Neonatal outcomes included bilirubin levels, hematocrit change, phototherapy, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, mean hemoglobin, cord pH, mortality, need for resuscitation, and blood transfusion.

Results

No difference was noted between delayed and early cord clamping at cesarean delivery for any maternal outcome, including estimated blood loss, postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, surgical time, additional uterotonic administration, change in hemoglobin/hematocrit, and incidence of hysterectomy. Delayed cord clamping was favored for neonatal hematocrit change and bilirubin levels. No difference was noted in the need for phototherapy, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and Apgar scores.

Conclusion

In agreement with robust physiological evidence, our data suggest that delayed cord clamping improves some neonatal outcomes (including hematocrit and bilirubin levels) for both term and preterm infants born via cesarean delivery compared with early cord clamping, without increasing the risk of adverse maternal outcomes, including maternal bleeding.

### Effect of delayed cord clamping above versus below the perineum on neonatal hematocrit: a randomized controlled trial [^111BPVic]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a difference in neonatal hematocrit at 24 hours of life in full-term newborns for which delayed cord clamping is performed above versus below the perineum.

Materials and Methods

One hundred one patients with singleton pregnancies > 37 weeks of gestation presenting for delivery were randomized to delayed cord clamping above or below the perineum. At 24 hours of life, neonatal hematocrit was determined, and the difference was compared using statistical analysis. Secondary outcomes measured were need for phototherapy, transfusion, and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.

Results

Of 101 patients recruited for the study, 53 were randomized to the above group, and 48 were randomized to the below group. Twenty-seven patients in the above group and 26 patients in the below group completed the study. The above group had an average neonatal hematocrit of 52.7% (± 2.58%). The below group had an average neonatal hematocrit of 55.8% (± 2.42%). There was no statistical difference between groups (p = 0.10). Similarly, differences in secondary outcomes did not reach statistical significance. Three infants in the above group and one infant in the below group required phototherapy. None of the infants required blood transfusion. Three infants in the above group and one infant in the below group required NICU admission.

Conclusions

When comparing delayed cord clamping above versus below the perineum, there is no difference in the neonatal hematocrit at 24 hours of life.

### Immediate versus delayed umbilical cord clamping in premature neonates born [^117EjoBz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to test whether delayed versus immediate cord clamping would result in higher blood pressure (BP) and hematocrit (Hct), and to assess its clinical effects on the neonatal course in premature neonates (< 35 weeks). This was a prospective, masked, randomized, controlled study. Prior to delivery, 35 neonates were randomly assigned to immediate cord clamping (ICC) at 5 to 10 seconds, and a comparable group of 30 neonates were randomly assigned to delayed cord clamping (DCC) at 30 to 45 seconds. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that the DCC group tended to have higher initial diastolic BP and higher Hct (especially in vaginally delivered neonates). Infants weighing < 1500 g with DCC tended to have higher mean BP, and needed less mechanical ventilation and surfactant compared with ICC neonates. Infants with DCC did not experience more polycythemia (Hct > 60%), but had a trend toward higher bilirubin levels with no differences in the phototherapy needs. DCC seems to be safe and may be beneficial when compared with ICC in premature neonates. However, the differences between the two methods were modest and the clinical relevance needs to be assessed further by larger studies and additional meta-analysis of randomized trials.

### Effect of delayed cord clamping on umbilical blood gas values in term newborns: a systematic review [^115ZNC9g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect of delayed cord clamping on cord blood gas values in vaginally delivered, healthy, term singletons.

Data Source

We used MEDLINE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases.

Methods Of Study Selection

Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cord blood gas values obtained from early compared with delayed cord clamping groups and observational studies using serial cord blood gas from the same umbilical cord. We described the difference in means of cord blood gas parameters and comparative descriptive statistics when a difference in means was not available. We used a domain-based risk bias tool to extract methodologic details and assess potential risk of bias.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

This review included two RCTs and three observational studies. These studies included a total of 234 newborns with early cord clamping and 218 newborns with delayed cord clamping. The observational studies showed that 45–90 seconds delayed cord clamping was associated with mean decreases in umbilical arterial pH (0.02–0.03), HCO₃ (0.3–0.8 mmol/L) and increases in base deficit (0.3–1.3 mmol/L) compared with early cord clamping. One observational study showed that delayed cord clamping was associated with decreases in umbilical venous pH (0.01) and HCO₃ (0.2 mmol/L) and increase in venous base deficit (0.1–0.3 mmol/L) compared with early cord clamping. These changes were not observed in the two RCTs.

Conclusion

Delayed cord clamping up to 120 seconds has either no effect or only a small effect on cord blood acid-base balance; overall, the magnitude of these changes is not clinically significant in vaginally delivered, healthy, term singletons.

### Physiological-based cord clamping: when the baby is ready for clamping [^114oX7kn]. Neonatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The benefits of delayed cord clamping have mainly been attributed to the concept of placental transfusion. Although there are many beliefs about the mechanism of placental transfusion, the scientific explanation is still lacking. Gravity and uterine contractions do not appear to be the driving forces behind the transfusion, although pressure changes during spontaneous inhalations could play a role. This is thought to result from a reduction in intrathoracic pressure associated with inspiration, which has been shown to accelerate the movement of blood into the infant. If this is the primary mechanism, it indicates that spontaneous breathing is needed to drive placental transfusion and so ideally one should wait until breathing has commenced before clamping the cord.

Recent animal experiments have demonstrated that the large respiratory and circulatory changes that need to occur during transition at birth, are intricately linked. This understanding provided the physiological rationale for why there is a hemodynamic benefit to wait with cord clamping until the lungs have been aerated. This is referred to as physiological-based cord clamping (PBCC). Several experimentalists and clinicians have been involved in a research program investigating the biology underpinning PBCC and translating the findings into clinical settings. This program of research had its origins in trying to understand the clinical dilemma as to why a high proportion of normal, healthy, well-oxygenated infants would have a low heart rate at birth. This prompted experimental studies to describe the underlying mechanism and was followed by a randomized trial evaluating efficacy in preterm infants. Together, this program has taken us more than a decade to complete. In this review, we will discuss the insights gained and lessons learned from the project's implementation.

### Optimizing transition: providing oxygen during intact cord resuscitation [^1177ghSj]. Seminars in Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Delayed clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord at birth is standard practice for management for all newborns.

### Deferred cord clamping, cord milking, and immediate cord clamping at preterm birth: a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^113K82BB]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Umbilical cord clamping strategies at preterm birth have the potential to affect important health outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of deferred cord clamping, umbilical cord milking, and immediate cord clamping in reducing neonatal mortality and morbidity at preterm birth.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. We searched medical databases and trial registries (from database inception until Feb 24, 2022; updated June 6, 2023) for randomised controlled trials comparing deferred (also known as delayed) cord clamping, cord milking, and immediate cord clamping for preterm births (< 37 weeks' gestation). Quasi-randomised or cluster-randomised trials were excluded. Authors of eligible studies were invited to join the iCOMP collaboration and share individual participant data. All data were checked, harmonised, re-coded, and assessed for risk of bias following prespecified criteria. The primary outcome was death before hospital discharge. We performed intention-to-treat one-stage individual participant data meta-analyses accounting for heterogeneity to examine treatment effects overall and in prespecified subgroup analyses. Certainty of evidence was assessed with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136640.

Findings

We identified 2369 records, of which 48 randomised trials provided individual participant data and were eligible for our primary analysis. We included individual participant data on 6367 infants (3303 [55%] male, 2667 [45%] female, two intersex, and 395 missing data). Deferred cord clamping, compared with immediate cord clamping, reduced death before discharge (odds ratio [OR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.51–0.91], high-certainty evidence, 20 studies, n = 3260, 232 deaths). For umbilical cord milking compared with immediate cord clamping, no clear evidence was found of a difference in death before discharge (OR 0.73 [0.44–1.20], low certainty, 18 studies, n = 1561, 74 deaths). Similarly, for umbilical cord milking compared with deferred cord clamping, no clear evidence was found of a difference in death before discharge (0.95 [0.59–1.53], low certainty, 12 studies, n = 1303, 93 deaths). We found no evidence of subgroup differences for the primary outcome, including by gestational age, type of delivery, multiple birth, study year, and perinatal mortality.

Interpretation

This study provides high-certainty evidence that deferred cord clamping, compared with immediate cord clamping, reduces death before discharge in preterm infants. This effect appears to be consistent across several participant-level and trial-level subgroups. These results will inform international treatment recommendations.

### How to improve newborn outcomes in 60 s-delay clamping the umbilical cord [^117MDrVt]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite rapidly-developing evidence that deferred umbilical cord clamping (DCC) improves newborn outcomes, there is wide variation around this practice for the nearly 4 million births in the U.S. each year. Given that the U.S. ranked 33 out of 38 OECD countries for infant mortality in 2019 with 5.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, the need for better perinatal care is pressing. Broader adoption of deferred cord clamping represents one important quality improvement opportunity to improve newborn cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine outcomes. This commentary summarizes the recent history of DCC implementation, the benefits and risk of DCC, and provides recommendations for increased adoption in the United States.

Assessment of Benefit and Risk

In the modern medical era, it became common practice to clamp and cut the umbilical cord shortly after the birth of a newborn. However, a growing body of evidence has established benefits to DCC. It is a simple and free intervention that allows for the autotransfusion of placental blood before clamping. The practice is endorsed by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP), and World Health Organization (WHO). There is wide variation in the use of DCC with a lack of standardized treatment protocols. Based on well-designed randomized clinical trials and clinical wisdom, the implementation of standardized DCC protocols would provide both short- and long-term health benefits.

The first randomized-controlled trial performed in 1988 supported an acute benefit of DCC. There was a decreased likelihood of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Since then, trials have indicated many incremental health benefits, such as increased neonate hemoglobin levels. Lower transfusion rates improve outcomes and decrease the cost of care.

The benefits of DCC are more pronounced and evident in preterm births, such as a reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and overall increases in blood flow, stroke volume, and cardiac output.

While there are numerous acute health benefits with DCC, until recently literature was unclear about long-term benefits. One trial found modest neurodevelopment improvements 4 years post-birth. Infants with the intervention had better fine motor functions compared to an immediate cord clamping group. Most benefits start at the one-minute mark and diminish after three minutes. To this day, no universal guidelines exist on the timing of delay. For instance, the WHO utilizes a 60-second threshold for DCC, while ACOG recommends 30–60 s.

### Umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138gRke]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Placental management strategies such as umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping may provide a range of benefits for the newborn. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of umbilical cord milking and delayed cord clamping for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia.

Methods

Three databases and five clinical trial registries were systematically reviewed to identify randomised controlled trials comparing umbilical cord milking or delayed cord clamping with control in term and preterm infants. The primary outcome was neonatal hypoglycaemia (study defined). Two independent reviewers conducted screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB-2). Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Meta-analysis using a random effect model was done using Review Manager 5.4. The review was registered prospectively on PROSPERO (CRD42022356553).

Results

Data from 71 studies and 14 268 infants were included in this review; 22 (2 537 infants) compared umbilical cord milking with control, and 50 studies (11 731 infants) compared delayed with early cord clamping. For umbilical cord milking there were no data on neonatal hypoglycaemia, and no differences between groups for any of the secondary outcomes. We found no evidence that delayed cord clamping reduced the incidence of hypoglycaemia (6 studies, 444 infants, RR = 0.87, CI: 0.58 to 1.30, p = 0.49, I² = 0%). Delayed cord clamping was associated with a 27% reduction in neonatal mortality (15 studies, 3 041 infants, RR = 0.73, CI: 0.55 to 0.98, p = 0.03, I² = 0%). We found no evidence for the effect of delayed cord clamping for any of the other outcomes. The certainty of evidence was low for all outcomes.

Conclusion

We found no data for the effectiveness of umbilical cord milking on neonatal hypoglycaemia, and no evidence that delayed cord clamping reduced the incidence of hypoglycaemia, but the certainty of the evidence was low.

### Effect of delayed versus immediate umbilical cord clamping in vaginal delivery at term: a randomized clinical trial [^113o9gj6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Randomization and masking

Eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either immediate or delayed cord clamping. Women were randomized by a web‐based system, and the randomization sequence was prepared by an independent statistician. The recruiters and the trial coordinator did not have access to the randomization sequence. The trial was open‐label given the nature of the interventions.

Women were approached by the research staff and counseled about the trial at the time of active stage of labor in case of spontaneous onset of labor. At that time eligible women received a complete blood count with hemoglobin level assessment. Eligible women who agreed to take part in the study were randomized at the time of delivery of the baby in case of spontaneous vaginal delivery.

2.5 Sample size calculation

Calculation of the sample size was based on the following consideration: a mean ± standard deviation change in hemoglobin level for spontaneous vaginal delivery of −0.9 ± 1.0 g/dl with immediate cord clampingand of 1.5 g/dl with delayed cord clamping group, and an anticipated 20% crossover rate from delayed to immediate cord clamping. Based on these considerations, setting a power of 80% to detect a significant greater drop in postdelivery day 1 maternal hemoglobin level, with a two‐sided type 1 error of 5%, a sample size of 122 participants was planned.

2.6 Statistical analysis

Data are shown as means, or as number (percentage). Univariate comparisons of dichotomous data were performed with the use of the χ² test with continuity correction. Comparisons between groups were performed with the use of the t test to test group means by assuming equal within‐group variances.

The primary analysis was an intention‐to‐treat comparison of the treatment assigned at randomization. The effect of immediate or delayed cord clamping on each outcome was quantified as relative risk or as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

A two‐sided P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19.0 (IBM Inc.).

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^113JGKBk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) in term and preterm infants — professional guidance and maternal risk are summarized as follows. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends a delay in umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds after birth in vigorous term and preterm infants, and delayed umbilical cord clamping is usually defined as cord clamping at least 30–60 seconds after birth. Additional guidance notes that the World Health Organization recommends that the umbilical cord not be clamped earlier than 1 minute after birth in term or preterm infants who do not require positive pressure ventilation, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program recommends delayed umbilical cord clamping for at least 30–60 seconds for most vigorous term and preterm infants, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends deferring umbilical cord clamping for healthy term and preterm infants for at least 2 minutes after birth, and the American College of Nurse-Midwives recommends delayed umbilical cord clamping for term and preterm infants for 2–5 minutes after birth. Delayed umbilical cord clamping does not increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

### Physiological-based cord clamping in very preterm infants-randomised controlled trial on effectiveness of stabilisation [^112GgiFt]. Resuscitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To test whether stabilising very preterm infants while performing physiological-based cord clamping (PBCC) is at least as effective as the standard approach of time-based delayed cord clamping (DCC).

Methods

A randomised controlled non-inferiority study was performed in two centres from May until November 2018, including preterm infants born below 32 weeks of gestational age. Infants were allocated to PBCC or standard DCC. Infants receiving PBCC were stabilised on a purpose-built resuscitation table with an intact umbilical cord. The cord was clamped when the infant had regular spontaneous breathing, heart rate ≥ 100 bpm and SpO₂ > 90% while using FiO₂ < 0.40. In infants receiving DCC, the cord was clamped at 30–60 seconds after birth before they were transferred to the standard resuscitation table for further treatment and stabilisation. Primary outcome was time to reach respiratory stability.

Results

Thirty-seven infants (mean gestational age 29 + 0 weeks) were included. Mean cord clamping time was 5:49 ± 2:37 min in the PBCC (n = 20) and 1:02 ± 0:30 min in the DCC group (n = 17). Infants receiving PBCC needed less time to reach respiratory stability (PBCC 5:54 ± 2:27 min; DCC 7:07 ± 2:54 min; mean difference corrected for gestational age -1:19 min, 95% CI [-3:04–0:27]), showing non-inferiority with the pre-defined limit of 1:15 min. No significant differences between the groups were found for maternal blood loss, postpartum haemorrhage, infant temperature at admission or short-term neonatal outcomes.

Conclusion

Stabilisation of very preterm infants with physiological-based cord clamping is at least as effective as with standard DCC.

### Effect of delayed cord clamping on the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants with respiratory distress [^115ikDME]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants born at < 32 weeks of gestation who received delayed cord clamping rather than early cord clamping.

Methods

During this multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study, data of 1283 infants born at < 32 weeks of gestation who received umbilical cord management between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, were collected from 26 tertiary referral neonatal intensive care units in China. The primary outcome was bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Results

A total of 440 infants (34.3%) received delayed cord clamping. The bronchopulmonary dysplasia rates were 32.5% and 55.6% for infants who received delayed cord clamping and those who received early cord clamping, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the delayed cord clamping group had a lower risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35–0.62; P < 0.001). No significant difference in the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was observed between groups (P = 0.09). A subgroup analysis of 227 infants born at < 28 weeks of gestation revealed that 65 (28.6%) received delayed cord clamping, and that 40 (61.5%) of these 65 infants experienced bronchopulmonary dysplasia. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for the delayed cord clamping group was not decreased (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.30–1.41; P = 0.28).

Conclusion

Delayed cord clamping independently decreased the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants born at < 32 weeks of gestation with moderate-to-severe respiratory distress; however, for those born at < 28 weeks of gestation, this benefit was not observed.

### Immediate and delayed cord clamping in infants born between 24 and 32 weeks: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^112MBu2d]. Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

This pilot study's aim was to establish feasibility of a protocol for delayed cord clamping (DCC) versus immediate cord clamping (ICC) at preterm birth and to examine its effects on initial blood pressure and other outcomes.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial recruited 32 infants between 24 and 32 weeks. Immediately before delivery, mothers were randomized to ICC (cord clamped at 5 to 10 seconds) or DCC (30- to 45-second delay in cord clamping) groups.

Results

Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that the DCC group were more likely to have higher initial mean blood pressures (adjusted OR 3.4) and less likely to be discharged on oxygen (adjusted OR 8.6). DCC group infants had higher initial glucose levels (ICC = 36 mg/dl, DCC = 73.1 mg/dl; p = 0.02).

Conclusion

The research design is feasible. The immediate benefit of improved blood pressure was confirmed and other findings deserve consideration for further study.

### Management of placental transfusion to neonates after delivery [^114z5VMb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

This review summarizes high-quality evidence supporting delayed umbilical cord clamping to promote placental transfusion to preterm and term neonates. In preterm neonates, delayed cord clamping may decrease mortality and the need for blood transfusions. Although robust data are lacking to guide cord management strategies in many clinical scenarios, emerging literature is reviewed on numerous topics including delivery mode, twin gestations, maternal comorbidities (eg, gestational diabetes, red blood cell alloimmunization, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection) and neonatal complications (eg, fetal growth restriction, congenital heart disease, and the depressed neonate). Umbilical cord milking is an alternate method of rapid placental transfusion, but has been associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm neonates. Data on long-term outcomes are discussed, as well as potential contraindications to delayed cord clamping. Overall, delayed cord clamping offers potential benefits to the estimated 140 million neonates born globally every year, emphasizing the importance of this simple and no-cost strategy.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since active management of the third stage of labor was introduced, early clamping of the umbilical cord has spread across the world. However, during the last decade, clinical insights have questioned this policy. This gained support through extensive clinical trials showing that late cord clamping results in better neonatal outcomes in preterm and term‐born babies. Delayed cord clamping allows blood flow between the placenta and baby to continue during the third stage of labor, leading to a more stable neonatal hemodynamic transition. In addition, as part of the neonate's physiological transition naturally occurring during the third stage of labor there is a progressive increase in heart rate, which is now considered the most reliable indicator of normalcy. In this sense, delayed cord clamping provides a safe time lapse to avoid rushing to perform unnecessary interventions.

A recent study by Katheria et al.found that in preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation more than 90% of infants established respirations with colorimetric carbon dioxide change within the first minute after birth when they received stimulation. This is important for cardiovascular stability to occur; the newborn must be breathing, therefore during delayed cord clamping attempts should be made to get them to breathe spontaneously. This, as a minimum, should be conducted with stimulation and should allow a safe time to assess the slow initiation of spontaneous breathing and to provide minimally invasive medical support, if needed, avoiding unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions.

The shorter the gestational age, the more significant the delay in initiating effective breathing owing to an immature respiratory drive, poor muscle strength, and surfactant deficiency. The initial functional residual lung capacity provides an insignificant amount of pulmonary exchange during the first breaths. Safety of respiration may depend transiently on the placental gas exchange that makes a substantial contribution to the infant's oxygen needs during these seconds and minutes of transition.

Caring for the preterm infant with an intact umbilical cord and in the "maternal space" allows a safe time for assessing the slow initiation of spontaneous breathing.

### Resuscitation with placental circulation intact compared with cord milking: a randomized clinical trial [^113WGPrL]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Delayed cord clamping (of 30–60 seconds) improves outcomes in preterm newborns not requiring immediate resuscitation at birth compared with immediate cord clamping. The American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics and European international guidelines for neonatal resuscitation suggest that for preterm newborns who do not require resuscitation at birth, it is reasonable to delay cord clamping for longer than 30 seconds. The majority of preterm newborns worldwide continue to receive an immediate cord clamping after birth, in particular, if delivered by cesarean delivery, to ensure a rapid start of resuscitation.,

Physiological studies, on animals indicate that effectively ventilating the lungs before clamping the cord results in a smoother hemodynamic postnatal adaptation compared with immediately clamping the cord. Effective ventilation of the lungs after a very premature birth is probably achieved after a longer time than 30 to 60 seconds, both in spontaneously breathing preterm newborns and in those who require respiratory support. We hypothesized that a longer delay in clamping the cord while starting to assist the newborn should allow smoother cardiorespiratory adaptation, especially in newborns who are not immediately breathing at birth.

Umbilical cord milking (UCM) is considered an alternative procedure to be performed at birth when delayed cord clamping is not feasible (eg, if immediate resuscitation is needed), because it better benefits preterm newborns compared with immediate cord clamping. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the effect of resuscitation with placental circulation intact (PCI) and delayed cord clamping with resuscitation with UCM in preterm newborns. Thus, the objective of our study was to compare the clinical outcomes observed with these 2 different strategies of resuscitation in preterm newborns.

Delayed cord clamping at 30 or more seconds versus early cord clamping at less than 30 seconds — very low-certainty evidence from four trials including 537 infants found that meta-analysis was not able to demonstrate an impact on neonatal mortality (RR, 2.54; 95% CI, 0.50–12.74), the need for resuscitation (RR, 5.08; 95% CI, 0.25–103.58), or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.69–1.95). The review noted that compared to early cord clamping, delayed cord clamping greater than or equal to 30 seconds may improve hematologic measures within 24 hours after birth and 7 days after birth but may make little to no difference to maternal postpartum hemorrhage greater than or equal to 500 ml.

Umbilical cord blood collection — obstetric and neonatal care, including delayed cord clamping, should be preserved during donation. Umbilical cord blood collection should not compromise obstetric or neonatal care or alter routine practice of delayed umbilical cord clamping with the rare exception of medical indications for directed donation. It is important to inform patients that the medical condition of the woman or neonate may prevent adequate umbilical cord blood collection. There is no current evidence to support the use of an autologous umbilical cord blood sample in regenerative medicine.

### Short, medium, and long deferral of umbilical cord clamping compared with umbilical cord milking and immediate clamping at preterm birth: a systematic review and network meta-analysis with individual participant data [^117Jrme9]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Deferred (also known as delayed) cord clamping can improve survival of infants born preterm (before 37 weeks of gestation), but the optimal duration of deferral remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data network meta-analysis with the aim of comparing the effectiveness of umbilical cord clamping strategies with different timings of clamping or with cord milking for preterm infants.

Methods

We searched medical databases and trial registries from inception until Feb 24, 2022 (updated June 6, 2023) for randomised controlled trials comparing cord clamping strategies for preterm infants. Individual participant data were harmonised and assessed for risk of bias and quality. Interventions were grouped into immediate clamping, short deferral (≥ 15 s to < 45 s), medium deferral (≥ 45 s to < 120 s), long deferral (≥ 120 s), and intact cord milking. The primary outcome was death before hospital discharge. We calculated one-stage, intention-to-treat Bayesian random-effects individual participant data network meta-analysis. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019136640.

Findings

We included individual participant data from 47 trials with 6094 participants. Of all interventions, long deferral reduced death before discharge the most (compared with immediate clamping; odds ratio 0.31 [95% credibility interval] 0.11–0.80; moderate certainty). The risk of bias was low for 10 (33%) of 30 trials, 14 (47%) had some concerns, and 6 (20%) were rated as having a high risk of bias. Heterogeneity was low, with no indication of inconsistency.

Interpretation

This study found that long deferral of clamping leads to reduced odds of death before discharge in preterm infants. In infants assessed as requiring immediate resuscitation, this finding might only be generalisable if there are provisions for such care with the cord intact. These results are based on thoroughly cleaned and checked individual participant data and can inform future guidelines and practice.

### Delayed umbilical cord clamping after birth: ACOG committee opinion, number 814 [^116G4VQC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Umbilical cord blood banking — delayed umbilical cord clamping significantly decreased the volume and total nucleated cell counts of cord blood donations, with the proportion of units meeting initial screening decreasing from 39% with immediate umbilical cord clamping to 17% in cases with a 60-second delay; immediate cord clamping may increase yield when a patient and family are planning donation, but in the absence of directed donation the benefits to the infant of transfusion of additional blood volume at birth likely exceed the benefits of banking that volume, and families considering banking should be counseled accordingly.

### Delayed cord clamping vs cord milking in elective cesarean delivery at term: a randomized controlled trial [^117N1YiC]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Delayed cord clamping has significant beneficial effects on the neonate and its transition to extrauterine life and, therefore, is common practice at vaginal births in the Netherlands. In 2015, 16% of neonates were born via cesarean delivery; moreover, in 81% of these cases, the umbilical cord was clamped and cut immediately. Neonatal benefits of delayed cord clamping are an increased circulating volume of 25 to 30 mL/kg, leading to a higher preload of both the right and left ventricles during the transition from umbilical circulation to pulmonary circulation, thus maintaining a stable left ventricle output, and to higher neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels 24 to 48 hours after birth. Currently, little is known about whether the abovementioned neonatal benefits of delayed cord clamping could apply to neonates delivered by cesarean delivery. In these cases, possible negative effects on neonatal outcomes (ie, neonatal hypothermia, lower Apgar scores, and hyperbilirubinemia) and maternal outcomes (ie, increased maternal blood loss and higher postoperative infection rate) should also be taken into consideration.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether clamping the umbilical cord after 2 minutes is superior to cord milking during elective cesarean deliveries at term, taking both short- and long-term neonatal and maternal outcomes into consideration, and to determine whether cord milking could be an appropriate alternative to delayed cord clamping.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a large secondary care center in the Netherlands (Amphia Hospital in Breda) from October 2020 to April 2022. A total of 115 patients who underwent an elective cesarean delivery between 37 0/7 and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation were included. The primary outcomes were neonatal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels at 48 hours after birth. The secondary outcomes were divided into neonatal and maternal outcomes.

Results

After randomization, 58 participants were treated with cord milking, and 57 participants were treated with delayed cord clamping. There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics between both groups. There was no significant difference in the primary outcomes, with a mean hemoglobin level 48 hours after birth of 12.1 mmol/L in the delayed cord clamping group and 12.2 mmol/L in the cord milking group (P = 0.80). Regarding our secondary outcomes, there was no significant difference regarding Apgar score, neonatal body temperature, maternal blood loss, and postoperative infection rate between our intervention groups.

Conclusion

Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels at 48 hours after birth showed no significant difference when comparing delayed cord clamping with cord milking. Delayed cord clamping did not lead to increased maternal blood loss or postoperative infections compared with a method with a much shorter timeframe between delivery and clamping of the umbilical cord, namely, cord milking. In addition, delayed cord clamping did not lead to a lower Apgar score or neonatal temperature compared with cord milking. Our research suggests that delayed cord clamping can be safely performed during elective cesarean deliveries at term. If intraoperative circumstances do not allow for delayed cord clamping, cord milking can be an appropriate alternative for the neonate at term.
