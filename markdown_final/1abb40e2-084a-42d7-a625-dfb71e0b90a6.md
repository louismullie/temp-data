## Question

high HDL

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage high HDL cholesterol, including when it becomes paradoxical and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how high HDL-C is defined and why it matters clinically. Then, I should verify the strength and direction of epidemiologic associations across the HDL spectrum. Next, I will examine mechanistic explanations for paradoxical risk at very high levels. After that, I need to check guideline positions and whether HDL-C should be a therapeutic target. Then, I will outline a practical clinical approach to evaluation and management, including when to escalate workup. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line recommendation and highlight uncertainties that warrant caution in interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical framing. High HDL-C is generally considered protective in the mid-to-high range, but "very high" or "extremely high" HDL-C has been repeatedly linked to adverse outcomes; thresholds around ≥ 80–90 mg/dL recur across cohorts and meta-analyses as the region where risk may plateau or rise, particularly in men and in those with established coronary artery disease, so I should keep those cut points in mind as I interpret a given value [^1153biBK] [^112srQyB] [^1176Az8m].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiologic signal before drawing conclusions. Large pooled cohorts show an inverse association between HDL-C and coronary events across lower ranges, but with a plateau or even increased risk at very high levels; for example, in pooled U.S. cohorts, CHD risk did not fall further beyond about 90 mg/dL in men and 75 mg/dL in women, and in Japanese pooled cohorts, HDL-C ≥ 90 mg/dL was associated with higher atherosclerotic CVD mortality, especially among current drinkers, suggesting a U-shaped relationship rather than a purely linear protective effect [^1121jZp4] [^1176Az8m]. I should also note that a 2024 meta-analysis of over one million individuals found no overall mortality benefit at HDL-C ≥ 80 mg/dL and signaled higher CV mortality beyond sex-specific thresholds, reinforcing the notion that more is not always better [^1153biBK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Mendelian randomization and genetic studies generally do not support a causal protective role for simply raising HDL-C; variants that increase HDL-C are not consistently associated with fewer cardiovascular events, and some CETP-related HDL elevations may even track with dysfunctional HDL subspecies, so the observed U-shape likely reflects biology and confounding rather than a direct causal benefit of very high HDL-C itself [^116Q23ZM] [^116YXgWV]. I should double-check that this aligns with clinical trial data; indeed, HDL-C–raising strategies have largely failed to improve outcomes when tested, further weakening a causal interpretation of HDL-C quantity alone [^115S8ad2].

> Next, I should review mechanisms that could explain paradoxical risk at very high HDL-C. Let me consider HDL function rather than mass: cholesterol efflux capacity, not HDL-C level, predicts incident ASCVD, and individuals with very high HDL-C can have impaired efflux and altered composition, including lower phospholipid content and enrichment in apoC3, which may promote rather than prevent atherogenesis; delayed catabolism with larger, cholesterol-laden HDL particles may also predispose to dysfunction and even intimal trapping, so very high HDL-C may be a marker of impaired reverse cholesterol transport rather than enhanced protection [^111wCqHW] [^116QBUGo] [^116YXgWV] [^115SxcwK]. I need to ensure I also account for noncardiovascular contributors; very high HDL-C clusters with heavy alcohol use, which itself increases mortality, complicating observational interpretations and reinforcing the need to contextualize any extreme HDL value [^1176Az8m] [^115SxcwK].

> I will now examine guideline positions to avoid overinterpreting HDL-C. Major societies advise that HDL-C is not a therapeutic target; risk stratification and therapy should focus on atherogenic lipoproteins such as LDL-C, non–HDL-C, and apoB, with HDL-C used primarily as a risk marker within calculators rather than as a goal of treatment, so I should not recommend drugs solely to raise HDL-C [^111xoZLZ] [^116da9qC] [^115r6ugn]. But wait, what if the patient has very high HDL-C and low LDL-C; does that obviate statins? No — guidelines still anchor prevention on atherogenic cholesterol burden, so management should be individualized to overall risk and the rest of the lipid profile, not to HDL-C alone [^116U8Lqy].

> Let me think about a practical clinical approach when HDL-C is high. First, I should confirm the laboratory value and repeat testing to exclude analytic error or transient fluctuation; then, I should review the entire lipid profile, including triglycerides, LDL-C, and non–HDL-C, and assess lifestyle factors such as alcohol intake, physical activity, and adiposity, because heavy alcohol use can artifactually elevate HDL-C and confound risk interpretation [^111xoZLZ] [^1176Az8m]. Next, I should review secondary causes and medications that influence HDL, and consider whether the elevation is isolated or part of a broader dyslipidemia pattern; if HDL-C is extremely high, particularly ≥ 90–100 mg/dL, I should consider further evaluation for genetic contributors and, in select cases, assess HDL function where available, recognizing that efflux assays are not yet standard of care but can be informative in research or specialized centers [^1145m427] [^111wCqHW].

> For management, I need to ensure I prioritize what changes outcomes. That means intensifying lifestyle measures that lower atherogenic lipoproteins and improve HDL quality — regular aerobic and resistance exercise, weight optimization, smoking cessation, dietary pattern emphasizing reduced saturated fat and refined carbohydrates, and moderation of alcohol — while treating LDL-C and non–HDL-C to guideline targets with statins and, when indicated, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or selective therapies for hypertriglyceridemia; I should avoid agents used solely to raise HDL-C, such as niacin, given lack of outcome benefit and potential harms [^111xoZLZ] [^116U8Lqy] [^116da9qC]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overlooking residual risk; in patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or persistently elevated triglycerides, non–HDL-C or apoB–guided strategies are preferred secondary targets to capture atherogenic particle burden beyond LDL-C [^116U8Lqy] [^114EB8LN].

> I should confirm when to escalate evaluation for extremely high HDL-C. If HDL-C is ≥ 90–100 mg/dL, especially with premature ASCVD or a family history of extreme HDL phenotypes, I should consider referral for advanced lipid testing and, where available, functional HDL assays; while not routine, these assessments can identify dysfunctional HDL and guide counseling, even though they do not yet mandate a specific pharmacotherapy [^111wCqHW] [^116QBUGo]. But wait, what if the patient is on a CETP inhibitor in a trial setting; I need to remember that CETP modulation can raise HDL-C yet yield mixed clinical signals, reinforcing that HDL-C level is an imperfect surrogate for cardiovascular benefit [^116YXgWV].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line so I do not overstate anything. High HDL-C in the 40–80 mg/dL range remains a favorable risk marker, but very high HDL-C, typically ≥ 80–90 mg/dL, is not necessarily protective and may signal paradoxical risk, particularly in men and in those with established CAD; therefore, I should treat HDL-C as a risk enhancer or biomarker rather than a therapeutic target, and I should never use HDL-C alone to justify withholding indicated atherogenic cholesterol–lowering therapy [^112srQyB] [^1153biBK] [^111xoZLZ]. I need to ensure my plan emphasizes comprehensive risk reduction, addresses lifestyle and secondary causes, and targets LDL-C and non–HDL-C per guidelines, reserving specialized testing for extreme phenotypes or unresolved risk despite optimal standard care [^116U8Lqy] [^114EB8LN].

High HDL cholesterol is generally protective, but **very high HDL-C (≥ 80 mg/dL)** is paradoxically associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially in men and those with coronary artery disease [^112srQyB] [^1176Az8m]. This U-shaped risk curve likely reflects **dysfunctional HDL** with impaired reverse cholesterol transport and pro-inflammatory properties, not a true causal benefit of higher HDL-C [^111wCqHW] [^113wwkUS]. Clinically, **HDL-C is not a therapeutic target**; management should focus on LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB, with lifestyle and statins as first-line therapy [^111xoZLZ] [^114EB8LN]. Very high HDL-C warrants evaluation for secondary causes (e.g. alcohol, liver disease, genetic variants) and consideration of HDL function testing, but no evidence supports lowering HDL-C pharmacologically [^114Nvijj] [^116QBUGo].

---

## Epidemiological evidence on high HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular risk

Multiple large cohort studies show a **U-shaped association** between HDL-C and mortality: risk falls with rising HDL-C up to ~60–80 mg/dL, then plateaus or rises at higher levels [^112srQyB] [^11616Q3m]. A meta-analysis of 1,004,584 individuals found that **very high HDL-C (≥ 80 mg/dL)** was linked to higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, particularly in men and those with CAD [^notfound]. Similarly, Japanese cohorts showed a **2.37-fold increase** in atherosclerotic CVD mortality at HDL-C ≥ 90 mg/dL [^1176Az8m].

---

## Biological mechanisms underlying the paradoxical association

Several mechanisms may explain why very high HDL-C is harmful:

- **Impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT)**: Very high HDL-C may reflect delayed catabolism and reduced RCT efficiency, promoting cholesterol accumulation and atherosclerosis [^115SxcwK] [^116YXgWV].

- **Altered HDL composition and function**: High HDL-C can coexist with dysfunctional HDL that has reduced anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiatherogenic properties [^114Nvijj] [^116QBUGo].

- **Genetic variants**: Certain variants (e.g. SCARB1, CETP) raise HDL-C but increase CVD risk, likely via impaired RCT or altered HDL structure [^116YXgWV] [^117PLFiQ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that **HDL-C is not a therapeutic target**. Management should prioritize LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB reduction using lifestyle and statins; HDL-C is a risk marker, not a modifiable target [^111xoZLZ] [^114EB8LN].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

For patients with very high HDL-C, clinicians should:

- **Evaluate secondary causes**: Assess alcohol use, liver disease, and genetic variants that can elevate HDL-C and alter function [^115SxcwK] [^116Q23ZM].

- **Focus on overall risk**: Prioritize LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB control with lifestyle and statins; no pharmacologic therapy is recommended to lower HDL-C [^111xoZLZ] [^116U8Lqy].

- **Consider HDL function testing**: In select cases, cholesterol efflux capacity or other functional assays may help assess HDL quality, though they are not routinely available [^111wCqHW] [^116QBUGo].

---

## Conclusion

High HDL-C is generally protective, but **very high HDL-C (≥ 80 mg/dL)** is paradoxically associated with higher mortality, likely due to dysfunctional HDL. HDL-C should not be targeted therapeutically; management should focus on LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB reduction with lifestyle and statins, with evaluation for secondary causes when HDL-C is very high.

### Revisiting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in cardiovascular disease: is too much of a good thing always a good thing? [^112JDLXu]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be a leading cause of global mortality and morbidity. Various established risk factors are linked to CVD, and modifying these risk factors is fundamental in CVD management. Clinical studies underscore the association between dyslipidemia and CVD, and therapeutic interventions that target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol elicit clear benefits. Despite the correlation between low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and heightened CVD risk, HDL-raising therapies have yet to showcase significant clinical benefits. Furthermore, evidence from epidemiological and genetic studies reveals that not only low HDL-C levels, but also very high levels of HDL-C are linked to increased risk of CVD. In this review, we focus on HDL metabolism and delve into the relationship between HDL and CVD, exploring HDL functions and the observed alterations in its roles in disease. Altogether, the results discussed herein support the conventional wisdom that "too much of a good thing is not always a good thing". Thus, our recommendation is that a careful reconsideration of the impact of high HDL-C levels is warranted, and shall be revisited in future research.

### Treating low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: what is the evidence? [^111sNcW4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, genetic and interventional studies have failed to consistently support this relationship. There is an increasing body of evidence that the function of HDL, including its antiatherogenic properties and its reverse cholesterol transport activity, has a greater impact on CVD risk compared with levels of HDL alone. Targeting HDL has become a growing interest. Nevertheless, raising HDL pharmacologically has failed to show a considerable, if any, impact on cardiovascular outcome. Efforts should focus on improving HDL quality in addition to raising HDL levels when developing new therapies. Ongoing and future research will help determine the most safe and effective approach to improve cardiovascular outcome and establish the safety, efficacy and impact on atherosclerosis of the emerging HDL-raising therapies.

### High-density lipoproteins: a consensus statement from the National Lipid Association [^115r6ugn]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2013). Low credibility.

For > 4 decades it has been recognized that elevated serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its sequelae. Many prospective observational studies performed around the world have confirmed an inverse relationship between HDL-C and cardiovascular risk in people irrespective of sex, race, or ethnicity. Consequently, it was assumed that, by extension, raising HDL-C through lifestyle modification and pharmacologic intervention would reduce risk of CVD. Animal studies are consistent with this assumption. Lipid treatment guidelines around the world promoted the recognition of HDL-C as a therapeutic target, especially in high-risk patients. Some post hoc analyses from randomized controlled trials also suggest that raising HDL-C beneficially affects the risk of CVD. However, a number of recent randomized studies putatively designed to test the "HDL hypothesis" have failed to show benefit. The results of these trials have caused many clinicians to question whether HDL-C is a legitimate therapeutic target. In response to the many questions and uncertainties raised by the results of these trials, the National Lipid Association convened an expert panel to evaluate the current status of HDL-C as a therapeutic target; to review the current state of knowledge of HDL particle structure, composition, and function; and to identify the salient questions yet to be answered about the role of HDL in either preventing or contributing to atherosclerotic disease. The expert panel's conclusions and clinical recommendations are summarized herein. The panel concludes that, although low HDL-C identifies patients at elevated risk, and much investigation suggests that HDL may play a variety of antiatherogenic roles, HDL-C is not a therapeutic target at the present time. Risk stratified atherogenic lipoprotein burden (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-HDL-C) should remain the primary and secondary targets of therapy in patients at risk, as described by established guidelines. The National Lipid Association emphasizes that rigorous research into the biology and clinical significance of low HDL-C should continue. The development of novel drugs designed to modulate the serum levels and functionality of HDL particles should also continue. On the basis of an enormous amount of basic scientific and clinical investigation, a considerable number of reasons support the need to continue to investigate the therapeutic effect of modulating HDL structure and function.

### HDL cholesterol and protective factors in atherosclerosis [^111KVvoe]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological and clinical studies provide evidence that HDL-C levels are linked to rates of coronary events. The cardioprotective effects of HDL-C have been attributed to its role in reverse cholesterol transport, its effects on endothelial cells, and its antioxidant activity. Although some clinical trials suggest a benefit of raising HDL-C to reduce risk, further studies are needed, and HDL-C is still not considered a primary target of therapy in the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. However, HDL-C should be considered as part of the patient's overall profile of established risk factors in determining treatment strategies.

### High-density lipoprotein as a therapeutic target: a systematic review [^117XqcuD]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a cardiovascular risk factor that is gaining substantial interest as a therapeutic target.

Objectives

To review the current and emerging strategies that modify high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).

Data Sources

Systematic search of English-language literature (1965-May 2007) in MEDLINE and the Cochrane database, using the key words HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I and the subheadings reverse cholesterol transport, CVD [cardiovascular disease] prevention and control, drug therapy, and therapy; review of presentations made at major cardiovascular meetings from 2003–2007; and review of ongoing trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and current guidelines from major cardiovascular societies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Study selection was prioritized to identify randomized controlled trials over meta-analyses over mechanistic studies; identified studies also included proof-of-concept studies and key phase 1 through 3 trials of novel agents. Study eligibility was assessed by 2 authors; disagreements were resolved by consensus with the third.

Data Synthesis

Of 754 studies identified, 31 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Currently available therapeutic and lifestyle strategies, when optimized, increase HDL-C levels by 20% to 30%. While basic and small pilot studies have shown promise, proof that increasing HDL-C levels confers a reduction in major cardiovascular outcomes independent of changes in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides has been more elusive. Some novel therapeutic agents in human studies appear to effectively increase HDL-C levels, whereas other novel strategies that target HDL metabolism or function may have minimal effect on HDL-C levels.

Conclusions

At present there is modest evidence to support aggressively increasing HDL-C levels in addition to what is achieved by lifestyle modification alone. Ongoing clinical trials that target specific pathways in HDL metabolism may help expand cardiovascular treatment options.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and treatment guidelines [^111fbp94]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Setting consistent guidelines for the treatment of lipid abnormalities must take into consideration several factors and must balance the need for precision (favored by specialists) and practicality in the patient setting (favored by general medical practitioners). The appropriate populations for treatment should be clearly defined, and usual threshold levels, target levels, and treatment should be well established. Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has not been widely incorporated in guidelines as a significant abnormality predictive of cardiovascular risk and as a therapeutic target. However, that view is changing in the light of recent improved understanding of the importance of each lipid fraction abnormality, including HDL-C, in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic disease. In addition, clinical trials have demonstrated the apparent benefit of increasing low levels of HDL-C in reducing cardiovascular events. The use of guidelines incorporating threshold and target levels for managing HDL-C in high-risk populations is becoming seen as a practical means of improving the outcome for patients, especially for special groups, such as the elderly and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### HDL cholesterol is not HDL – don't judge the book by its cover [^114TkZEJ]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

The concept that raising HDL-cholesterol level will uniformly translate into cardiovascular risk reduction has been challenged by genetic epidemiology studies and large-scale, randomized clinical trials. Studies suggest that we should go beyond HDL cholesterol, and consider emerging biomarkers of HDL concentration, composition, and functionality as surrogates for cardiovascular risk reduction.

Final considerations

Taken together, HDL is a dynamic multifaceted lipoprotein that can serve several physiological roles, most of which have been preserved throughout evolution for other reasons than protection from atherosclerosis (Graphical Abstract). Clinically, low HDL-C remains a strong and important risk marker for increased risk of ASCVD, likely due to the inverse association with increased levels of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. For patients with extremely high HDL-C, the documented increased risk of infectious disease and all-cause mortality should inform patients and doctors alike of the possible negative prognostic consequences of high HDL-C. Finally, the observed increased risk of AMD observationally and causal, genetically for any increase in HDL levels is of concern. Future efforts to pharmacologically modulate HDL should likely focus on functional metrics of HDL function rather than HDL-C and other clinical indications besides ASCVD.

### High-density lipoprotein and coronary heart disease: current and future therapies [^115x5xiZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease remains a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality despite therapeutic advances that control many risk factors such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to levels lower than previously possible. Population studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels with the risk of coronary heart disease. As a result, HDL-C is gaining increasing interest as a therapeutic target. In this review, we explore the protective mechanisms of HDL and how current and future therapies harness these beneficial properties. We offer a biological framework to understand treatment strategies as well as their resultant successes and failures to guide management and future directions. At present, raising HDL-C level holds great promise, on the basis of epidemiology and initial trials, but we await the outcomes of the many large clinical outcomes trials currently under way to define the clinical role of older and novel therapies to raise HDL-C level.

### HDL cholesterol studies – more of the same? [^113Z8R66]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Studies published in 2012 in the field of HDL research have provided further evidence suggesting that a low HDL-cholesterol level, in the absence of related lipid or nonlipid risk factors, is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Beginning to understand high-density lipoproteins [^1177nBkn]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

This article reconciles the classic view of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) associated with low risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with recent data (genetics studies and randomized clinical trials) casting doubt over the widely accepted beneficial role of HDL regarding CVD risk. Although HDL cholesterol has been used as a surrogate measure to investigate HDL function, the cholesterol content in HDL particles is not an indicator of the atheroprotective properties of HDL. Thus, more precise measures of HDL metabolism are needed to reflect and account for the beneficial effects of HDL particles. Current and emerging therapies targeting HDL are discussed.

### HDL – is it too big to fail? [^115rpfxi]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

The HDL hypothesis has suffered damage in the past few years. Clinical trials have shown that raising HDL cholesterol levels does not improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In addition, Mendelian randomization studies have shown that DNA variants that alter HDL cholesterol levels in populations are unrelated to incident CVD events. Balancing this deluge of negative data are substantial basic science data supporting the concept that raising HDL cholesterol levels reduces CVD risk. Also, functionally relevant HDL subfractions might be more important determinants of risk than overall HDL cholesterol levels. But, while wobbly, the HDL hypothesis is still standing, seemingly too big to fail owing to past intellectual, economic and psychological investments in the idea.

### Role of high-density lipoproteins in cholesterol homeostasis and glycemic control [^115mosR7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Numerous human epidemiological studies have established unequivocally that a high plasma high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) level is inversely associated with the risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 1 This has led to the hypothesis that increasing HDL‐C levels may reduce the risk of having a cardiovascular event. However, most therapies that increase plasma HDL‐C levels have not reduced cardiovascular events when tested in large‐scale clinical outcome trials. Despite these discouraging results, there has been an upside suggesting that interventions that increase HDL‐C levels are associated with significantly improved glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 2, 3, 4 When this association is considered in light of outcomes from preclinical studies and small randomized clinical trials in which HDL‐C levels were increased in patients with T2DM, as well as in vitro studies that have provided an insight into the molecular basis of the clinical findings, it follows that modulating the individual constituents of HDLs, which may or may not include increasing HDL‐C levels, may be a potential therapeutic target for improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus.

This review outlines what is known about the antidiabetic properties of HDLs and the main HDL apolipoprotein, apoA‐I. Insights into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and how they are regulated by intracellular and plasma cholesterol levels, is also discussed in the context of the 2 main forms of diabetes mellitus: T2DM, in which insulin resistance leads to pancreatic β‐cell compensation and increased insulin secretion that eventually culminates in β‐cell exhaustion and complete loss of function; and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is characterized by selective autoimmune β‐cell destruction.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the cardiovascular equation: does the "good" still count? [^115yUJ6P]. Atherosclerosis (2005). Low credibility.

This article will discuss our current understanding of the role of HDL-C in the statin era, focusing on the question as to whether HDL-C still "counts" when determining cardiovascular risk. Epidemiologic evidence consistently demonstrates that low HDL-C is a strong and independent risk factor for CHD. The epidemiologic evidence is complimented by clinical data showing that interventions that raise HDL-C are associated with reductions in CHD risk, as well as by a growing body of experimental data demonstrating biologically plausible mechanisms that may underlie the observed clinical findings. Analyses of large statin trials also indicate that the significant and independent relationship between HDL-C and CHD risk persists despite the therapeutic effects of statins, and that HDL-C levels in statin-treated patients, both at baseline and in response to statin therapy, are relevant. Early studies on novel HDL targeting therapies are promising, but their long term safety profile and impact on clinical outcomes is yet to be determined in larger studies. Recent guidelines emphasize low HDL-C as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, specifically identify HDL-C as a target for intervention, and encourage the use of HDL-C raising interventions in high-risk patients with low HDL-C levels.

High-density lipoprotein in mortality

Both low and extremely high HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality(Figure 5). Whereas the association with low HDL-C levels concurs with the repeatedly observed increased risk of ASCVD, the increased mortality at extremely high HDL-C levels is less easily understood. This finding, however, derives from many studies, and raises the question of whether extremely high HDL-C levels have deleterious effects. Demonstrating a causal effect is very difficult, as conventional Mendelian randomization studies assume linear effects (the higher the level, the higher the risk over the entire concentration range, or vice versa). Non-linear Mendelian randomization designs can be used for U-shaped observational associations, but such studies need even more statistical power, and hitherto no such studies have examined whether extremely high HDL-C levels are causally related to increased mortality. Naturally, this limitation is also valid for low HDL-C associated with increased mortality, as well as for the other U-shaped relationships described in the following.

### Regulation of high-density lipoprotein metabolism [^111emnKy]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

There is compelling evidence from human population studies that plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol correlate inversely with cardiovascular risk. Identification of this relationship has stimulated research designed to understand how HDL metabolism is regulated. The ultimate goal of these studies has been to develop HDL-raising therapies that have the potential to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, the situation has turned out to be much more complex than originally envisaged. This is partly because the HDL fraction consists of multiple subpopulations of particles that vary in terms of shape, size, composition, and surface charge, as well as in their potential cardioprotective properties. This heterogeneity is a consequence of the continual remodeling and interconversion of HDL subpopulations by multiple plasma factors. Evidence that the remodeling of HDLs may impact on their cardioprotective properties is beginning to emerge. This serves to highlight the importance of understanding not only how the remodeling and interconversion of HDL subpopulations is regulated but also how these processes are affected by agents that increase HDL levels. This review provides an overview of what is currently understood about HDL metabolism and how the subpopulation distribution of these lipoproteins is regulated.

### HDL cholesterol and ASCVD risk stratification: a debate [^115odtmY]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

This debate is designed to review the usefulness of the cholesterol mass within high-density lipoproteins (HDL-C) to predict the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). PRO: There is much current confusion regarding the role of high density lipoproteins (HDLs) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). While it is an established fact that the concentration of HDL cholesterol is a robust, independent, inverse predictor of the risk of having an ASCVD event, recent studies have questioned whether HDLs actually protect against ASCVD. But this in no way challenges that fact that the concentration of HDL cholesterol is a powerful tool to be used in risk stratification of ASCVD. CON: The measurement of HDL-C in the 1970 heralded a new area of promising and exciting research in cardiovascular disease. The measurement of HDL-C has been part of cardiovascular risk stratification for the past three decades. HDL have pleotropic beneficial effects on the arterial vasculature and promote the removal of excess cholesterol from lipid laden macrophages. These effects are only weakly correlated with HDL-C levels. While HDL-C is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the epidemiological relationship falters at the extremes of measurement. Mendelian randomization does not support a link of causality and to date, attempts to raise HDL-C pharmacologically have not yielded the expected outcomes. The time has come to consider abandoning HDL-C for cardiovascular risk prediction and clinical decision making and to double efforts to develop better biomarkers of HDL function.

### Assessing low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a risk factor in coronary heart disease: a working group report and update [^11385xBq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical data show that a 1% increase in serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) can decrease cardiovascular risk by 2% to 3%. Therefore, mechanisms affecting the level and functionality of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its constituents are being investigated as targets for the rational development of drugs to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease. High-density lipoprotein-related research may also increase our understanding of the link between atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. This report and update of the HDL Working Group discusses HDL metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport, impaired HDL as a marker and a cause of proatherogenic states, and experimental and current approaches to HDL-related therapy.

### Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with risk of cardiovascular disease among initially high-density lipoprotein-high participants [^117KbKpW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

However, HDL-C levels may not always correspond to its functionality. For example, a prospective study involving 8,267 general population found a lower CVD risk with an increased cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) mediated by HDL-C, independently of their HDL-C levels. Another finding has suggested that the CEC of HDL-C was substantially and inversely related to the prevalence of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis and with incident CVD, irrespective of HDL-C levels. Additionally, unique phenotypes where CHD developed in the absence of traditional risk factors and with a very high HDL-C level have been observed, defying the commonly held belief that HDL-C plays a cardioprotective role. Individuals with very high HDL-C levels may be more vulnerable to CVD, and lower CEC is thought to be one of the reasons. Despite a number of studies challenging the role of HDL-C as a preventive factor against CVD, these studies have largely focused on a single time point level of HDL-C, typically the extremely high level above 80 mg/dL. Thus, more research is required to ascertain the effect of HDL-C level changes on CVD risk, especially among those with high but not very high levels of HDL-C. Hence, this study aimed to provide evidence as to whether an increase in HDL-C is related to incident CVD events among participants who already had a high HDL-C level. According to the 4th edition Korean guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia, HDL-C levels of 60 mg/dL or higher are considered high HDL-C levels and a protective factor against CVD. Thus, this study focused on individuals with baseline HDL-C levels of ≥ 60 mg/dL.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and statin use among U.S. adults with intermediate 10-year predicted ASCVD risk [^1159otMh]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults in the United States without diabetes mellitus (DM) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% to < 20% are labeled as "intermediate risk" and are recommended for consideration of a moderate-intensity statin for primary prevention. Historically, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has been regarded as "good cholesterol", which was based on epidemiologic studies demonstrating an association between high HDL-C and lower ASCVD risk. However, Mendelian randomization studies and clinical trials suggest that HDL-C itself is unlikely to have a causal role in ASCVD. High HDL-C may in fact reflect a dysfunctional state of poor efflux capacity and thus reduced lipid clearance leading to overly cholesterol-rich HDL. Instead, HDL function may be more relevant to atherosclerosis as there is significant heterogeneity in HDL activity by subpopulation which is reflected by variation in structure (eg, apolipoprotein presence). Nevertheless, the perception of HDL-C as "good cholesterol" may still affect decisions on statin initiation. We determined if statin use differed by HDL-C levels among adults with an intermediate 10-year ASCVD risk (7.5% to < 20%).

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Among U.S. adults with similar predicted 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, does statin use differ by level of HDL-C?

What is the main finding?

In a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk of 7.5% to < 20%, statin use was lower among adults with high HDL-C compared to normal.

### Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease: risk reduction with statin therapy [^114HSm6M]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease; however, patients with low levels of HDL-C without raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not currently eligible for lipid-lowering therapy. Many individuals with low levels of HDL-C have a combination of cardiovascular risk factors that include high LDL particle concentrations. Lowering LDL particle concentration and its surrogate measure, LDL-C, is an important approach to reducing cardiovascular risk. Statins are the most effective agents for lowering levels of LDL and can significantly increase levels of HDL-C. Extending statin therapy to patients with low levels of HDL-C but with LDL-C levels below target may have benefits for cardiovascular disease reduction in these patients.

### Association between very high HDL-C levels and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1153biBK]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent research has raised questions about the assumed cardiovascular (CV) benefits of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the potential for adverse outcomes with extremely high levels.

Objective

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between very high HDL-C levels (≥ 80 mg/dL) and mortality outcomes in individuals without coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for studies comparing very high HDL-C levels to normal levels (40–60 mg/dL) in CAD-free individuals. We assessed heterogeneity using I 2 statistics with a random-effects model.

Results

Our analysis included 1,004,584 individuals from 8 studies, of whom 133,646 (13.3%) had very high HDL-C levels. All-cause mortality did not significantly differ between groups (p = 0.55), nor did cancer mortality (p = 0.45). Cardiovascular mortality showed no change in those with very high HDL-C (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94–1.17; p = 0.37). Fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease events were less frequent in the very high HDL-C group (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.73–0.86; p < 0.00001). Subgroup dose-response analysis revealed that very high HDL-C levels increased cardiovascular death in women above 116 mg/dL (HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.01–2.15) and in men above 94 mg/dL (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01–1.65) (p_nonlinearity < 0.01).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that very high HDL-C levels are not protective against CV mortality and may, in fact, increase CV mortality risk especially in men.

### Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased cardiovascular disease risk: an analysis of statin clinical trials [^111PYcuy]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

It is well established that low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Growing evidence from epidemiologic as well as intervention studies have identified that a low level of HDL cholesterol contributes to cardiovascular disease risk. In addition, a number of clinical trials have substantiated that an inverse association between HDL cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular risk exists. Decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins has a major impact on cardiovascular risk reduction, and statin therapy plays a significant role in the management of CAD. However, low levels of HDL cholesterol remain as a cardiovascular risk factor despite statin therapy. This article presents an overview of statin clinical trials and discusses implications for the clinical management of patients with low HDL cholesterol levels and increased cardiovascular risk.

### Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with risk of cardiovascular disease among initially high-density lipoprotein-high participants [^111h32tT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were previously considered to be inversely associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The risk of CVD drops by 2–3% for every unit rise in HDL-C levels. However, HDL-C therapy, such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition, which raises its level, has been questioned in terms of CVD risk reduction. A recent study found that very high HDL-C levels are associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), suggesting that HDL-C levels may worsen all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Very high levels of HDL-C have also been associated with a higher mortality rate, according to epidemiological studies of CVD-free populations in Canada and northern Europe.

The reverse cholesterol transport, which is predominantly driven by cholesterol efflux, is one of the protective effects of HDL against CVD. Reverse cholesterol transport refers to the efflux of extracellular cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver, where it is metabolized and then excreted in the bile and feces. As a result of insufficient reverse transfer of cholesterol, which leaves extra cellular cholesterol in the vasculature, low HDL-C levels may increase the risk of atherosclerosis.

### Epidemiologic evidence for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a risk factor for coronary artery disease [^115ZDzn4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely related to coronary artery disease incidence in both women and men, with a proportionately increasing effect of HDL-C throughout the average (or slightly above average)-to-low concentration range. A substantial body of evidence from major epidemiologic studies has established that this coronary artery disease risk associated with HDL-C is entirely independent of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, other lipid parameters (triglycerides, total cholesterol), and other nonlipid risk factors. The coronary artery disease relative risk for patients with low levels of HDL-C in conjunction with low total cholesterol is also markedly higher than in patients with a profile of high levels of these 2 lipid parameters. Similarly, the risk associated with a low HDL-C level is of particular significance in patients with established coronary artery disease or with type 2 diabetes, and it is a more pertinent factor to consider when managing dyslipidemia.

### High-density lipoprotein function, dysfunction, and reverse cholesterol transport [^114Nvijj]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2012). Low credibility.

Although high high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels are associated with decreased cardiovascular risk in epidemiological studies, recent genetic and pharmacological findings have raised doubts about the beneficial effects of HDL. Raising HDL levels in animal models by infusion or overexpression of apolipoprotein A-I has shown clear vascular improvements, such as delayed atherosclerotic lesion progression and accelerated lesion regression, along with increased reverse cholesterol transport. Inflammation and other factors, such as myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation, can impair HDL production and HDL function, with regard to its reverse cholesterol transport, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Thus, tests of HDL function, which have not yet been developed as routine diagnostic assays, may prove useful and be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than HDL-cholesterol levels.

### High-density lipoproteins and atherosclerosis [^111XDufv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are strongly related to risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Low levels of HDL cholesterol are a major cardiovascular risk factor, and overexpression of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, markedly inhibits progression and even induces regression of atherosclerosis in animal models. Clinical data regarding the effect of increasing HDL cholesterol on vascular events are limited. HDL remains an important potential target for therapeutic intervention. A variety of gene products are involved in the regulation of HDL metabolism. Yet, the mechanisms by which HDL inhibits atherosclerosis are not yet fully understood. There remains much to be learned about HDL metabolism and its relation to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular risk factors.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol: an emerging target for stroke treatment [^113Ko7od]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

This review characterizes the current state of knowledge of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in relation to stroke.

Summary Of Review

HDL has anti-atherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory properties and is an important component in atherosclerosis. Serum HDL-cholesterol levels are inversely related to heart disease and stroke risk. There are various established and experimental treatments which can raise serum HDL cholesterol and improve its function.

Conclusions

HDL is an emerging target for atherosclerotic stroke treatment with the potential to dramatically impact the care of stroke patients.

### High-density lipoprotein revisited: biological functions and clinical relevance [^114uF62t]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Is high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol all we need to measure?

High-density lipoprotein structure and composition

HDL is the smallest circulating lipoprotein and is found near all cells. HDL contains both proteins and lipids (Figure 1), but the unique arrangement of its two main constituents in different HDL particle sub-species provides insights into understanding its various physiological roles. Lipids in HDL are arranged in a micelle-like configuration, with the abundant amphipathic lipids (phospholipids and free cholesterol) forming a surface monolayer and the more hydrophobic or neutral lipids (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) in the particle core. Particles with a hydrophobic neutral lipid core form spherical-like structures approximately 8–11 nm in diameter (referred to as α-migrating HDL, based on their migration on agarose gel), whereas particles depleted of neutral lipids form disc-like structures.

### HDL-C: helpful, harmful, hopeful, or guilty by association [^1155L83H]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the complex relationship of high-density lipoproteins and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Recent Findings

The identification of a U-shaped curve between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk highlights the nuanced relationship emerging over several decades. Perspectives on the utility of HDL-C as a modifiable risk factor for ASCVD have shifted from focusing on its quantity to enhancing its functionality. Recent trials directed at improving HDL particle function have similarly not reliably demonstrated a cardiovascular benefit.

Summary

In this review we aim to discuss the studies investigating HDL-C in the prevention of ASCVD by discussing the potentially helpful biochemical functions and the attempts to improve cardiovascular outcomes by modifying HDL. We then discuss rising evidence of an increasing degree of cardiovascular disease in those with elevated HDL-C, and whether we should be hopeful for future therapeutics or investigative directions. We further discuss whether HDL-C should be viewed as "guilty by association" reflecting a complex milieu of pathologic processes, and how that may favor its consideration as a biomarker or risk-enhancer.

### Coronary heart disease risks associated with high levels of HDL cholesterol [^116HAvPv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The association between high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and coronary heart disease (CHD) events is inverse and linear across a large range of HDL‐C (30 to 60 mg/dL) values. – Over the last several decades limited observational cohort data have suggested a possible threshold effect or increased risks for CHD and total mortality events in participants with HDL‐C > 80 mg/dL. – However, the sample size of individuals with very high HDL‐C was very small in most studies, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about the risks for CHD and total mortality associated with extremely high levels of HDL‐C. Since the guideline‐based use of lipid‐lowering pharmacotherapy is based on risk assessment, patients with very high levels of HDL‐C present a clinical dilemma, as the CHD risk associated with HDL‐C > 80 mg/dL is not well described.

The Lifetime Risk Pooling Project is a very large dataset with extensive phenotyping that provides a unique opportunity to study CHD risks across the full range of HDL‐C values, including those in individuals with extreme elevations in HDL‐C. In addition, the detailed covariate data from these cohorts allow for adjustment for many potential confounding variables. In this study, we aimed to quantify, in unadjusted and adjusted models, the hazards for CHD events and total mortality in individuals with very high HDL‐C. We hypothesized that we would see independent increased hazards for CHD events in individuals with very high levels of HDL‐C when compared with a 45 mg/dL and 55 mg/dL referent in men and women, respectively.

### Novel insights from human studies on the role of high-density lipoprotein in mortality and noncardiovascular disease [^112g7YG9]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of research about HDL (high-density lipoprotein) has for decades revolved around the possible role of HDL in atherosclerosis and its therapeutic potential within cardiovascular disease prevention; however, failures with therapies aimed at increasing HDL cholesterol has left questions as to what the role and function of HDL in human health and disease is. Recent observational studies have further shown that extreme high HDL cholesterol is associated with high mortality leading to speculations that HDL could in some instances be harmful. In addition, evidence from observational, and to a lesser extent genetic studies has emerged indicating that HDL might be associated with the development of other major noncardiovascular diseases, such as infectious disease, autoimmune disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, and lung disease. In this review, we discuss (1) the association between extreme high HDL cholesterol and mortality and (2) the emerging human evidence linking HDL to several major diseases outside the realm of cardiovascular disease.

### Metabolic abnormalities: high-density lipoproteins [^117NPPZL]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The dyslipidemia typically found in subjects with the metabolic syndrome includes an elevated concentration of plasma triglyceride, a low-density lipoprotein fraction in which the particles are smaller and denser than normal, and a low concentration of highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This article is concerned with the low HDL component. It provides an overview of HDL structure and metabolism and describes the functions of HDLs that may be cardioprotective. The article then outlines what is known about the concentration and subpopulation distribution of HDLs in the metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms responsible for the low HDL are discussed. The consequences of a low HDL concentration in this syndrome are addressed before the article concludes with a discussion of whether low HDL in the metabolic syndrome should be a therapeutic target.

### High-density lipoprotein metabolism: potential therapeutic targets [^112j8dXM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can substantially reduce coronary artery disease (CAD)-related morbidity and mortality. The prevention and management of CAD has chiefly focused on 1 component of the lipid profile: the reduction of LDL cholesterol. Yet, the majority of patients in both the primary and secondary prevention settings continue to experience significant residual risk for acute cardiovascular events even when their LDL cholesterol is lowered aggressively with combinations of lifestyle modification and pharmacologic intervention. As a result, there is increased focus on targeting and treating low serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in an effort to further reduce risk for cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ischemic stroke, and death. Epidemiologically high serum levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with reduced risk for the development of atherosclerotic disease. HDL particles are believed to be antiatherogenic secondary to their capacity to drive reverse cholesterol transport and antagonize pathways of inflammation, thrombosis, and oxidation. HDL cholesterol can be quite challenging to raise in many individuals because of the large number of polymorphisms in the genes, enzymes, cell surface receptors, and apoproteins that regulate the serum concentrations, functionality, and patterns of metabolism of HDL particles This article reviews HDL metabolism and established as well as emerging therapeutic approaches to raising serum concentrations of this fascinating and complex lipoprotein.

Figure 5
High-density lipoprotein levels on a continuous scale and risk of all-cause mortality in men and women from the Copenhagen General Population Study. Adapted from Madsen et al.

The largest observational studies showed that extremely high HDL-C levels were not associated with a higher risk of cancer mortality, but rather with CV and/or other mortalities. There are several possible explanations behind these associations. First, 11% of individuals with high HDL-C carry rare genetic variants that not only have a strong effect on HDL-C levels, but may also have concomitant detrimental health effects possibly through dysfunctional HDL, including an altered ability to remove excess cholesterol from cells. Second, the association could be driven by confounding, e.g. extremely high HDL-C levels are found in people with very high alcohol consumption, which could be the actual cause of high mortality. Third, high HDL-C levels result from delayed catabolism. On the one hand, this may indicate disturbed delivery of cholesterol to the liver for excretion. On the other hand, like for LDL, the prolonged residence time will promote modifications of the molecular composition and components of HDL, ultimately resulting in HDL dysfunction. At high HDL-C levels, the particle size is larger than normal. Therefore, it is at least theoretically possible that these large, likely dysfunctional HDL particles become trapped in the arterial intima, leading to cholesterol accumulation and eventually to atherosclerosis and ASCVD. Finally, in observational analyses, it is never possible to rule out reverse causation, that is, poor health leading to early death could also lead to extremely high HDL-C levels.

### Why is non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol a better marker of the risk of vascular disease than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol? [^115LgjRT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2010). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been the focus of managing lipoprotein disorders for decades. It is now time to consider a change. Both apolipoprotein B (apoB) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been shown to be more accurate markers of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C. ApoB measures total atherogenic particle number, of which 90% are LDL particles. Therefore, LDL particle number determines plasma apoB in most patients. Non-HDL-C is widely assumed to be superior to LDL-C when triglyceride concentrations are elevated (even modestly) because it includes the cholesterol in very-low-density lipoprotein. However, evidence does not support this concept. Rather, non-HDL-C appears to be an indirect way of estimating apoB. We argue that we should integrate the information from non-HDL-C and apoB for better risk assessment and a better target of therapy.

### Novel targets that affect high-density lipoprotein metabolism: the next frontier [^114Y839B]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

As the significance of treating coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a high priority in reducing morbidity and mortality worldwide, newer treatment strategies continue to evolve. The efficacy of statin therapy in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reducing cardiovascular events is well established. Yet, addressing residual macrovascular risk becomes a compelling rationale for proposing that pharmacologic therapy targeted at low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is a rationale target for enhanced management of CAD. This article reviews current options for the therapeutic management of HDL cholesterol, including discussion of novel agents aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease risk in patients with low levels of HDL cholesterol.

Chart 2 — High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is not recommended as a target of therapy per se, metabolic syndrome is recognized as a multiplex risk factor for both ASCVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus with high potential to benefit from lifestyle therapies, and some conditions or medications can produce adverse changes in lipid levels and should be considered when evaluating patients with dyslipidemia.

### Familial occurrence of abnormalities of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^115zCCfy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2007). Low credibility.

In families, well-known monogenic high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) disorders characterized by extreme HDL-C levels on both ends of the continuum occur in multiple HDL pathways and can confer increased risk for atherosclerotic disease. Polygenic HDL-C variants have been more difficult to identify. In many family and twin studies in different populations, HDL-C levels have been shown to be highly heritable, explaining, on average, between 40% and 60% of between-individual variation. This review of abnormal HDL in families addresses known monogenic HDL disorders and HDL-C heritability in the general population, and presents novel data on the heritability of HDL-C in families with a history of premature coronary artery disease. We conclude that levels of HDL-C and HDL abnormalities are largely under genetic control and environmental and behavioral factors alone have only a modest impact. While rare, monogenic disorders offer considerable insight into the genetics of HDL regulation. Moderate to high heritability estimates across different family populations suggest that future genetic studies will be successful in identifying HDL genetic trait loci and that translational studies will ultimately lead to therapies that optimize the cardiovascular protective benefits of HDL.

### Mendelian disorders of high-density lipoprotein metabolism [^115aYq7s]. Circulation Research (2014). Low credibility.

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a highly heterogeneous and dynamic group of the smallest and densest lipoproteins present in the circulation. This review provides the current molecular insight into HDL metabolism led by articles describing mutations in genes that have a large affect on HDL cholesterol levels through their roles in HDL and triglyceride metabolism. Using this information from both human and animal studies, it is discussed how HDL is produced, remodeled in the circulation, affected by factors that control the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, how it helps maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and, finally, how it is catabolized. It can be concluded that HDL cholesterol as a trait is genetically heterogeneous, with as many as 40 genes involved. In most cases, only heterozygotes of gene variants are known, and HDL cholesterol as a trait is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Only 3 Mendelian disorders of HDL metabolism are currently known, which are inherited in an autosomal-recessive mode.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: evidence and guidance for management [^111x2dQ3]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims (i) to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and (ii) to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Current evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The Panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk of elevation of blood glucose, uric acid or liver enzymes with niacin, and myopathy, increased serum creatinine and cholelithiasis with fibrates. These recommendations will facilitate reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities at LDL-C goal.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116da9qC]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and metabolic syndrome — low HDL-C is a component of metabolic syndrome, a direct mechanistic relationship between low HDL and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is not fully understood, and genetic and clinical trial evidence do not support targeting HDL-C levels themselves; single nucleotide polymorphisms that increase plasma HDL-C concentration in isolation were not associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, agents that markedly raise HDL-C including niacin and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors have failed to demonstrate that they reduce all cause mortality, CHD mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke in statin-treated patients, and "at this time, HDL-C is not recommended as a target of therapy per se". Available evidence from meta-analyses suggests that metabolic syndrome is independently associated with ASCVD risk, "essentially doubling the risk", and HDL-C level is often raised as a consequence of efforts to reduce atherogenic cholesterol through lifestyle and drug therapies.

### Repositioning of the global epicentre of non-optimal cholesterol [^114gPUM4]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

High blood cholesterol is typically considered a feature of wealthy western countries 1,2. However, dietary and behavioural determinants of blood cholesterol are changing rapidly throughout the world 3 and countries are using lipid-lowering medications at varying rates. These changes can have distinct effects on the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, which have different effects on human health 4,5. However, the trends of HDL and non-HDL cholesterol levels over time have not been previously reported in a global analysis. Here we pooled 1,127 population-based studies that measured blood lipids in 102.6 million individuals aged 18 years and older to estimate trends from 1980 to 2018 in mean total, non-HDL and HDL cholesterol levels for 200 countries. Globally, there was little change in total or non-HDL cholesterol from 1980 to 2018. This was a net effect of increases in low- and middle-income countries, especially in east and southeast Asia, and decreases in high-income western countries, especially those in northwestern Europe, and in central and eastern Europe. As a result, countries with the highest level of non-HDL cholesterol-which is a marker of cardiovascular risk-changed from those in western Europe such as Belgium, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Malta in 1980 to those in Asia and the Pacific, such as Tokelau, Malaysia, The Philippines and Thailand. In 2017, high non-HDL cholesterol was responsible for an estimated 3.9 million (95% credible interval 3.7 million-4.2 million) worldwide deaths, half of which occurred in east, southeast and south Asia. The global repositioning of lipid-related risk, with non-optimal cholesterol shifting from a distinct feature of high-income countries in northwestern Europe, north America and Australasia to one that affects countries in east and southeast Asia and Oceania should motivate the use of population-based policies and personal interventions to improve nutrition and enhance access to treatment throughout the world.

### Approach to the patient with extremely low HDL-cholesterol [^111BMA3N]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with extremely low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) pose distinct challenges to clinical diagnosis and management. Confirmation of HDL-C levels below 20 mg/dl in the absence of severe hypertriglyceridemia should be followed by evaluation for secondary causes, such as androgen use, malignancy, and primary monogenic disorders, namely, apolipoprotein A-I mutations, Tangier disease, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency. Global cardiovascular risk assessment is a critical component of comprehensive evaluation, although the association between extremely low HDL-C levels and atherosclerosis remains unclear. Therapeutic interventions address reversible causes of low HDL-C, multiorgan abnormalities that may accompany primary disorders and cardiovascular risk modification when appropriate. Uncommon encounters with patients exhibiting extremely low HDL-C provide an opportunity to directly observe the role of HDL metabolism in atherosclerosis and beyond the vascular system.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^1145m427]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, HDL-C is routinely reported with the patient's lipid profile, although its main practical utility is within equations to calculate values for LDL-C and non-HDL-C and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. What is the appropriate approach when HDL-C on a routine lipid panel is flagged as being outside the "normal" range?

A low HDL-C is most commonly seen in patients with elevated TG levels. In this scenario, diagnosis and management would devolve to the algorithm for elevated TG (Fig. 4) and ruling out any secondary factors. Because genetic determinants of the joint elevated TG and depressed HDL-C phenotype are typically polygenic, there is no reason for genetic evaluation in these patients, unless a monogenic cause of severe HTG such as FCS is seriously being considered. Treatment would be centered on reducing levels of atherogenic lipoproteins, including apo B-containing TG-rich particles and remnants. Lifestyle measures such as improved diet and especially exercise appear to have clear benefits on HDL function, although, as mentioned, this cannot be assessed by any current clinical assays.

In the second scenario, HDL-C is low in isolation, without concomitant deviation in TG levels or indeed any other lipoproteins. This situation can arise from the same secondary factors that raise TG levels, so these should be ruled out. In cohort studies of > 900 individuals with isolated low HDL-C, we found that overwhelmingly the genetic basis is polygenic, meaning that the phenotype is usually determined by the accumulated contribution of many common SNP variants that each act incrementally to lower HDL-C. A smaller proportion of such patients instead has a single copy of a pathogenic variant in a gene for which 2 copies cause severe monogenic HDL-C deficiency syndromes, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. At present, there is no evidence that knowing the precise genetic basis of low HDL-C affects management. Thus, genetic testing is not recommended, unless the isolated HDL-C deficiency is so extreme that a monogenic condition such as Tangier disease, apo A-I deficiency, or LCAT deficiency is suspected. Rare monogenic HDL-C deficiency states may require specialized attention because of possible systemic involvement. Otherwise, management of a patient with isolated low HDL-C includes prudent lifestyle advice and pharmacotherapy that focuses on optimizing management of atherogenic apo B-containing lipoproteins, using statins as the first step.

Exercise and HDL-C — In adults, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) changes with exercise are variable, with a small "3 to 5% increase" on average and a range "from −5 to +25%" after training, and significant aerobic effects are estimated at "∼ 1000 to 1500 kcal/week (i.e., ∼ 7 to 14 miles/week of walking or jogging)". "6 to 9 weeks of resistance training (8 to 10 exercises, 3 times/week)" can "increase HDL-C 4 to 9% in men and women". Response is influenced by "baseline HDL-C, gender, training volume, and, to a lesser degree, training intensity", is greater "in those who have relatively low HDL-C and high TG levels", shows sex differences as "Average TG levels are higher and HDL-C levels lower in men compared to women", and has genetic determinants with polymorphisms "explaining up to 50% of the variation in HDL-C".

### Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and guidelines for cholesterol lowering in recent history [^112iei4m]. Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) released guidelines for treating cholesterol in 1988, 1994, and 2002. After a hiatus, the guidelines were released again in 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018.

Methods

In this article, I review these guidelines, factors that affected their release, how they evolved, and why recommended treatment targets are reasonable. Also, to aid reader understanding, I briefly discuss biochemical mechanisms and the pathophysiology of beta-lipoproteins, focusing on the importance on non-high-density cholesterol (non-HDLC) in assessing risk and as a target for treatment. The concepts discussed are important to laboratory clinicians because those workers inscribe target values on the reports and may consult with medical staff members.

Conclusions

The newest recommendations, released in 2018, are an extension of the 2017 guidelines that defined non-HDLC as equivalent to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC). For the reasons discussed herein, non-HDLC has advantages over LDLC. Laboratories reporting cholesterol results should include non-HDLC values and cutoffs in their reports.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increase and non-cardiovascular mortality: a meta-analysis [^113WfY4D]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Many observational prospective studies have confirmed the inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease. However, the potential benefit of the pharmacological increase in HDL cholesterol has not been clearly demonstrated. Moreover, in some interventions an increase in total mortality has been reported.

Objective

The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine the relationship between HDL cholesterol increase and non-cardiovascular mortality in randomised trials.

Data Sources

Authors searched Medline up to December 2008.

Study Selection

Four reviewers identified randomised trials in which, through different types of interventions, HDL cholesterol increase in the treatment group was > 4% compared to control group, both groups reported separately non-cardiovascular mortality and the duration of the study was, at least, one year.

Data Extraction

Data of HDL cholesterol concentrations and deaths were collected as they appeared in the original studies. If necessary, reviewers calculated data by using trial information.

Results

Meta-regression analysis included 44 articles corresponding to 107 773 participants. Analysis showed an association between HDL cholesterol increase and non-cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.023), however, the correlation disappeared when we excluded the ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerosis Events) trial from the analysis (p = 0.972).

Conclusions

Meta-regression analysis results suggest that increases in HDL cholesterol up to 40% are not associated with higher non-cardiovascular death. The increase in adverse events observed in some trials where HDL cholesterol was raised in large amounts could be related with the drug mechanisms more than the HDL cholesterol increase itself.

### Association between change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality: systematic review and meta-regression analysis [^115S8ad2]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Implications for clinical practice and future research

The lack of association between treatment induced change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths raises questions about the rationale for development of therapeutic agents that increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Raising high density lipoprotein cholesterol without considering effects on high density lipoprotein function seem to have little promise for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Future research should prospectively consider the results of assays to measure high density lipoprotein function and then provide definitive evidence of pharmacological effects on patient important outcomes in long term randomised trials.

Results from this study corroborate recommendations from current clinical guidelines (Adult Treatment Panel III, American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and American Diabetes Association) that emphasise targeting primarily low density lipoprotein cholesterol in the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent updates of the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines confirmed low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (< 40 mg/dl) as a major cardiovascular risk factor. Although the guidelines recommend that clinicians should consider combining a low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering drug with a fibrate or niacin in patients with low high density lipoprotein cholesterol, they refrained from making recommendations about specific targets for raising high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations.

### Rethinking good cholesterol: a clinicians' guide to understanding HDL [^112p7SZn]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Low HDL cholesterol dyslipidaemia affects about half of people with type 2 diabetes and represents a major independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The "good cholesterol" label was coined decades ago on the basis of a presumed causal role of HDL cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, this view has been challenged by the negative results of several studies of HDL cholesterol-raising drugs, creating a paradox for clinicians regarding the value of HDL cholesterol as a risk biomarker and therapeutic target, and seemingly contradicting decades of evidence substantiating an inverse relation between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. We seek to resolve this issue by revisiting the history of the HDL hypothesis, chronicling how this paradox is ultimately rooted in the progressive erroneous blurring of the distinction between HDL and HDL cholesterol. We describe the compositional complexity of HDL particles beyond their cholesterol cargo and focus on their role in lipid transport. We discuss the evidence regarding novel HDL functions, including effects on glucose metabolism, and speculate on the implications for type 2 diabetes. HDL cholesterol is an imperfect biomarker of a highly complex and multifunctional lipid transport system, and we should now consider how new HDL markers more causally linked to cardiovascular complications could be adapted for clinical use. In the absence of a superior alternative, HDL cholesterol generally has value as a component of primary cardiovascular disease risk prediction models, including in people with type 2 diabetes. However, to avoid prognostic overgeneralisations, it is high time that the good cholesterol label is dropped.

### Managing the risk of atherosclerosis: the role of high-density lipoprotein [^115nHQbC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

The association of low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events implies a central involvement of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the retardation of the atherosclerotic process and the corresponding slowing of progression of coronary artery disease. HDL-C appears to exert this protective effect through multiple mechanisms. Through its association with antioxidant enzymes, such as paraoxonase and the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, it may protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from oxidation and decrease the expression of adhesion molecules, both of which contribute importantly to the initiation of atherosclerotic plaques. HDL may also further inhibit plaque expansion by improving the stability of existing plaques, and it may reduce the susceptibility of plaques to rupture by mediating reverse cholesterol transport. This article examines recent experimental approaches aimed at elucidating these antiatherogenic, HDL-mediated mechanisms.

### Interrelationships among HDL metabolism, aging, and atherosclerosis [^111FZhgU]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2009). Low credibility.

HDL plasma concentrations decline with age in prospective studies. Decline in HDL concentration and function may occur secondary because of hormonal changes, inflammatory processes, and diabetes mellitus. Beyond these effects specific aging processes may be involved. Replicative aging, the telomere-driven loss of divisional capacity, is a species-specific aging mechanism that may decrease HDL concentration and function. Cross-sectionally, by contrast, HDL levels do not change much or even slightly increase with age, suggesting that only people with still high HDL concentrations survive. A selection bias by HDL lowering genetic variation may explain why HDL deficiency is extremely rare among centenarians. Vice versa, HDL may modulate the aging process, not only by its well-known antiatherogenic effects, eg, its ability to remove cellular lipids and by antiatherogenic pleiotropic effects on cell survival, but possibly also by direct interfering with aging signaling or survival factor KLOTHO. Most of the current findings, however, are based on cell culture and selected animal experiments and await further confirmation by appropriate in vivo models.

### HDL and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: genetic insights into complex biology [^116Q23ZM]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Plasma levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) predict the risk of cardiovascular disease at the epidemiological level, but a direct causal role for HDL in cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Studies in animal models and humans with rare monogenic disorders link only particular HDL-associated mechanisms with causality, including those mechanisms related to particle functionality rather than cholesterol content. Mendelian randomization studies indicate that most genetic variants that affect a range of pathways that increase plasma HDL-C levels are not usually associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, with some exceptions, such as cholesteryl ester transfer protein variants. Furthermore, only a fraction of HDL-C variation has been explained by known loci from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting the existence of additional pathways and targets. Systems genetics can enhance our understanding of the spectrum of HDL pathways, particularly those pathways that involve new and non-obvious GWAS loci. Bioinformatic approaches can also define new molecular interactions inferred from both large-scale genotypic data and RNA sequencing data to reveal biologically meaningful gene modules and networks governing HDL metabolism with direct relevance to disease end points. Targeting these newly recognized causal networks might inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### HDL cholesterol, very low levels of LDL cholesterol, and cardiovascular events [^113oEM52]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are a strong inverse predictor of cardiovascular events. However, it is not clear whether this association is maintained at very low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

Methods

A post hoc analysis of the recently completed Treating to New Targets (TNT) study assessed the predictive value of HDL cholesterol levels in 9770 patients. The primary outcome measure was the time to a first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke. The predictive relationship between HDL cholesterol levels at the third month of treatment with statins and the time to the first major cardiovascular event was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses and was also assessed for specific LDL cholesterol strata, including subjects with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter).

Results

The HDL cholesterol level in patients receiving statins was predictive of major cardiovascular events across the TNT study cohort, both when HDL cholesterol was considered as a continuous variable and when subjects were stratified according to quintiles of HDL cholesterol level. When the analysis was stratified according to LDL cholesterol level in patients receiving statins, the relationship between HDL cholesterol level and major cardiovascular events was of borderline significance (P = 0.05). Even among study subjects with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter, those in the highest quintile of HDL cholesterol level were at less risk for major cardiovascular events than those in the lowest quintile (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis, HDL cholesterol levels were predictive of major cardiovascular events in patients treated with statins. This relationship was also observed among patients with LDL cholesterol levels below 70 mg per deciliter. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00327691 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with risk of cardiovascular disease among initially high-density lipoprotein-high participants [^117V3Hp2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this population-based longitudinal cohort study of participants with high HDL-C levels, the greatest HDL-C increase group revealed a higher risk of CVD by 1.15-fold. Notably, this association persisted even in those whose LDL-C levels were decreased. Participants showed a nearly 1.3-fold increased risk of incident CHD despite having decreased LDL-C levels. To enhance preventive management against CVD, redefining the effects of HDL-C level on CVD risk may be indispensable.

### Hypertriglyceridemia: a too long unfairly neglected major cardiovascular risk factor [^111PUZXg]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

In accordance with the HDL function hypothesis, it is not HDL cholesterol itself that has a causal relation to atheroprotection, but rather HDL function, which cannot be reliably estimated through the simple measurement of HDL-C.

Interesting lessons could be derived from the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study with bezafibrate and basically low HDL in all patients: despite of a significant HDL raising, the overall benefits were non-significant. However, the benefit of bezafibrate in the subgroup of patients with high TG levels was extremely impressive.

Additional challenges to the HDL hypothesis are driven by data derived from human genetic studies and randomized controlled trials. Taken together, genetic studies strongly support the theory that high concentrations of TG-rich lipoproteins or remnant cholesterol are causal risk factors for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, and that low HDL cholesterol is probably an innocent bystander. Low HDL cholesterol might merely be a long-term marker of raised TG and remnant cholesterol. Alternatively, HDL cholesterol might be a marker of cardiovascular health but is non-causal in the atherogenesis.

Management of hypertriglyceridemia

Intensive lifestyle therapy, including dietary counseling to achieve appropriate diet composition, physical activity, and a program to achieve weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals are the main initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and described elsewhere.

Elevated levels of TG (and TG -rich lipoproteins) are increasingly being recognized as treatment targets to lower CV risk in certain patient subgroups, including individuals receiving statins – a cornerstone of the modern lipids-modifying therapy. The choice of statin should depend on the needs of the individual patient. In this context, the potential benefits of pitavastatin versus other statins in the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes should be emphasized. Moreover, although some statins are associated with increased haemoglobin A1C levels in patients receiving intensive but not moderate therapy, pitavastatin has demonstrated neutral or even favourable effects on glucose control in patients with and without T2DM or MS. However, intensive statin therapy with the most potent statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and even pitavastatin) does not completely eliminate the residual cardiovascular risk associated with high TG.

### Lipid parameters for measuring risk of cardiovascular disease [^111dvhy5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Besides measuring blood pressure and glucose levels, assessing the lipid spectrum is the method most commonly used to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), as well as those who are likely to benefit most from lipid-lowering therapy. Although lowering LDL-cholesterol levels is the primary target of therapy in most clinical guidelines, accumulating evidence indicates that other lipoprotein-lipid measurements could provide a predictive value over and above that of LDL-cholesterol levels. For example, individuals treated with statins who achieve low LDL-cholesterol levels, but have high concentrations of either non-HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein (apo) B, remain at increased cardiovascular risk. Similarly, individuals with low levels of either HDL cholesterol or apo A-I are also likely to experience cardiovascular events, despite having normal LDL-cholesterol levels. The residual cardiovascular risk, beyond that characterized by LDL-cholesterol levels alone, is exacerbated by physical inactivity and abdominal obesity, which are both increasingly prevalent risk factors for CVD. In this Review, we discuss the measurement of various lipoprotein-lipid parameters for the prediction of CVD risk, and their importance in identifying those patients who are likely to benefit from lipid-lowering therapy. The impact of recent studies on clinical guidelines is also considered.

### Association between serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and progression of chronic kidney disease: results from the KNOW-CKD [^114juDxS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Serum high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) has traditionally been considered to be protective against cardiovascular disease in the general population. HDL exerts an antiatherogenic effect through reverse cholesterol transport, a multiorgan process that removes excess cholesterol from lipid‐laden macrophages and peripheral tissue. 1 In addition, normal HDL also confers protection against atherosclerosis through different mechanisms, including anti‐inflammatory, antioxidative, and antithrombotic effects. The exact mechanisms of these effects are unknown, but previous studies have suggested a possible role of minor HDL components, such as apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein A‐IV, and apolipoprotein J. 2, 3, 4 Not surprisingly, several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a clear inverse association between serum HDL cholesterol (HDL‐C) and the risk of cardiovascular disease. 5, 6, 7 However, recent studies questioned the relevance of HDL‐C as a surrogate marker for HDL‐related cardiovascular risk. Randomized clinical trials that aimed at increasing HDL‐C levels showed no clinical benefit in reducing cardiovascular risk. 8, 9, 10 In addition, mendelian randomization analyses failed to show a causal association between genetically elevated HDL‐C levels and risk for myocardial infarction. 11 Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence showing that the composition of HDL determines its functional properties, rather than the levels of circulating HDL‐C. 12 Taken together, these findings raise a concern about the previous notion that high serum HDL‐C levels confer protection against adverse outcomes.

### HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and incident cardiovascular events [^111wCqHW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration plays a causal role in atherosclerosis. A more important factor may be HDL cholesterol efflux capacity, the ability of HDL to accept cholesterol from macrophages, which is a key step in reverse cholesterol transport. We investigated the epidemiology of cholesterol efflux capacity and its association with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes in a large, multiethnic population cohort.

Methods

We measured HDL cholesterol level, HDL particle concentration, and cholesterol efflux capacity at baseline in 2924 adults free from cardiovascular disease who were participants in the Dallas Heart Study, a probability-based population sample. The primary end point was atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as a first nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization or death from cardiovascular causes. The median follow-up period was 9.4 years.

Results

In contrast to HDL cholesterol level, which was associated with multiple traditional risk factors and metabolic variables, cholesterol efflux capacity had minimal association with these factors. Baseline HDL cholesterol level was not associated with cardiovascular events in an adjusted analysis (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.99). In a fully adjusted model that included traditional risk factors, HDL cholesterol level, and HDL particle concentration, there was a 67% reduction in cardiovascular risk in the highest quartile of cholesterol efflux capacity versus the lowest quartile (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.55). Adding cholesterol efflux capacity to traditional risk factors was associated with improvement in discrimination and reclassification indexes.

Conclusions

Cholesterol efflux capacity, a new biomarker that characterizes a key step in reverse cholesterol transport, was inversely associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events in a population-based cohort. (Funded by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation and others.).

Graphical Abstract
The great complexity of HDL. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles carry a large number of proteins and lipids, which contribute to define their compositional and functional complexity. HDLs exert multiple protective activities, essentially by three major mechanisms. HDLs, however, can lose their protective functions and even gain adverse functions in chronic diseases or during infections. U-shaped relationships between HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and several conditions have been reported, being both low and extremely high HDL-C levels associated with an increased risk of several pathologies and mortality.

### An evidence-based analysis of the National Lipid Association recommendations concerning non-HDL-C and apoB [^114qMxxZ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The National Lipid Association (NLA) selected non-HDL-C as its prime index of the cardiovascular risk associated with the apoB lipoproteins. ApoB was recommended only as an optional secondary target after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) targets were achieved.

Objective

The aims of this analysis were to determine whether (1) all relevant uses of apoB were considered by the NLA; (2) all the relevant evidence was considered by the NLA panel; and (3) all the evidence that was considered was interpreted correctly.

Results

(1) The utility of apoB in the diagnosis of the atherogenic dyslipoproteinemias was not considered. (2) All the relevant observational studies were not identified, and some that were cited were incorrectly interpreted. In particular, an equal hazard ratio for two markers in a group does not mean they will predict risk equally in individuals within the group in whom they are discordant. This matters because discordance analysis consistently demonstrates apoB and LDL particle number are more accurate measures of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C/non-HDL-C. (3) The target levels of apoB selected by the NLA are too high relative to the levels selected for LDL-C and non-HDL-C.

Conclusions

The review of the evidence by the NLA was incomplete. More complete examination of the evidence indicates that apoB is a more accurate marker of cardiovascular risk than non-HDL-C and that the practice of lipidology would be improved by inclusion of apoB along with lipoprotein lipids in routine clinical care.

### Coronary heart disease risks associated with high levels of HDL cholesterol [^1121jZp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and coronary heart disease (CHD) events is not well described in individuals with very high levels of HDL-C (> 80 mg/dL).

Methods and Results

Using pooled data from 6 community-based cohorts we examined CHD and total mortality risks across a broad range of HDL-C, including values in excess of 80 mg/dL. We used Cox proportional hazards models with penalized splines to assess multivariable, adjusted, sex-stratified associations of HDL-C with the hazard for CHD events and total mortality, using HDL-C 45 mg/dL and 55 mg/dL as the referent in men and women, respectively. Analyses included 11 515 men and 12 925 women yielding 307 245 person-years of follow-up. In men, the association between HDL-C and CHD events was inverse and linear across most HDL-C values; however at HDL-C values > 90 mg/dL there was a plateau effect in the pattern of association. In women, the association between HDL-C and CHD events was inverse and linear across lower values of HDL-C, however at HDL-C values > 75 mg/dL there were no further reductions in the hazard ratio point estimates for CHD. In unadjusted models there were increased total mortality risks in men with very high HDL-C, however mortality risks observed in participants with very high HDL-C were attenuated after adjustment for traditional risk factors.

Conclusions

We did not observe further reductions in CHD risk with HDL-C values higher than 90 mg/dL in men and 75 mg/dL in women.

### Coronary heart disease risks associated with high levels of HDL cholesterol [^111fkXpk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis from 6 community‐based cohorts we did not observe a monotonic inverse linear association between HDL‐C and CHD risk at very high levels of HDL‐C. Rather, we observed evidence of a plateau effect for CHD risk at high levels of HDL‐C in men and women.

Although CHD event rates were generally lower in cohort participants with very high HDL‐C, risk for CHD events persisted in this group as many participants with very high HDL‐C still experienced MI or CHD death during follow‐up. However, the significant associations observed between age, blood pressure, and non‐HDL‐C and CHD risk suggest that at‐risk individuals with very high HDL‐C are at least partially identifiable through assessment of traditional risk factors. We believe this observation suggests heterogeneity in the CHD risk of individuals with very high HDL‐C. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to continue to consider the entire spectrum of CHD risk factors, and not assume that a very high HDL‐C is automatically or fully protective against CHD.

A recent nested case‐control analysis on participant samples from the Nurses' Health and Health Professionals Follow‐Up Studies suggests a structural variation in HDL particles that may mediate the atheroprotective properties of HDL. Specifically, Jensen et al found that people with HDL particles that contained Apolipoprotein CIII did not have the expected inverse association between HDL‐C and CHD risk. This finding raises the possibility that more prevalent dysfunctional HDL particle variants in people with very high HDL‐C could explain the plateau relationship between HDL and CHD risk observed in this study.

Interestingly, the triglyceride concentrations in Tables 1 and 2 are noticeably lower in individuals with very high HDL‐C. Higher triglyceride concentrations in individuals with very high HDL‐C suggest the possibility of decreased lipid exchange from HDL to VLDL particles that could be mediated by abnormalities in physiologic pathways for lipid exchange between lipoprotein particles, eg, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity.

### Targeting residual cardiovascular risk: raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^1139m37E]. Heart (2008). Low credibility.

The last 20 years have witnessed dramatic reductions in cardiovascular risk using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ("statins") to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Using this approach one can achieve a reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events of 21% for every 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl) decrease in LDL-C. However, despite intensive therapy with high dose "statins" to lower LDL-C levels below 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl), the risk of a major cardiovascular event in patients with established coronary artery disease remains significant at a level approaching an annual risk of 9%, paving the way for new strategies for reducing the residual cardiovascular risk in this patient group. Early epidemiological studies have identified low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (< 1.0 mmol/l or 40 mg/dl), a common feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, to be an independent determinant of increased cardiovascular risk. The beneficial effects of HDL-C on the cardiovascular system have been attributed to its ability to remove cellular cholesterol, as well as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antithrombotic properties, which act in concert to improve endothelial function and inhibit atherosclerosis, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk. As such, raising HDL-C in patients with aggressively lowered LDL-C provides an additional strategy for addressing the residual cardiovascular risk present in these patients groups. Studies suggest that for every 0.03 mmol/l (1.0 mg/dl) increase in HDL-C, cardiovascular risk is reduced by 2–3%. Raising HDL-C can be achieved by both lifestyle changes and pharmacological means, the former of which include smoking cessation, aerobic exercise, weight loss and dietary manipulation. Therapeutic strategies have included niacin, fibrates, thiazolidinediones and bile acid sequestrants. Newly developed pharmacological agents include apolipoprotein A-I mimetics and the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, JTT-705 and torcetrapib, the latter of which has been recently withdrawn from clinical testing because of serious adverse effects. Emerging experimental studies investigating the complex pathways of HDL metabolism have identified several new targets for raising HDL-C with new pharmaceutical agents currently in development. For the time being, the long-acting formulations of nicotinic acid remain the most effective and best tolerated pharmacological strategy for raising HDL-C in patients already on statin therapy to control LDL-C. Therefore, raising HDL-C represents an important strategy for reducing residual cardiovascular risk in patients already optimally treated with statins, and should lead to further improvements in clinical outcomes in these patient groups.

### Causal inference for genetically determined levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of infectious disease [^116F3Lpa]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observationally associated with reduced risk of infectious disease hospitalizations.
Alternatively, elevated levels of triglycerides were observationally associated with increased risk of infectious disease hospitalizations.
For genetically determined lipid levels, only high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly associated with reduced risk of hospitalizations for infectious disease, lower odds of outpatient antibiotic usage, and reduced risk of mortality from sepsis.
Mendelian randomization analysis suggested that the observational relationship between higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduced risk of hospitalization for infectious disease could be causal in nature.

Despite the epidemiological evidence for a strong association between low levels of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (HDL-C) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, genetic studies and clinical trials have failed to demonstrate that this relationship is causal. However, there is interest in the role of HDL particles as an important component of the innate immune system and protecting against infection. –

See accompanying editorial on page

HDL is able to sequester pathogen-associated lipids, such as lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid, and mitigate host inflammation during sepsis. – These findings are consistent with preclinical studies that show that HDL-based interventions reduce inflammation and improve survival in rodent models of experimental sepsis. Furthermore, low levels of HDL-C and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased risk of infectious disease, respectively, in sepsis cohorts and large epidemiological studies.– However, these epidemiological associations are subject to confounding and reverse causation, and it remains unclear whether they represent causal relationships. Indeed, recent studies have suggested that the associations between low levels of LDL-C and sepsis mortality are likely due to confounding rather than representing a causal relationship. It is unknown whether the same is true for HDL-C.

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of common variants associated with HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels on infectious disease risk among the general population. Using genetic variants as risk factors can circumvent many issues of confounding and reverse causation and has the potential to provide causal inference regarding the effect of genetically determined levels of HDL-C on susceptibility to infectious disease. We hypothesized that individuals with elevated levels of genetically determined HDL-C, but not LDL-C or triglycerides, would have reduced risk of hospitalization for infectious disease hospitalizations and improved sepsis survival.

### Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol: stars or second leads in diabetes? [^111fXT7G]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The association between reduced HDL cholesterol levels and increased risk of heart disease is, on the other hand, well established, independently of TG levels and other risk factors. In fact, the "low HDL cholesterol" or "hypoalpha" syndrome is the most frequent lipoprotein abnormality in coronary patients. Intravascular ultrasound studies demonstrate that patients with low HDL cholesterol and high TG levels have more extensive coronary atheromas than those with an isolated elevation of LDL cholesterol. Patients with reduced HDL cholesterol levels show intima-media thickness results similar to those with familial hypercholesterolemia, while a high level of HDL cholesterol reduced plaque growth in subjects with preexisting carotid atherosclerosis.

The HDL particles induce the removal of cholesterol from cells, including those in atherosclerotic plaques, and carry them to the liver, but the mechanisms by which HDL confer protection from atherosclerosis include more than just reverse cholesterol transport. HDL particles seem to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, inhibiting the oxidation of LDL cholesterol and the expression of cellular adhesion molecules and monocyte recruitment. The HDL may also reduce the risk of thrombosis by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation.

Recent studies, however, demonstrated that it may be the level of apoA-I, rather than the level of HDL cholesterol, that is important in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. In fact, high plasma HDL cholesterol and large HDL particles may be associated with increased CAD risk when levels of apoA-I and apoB remain constant. In contrast, apoA-I remains negatively associated with CAD risk, even in high concentrations.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116U8Lqy]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Non–HDL–C and LDL–C — The NLA Expert Panel's consensus view is that non–HDL–C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a better primary target for modification than LDL–C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and non–HDL–C is listed first to emphasize its primary importance. LDL–C comprises ~75% of the cholesterol in circulation carried by lipoprotein particles other than HDL. Epidemiologic studies have shown that non–HDL–C is a stronger predictor of ASCVD morbidity and mortality than LDL–C. Using non–HDL–C as a target for intervention also simplifies the management of patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), and an elevated triglyceride concentration confounds the relationship between LDL–C and ASCVD risk, but this appears to be less of an issue with non–HDL–C.

### Genetically elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol through the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene does not associate with risk of Alzheimer's disease [^112p9fMb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurological disease affecting more than 5 million individuals living in the United States. A potential connection between cholesterol levels and risk of AD and dementia has been suggested. This is important as cholesterol levels in blood can be modified. However, there is conflicting epidemiological evidence whether high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, which is considered the beneficial cholesterol, is a risk factor for AD and dementia. In a prospective study of approximately 7000 French individuals, there was no association of HDL-C with incident all-cause dementia or AD. On the other hand, in the same French cohort, an association was observed in men between incident all-cause dementia, but not AD, and in a study of 75,000 individuals in Denmark, HDL-C was associated with both all-cause dementia and AD. When evidence was combined from multiple published studies, late-life HDL-C was not associated with all-cause dementia or AD.

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is involved in the exchange of cholesteryl esters and phospholipids between HDLs and other lipoproteins. Increased plasma HDL-C and plasma CETP is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CETP locus have been strongly linked to altered plasma lipid levels. Furthermore, protein-truncating variants (i.e. nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants) in CETP are associated with higher HDL-C, lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lower triglycerides, and lower risk of coronary heart disease. The Global Lipids Genetic Consortium has reported 10 variants on the exome array that are significantly and distinctly associated with HDL-C. These SNPs in CETP with large effects on HDL-C can be used as tools to elucidate whether there is a causal role of HDL-C on AD. In this study, we use instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments (i.e. Mendelian Randomization) to predict whether high HDL-C through CETP is associated with AD by answering the questions: (1) Do CETP SNPs associate with AD risk?; and (2) Does genetically predicted high HDL-C through CETP associate with risk of AD?

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^114EB8LN]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment markers for ASCVD — Primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD require an accurate estimation of risk of both future and recurrent cardiovascular events, and the LDL-C level is the focus of this article and is a highly relevant biomarker (indicator) of ASCVD risk, with high LDL-C generally indicative of high ASCVD risk and very low LDL-C levels generally indicative of low ASCVD risk (in the absence of other major risk factors). In individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) offer superior risk assessment by accounting for all atherogenic particles, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) and other major guidelines recommend consideration of apo B or non–HDL-C as secondary targets, particularly in high-risk patients or when triglyceride levels are elevated; the level of ASCVD risk should inform intensity of treatment to lower LDL-C.

### Repeated measures of extremely high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and subsequent all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events: a longitudinal study [^1112Qi8v]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Extremely high level high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol had been cautioned as risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. However, both the physician and the patient may underestimate the risk due to the emphasis on "good cholesterol", resulting in passive treatment or adoption of a less healthy lifestyle. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate the association with longitudinal data to account for fluctuations in HDL cholesterol and covariates.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study at a large teaching hospital in Tokyo, Japan, from 2005 to 2016. We included all adults who participated in health check-ups. Outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. HDL cholesterol was repeatedly measured at each visit and categorized into five groups. The time-varying Cox model was applied to longitudinal analyses.

Results

We included a total of 83,100 participants; the mean age was 45.5 (standard deviation:12.4) years; 41,013 (49.4%) were male, and 4475 participants belonged to the extremely high level HDL cholesterol group (> 90 mg/dl). During a median follow-up of 1746 (interquartile range:740–3112.5) days, 382 (0.5%) participants died, and 2023 (2.4%) experienced cardiovascular events. Although the extremely high level HDL cholesterol group had significantly lower hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality (HR:0.49, 95%confidence interval(CI):0.26–0.90) and cardiovascular events (HR:0.71, 95%CI:0.54–0.94) compared to the low group (< 40 mg/dl), HRs were higher than in the very high level HDL cholesterol group.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that extremely high level HDL cholesterol has significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events compared to low level, but higher risks compared to very high level, as previously reported.

### Dietary fat and cardiovascular disease risk: quantity or quality? [^117FbPen]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

When considering dietary fat quantity, there are two main factors to consider, impact on body weight and plasma lipoprotein profiles. Data supporting a major role of dietary fat quantity in determining body weight are weak and may be confounded by differences in energy density, dietary fiber, and dietary protein. With respect to plasma lipoprotein profiles, relatively consistent evidence indicates that under isoweight conditions, decreasing the total fat content of the diet causes an increase in triglyceride and decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. When considering dietary fat quality, current evidence suggests that saturated fatty acids tend to increase low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, whereas monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to decrease LDL cholesterol levels. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3), are associated with decreased triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemic patients and decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). Dietary trans-fatty acids are associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels. Hence, a diet low in saturated and trans-fatty acids, with adequate amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, would be recommended to reduce the risk of developing CHD. Additionally, the current data suggest it is necessary to go beyond dietary fat, regardless of whether the emphasis is on quantity or quality, and consider lifestyle. This would include encouraging abstinence from smoking, habitual physical activity, avoidance of weight gain with age, and responsible limited alcohol intake (one drink for females and two drinks for males per day).

### Pharmacological inhibition of CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) increases HDL (high-density lipoprotein) that contains apoC3 and other HDL subspecies associated with higher risk of coronary heart disease [^116YXgWV]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

The concentration of HDL-C (cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins) in the blood, widely accepted as an inverse risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), is routinely measured in primary care screening and was the target of therapies to reduce risk. However, it is not the cholesterol itself that reduces risk of CVD. Rather, the HDLs carrying that cholesterol are the actors that facilitate efflux of cholesterol from tissues for excretion via the liver, mediate inflammation and oxidation, and participate in protective hemostatic and apoptotic processes. Thus, while epidemiological evidence supports HDL-C as a biomarker for CVD risk, the measure is inherently imperfect, merely providing a snapshot of the amount of the cholesterol within a dynamic system of HDL subject to perturbation. For example, reduced ability of HDLs to deliver cholesterol to the liver via SR-BI (scavenger receptor BI) results in elevated levels of HDL-C, but rather than a decrease in risk of coronary heart disease, there is an increase. With reduced clearance through the liver, plasma HDL-C rises as HDLs continue to efflux cholesterol from tissues. In this case, elevated HDL-C is a marker of dysfunction. Conversely, enhanced efficiency of the same mechanism results in low levels of plasma HDL-C due to increased flux of cholesterol out of the body. In this case, a low level of HDL-C is a marker of enhanced function. Furthermore, neither of these perturbations in HDL-C concentration may have any effect on the other protective functions of HDL beyond reverse cholesterol transport. Thus, HDL-C is not a reliable marker of protection against CVD imparted by HDLs. Recent epidemiological studies have included individuals with very high levels of HDL-C and have found that the inverse linear relationship between HDL-C and CVD risk is lost at elevated levels.

### Divergent approaches to the treatment of dyslipidemia with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^114dKifj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2000). Low credibility.

Further therapy should be considered for patients who have reached target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels but have low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) since rates of coronary artery disease continue to be high for a sizable proportion of this population. Lifestyle approaches include dietary changes, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, concomitant drug reassessment, and specific coexistent conditions. Aggressive statin therapy still leaves a high residual rate of cardiac events. Other drug approaches include estrogen, fibrate, niacin therapy, and combinations of these agents. Recent results from an ongoing trial of combination extended-release prescription niacin plus lovastatin are very promising.

### The genetics of high-density lipoprotein metabolism: clinical relevance for therapeutic approaches [^117YFbxd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

The risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) is inversely correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol plasma levels. These plasma HDL cholesterol levels are influenced by the activity of a number of enzymes and receptors, and therefore, variations in the genes encoding for these proteins may consequently result in an altered CAD risk. Identification of such pivotal players in HDL cholesterol metabolism that are also strongly associated with CAD risk is crucial for the materialization of novel therapeutic modalities. A large amount of knowledge has been obtained by studies involving families with extreme HDL phenotypes specific to molecular defects. In fact, thus far, monogenetic defects have been described in the genes coding for apolipoprotein A-I, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1, cholesterol ester transfer protein, the lack of endothelial lipase (LIPG), phospholipid transfer protein, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. Despite the fact that the total number of carriers of such mutations is rather small, much can be gained by extensively studying the metabolic and vascular consequences of these mutations. Surrogate markers for atherosclerosis have proved to be useful to overcome this sample size limitation and have been widely exploited to study families with decreased or increased HDL cholesterol levels in order to correlate HDL cholesterol phenotypes to atherosclerotic burden in cases and controls. Apart from such extreme phenotype approaches, novel population-based genome-wide association studies have been used to decipher the link between genetic loci and HDL cholesterol levels, and the identification of novel HDL cholesterol-related genes is eagerly awaited. These might be instrumental in the ongoing fight against atherosclerosis.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^113iixsU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Very high risk — population, goals, and therapy — includes patients with clinical evidence of ASCVD and those with diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 and ≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage, who have aggressive atherogenic cholesterol goals of non–HDL-C < 100 mg/dL and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL; for those at very high risk, pharmacotherapy is recommended when atherogenic cholesterol levels are above goal, and pharmacotherapy with a moderate- or high-intensity statin is considered a therapeutic option even at lower pretreatment levels, with use of a moderate- or high-intensity statin stated as something that should be considered in patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels; end-stage (stage 5) chronic kidney disease is associated with very high risk for ASCVD events, randomized controlled trials of lipid-altering therapies have not consistently shown benefits in this group, and goals for atherogenic cholesterol levels in stage 5 CKD have not been defined and are instead considered a matter of clinical judgment.

### Common lipid-altering gene variants are associated with therapeutic intervention thresholds of lipid levels in older people [^115V33Gy]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Raised total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are established risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), and interventions to lower these, most commonly statin treatment, are part of standard medical practice. However, there is increasing evidence that low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease – and stroke. In addition, there is some evidence that raised triglyceride levels, independently increase cardiovascular and diabetes risk.

The National Institutes of Health Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adultsrecommended that lifestyle and treatment interventions should be considered in individuals with LDL levels ≥ 130 mg/dL who have two or more additional risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, age, family history of CAD) and ≥ 160 mg/dL for individuals with less than two additional risk factors. High-density lipoprotein levels < 40 mg/dL were considered an additional risk factor for CAD, whereas levels > 60 mg/dL are protective. Women have a higher recommended HDL threshold than men in the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome (≥ 50 mg/dL compared with ≥ 40 mg/dL, respectively), due to the influence of oestrogen on HDL levels. Treatment of triglyceride levels should be initiated when > 150 mg/dL, first using lifestyle intervention, but if levels exceed 200 mg/dL, drug treatment should also be considered.

Over the last 18 months, genome-wide association scans (GWAS) have robustly identified or confirmed 21 independent variants affecting LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels. Most of these variants are associated with small individual changes in their respective lipid levels and therefore studies have also assessed the impact of combining information from many variants. There is no evidence for interaction between individual variants, and a simple approach of counting risk alleles has been adopted. For example, Kathiresanrecently showed that an allele count combining nine variants for LDL and HDL levels was associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in a sample with a mean age of 57 years.

In our study, we aimed to assess the combined effect of the variants identified/confirmed by GWAS to be associated with HDL, LDL, and triglyceride levels in a representative older population. We examined associations with recommended 'need for intervention' levels, and history of MI in the population-based InCHIANTI Study of Aging. As secondary outcomes, we also measured associations with stroke and peripheral arterial disease, hypothesizing that lipid-altering SNPs may be also associated with these vascular outcomes.

### Lipoprotein assessment in the twenty-first century [^114dv2iv]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on decades of both basic science and epidemiologic research, there is overwhelming evidence for the causal relationship between high levels of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. Risk evaluation and monitoring the response to lipid-lowering therapies are heavily dependent on the accurate assessment of plasma lipoproteins in the clinical laboratory. This article provides an update of lipoprotein metabolism as it relates to atherosclerosis and how diagnostic measures of lipids and lipoproteins can serve as markers of cardiovascular risk, with a focus on recent advances in cardiovascular risk marker testing.

### HDL cholesterol protects against cardiovascular disease in both genders, at all ages and at all levels of risk [^113xuWWC]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to clarify some previous inconsistencies regarding the role of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as a CVD protective factor.

Methods

The SCORE dataset contained data on HDL-C for 104,961 individuals (45% women) without pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD). These were from 7 pooled European prospective studies. The effect of HDL-C, both in quintiles and as a continuous variable, on risk of CVD and CHD mortality was examined, using Cox proportional hazards model, adjusted for age, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes and body mass index and stratified by gender, age group, country and category of SCORE CVD risk.

Results

A strong, graded, independent, inverse relationship between HDL-C and both CVD and CHD mortality was demonstrated. Adjusted hazard ratios per 0.5mmol/l increase in HDL-C were 0.60 (0.51, 0.69) and 0.76 (0.70, 0.83) in women and men, respectively for the CVD mortality endpoint. The corresponding hazard ratios were 0.53 (0.42, 0.68) and 0.79 (0.64, 0.98) in elderly women and men, respectively. The relationship was significant in all SCORE CVD risk strata and age groups.

Conclusions

This multivariable analysis, the largest of its kind to date, has confirmed the inverse, independent, strong and graded relationship between HDL-C and both CVD and CHD mortality. We have clarified previous suggestions that the relationship is stronger in women and that it applies in all age groups. This is the first prospective study to demonstrate the independent relationship specifically in healthy elderly women and to show that the relationship holds at all levels of total CVD risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116TSrVY]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA Part 1 recommendations — ASCVD risk categories define atherogenic cholesterol goals and thresholds to consider drug therapy as follows: Low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors; consider other risk indicators) targets Non–HDL-C < 130 and LDL-C < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 190 or LDL-C ≥ 160. Moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors; consider quantitative risk scoring and other risk indicators) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 160 or LDL-C ≥ 130. High risk (≥ 3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL; or a quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold) keeps goals < 130 and < 100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 130 or LDL-C ≥ 100. Very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥ 2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage) sets goals Non–HDL-C < 100 and LDL-C < 70, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥ 100 or LDL-C ≥ 70. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### Evidence of a polygenic origin of extreme high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels [^116JAD2x]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

There are several known monogenic causes of high and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, but traditional sequencing studies have had limited success in identifying mutations in the majority of individuals with extreme HDL-C levels. The aim of this study was to assess the power of a targeted high-throughput sequencing strategy to elucidate the genetic basis of extreme HDL-C phenotypes.

Approach and Results

We sequenced 195 genes with either established or implicated roles in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism plus 78 lipid-unrelated genes in patients with HDL-C < 1st (n = 40) or > 99th (n = 40) percentile values, and the results were compared with those of 498 individuals representative of the Dutch general population and 95 subjects with normal HDL-C (between 40th and 60th percentile values). The extreme HDL cohort carried more rare nonsynonymous variants in the lipid geneset than both the general population (odds ratio, 1.39; P = 0.019) and normal HDL-C (odds ratio, 1.43; P = 0.040) cohorts. The prevalence of such variants in the lipid-related and lipid-unrelated genesets was similar in the control groups, indicative of equal mutation rates. In the extreme HDL cohort, however, there was enrichment of rare nonsynonymous variants in the lipid versus the control geneset (odds ratio, 2.23; P < 0.0001), and 70% of the lipid-related variants altered conserved nucleotides. The lipid geneset comprised 4 nonsense, 10 splice-site, and 8 coding indel variants, whereas the control geneset contained only 1 such variant. In the lipid geneset, 87% and 28% of the patients carried ≥ 2 and ≥ 5 rare variants.

Conclusions

This study suggests that most extreme HDL-C phenotypes have a polygenic origin.

### Association of extremely high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with cardiovascular mortality in a pooled analysis of 9 cohort studies including 43, 407 individuals: the EPOCH-JAPAN study [^1176Az8m]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of very high or extremely high levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not well described. Although a few recent studies have reported the adverse effects of extremely high levels of HDL-C on CVD events, these did not show a statistically significant association between extremely high levels of HDL-C and cause-specific CVD mortality. In addition, Asian populations have not been studied.

Objective

We examine the impact of extremely high levels of HDL-C on cause-specific CVD mortality using pooled data of Japanese cohort studies.

Methods

We performed a large-scale pooled analysis of 9 Japanese cohorts including 43,407 participants aged 40–89 years, dividing the participants into 5 groups by HDL-C levels, including extremely high levels of HDL-C ≥ 2.33 mmol/L (≥ 90 mg/dL). We estimated the adjusted hazard ratio of each HDL-C category for all-cause death and cause-specific deaths compared with HDL-C 1.04–1.55 mmol/L (40–59 mg/dL) using a cohort-stratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

During a 12.1-year follow-up, 4995 all-cause deaths and 1280 deaths due to overall CVD were identified. Extremely high levels of HDL-C were significantly associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic CVD mortality (hazard ratio = 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.37–4.09 for total) and increased risk for coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke. In addition, the risk for extremely high HDL-C was more evident among current drinkers.

Conclusion

We showed extremely high levels of HDL-C had an adverse effect on atherosclerotic CVD mortality in a pooled analysis of Japanese cohorts.

### Plasma high density lipoproteins: therapeutic targeting and links to atherogenic inflammation [^1134PkuR]. Atherosclerosis (2018). Low credibility.

Plasma HDL levels have an inverse relationship to coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, which led to the idea that increasing HDL levels therapeutically would ameliorate atherosclerosis. Human genetic deficiency of CETP caused markedly elevated HDL and moderately reduced non-HDL cholesterol levels, suggesting that CETP inhibitors might produce cardiovascular benefit. The CETP inhibitor anacetrapib reproduced the phenotype of homozygous CETP deficiency and showed a highly significant benefit for CAD in the REVEAL trial. However, the magnitude of this effect was moderate, and the mechanism of benefit remains unclear. Insights into the mechanisms underlying macrophage cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport have come from monogenic human disorders and transgenic mouse studies. In particular, the importance of the ATP binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 in promoting cholesterol efflux from myeloid and other hematopoietic cells has been shown and linked to aberrant myelopoiesis and macrophage inflammation. Recent studies have shown that myeloid deficiency of ABCA1 and ABCG1 leads to macrophage and neutrophil inflammasome activation, which in turn promotes atherosclerotic plaque development and notably the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in plaques. In addition, clonal hematopoiesis has emerged as an important CAD risk factor, likely involving macrophage inflammation and inflammasome activation. Further elucidation of the mechanisms linking plaque accumulation of cholesterol and oxidized lipids to myeloid cell inflammation may lead to the development of new therapeutics specifically targeting atherogenic inflammation, with likely benefit for CAD.

### High-density lipoprotein revisited: biological functions and clinical relevance [^114yvc7g]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Cholesterol transport

The most intensively investigated function of HDL is reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). According to this model, HDLs elicit cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells of atherosclerotic plaques either specifically, via sequential interactions with ABCA1 and ABCG1, or by aqueous diffusion, through a process facilitated by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) (Figure 2). Virtual HDL-deficiency in Tangier disease as well as in mice with systemic or hepatocyte-specific knock-out of ABCA1, illustrates the rate-limiting importance of ABCA1 for the biogenesis of HDL. Free cholesterol is then esterified by LCAT and cleared by the liver, either directly, by selective uptake through SR-BI, or indirectly after CETP-mediated transfer to apoB-containing lipoproteins which are then internalized by the LDL receptor. In addition, HDL particles as such are taken up by hepatocytes through a yet poorly understood mechanism (Figure 2).

Of note, HDL-C levels reflect neither the capacity nor the intensity of RCT. Neither do increased HDL-C levels upon treatment with CETP inhibitors indicate enhanced RCT. Especially in the context of LDL receptor activation through the concomitant statin therapy, the interference with cholesteryl ester transfer from HDL to LDL blocks RCT by preventing the removal of cholesterol by the LDLR pathway. The doubling of HDL-C levels upon CETP inhibition indicates that the blockage of this indirect pathway is not compensated by the direct removal of HDL and its cholesterol cargo.

RCT is of special relevance for the removal of cholesterol from macrophages: following cholesterol accumulation, macrophages exert several pro-inflammatory activities which are dampened by HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Also, adipocytes are enriched with cholesterol to form the biomembranes surrounding lipid droplets. Hydrolysis of triglycerides in white adipocytes upon fasting or in brown adipocytes upon heat production is accompanied by a breakdown of these membranes and the release of considerable amounts of cholesterol for RCT. At least in mouse models, HDL or ABC transporters were shown to play an important role in this process.

HDLs also accept unesterified cholesterol from TGRLs, a process enhanced upon hydrolysis of triglycerides by lipoprotein lipase and independent of phospholipids (Figure 2).

### High-density lipoprotein (HDL) phospholipid content and cholesterol efflux capacity are reduced in patients with very high HDL cholesterol and coronary disease [^116QBUGo]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are strongly inversely associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), and high HDL-C is generally associated with reduced risk of CAD. Extremely high HDL-C with CAD is an unusual phenotype, and we hypothesized that the HDL in such individuals may have an altered composition and reduced function when compared with controls with similarly high HDL-C and no CAD.

Approach and Results

Fifty-five subjects with very high HDL-C (mean, 86 mg/dL) and onset of CAD at the age of ≈ 60 years with no known risk factors for CAD (cases) were identified through systematic recruitment. A total of 120 control subjects without CAD, matched for race, sex, and HDL-C level (controls), were identified. In all subjects, HDL composition was analyzed and HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was assessed. HDL phospholipid composition was significantly lower in cases (92 ± 37 mg/dL) than in controls (109 ± 43 mg/dL; P = 0.0095). HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was significantly lower in cases (1.96 ± 0.39) than in controls (2.11 ± 0.43; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

In people with very high HDL-C, reduced HDL phospholipid content and cholesterol efflux capacity are associated with the paradoxical development of CAD.

### The association of HDL-cholesterol levels with incident major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality in 0.6 million individuals with type 2 diabetes: a population-based retrospective cohort study [^117PLFiQ]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The association between high HDL-C levels and adverse cardiovascular outcomes is generalizable to the large population of individuals with type 2 diabetes, which may bear implications in the construction of cardiovascular risk calculators as current risk calculators (including the SCORE2-Diabetes) consider HDL-C level as a linear variable and may not account for the higher cardiovascular risks linked to the high HDL-C levels. It is also interesting to note that the excess risk of MACE associated with high HDL-C levels was less than that associated with low HDL-C levels. This asymmetry of the U-shaped association between HDL-C levels and MACE has been suggested in some, but not all, studies. Further population-based epidemiological studies would help to confirm such observation to refine cardiovascular risk estimation.

There are some postulated mechanisms for the elevated cardiovascular risks at high HDL-C levels in type 2 diabetes. Very high HDL-C levels may be a result of genetic variants that have detrimental effects on disease susceptibility. For instance, certain genetic mutations in LIPC and SCARB1, which have been linked to a higher risk of coronary heart disease. Moreover, HDL-C levels represent the overall concentration of HDL-C in the circulation, which is a mix of HDL particles with different biological functions. HDL particles possess multiple biological activities which can influence glycaemia, immunity and inflammation, atherosclerosis and function of vascular cells. HDL consists of a family of lipoprotein particles which differ in density, size, charge, protein and lipid composition, and HDL particles are highly heterogeneous. It has been shown that various cellular functions of HDL only weakly correlated with each other. Different cellular functions of HDL were determined by different structural components. Hence, HDL-C levels only reflect the cholesterol contents of the HDL pool and do not predict its composition or function. Type 2 diabetes is associated with various modifications in the structures and functions of HDL particles. For example, increased glycation/glycoxidation of HDL may impair its reverse cholesterol transport ability and diminish its antiatherogenic capacity. The oxidative environment of the acute phase response in diabetes is associated with change of HDL particles from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory. The increased particle sizes and detrimental subspecies such as HDL containing apoC3 in individuals with high levels of HDL-C have been found to result in cholesterol deposition and atherosclerosis development, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular events.

### Cholesteryl ester transfer protein: a novel target for raising HDL and inhibiting atherosclerosis [^113uabgX]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) promotes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from antiatherogenic HDLs to proatherogenic apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, including VLDLs, VLDL remnants, IDLs, and LDLs. A deficiency of CETP is associated with increased HDL levels and decreased LDL levels, a profile that is typically antiatherogenic. Studies in rabbits, a species with naturally high levels of CETP, support the therapeutic potential of CETP inhibition as an approach to retarding atherogenesis. Studies in mice, a species that lacks CETP activity, have provided mixed results. Human subjects with heterozygous CETP deficiency and an HDL cholesterol level > 60 mg/dL have a reduced risk of coronary heart disease. Evidence that atherosclerosis may be increased in CETP-deficient subjects whose HDL levels are not increased is difficult to interpret and may reflect confounding or bias. Small-molecule inhibitors of CETP have now been tested in human subjects and shown to increase the concentration of HDL cholesterol while decreasing that of LDL cholesterol and apoB. Thus, it seems important and timely to test the hypothesis in randomized trials of humans that pharmacological inhibition of CETP retards the development of atherosclerosis.

### Increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in dyslipidemia by cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition: an update for clinicians [^116msuxS]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Reduced HDL cholesterol may be a risk factor comparable in importance to increased LDL cholesterol. Interventions that raise HDL are antiatherosclerotic, presumably through acceleration of reverse cholesterol transport and by antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects. In the hypercholesterolemic rabbit, HDL levels can be increased by > 50% by inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a molecule that plays a central role in HDL metabolism. This HDL-raising effect is antiatherosclerotic in moderately severe hyperlipidemia but appears to be ineffective in the presence of severe hypertriglyceridemia. In humans, mutations resulting in CETP inhibition have been associated with both reduced and increased risk of atherosclerosis. Proposed explanations for these apparently disparate observations are that the antiatherosclerotic effect of CETP inhibition varies with either the metabolic milieu or the degree of CETP inhibition. We now have pharmacological inhibitors of CETP that are capable of increasing HDL by as much as 50% to 100% in humans. The importance of this development is that reduced HDL is a risk factor independent of LDL and that these new agents alter HDL by a magnitude comparable to that of statins on LDL. Clinical trials, now beginning, will need to identify the patient subsets in which CETP inhibition may be more or less effective.

### The relative role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in coronary artery disease: evidence from large-scale statin and fibrate trials [^117U29LY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Statin therapy has been remarkably successful in reducing coronary events and improving survival. Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the paramount mechanism for the benefit of statins. Although the relation between reduction of risk of coronary artery disease and pretreatment lipid levels has not been fully resolved, a feature of statin therapy emerging from previous large-scale trials is the diminished benefit when the baseline level of LDL-C is low (eg, < 125 mg/dL). Increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) with statin therapy are associated with mild reductions in coronary events, indicating that HDL-C is an important element. However, the risk of low HDL-C is not altered by statin therapy, in marked contrast with LDL-C. Because most coronary events have not been prevented in the statin trials, nonstatin lipid therapy, including fibrates, may be necessary to further reduce the unacceptably high rate of coronary artery disease.

### Preventing high cholesterol… [^115FLWdY]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- By living a healthy lifestyle, you can help keep your cholesterol in a healthy range.
- Overweight and obesity raise levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Make healthy eating choices Your body makes all of the cholesterol it needs, so you do not need to obtain cholesterol through foods. Eating lots of foods high in saturated fat and trans fat may contribute to high cholesterol and related conditions, such as heart disease. What you can do to help prevent cholesterol: Limit foods high in saturated fat. Saturated fats come from animal products and tropical oils. Foods that are higher in saturated fat may be high in cholesterol. Choose foods that are low in saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, and added sugars. These foods include lean meats; seafood; fat-free or low-fat milk, cheese, and yogurt; whole grains; and fruits and vegetables.

Eat foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans, and unsaturated fats. These foods may help prevent and manage high levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Find healthy, seasonal recipes at the Million Hearts ® healthy recipes page. Prevention steps and strategies Maintain a healthy weight Overweight and obesity raise levels of LDL cholesterol. Excess body fat affects how your body uses cholesterol and slows down your body's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood. The combination raises your risk of heart disease and stroke. What you can do: To determine whether your weight is in a healthy range, doctors often calculate your body mass index. If you know your weight and height, you can calculate your BMI at CDC's Assessing Your Weight website.

Doctors sometimes also use waist and hip measurements to measure excess body fat. Limit alcohol Too much alcohol can raise cholesterol levels and levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood. What you can do:

- Avoid drinking too much alcohol. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women should have no more than one.
- Learn more at CDC's Alcohol and Public Health website.

### Association between HDL-C levels and adverse cardiovascular outcomes… [^112srQyB]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Very high HDL-C levels are paradoxically associated with higher mortality risk in individuals with CAD. Importance Previous studies have shown lower cardiovascular risk with higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, recent data in the general population have shown increased risk of adverse outcomes at very high HDL-C concentrations. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this cohort study suggest that very high HDL-C levels are paradoxically associated with higher mortality risk in individuals with CAD. This association was independent of the common polymorphisms associated with high HDL-C levels. Individuals with an HDL-C level greater than 80 mg/dL also had lower mean triglyceride levels and higher mean LDL-C levels than those with lower HDL-C levels.

A positive linear association between the HDL-C GRS and HDL-C levels was observed, with a 1-SD higher HDL-C GRS being associated with a 3. 03-mg/dL higher HDL-C level. Results of this cohort study suggest that in individuals with CAD, compared with those with normal HDL-C levels, those with very high HDL-C levels have a higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and alcohol use. Even though prevalence of some traditional risk factors, such as diabetes, myocardial infarction history, heart attack history, and BMI, decreased with increasing HDL-C levels, we observed a higher risk of mortality in this group after adjusting for these risk factors. Prior studies have indicated that low HDL-C levels are associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes compared with those with normal HDL-C levels.

21, 22 More recently, studies have indicated that very high HDL-C level is also associated with adverse outcomes in the general population without known CAD. 9, 10, 23 To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association of very high HDL-C levels with cardiovascular mortality among patients with CAD.
