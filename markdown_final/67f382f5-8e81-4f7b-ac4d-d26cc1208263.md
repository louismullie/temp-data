## Question

How often do you need to do CT scans for lung nodules for surveillance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often to perform CT surveillance for pulmonary nodules, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core risk stratification framework by nodule size, composition, and patient risk. Then, I should verify the surveillance intervals for solid nodules ≤ 8 mm versus > 8 mm, including special handling for multiple nodules. Next, I will review subsolid nodules, including pure ground-glass and part-solid lesions. After that, I need to check the technical imaging parameters and growth assessment methods. Finally, I should consider special contexts such as screening programs, COVID-era adaptations, and patient-centered factors like adherence and psychological impact, and then synthesize a concise decision algorithm with caveats and exceptions [^115w8z2w] [^113vMbob] [^112hU7fg].

> Let me first confirm the foundational risk stratification elements that drive surveillance cadence: nodule size, solid versus subsolid composition, and patient risk factors for lung cancer, because these three axes underpin ACCP, Fleischner, and BTS recommendations and directly determine interval length and total duration of follow-up [^116Kxkfo] [^114JqRBL] [^113Ho9k9].

> I will now examine solid nodules ≤ 8 mm, and I need to ensure I separate low-risk from high-risk patients because ACCP uses this split to modulate intensity and duration of surveillance; for low-risk patients, ≤ 4 mm typically needs no routine follow-up, 4–6 mm gets a single 12-month CT, and 6–8 mm gets CT at 6–12 months and again at 18–24 months if unchanged, whereas for high-risk patients, ≤ 4 mm is re-evaluated at 12 months, 4–6 mm at 6–12 months then again at 18–24 months, and 6–8 mm at 3–6 months, 9–12 months, and 24 months, with all surveillance using low-dose, noncontrast techniques and decisions for multiple nodules based on the largest nodule [^115DB2yF] [^116Kxkfo] [^116V5qY4].

> Wait, let me verify the > 8 mm solid nodule pathway because this is where surveillance is often inappropriate; for solid nodules > 8 mm, surveillance is reserved for very low pretest probability scenarios or when functional imaging and/or biopsy are negative or nondiagnostic, and when surveillance is chosen, the standard schedule is CT at 3–6 months, 9–12 months, and 18–24 months using thin sections and low-dose technique, with explicit caution that delays beyond 6 months risk stage migration and that many patients with > 8 mm nodules should proceed to PET-CT, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical evaluation rather than surveillance [^113jd5f7] [^112svB2s] [^116p22P3].

> Hold on, I should verify the handling of multiple solid nodules; guidelines consistently advise basing surveillance on the largest nodule and using the same size- and risk-based intervals, which simplifies follow-up while maintaining safety margins for the highest-risk lesion in the cluster [^116Kxkfo] [^115DB2yF].

> Next, I should review subsolid nodules, and I need to distinguish pure ground-glass from part-solid because their biology and surveillance cadence differ; for pure ground-glass nodules ≤ 5 mm, no routine follow-up is generally recommended, whereas for > 5 mm pure ground-glass, annual CT for at least 3 years is advised, with some Asian and specialty guidelines extending surveillance longer due to indolent but real malignancy risk, and for part-solid nodules ≤ 8 mm, CT at about 3, 12, and 24 months followed by annual imaging for 1–3 additional years is recommended, with earlier action if a solid component emerges or grows [^114CksGx] [^113BqB7B] [^112o9woH] [^111ct3x5].

> I should double-check the technical execution of surveillance CT because suboptimal technique can obscure growth; all major guidelines converge on low-dose, noncontrast acquisitions with thin sections through the nodule of interest, ideally ≤ 1.25 mm, and they emphasize comparing with all prior studies and using volumetric or semi-automated tools to quantify growth, with growth defined conservatively as a ≥ 25% increase in diameter or volume, recognizing that very small nodules may require longer intervals to confidently detect change [^116SGP45] [^113jd5f7] [^112auJJZ].

> But wait, what if the nodule was detected in a lung cancer screening program; I need to ensure I align with Lung-RADS and related guidance, which generally use lower thresholds for new nodules and shorter initial follow-up intervals, for example new solid nodules < 6 mm often trigger 6-month surveillance and 6–8 mm trigger 3-month surveillance, while part-solid nodules with a solid component ≥ 8 mm warrant expedited evaluation; importantly, during COVID-19, expert panels allowed 3–6 month delays for many indeterminate nodules, but observational data suggest that delays beyond 6 months are associated with more stage II+ diagnoses, so I should avoid extending beyond 6 months when feasible [^115w8z2w] [^113vMbob] [^114NFrnv] [^116p22P3].

> Let me consider patient-centered factors that can modify surveillance intensity; adherence to follow-up is often suboptimal, and prolonged uncertainty can drive anxiety, so clear communication about why intervals are chosen, the low but nonzero malignancy risk, and the radiation trade-offs improves adherence, and shared decision-making is especially important when guidelines allow flexibility based on clinical judgment and patient preference, including in Asian populations where extended surveillance beyond 3 years is sometimes favored due to different risk profiles and infectious mimics like tuberculosis [^112hU7fg] [^112VQRr6] [^112wTBft].

> I should confirm that I am not overextending surveillance beyond evidence-based durations; Choosing Wisely explicitly cautions against surveillance more frequent or longer than recommended, and for solid nodules stable over 2 years the risk of malignancy is extremely low, which supports discharge in many cases, whereas subsolid lesions may warrant longer follow-up because of their indolent biology and the possibility of late development of a solid component [^116Vmaff] [^112vGLtR] [^114CksGx].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision flow without losing nuance: first, measure and characterize the nodule precisely and review prior imaging; second, classify size, solid versus subsolid composition, and patient risk; third, for solid ≤ 8 mm, apply ACCP size- and risk-based intervals with low-dose thin-slice CT; fourth, for solid > 8 mm, avoid surveillance unless pretest probability is very low and functional imaging or biopsy is negative or declined, and if surveilled, use 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 month CTs; fifth, for subsolid nodules, use no routine follow-up if ≤ 5 mm pure ground-glass, annual CT for ≥ 3 years if > 5 mm pure ground-glass, and 3, 12, 24 months then annual imaging for part-solid nodules; sixth, reassess growth at each interval and escalate to PET-CT, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical consultation if growth occurs or new solid components appear; finally, tailor to screening context, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and avoid delays beyond 6 months when possible [^116Kxkfo] [^114JqRBL] [^114CksGx] [^116p22P3].

CT surveillance intervals for lung nodules depend on **nodule size, composition, and patient risk** [^114JqRBL]. For **solid nodules ≤ 8 mm**, use low-dose, non-contrast CT and follow size-based intervals: ≤ 4 mm at 12 months (no further follow-up if unchanged) [^116Kxkfo]; 4–6 mm at 6–12 months, then 18–24 months if unchanged [^116Kxkfo]; 6–8 mm at 3–6, 9–12, and 24 months if unchanged [^1156YLSN]. For **solid nodules > 8 mm**, obtain CT at 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 months if surveillance is chosen, and use PET/CT or biopsy if risk is moderate to high [^113jd5f7] [^117Uozmi]. For **subsolid nodules**, repeat CT at 3–6 months to confirm persistence, then annually for at least 3 years; if a solid component develops or the solid component is ≥ 8 mm, proceed to PET/CT and biopsy [^111JKmG8] [^111SVvad]. Always tailor follow-up to patient risk, comorbidities, and preferences, and use the lowest effective radiation dose [^116Kxkfo].

## Solid pulmonary nodules

### Nodules ≤ 8 mm

For nodules ≤ 8 mm, **surveillance intervals** are size- and risk-based:

| **Nodule size** | **Low-risk patient** | **High-risk patient** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 4 mm | No routine follow-up | CT at 12 months; no further follow-up if unchanged [^116Kxkfo] |
| 4–6 mm | CT at 12 months; no further follow-up if unchanged [^115DB2yF] | CT at 6–12 months, then 18–24 months if unchanged [^116Kxkfo] |
| 6–8 mm | CT at 6–12 months, then 18–24 months if unchanged [^115DB2yF] | CT at 3–6, 9–12, and 24 months if unchanged [^116Kxkfo] |

---

For **imaging technique**, use low-dose, non-contrast CT with thin sections through the nodule [^112svB2s].

---

### Nodules > 8 mm

For nodules > 8 mm, **surveillance intervals** are CT at 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 months if surveillance is selected for very low-risk patients or when PET/CT or biopsy is inconclusive [^113jd5f7] [^112svB2s]. For **additional evaluation**, consider PET/CT, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical resection based on malignancy risk and patient preference [^1166zTws].

---

## Subsolid pulmonary nodules

### Pure ground-glass nodules (GGN)

For pure ground-glass nodules (GGN), **surveillance intervals** are an initial repeat CT at 6–12 months to confirm persistence, then annual CT for at least 3 years; consider ongoing annual surveillance if stable [^111JKmG8] [^116ETWxB]. For **nodules ≤ 5 mm**, no routine follow-up is recommended [^111f1Nji].

---

### Part-solid nodules

For part-solid nodules, **surveillance intervals** are CT at 3–6 months to confirm persistence, then annual CT for at least 3 years; if the solid component is ≥ 8 mm, proceed to PET/CT and biopsy [^111JKmG8] [^113MpRJj].

---

## Special considerations

- **Multiple nodules**: Base follow-up on the largest nodule [^116Kxkfo].
- **Patient factors**: Tailor surveillance to comorbidities, life expectancy, and preferences [^111wgPxw].
- **Radiation dose**: Use the lowest effective dose and minimize cumulative exposure [^116Kxkfo].

---

## CT surveillance intervals

| **Nodule type** | **Size** | **Initial follow-up** | **Subsequent follow-up** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Solid | ≤ 4 mm | 12 months (high-risk) | None if unchanged |
| Solid | 4–6 mm | 6–12 months (high-risk) | 18–24 months if unchanged |
| Solid | 6–8 mm | 3–6 months (high-risk) | 9–12 and 24 months if unchanged |
| Solid | > 8 mm | 3–6 months | 9–12 and 18–24 months if unchanged |
| GGN | ≤ 5 mm | No routine follow-up | None |
| GGN | > 5 mm | 6–12 months | Annual CT ≥ 3 years |
| Part-solid | Any size | 3–6 months | Annual CT ≥ 3 years |

---

CT surveillance intervals for lung nodules are **guided by nodule size, composition, and patient risk**, with low-dose, non-contrast CT used to balance detection and radiation exposure [^116Kxkfo] [^111SVvad] [^113jd5f7].

Pulmonary nodules — conclusions and recommendations for research indicate that individuals with solid nodules measuring ≥ 8 mm should be managed by reviewing old imaging studies; estimating the probability of malignancy; performing imaging tests to better characterize the nodule; evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives; and eliciting patient preferences for CT scan surveillance, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical diagnosis. For solid nodules measuring ≤ 8 mm, these are described as infrequently malignant, difficult to biopsy, risky to resect, and not reliably characterized by PET scan or other functional imaging tests, leaving CT scan surveillance as the most appropriate option. At this time, the frequency and duration of surveillance are guided by expert consensus-based recommendations from the Fleischner Society. Subsolid nodules often are premalignant or malignant and may require extended-duration surveillance for growth or development of a solid component.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, more specifically with respect to follow-up imaging, solid nodules, ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend to consider deciding on the frequency and duration of CT surveillance in patients with a solid nodule ≤ 8 mm in diameter and ≥ 1 risk factor for lung cancer according to the size of the nodule:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
| ≤ 4 mm|- Reevaluate nodules at 12 months without the need for additional follow-up if unchanged|
| > 4 mm to 6 mm|- Monitor nodules sometime between 6 and 12 months and then again between 18 and 24 months if unchanged|
| > 6 mm to 8 mm|- Monitor nodules initially sometime between 3 and 6 months then subsequently between 9 and 12 months and again at 24 months if unchanged.|

Serial CT surveillance schedule and technique — In an individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule > 8 mm in diameter who undergoes surveillance, serial CT scans using thin sections and non-contrast, low-dose techniques should be performed at 3 to 6 months, 9 to 12 months, 18 to 24 months, and, depending on clinical judgement and patient preference, annually thereafter.

Computed tomography (CT) surveillance scheduling for solid, indeterminate nodules — For nodules measuring > 8 mm, standard practice is to obtain follow-up CT scans at about 3 to 6, 9 to 12, and 18 to 24 months, and surveillance is virtually always performed with CT scanning. A Scottish study found that maximum cross-sectional tumor area increased by > 50% in almost 25% of patients with treatment delays of 15 to 131 days. The surveillance strategy should be avoided when the clinical probability of cancer is moderate to high; it is most appropriate in individuals with a very low probability of malignancy and in those who are at high risk for complications of surgical resection and nonsurgical biopsy.

Solid, indeterminate nodules > 8 mm — CT surveillance indications and schedule: In an individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule > 8 mm in diameter, perform surveillance with serial low-dose CT scans when the clinical probability of malignancy is deemed low (< 5%), when biopsy is non-diagnostic and the lesion is not hypermetabolic as assessed by PET, or when a fully informed patient prefers this nonaggressive management approach, despite the potential risk of disease progression. For those who undergo surveillance, serial CT scans using thin sections and non-contrast, low-dose techniques should be performed at 3 to 6 months, 9 to 12 months, 18 to 24 months, and, depending on clinical judgement and patient preference, annually thereafter.

Suitability for surgery or other curative-intent treatment emphasizes that before embarking on a potentially inconvenient, risky, and expensive evaluation, it is important to establish the individual's suitability and desire for curative treatment; although therapeutic lobectomy frequently is contraindicated in individuals with advanced comorbid conditions, relatively few individuals will be excluded from consideration for sublobar resection or other less-invasive treatments; some individuals may prefer no treatment, and in such individuals it does not make sense to pursue biopsy or aggressive CT scan surveillance, although it is always prudent to monitor for symptoms that may be palliated; for individuals who desire treatment but either refuse or cannot tolerate surgery (even limited resection), surgical diagnosis is precluded, and other options for evaluation include functional imaging, CT scan surveillance, and nonsurgical biopsy, and prior to beginning nonsurgical treatment, the diagnosis of lung cancer ideally should be confirmed by biopsy specimen.

Pulmonary nodules — management strategies and thresholds are outlined as follows: Surgery is the diagnostic gold standard and the definitive treatment of malignant nodules, but surgery should be avoided in patients with benign nodules. CT scan surveillance avoids unnecessary surgery in patients with benign nodules, but surveillance delays diagnosis and treatment in cases of malignancy. In this analysis, surveillance was favored when the probability of malignancy was < 3%, and surgical diagnosis was preferred when the probability was > 68%.

### Management of progressive pulmonary nodules found during and outside of CT lung cancer screening studies [^112PywyE]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Although the effectiveness of screening for lung cancer remains controversial, it is a fact that most lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage outside of lung cancer screening programs. In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force revised its lung cancer screening recommendation, now supporting lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography in patients at high risk. This is also endorsed by many major medical societies and advocacy group stakeholders, albeit with different eligibility criteria. In Europe, population-based lung cancer screening has so far not been recommended or implemented, as some important issues remain unresolved. Among them is the open question of how enlarging pulmonary nodules detected in lung cancer screening should be managed. This article comprises two parts: a review of the current lung cancer screening approaches and the potential therapeutic options for enlarging pulmonary nodules, followed by a meeting report including consensus statements of an interdisciplinary expert panel that discussed the potential of the different therapeutic options.

### Pulmonary nodules: common questions and answers [^111RnwGJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are often incidentally discovered on chest imaging or from dedicated lung cancer screening. Screening adults 50 to 80 years of age who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years with low-dose computed tomography is associated with a decrease in cancer-associated mortality. Once a nodule is detected, specific radiographic and clinical features can be used in validated risk stratification models to assess the probability of malignancy and guide management. Solid pulmonary nodules less than 6 mm warrant surveillance imaging in patients at high risk, and nodules between 6 and 8 mm should be reassessed within 12 months, with the recommended interval varying by the risk of malignancy and an allowance for patient-physician decision-making. A functional assessment with positron emission tomography/computed tomography, nonsurgical biopsy, and resection should be considered for solid nodules 8 mm or greater and a high risk of malignancy. Subsolid nodules have a higher risk of cancer and should be followed with surveillance imaging for longer. Direct physician-patient communication, clinical decision support within electronic health records, and guideline-based management algorithms included in radiology reports are associated with increased compliance with existing guidelines.

Objectives

The objective of this article is to update previous evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management of individuals with solid pulmonary nodules and to generate new recommendations for those with nonsolid nodules.

Methods

We updated prior literature reviews, synthesized evidence, and formulated recommendations by using the methods described in the "Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer" in the American College of Chest Physicians Lung Cancer Guidelines, 3rd ed.

Results

We formulated recommendations for evaluating solid pulmonary nodules that measure > 8 mm in diameter, solid nodules that measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter, and subsolid nodules. The recommendations stress the value of assessing the probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need to weigh the benefits and harms of different management strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and surveillance with chest CT imaging), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

Conclusions

Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated and managed by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting their preferences for management.

### Management of the solitary pulmonary nodule [^113ym7zd]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review the categorization and management of solitary pulmonary nodules.

Recent Findings

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were updated in 2018 and the revised Fleischner Society guidelines were published in 2017. The revised Fleischner Society guidelines published in 2017 have less frequent follow-up recommendations for incidentally detected pulmonary nodules with longer intervals between subsequent CT scans. The updated 2018 version of National Comprehensive Cancer Network lung cancer screening guidelines provide recommendations for screen-detected nodules based on a patient's risk of cancer. New molecular assays may be of use in patients with a pretest probability of malignancy less than 50%. When these tests indicate low risk, a strategy of follow-up CT imaging may be feasible, avoiding unnecessary invasive testing. However, further clinical utility studies are needed in this area.

Summary

Management options for pulmonary nodules include watchful waiting with follow-up CT imaging, PET imaging, or further invasive testing based on probability of malignancy. With a low estimated risk of malignancy in an incidentally detected solitary pulmonary nodule, longer intervals between follow-up CT scans are recommended for patients. For patients at high risk for malignancy or those with nodules of at least 8mm, either incidentally, screen detected, or symptom driven, a diagnostic biopsy is necessary to establish the cause of a solitary pulmonary nodule.

### Incidence rate and malignancy risk in new nodules in a lung cancer screening programme [^116fxdPB]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a substantial body of evidence investigating malignancy risk in lung nodules identified at baseline CT in lung cancer screening (LCS) programmes. However, understanding of the risk of malignancy posed by new nodules seen at subsequent scans is more limited. As lung cancer screening becomes established as an annual/biennial process, positive scans will increasingly be driven by the development of new nodules, for which currently validated baseline risk prediction models (e.g. the Brock score) are not applicable. An evidence-based approach to these nodules is therefore essential for effective screening programmes.

As well as appearing at annual/biennial screening rounds, new nodules can also appear on nodule follow-up (NFU) CTs after a shorter interval, such as CTs acquired 3 months after identification of an indeterminate nodule. Such a finding may itself lead to a further 3-month interval scan, potentially doubling, tripling, or even quadrupling the number of scans a participant undergoes with each year of screening. It has been hypothesised that nodules developing within a short time period have a high likelihood of being benign or inflammatory by virtue of their very rapid growth rate. However, the malignancy risk in this group of nodules has not been widely studied in the setting of lung cancer screening, so there is, at present, no evidence to support more or less frequent surveillance.

Evidence from the NELSON lung cancer screening trial found that the probability of a new solid nodule ≥ 27 mm 3 at subsequent screening round (1–2 years after baseline) representing cancer was higher than that of an equivalently sized nodule identified on the baseline scan, and therefore advocated a lower size threshold for surveillance or referral for investigation for new nodules identified at annual or biennial screening rounds. LungRADS advises lower size thresholds for the management of new nodules (advising 6-month and 3-month NFU-CT for new solid nodules < 6 mm diameter (< 113 mm 3) and 6 to < 8 mm (113 to < 268 mm 3), respectively, and definitive investigation in new solid nodules ≥ 8 mm (268 mm 3)), but no distinction is made regarding whether the new nodule develops at an annual screening visit or in the shorter timeframe of a nodule follow-up scan. Fleischner Society (for incidentally detected) and British Thoracic Society (for incidentally- and screen-detected nodules) guidelines make no specific recommendations for new nodules identified at 3-month follow-up CTs.

COVID-19 lung nodule surveillance — Scenario 4 (screening-detected lung nodule, Lung-RADS category 3): During the COVID-19 pandemic, consistent with CDC guidance to defer nonurgent care, it is acceptable to delay surveillance for approximately 3 to 6 months. Current (pre-COVID-19) recommendations suggest a surveillance chest CT (computed tomography) scan 6 months after the nodule was identified. Lung-RADS category 3 nodules are considered to have a 1% to 2% probability of malignancy, and include solid nodules ≥ 6 mm to < 8 mm in diameter, part-solid nodules with the solid component < 6 mm in diameter, new solid nodules 4 to < 6 mm in diameter, new part-solid nodules < 6 mm in diameter, and pure ground-glass nodules ≥ 30 mm. Factors that may influence this decision include COVID-19 penetrance in the community and hospital, availability of rapid COVID-19 testing, availability of resources, patient values, and comorbid conditions.

Pulmonary nodules — initial imaging evaluation: In an individual with an indeterminate nodule that is visible on chest radiography, review prior imaging tests. In an individual with an indeterminate nodule that has been stable for at least 2 years, annual low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening beyond 2 years for high-risk patients for early detection of lung cancer should be individualized. In an individual with an indeterminate nodule identified by chest radiography, perform low-dose chest CT (preferably with thin sections through the nodule) to characterize the nodule and assess the likelihood of malignancy.

### Evaluation of pulmonary nodules: clinical practice consensus guidelines for Asia [^112VQRr6]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Geographic considerations, exceptions to surveillance, and extended follow-up — The threshold for what is considered "low probability" may depend on the geographical and cultural context of individuals, and generally the probability of malignancy of pulmonary nodules is higher in Asian populations than in Western populations; for seemingly benign nodules (ie, low probability of malignancy), an accurate diagnosis may sometimes be necessary rather than surveillance, with examples including tuberculosis or other infections requiring specific treatment and patients who use high-dose immunosuppression (eg, transplant) who may need a more aggressive approach; in Asia, the high prevalence of risk factors and reports of malignancy emerging after many years suggest that consideration should be given to extended (3 years and beyond) annual surveillance based on clinical judgment and patient preference, although the expert panel acknowledged the lack of evidence for this approach and the potential risk of ongoing ionizing radiation, and surveillance may cease in nodules that show progressive shrinkage or disappearance.

### Late to the game: cancer screening guidelines and nodule surveillance in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias [^116e6JuS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The different outcomes and challenges associated with these treatment approaches, combined with the lack of guidelines, not only make multidisciplinary discussions among pulmonologists, chest radiologists, oncologists, and thoracic surgeons indispensable but also highlight the crucial role of timely screening. LCS guidelines would allow for early-stage LC identification and patient selection, especially for those with mild physiologic impairment and no other significant risk factors, which may lead to better outcomes.

Recent work advocates for annual LCS in patients with IPF, emphasizing careful evaluation of emerging nodules in regions with extensive fibrosis, subpleural areas, and the normal–fibrotic interface. Short-interval surveillance for newly identified nodules should integrate both chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography. We align with the notion that yearly LCS is warranted for fibrotic IIPs. Newly identified nodules may require closer follow-up every 6 months for nodules < 6 mm, with consideration for positron emission tomography–computed tomography for those > 6 mm. The annual computed tomography recommendation is supported by current LCS guidelines for high-risk populations, and the closer follow-up is driven by the inherent high-risk nature and increased doubling times exhibited by LC in IIP and by expert opinion. We recognize that IIP-specific LCS guideline approval requires proof of mortality benefit. However, conducting appropriate randomized trials in this population is not practical. Recommendations, therefore, should rely heavily on a shared decision-making process involving a multidisciplinary team discussion and the patient.

In conclusion, LC protocols for IIPs are long overdue, and the responsibility for their development falls on us. This pressing matter calls for the formation of a committee of clinician-scientists to review available evidence and generate comprehensive IIP-specific LCS and nodule surveillance guidelines. Tailored recommendations addressing a patient's risk assessment and diagnostic and therapeutic nuances are imperative to bridge existing gaps and help guide appropriateness for LCS. We believe that early diagnosis of LC holds the potential for targeted interventions, and improved survival, although further studies are warranted to support this. Until then, the question remains: Will we rise to this challenge?

### Interventions to improve adherence to clinical guidelines for the management and follow-up of pulmonary nodules: a systematic review [^112Yy8M7]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Most early-stage lung cancers are radiographically identified as a pulmonary nodule (PNs). PNs are well or poorly circumscribed small, rounded lung abnormalities that may be single or multiple. Many PNs are identified incidentally when CT scans are performed of the chest or thorax during routine medical care, and other PNs are identified in screening programs (eg, for lung cancer). In some settings, incidental findings may be a source of more identified early lung cancers than screening programs.PNs can denote premalignant or early-stage lung cancer; therefore, effective management can reduce mortality. Up to 35% of the general population can have PNs when they undergo CT scanning, and 50% of patients with nodules have more than one.

According to clinical guidelines, patients with nodules should be followed up systematically depending on the number of nodules, their morphology, and medical history. Although most nodules are benign, 3% to 5% turn out to be lung cancer. Therefore, in line with clinical guidelines (eg, from the British Thoracic Society and the Fleischner Society,), management involves performing follow-up scans to determine the rate of growth of these nodules. The initial follow-up scan helps determine if further surveillance is required based on growth rate of the nodule. Following up incidentally identified PNs is also important for maximizing early identification of lung cancer, as these populations can be substantially demographically different from lung cancer screening populations. For example, one US prospective observational study following up 22,886 patients, comparing a lung cancer screening program with a lung nodule follow-up program, found that only 54% of total patients with lung cancer would have been eligible for lung cancer screening.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: an observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^116p22P3]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a cohort of 2,001 participants who underwent interval surveillance (due at 3 months) for an indeterminate nodule at baseline LDCT, we found no change in the proportion of participants diagnosed with stage > I lung cancer when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed from 3 to 6 months. We observed a higher proportion of cancers that were diagnosed at stage II or above when scans were delayed beyond 6 months, which suggests that delays beyond this timepoint risk disease progression becoming significant.

Although there is evidence that adherence to recommended follow-up for screen-detected findings is known to be suboptimal, there is little evidence for the consequences of such delays. Such research is challenging; first, most participants who undergo nodule follow-up CT scan will not have cancer, meaning large screened cohorts are required to obtain sufficient cancer numbers. Second, given that pathologic upstaging at surgery occurs in 17%-38% of cases, it is not possible to determine whether extended delays truly led to stage shift in individual cases. With the use of a retrospective review of baseline (noncontrast) LDCT examinations to assess for clinical stage shift, a recently published article in a US screening cohortfound that clinical upstaging was observed more frequently following delayed nodule follow-up CT scans compared with cancers diagnosed following nodule follow-up CT scans performed at the target time, with a median delay in cases in which upstaging occurred of 131 days (after the target time). Although using different methodological approaches, our findings in nodule follow-up CT scans performed at > 180 days (equivalent to delays of > 90 days after target time) are concordant with those of Ahmed et al, with more prolonged delays to nodule follow-up CT scans increasing the risk of cancers being diagnosed at higher stage.

### Evaluation of pulmonary nodules: clinical practice consensus guidelines for Asia [^112wTBft]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Asian practice considerations for small solid nodules — No data are available to properly support modifications to the CHEST recommendations. However, solid nodules ≤ 8 mm in diameter have a low, but not negligible, probability of malignancy, and environmental risk factors may make the dichotomy between high and low risk not applicable in many parts of Asia. As a result, the expert panel suggested more frequent and longer term CT surveillance (3 years and beyond depending on clinical judgment and patient preference) for small nodules than recommended by the CHEST group, and one recent study from Thailand also observed a very high prevalence of TB in nodules ≤ 8 mm but especially in smaller nodules (4.5–11 mm).

Solid pulmonary nodules measuring > 8 mm — evaluation and pretest probability are emphasized: among individuals with a solid nodule measuring > 8 mm in diameter, steps include estimating the probability of cancer, characterizing the lesion with computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) or another functional imaging test, and choosing among nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and active surveillance with serial CT scans; because clinical and radiographic characteristics cannot reliably distinguish between benign and malignant nodules in most individuals, it is nevertheless important to estimate the clinical probability of malignancy before ordering imaging tests or biopsy procedures, and several quantitative models have been developed to assist in this task, including four new models developed since 2005.

### Management of incidental lung nodules: current strategy and rationale [^1125AAPF]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected lung nodules are increasingly common in routine diagnostic computed tomography (CT) imaging. Formal management recommendations for incidental nodules, such as those outlined by the Fleischner Society, must therefore reflect a balance of malignancy risk and the clinical context in which nodules are discovered. Nodule size, attenuation, morphology, and location all influence the likelihood of malignancy and, thus, the necessity and timing of follow-up according to current Fleischner recommendations. As technological advancements in CT imaging continue, there may be greater reliance on advanced computerized analysis of lung nodule features to help determine the risk of clinically significant disease.

### Incidence rate and malignancy risk in new nodules in a lung cancer screening programme [^115Bc8q4]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present data from one of the largest studies of malignancy risk in new nodules at annual CT in lung cancer screening to date and the first (to our knowledge) to investigate risk in new nodules at short-term surveillance CT. We found that (1) the probability of lung cancer in new nodules arising at annual screening CT is overall small, but is not negligible (3.0%); (2) lung cancer risk is very low for new nodules emerging within the short interval of a 3-month follow-up CT (0.63%); (3) lower size thresholds for surveillance (30 mm 3) and immediate referral (200 mm 3) of new nodules at 1 year from baseline CT advocated in previous studies is reinforced.

Despite the increasing adoption of LCS as an annual or biennial process in the US, UK and other countries, there remains a paucity of evidence to guide management decisions for new nodules. Our data add to previous studies showing that this is not a negligible concern. Our annual incident nodule rate of 11.1% (of which 5.6% met the criteria for further surveillance or MDT assessment) is somewhat higher than the 5–7% reported in NELSON and 7.5% in PLuSS. When extrapolated to population-level screening, this incident rate represents a substantial clinical problem that requires an evidence-based management approach.

Overview

Lung nodules are common findings on diagnostic and screening computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest. National guidelines recommend algorithms to evaluate lung nodules because a subset are malignant. Although guideline-concordant lung nodule evaluation rates are low overall, the risk of suboptimal follow-up is higher for minoritized racial and ethnic groups. This research statement summarizes the existing evidence, identifies research gaps, and reports a formal consensus development process to prioritize future research questions in four domains related to interventions to mitigate health disparities in lung nodule evaluation: 1) considerations regarding research methodology, 2) interventions at the patient level, 3) interventions at the clinician level, and 4) interventions at the health-system level. This statement offers a research agenda to inform investigators and funding agencies on the considerations to generate high-priority, high-quality research on interventions to mitigate inequities in the evaluation of lung nodules.

### Advanced imaging tools in pulmonary nodule detection and surveillance [^113XPkD6]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. The National Lung Screening Trial has demonstrated that lung cancer screening can reduce lung cancer specific and all cause mortality. With approval of national coverage for lung cancer screening, it is expected that an increase in exams related to pulmonary nodule detection and surveillance will ensue. Advanced imaging technologies for nodule detection and surveillance will be more important than ever. While computed tomography (CT) remains the modality of choice, other emerging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging provides viable alternatives to CT.

Pulmonary nodule size thresholds during low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening — nodules less than or equal to 8 mm can be safely followed with radiographic surveillance without invasive testing, whereas for larger pulmonary nodules (> 8 mm) or small nodules that grow during surveillance specialists often become involved to assess the need for invasive testing.

Pulmonary nodules — limitations of FDG-PET in high pretest probability and follow-up needs are noted: Among patients with indeterminate nodules (by CT scan) and high pretest probability, negative PET scan results do not reliably exclude malignancy. Hence, patients with solid nodules and negative (nonhypermetabolic) PET scan results are believed to require continued surveillance for at least 2 years to confirm benignity. Patients with nonhypermetabolic malignant tumors may have a favorable prognosis, even when definitive surgical treatment is delayed by a period of observation as long as 238 days.

### Prospects for population screening and diagnosis of lung cancer [^112sWMKh]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Deaths from lung cancer exceed those from any other type of malignancy, with 1·5 million deaths in 2010. Prevention and smoking cessation are still the main methods to reduce the death toll. The US National Lung Screening Trial, which compared CT screening with chest radiograph, yielded a mortality advantage of 20% to participants in the CT group. International debate is ongoing about whether sufficient evidence exists to implement CT screening programmes. When questions about effectiveness and cost-effectiveness have been answered, which will await publication of the largest European trial, NELSON, and pooled analysis of European CT screening trials, we discuss the main topics that will need consideration. These unresolved issues are risk prediction models to identify patients for CT screening; radiological protocols that use volumetric analysis for indeterminate nodules; options for surgical resection of CT-identified nodules; screening interval; and duration of screening. We suggest that a demonstration project of biennial screening over a 4-year period should be undertaken.

### Management of pulmonary nodules by community pulmonologists: a multicenter observational study [^117XGg5y]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A pulmonary nodule (PN) is defined as a radiographic opacity ≤ 3 cm in diameter surrounded by lung parenchyma. The prevalence of PNs is unknown, with estimates ranging from 150,000 to 1 million per year in the United States. The identification of PNs may increase over the next decade for several reasons. First, chest CT scans are ordered frequently for a myriad of clinical indications, including dyspnea or chest pain. Smith-Bindman et alestimate the rate of chest CT scanning as 23 per 1,000, which, extrapolated to the US population, equates to approximately 7 million chest CT scans performed annually. Second, the National Lung Screening Trial found three fewer deaths from lung cancer per 1,000 in those screened annually for 3 years with low-dose chest CT scans, leading to the B recommendation by the US Preventive Services Task Forceto screen high-risk individuals with yearly low-dose CT scans. However, the National Lung Screening Trial also found a 25% rate of screen-detected nodules, 96% of which were benign. Currently, 8.6 million Americans meet the criteria for screening. Depending on the penetration of screening, the incidence of detected PNs could increase dramatically.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: an observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^111KUsJc]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Our findings should not be interpreted as giving the "optimal" time to perform surveillance scans. There is already discrepancy between LungRADS, which recommends 3-month follow-up for higher risk and 6-month follow-up for lower risk nodules, and BTSand European position statement for lung cancer screening guidelines, which recommend a repeat LDCT at 3 months. Determining the optimal nodule follow-up CT scan interval must consider the risk of stage shift while ensuring enough time for true growth to be observed and for feasibility for participants and screening programs.

Our comparative analysis is limited by the fact that we were able to perform the vast majority of nodule follow-up CT scans within 6 months; therefore, only a small number of participants were scanned after an interval of > 180 days. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the 2,001 individuals and 87 cancers included in this analysis are comparable with other entire screening cohorts. A further limitation is that this is observational data. Finally, although LungRADS categories were available for secondary analysis, our nodule management protocol used BTS guidelines.

In conclusion, in a cohort of 2,001 participants who underwent NFU CT for indeterminate nodules that were identified at baseline LDCT, we observed no difference in risk of lung cancer diagnosis at stage > 1 when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed from 3–6 months, but we observed a higher proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage II or above when scans were delayed beyond 6 months. This finding provides support to the guidelines proposed by the CHEST expert panelthat, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at which time attending a CT scan in a health care setting poses a significant risk to a participants' health, deferring interval surveillance for indeterminate nodules that were identified on baseline scans by up to 6 months is a justifiable approach, However, the increased risk of higher stage at diagnosis beyond 6 months should be recognized, with every effort made to ensure that indeterminate nodules undergo surveillance before this.

### High risk lung nodule: a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis and management [^114mzC3a]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are often discovered incidentally during CT scans performed for other reasons. While the vast majority of nodules are benign, a small percentage may represent early-stage lung cancer with the potential for curative treatments. With the growing use of CT for both clinical purposes and lung cancer screening, the number of pulmonary nodules detected is expected to increase substantially. Despite well-established guidelines, many nodules do not receive proper evaluation due to a variety of factors, including inadequate coordination of care and financial and social barriers. To address this quality gap, novel approaches such as multidisciplinary nodule clinics and multidisciplinary boards may be necessary. As pulmonary nodules may indicate early-stage lung cancer, it is crucial to adopt a risk-stratified approach to identify potential lung cancers at an early stage, while minimizing the risk of harm and expense associated with over investigation of low-risk nodules. This article, authored by multiple specialists involved in nodule management, delves into the diagnostic approach to lung nodules. It covers the process of determining whether a patient requires tissue sampling or continued surveillance. Additionally, the article provides an in-depth examination of the various biopsy and therapeutic options available for malignant lung nodules. The article also emphasizes the significance of early detection in reducing lung cancer mortality, especially among high-risk populations. Furthermore, it addresses the creation of a comprehensive lung nodule program, which involves smoking cessation, lung cancer screening, and systematic evaluation and follow-up of both incidental and screen-detected nodules.

### Patients' experiences of, and psychological responses to, surveillance for pulmonary nodules detected through lung cancer screening [^112hU7fg]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

One potential barrier to the acceptability of LCS is the relatively high frequency of indeterminate pulmonary nodules; nodules of low but not negligible malignancy probability for which guidelines (including Lung-RADSand British Thoracic Society) advise surveillance CT scan at 3–6 months. Across UK LCS trials, approximately 11% of participants had an indeterminate pulmonary nodule at baseline screening CT, which required surveillance. Previous research has found that individuals receiving indeterminate findings experience negative psychological outcomes during the months spent waiting for their first surveillance scan, although this appears to resolve in the longer term. The negative psychological outcomes can arise from individuals being placed in a prolonged period of uncertainty, concern and emotional distress, with women, individuals experiencing socioeconomic deprivation, and those who currently smoke more likely to experience clinically elevated anxiety and LC-related distress while waiting for a surveillance CT. Crucially, psychological distress or negative experiences of surveillance could adversely affect individuals' subsequent screening behaviour, including adherence to surveillance or subsequent screening rounds, and satisfaction with screening. Indeed, research in the context of incidentally diagnosed nodules (ie, outside of screening) has highlighted patients' emotional discomfort and prolonged uncertainty when they perceive their cancer-related concerns are not addressed by healthcare professionals (HCPs), which might lead to poor adherence to surveillance and inadequate knowledge of their care plan. Data from the United States have found that adherence to follow-up after a positive screening examination is low, and it is therefore essential that all these factors are addressed to ensure screen-detected findings are followed up appropriately.

Ensuring individuals considering screening are well-informed and aware of the frequency with which indeterminate nodules are detectedand the possibility of needing surveillance has been suggested to reduce cancer-related distress among those receiving a nodule diagnosis. A series of studies in the US healthcare context of incidentally detected nodules suggests HCPs often underestimate the psychological impact these 'near-cancer' diagnoses have on patients. The framework by Slatore and Wiener argues that high-quality, patient-centred communication strategies are needed to mediate how patients respond, to promote adaptive psychological responses and support cancer knowledge and prevention behaviour during surveillance. However, there is little evidence of patients' experiences, reactions and behaviours following the information and communication they receive when undergoing surveillance for an indeterminate nodule detected through screening, with no qualitative research to date in the UK LCS context.

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening — incidental non-lung nodule findings are common on baseline scans (41%- 94%) and often trigger additional evaluation (9% to 15%), yet few patients undergo invasive procedures (< 5%) and therapeutic interventions are rarely prompted (< 1%); new non-lung nodule findings on subsequent scans are uncommon (~ 5% per year), and therefore these findings on screening LDCT scan cannot be recommended as an indication for further investigation at this time.

### Evaluation of lung cancer risk among persons undergoing screening or guideline-concordant monitoring of lung nodules in the Mississippi delta [^113VnCAs]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer mortality is diminishing in the US, along with downward stage shift and improvement in survival across stages. The stage redistribution began shortly after low-dose computed tomography screening (LDCT) became a covered health care benefit. However, implementation barriers hinder widespread adoption, and a geographic disparity has emerged, including a mismatch between state-level density of accredited LDCT facilities and per-capita lung cancer mortality. Although residents of states and counties in the Mississippi Delta region have some of the worst lung cancer mortality statistics, fewer than 5% of eligible persons in southern US states have been screened. Paradoxically, lung cancer screening threatens to exacerbate preexisting racial and geographic disparities in lung cancer mortality.,

Persons at greatest risk for lung cancer, such as the less well-educated, rural dwellers, and the socioeconomically disadvantaged, are also least likely to access preventive care. Such persons often seek care in settings ill-equipped for preventive care. The use of CT imaging has been steadily rising in North America, along with the frequency of detecting lung nodules. Guideline-concordant management of such incidentally detected lung nodules provides another route to early detection of lung cancer. We concurrently implemented LDCT and lung nodule programs (LNP) within a community-based health care system, and a previous reportfound a higher frequency of lung cancer diagnosis through the LNP. It is unclear whether the larger numbers of persons diagnosed with lung cancer in the LNP simply reflect the larger numbers undergoing surveillance through this program, or if the cumulative lung cancer diagnosis hazard differs between the types of persons enrolled.

To evaluate this, we compared the cumulative incidence of lung cancer in screening-age populations within both programs. We hypothesized that lesions scored as Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) 3 (recommended for CT scan follow-up within 6 months) and Lung-RADS 4 (recommended for radiological follow-up within 3 months or invasive diagnostic testing) infer a hazard of lung cancer diagnosis similar to lesions typically identified by radiologists as needing further surveillance or intervention in the LNP setting. We evaluated the relative hazard of lung cancer diagnosis in subsets of LNP participants with different smoking histories. We also evaluated the association between Medicare eligibility age, race, and access to early lung cancer detection through LDCT and LNP.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: an observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^116z2ecv]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitated urgent adaptation of guidelines to ensure individuals were exposed to health care settings only when absolutely necessary. This included the follow-up of pulmonary nodules, especially in lung cancer screening participants. Although delaying imaging follow-up evaluation in this context seems prudent, such delays theoretically risk upstaging of early-stage lung cancers that manifest as nodules. To assist practitioners who facilitate lung cancer screening programs, the CHEST expert panel report recommended that screening should be paused and that, for indeterminate nodules that require surveillance, the time intervals could be relaxed by 3–6 months.

Although the World Health Organization has declared an end to SARS-CoV-2 as a global health emergency, participant adherence to strict timing of interval surveillance scans has been shown to be suboptimal. However, at this time, little is known regarding the effect of such delays on stage at diagnosis.

The SUMMIT Study is a prospective observational cohort study that examines the delivery of a low-dose CT (LDCT) scan lung cancer screening service to a high-risk population and that validates a multicancer early detection blood test. Running from 2019–2023, the study was impacted by national lockdowns caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which means that a proportion of participants had delays to interval scans for indeterminate nodules identified on baseline LDCT. The aim of this observational analysis was to examine whether the delay of interval scans for indeterminate nodules within the timescale proposed by the CHEST expert panel was associated with an increased proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage 2 or above.

Current CT screening activity inside and outside the UK

Lung cancer screening by CXR was advocated by the American Cancer Society in the 1970s, however this recommendation was withdrawn following evidence from the trials in the 1980s. Following the publication of the NLST results, the USPSTF recommended screening with LDCT of individuals aged 55–80 who have accrued at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and are current or former smokers who have given up for ≤ 15 years. The ACCP/American Thoracic Society, American College of Radiology (ACR) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network have all also released statements or guidelines for screening.

In February 2015, the US insurers, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services agreed to fund screening of asymptomatic insured individuals aged 55–77 who meet the USPSTF smoking criteria. The newly instated 'Obamacare' enables some 30% of the uninsured population to access LDCT screening; however, once a nodule is detected it is classified as surveillance rather than screening, and perversely funds are insufficient to cover this crucial aspect of the screening process. Furthermore, a significant proportion of the US population do not qualify for screening at all through lack of insurance coverage. What is really required, therefore, is a national screening programme that is accessible to individuals from all communities such as the US National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Nonetheless, LDCT screening for insured individuals is now underway in the US. The ACR runs an accreditation programme outlining basic standards for performing and evaluating screening scans using the above-mentioned Lung-RADS. At the time of writing, there were 1220 accredited centres for LDCT screening in the US, 43 of which had been awarded 'diagnostic imaging centre of excellence'. The ACR has constructed a lung cancer screening registry, to record outcomes from screening and the first feedback was expected in autumn 2015.

Screening has not yet been initiated in Canada, and the European Society of Radiology and European Respiratory Society recommend that screening should be performed in 'comprehensive, quality-controlled longitudinal programmes'. In China, several lung cancer screening programmes have been initiated, particularly in areas with high lung cancer incidence, funded by central or local government.

The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) is due to make a decision on lung cancer LDCT screening in the UK pending the results of the pooled European data. In the meantime, several centres around the UK have initiated early diagnosis campaigns or pilot screening projects and these will contribute increasing knowledge around the best methods of implementation in the UK.

### Creating an incidental pulmonary nodule safety-net program [^117AqRfx]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are a frequent, incidental finding on CT scans, ranging from up to 8.4% on abdominal scans and up to 48% on CT angiograms. Incidental findings are sometimes disregarded or overshadowed by critical situations and may not be disclosed or documented on discharge. The costs and risks associated with incidental findings are not insignificant, including the risk of a delayed diagnosis of lung cancer. A medical center commitment to prevent overlooked incidental pulmonary nodules led to the development of an incidental pulmonary nodule program. The program, led by an advanced practice nurse, established processes to identify patients with incidental lung nodules on CT scans and developed criteria for further follow-up with the primary care provider and the patient. Improvements with consistent use of Fleischner guidelines in scan reports by radiologists and increased ownership in informing patients of incidental nodules by ED and trauma providers have occurred. As the frequency of chest CT imaging is increasing, the number of incidental nodules identified will also increase. A lung nodule surveillance process would greatly benefit every lung nodule clinic or hospital system for management of pulmonary nodules.

Subsolid lung nodules — clinical background and surveillance overview notes that computed tomography (CT) imaging has increased identification of incidental lung nodules, including indeterminate subsolid nodules, and that subsolid nodules can either represent benign disease or malignancy. Lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as subsolid lesions is generally considered to be more indolent and correlated with better long-term survival, and therefore the primary course for most screen-detected subsolid nodules is CT surveillance. The document states that details of surveillance strategies remain controversial and raises concern about overdiagnosis of nonsolid (pure ground-glass) lung adenocarcinomas that may lead to overtreatment; it also notes that this American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) expert consensus document provides recommendations for surveillance and surgical intervention while identifying opportunities for future research.

IMAGING IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF LUNG CANCER

Diagnostic imaging tests

When possible, a spiral CT scan should be undertaken for diagnostic imaging as it gives the best image (option, level of evidence: D). An anterior–posterior and lateral chest X-ray, performed with a high kilovoltage technique, is essential in the diagnostic work-up (recommendation). If lung cancer is suspected, a normal chest X-ray will not be sufficient to exclude the diagnosis (recommendation). Patients with any suspicion of lung cancer, despite a normal chest X-ray, should have a thoracic CT scan (recommendation). If a suspicious lesion is observed on a normal chest X-ray, a thoracic CT scan is warranted, if treatment, other than supportive care, is envisaged; a baseline evaluation is required to assess treatment response; or a transparietal fine needle biopsy is planned (recommendation).

A CT scan image is not sufficiently specific to confirm the diagnosis (recommendation).

Positron emission tomography (PET scanning) in diagnosis

Surgery is not recommended if the lung lesion measures less than 10 mm and if there is no fluoro-2-deoxy — glucose (FDG) uptake. Clinical and radiological surveillance should be undertaken for 4–6 months to ensure that the lesion does not increase in size. The upper limit of nodule size warranting this approach is not known, but it is estimated to be perhaps up to 40 mm. This policy of surveillance is particularly appropriate to minimise any unnecessary invasive active investigation of a nodule (recommendation, expert agreement).

Guidelines for the management of subsolid nodules are grounded in even weaker evidence than those for solid nodules and should also be studied, and it may also be helpful for guideline developers to use a living guideline model to more rapidly and efficiently disseminate important developments in the field.

### Screening for lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^115w8z2w]. Chest (2007). Medium credibility.

ACCP lung cancer screening — CT positive test thresholds and nodule measurement — We suggest that screening programs define what constitutes a positive test on the low-dose CT based on the size of a detected solid or part-solid lung nodule, with a threshold for a positive test that is either 4 mm, 5 mm, or 6 mm in diameter (Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence). A positive test is defined as a test that leads to a recommendation for any additional testing other than to return for the annual screening exam. Nodule diameter is the average of long- and short-axis diameters on the same sagittal, coronal, or transverse image; for part-solid nodules, diameter should be based on the size of the solid component and measured using lung windows. An equivalent volumetric threshold can also be considered. The LungRADS structured reporting system currently uses a 6 mm threshold for a positive test on the baseline scan and 4 mm if a new nodule is found on the annual scan for solid nodules, and 6 mm on the baseline scan and any size if a new nodule is found on the annual scan for part-solid nodules.

Lung-RADS guidance includes "GG: < 30 mm or any size and unchanged: RTAS (category 2)" and for larger or new GG "GG: > 30 mm or new: 6-mo CT scan (category 3)", while PS recommendations include " < 6 mm: baseline RTAS (category 2), new 6-mo CT (category 3)" and escalation by solid component size: "solid component < 6 mm, 6-mo CT (category 3); solid component = 6–8 mm or new or growing and < 4 mm, 3-mo CT (category 4A); solid component ≥ 8 mm or new or growing and ≥ 4 mm, further evaluation (category 4B)".

### Prevalence and clinical characteristics of malignant lung nodules in tuberculosis endemic area in a single tertiary centre [^1175gkFS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

A clinical practice consensus guideline for the pulmonary nodule was developed in Asia. The decision to biopsy a lung nodule depends on the probability of malignancy and the size and characteristics of the lung nodule. However, the guidelines are not often implemented among clinicians in Asian countries, even though the awareness is high. Multiple tools have been developed to calculate lung malignancy risk, but the strength of association of each risk factor to lung malignancy remains unknown.

Our hospital is a tertiary referral center that serves a heterogenous, multiracial population in Kuala Lumpur and TB is common in our catchment area. Being a tertiary centre, CT Scan is done routinely in our centre for various reasons, and many lung nodules are detected incidentally. Hence, we aim to study lung nodules prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes from surveillance computed tomography and biopsy. Our primary objective is to determine the prevalence of malignant lung nodules among nodules measuring 2–30 mm on the CT scan surveillance. Our secondary objective is to describe the characteristics of a malignant lung nodule, determine the risk factors of a malignant lung nodule in our tertiary centre, and assess the clinician's compliance with Fleischner's 2017 guidelines.

### An official American Thoracic Society / American College of Chest Physicians policy statement: the choosing wisely top five list in adult pulmonary medicine [^116Vmaff]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely campaign aims to curb health-care costs and improve patient care by soliciting lists from medical societies of the top five tests or treatments in their specialty that are used too frequently and inappropriately. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and American College of Chest Physicians created a joint task force, which produced a top five list for adult pulmonary medicine. Our top five recommendations, which were approved by the executive committees of the ATS and American College of Chest Physicians and published by Choosing Wisely in October 2013, are as follows: (1) Do not perform CT scan surveillance for evaluation of indeterminate pulmonary nodules at more frequent intervals or for a longer period of time than recommended by established guidelines; (2) do not routinely offer pharmacologic treatment with advanced vasoactive agents approved only for the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension to patients with pulmonary hypertension resulting from left heart disease or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension); (3) for patients recently discharged on supplemental home oxygen following hospitalization for an acute illness, do not renew the prescription without assessing the patient for ongoing hypoxemia; (4) do not perform chest CT angiography to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism in patients with a low clinical probability and negative results of a highly sensitive D-dimer assay; (5) do not perform CT scan screening for lung cancer among patients at low risk for lung cancer. We hope pulmonologists will use these recommendations to stimulate frank discussions with patients about when these tests and treatments are indicated — and when they are not.

### Don't perform CT surveillance for evaluation of indeterminate pulmonary nodules at more frequent intervals or for a longer period of time than recommended by established guidelines… [^112vGLtR]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for pulmonary nodule evaluation suggest that intensity of surveillance should be guided by the likelihood of malignancy. In patients with no prior history of cancer, solid nodules that have not grown over a two-year period have an extremely low risk of malignancy. Similarly, intensive surveillance has not been shown to improve outcomes such as lung cancer mortality. Meanwhile, extended or intensive surveillance exposes patients to increased radiation and prolonged uncertainty.
