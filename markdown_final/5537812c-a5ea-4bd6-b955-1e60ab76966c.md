## Question

What are the potential complications of untreated gout?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of untreated gout, including how the disease progresses, the specific musculoskeletal, renal, cardiovascular, and quality-of-life impacts, and how treatment alters prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and staging of gout to anchor the timeline of complications. Then, I should verify the key musculoskeletal sequelae: recurrent flares, chronic gouty arthritis, tophi, bone and cartilage erosion, and deformity. Next, I will examine renal complications, including nephrolithiasis and urate nephropathy. After that, I need to review cardiovascular and metabolic associations and the burden of comorbidity. Finally, I will consider quality-of-life, disability, healthcare utilization, and how treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy changes outcomes, before summarizing the core complications with guideline-backed targets and timing considerations [^114YzRfQ] [^115C6rnR] [^116A43TT] [^113GgTZp].

> Let me first confirm the disease course so I don't jump to conclusions: gout progresses through asymptomatic hyperuricemia, crystal deposition, intermittent flares, and then, if untreated, chronic tophaceous disease with structural joint damage, driven by persistent urate supersaturation and ongoing crystal burden, which is the substrate for all complications to follow [^112sWfyx] [^114goZD1].

> I will now examine the musculoskeletal complications, starting with recurrent acute flares, because untreated patients have a high short-term recurrence risk; wait, let me verify the magnitude — yes, about 69% within a year after a first attack, reflecting persistent intra-articular crystals that trigger inflammation whenever mobilized [^111wMtrC] [^114goZD1]. Chronic gouty arthritis emerges as the inflammatory response becomes smoldering, with synovitis and progressive cartilage and bone damage that may already be irreversible by the time of diagnosis in some patients, particularly with high urate loads or delayed treatment, which explains early structural changes despite infrequent overt flares [^113jcmxe] [^116TdMpu] [^111wMtrC].

> Next, I should review tophus formation, since tophi are the hallmark of advanced disease when hyperuricemia is untreated; hold on, I should confirm the complications that come with them — yes, tophi cause pain, cosmetic deformity, and importantly, erosion of periarticular bone and cartilage, with case-based evidence of ulceration, infection, and prolonged morbidity, which can necessitate surgery and carry high complication rates if unmanaged [^113jcmxe] [^115ouMVs]. I need to ensure I capture structural outcomes accurately: bone erosion and deformity reflect cumulative crystal burden and correlate with disability, and these changes accrue steadily in the absence of urate-lowering therapy to drive crystal dissolution, often progressing to irreversible joint destruction in longstanding disease [^114goZD1] [^111wMtrC].

> Now, let me consider renal complications, because I should double-check that I distinguish nephrolithiasis from parenchymal urate nephropathy; gout increases the risk of uric acid stones and is linked to interstitial and medullary urate deposition, with emerging evidence that "gouty nephropathy" from microcrystalline urate may be more common than appreciated, correlating with hypertension and kidney dysfunction in imaging studies of gout patients with CKD [^116qz26N] [^113a44gL]. But wait, what if the renal disease is entirely due to comorbidities? The association is strong and bidirectional, and gout is tightly linked with CKD prevalence, with under-recognition and under-treatment of urate in CKD compounding risk and worsening outcomes, so I should be careful not to overstate causality while acknowledging a likely contributory role of urate toxicity in some cases [^116qz26N] [^113jcmxe].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity, since these are central to excess mortality in gout; let me verify the signal strength — patients with gout have markedly elevated prevalences of hypertension, CKD, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease, and hyperuricemia is associated with incident hypertension and vascular disease in observational data, though causality remains debated and likely multifactorial with shared pathways and confounding [^116qz26N] [^1123eTwD] [^114goZD1]. Hold on, I should verify whether urate-lowering changes cardiovascular outcomes — evidence is mixed and largely observational; interventional trials are ongoing, so I must avoid over-claiming while acknowledging the epidemiologic burden and potential benefits of lowering urate in high-risk patients, especially those with CKD or very high urate levels [^114goZD1] [^113PGPNG].

> I will now examine quality-of-life and disability impacts, because I need to ensure the narrative reflects patient-centered outcomes; poorly controlled gout drives substantial pain, reduced mobility, and work absenteeism, and advanced tophaceous disease can be disfiguring and functionally limiting, with significant time off work and reduced health-related quality of life, alongside increased hospitalizations when flares and tophi are uncontrolled [^113jcmxe] [^114goZD1] [^116UE4pN]. Let me reconsider whether the economic burden is captured — yes, untreated or undertreated gout imposes a substantial and preventable burden on health systems due to emergency visits, hospitalizations, and disability, which escalates with higher urate and more frequent flares [^116UE4pN].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical and complications are missed; gout can mimic septic arthritis and nonhealing ulcers, sometimes leading to amputation in the context of comorbid vascular disease and infection risk, and even when serum urate is "normal" at presentation, chronic urate burden may already be sufficient to cause tophi and erosion, so clinicians must not anchor on a single normal urate value to exclude advanced disease or ongoing crystal deposition [^1174vhHc] [^114H51gr] [^116r9qgQ]. I should double-check that guidelines align with this nuance — imaging can reveal subclinical urate deposits, reinforcing that complications reflect tissue urate burden more than a single serum value [^111VqppV].

> Next, I should review how treatment modifies this trajectory; treat-to-target urate-lowering therapy to below 6 mg/dL (and lower in severe disease) dissolves existing crystals, suppresses flares, shrinks and resolves tophi, and halts structural progression when sustained, and prophylaxis during initiation reduces mobilization flares, though many patients remain undertreated and under-titrated, limiting these benefits in real-world practice [^114goZD1] [^114Pzu3i] [^113GgTZp]. Hold on, I should verify guideline-backed indications and timing — strong indications include tophi, radiographic damage, or frequent flares, and while some guidelines advise starting ULT after a first flare, conditional recommendations allow earlier initiation in select contexts such as marked hyperuricemia, CKD, or urolithiasis, emphasizing individualized risk-benefit decisions [^115C6rnR] [^116A43TT] [^115K2FBK].

> Putting this together, the core complications of untreated gout span four domains: musculoskeletal destruction with recurrent flares, chronic gouty arthritis, tophi, and irreversible erosive arthropathy; renal disease including uric acid nephrolithiasis and possible urate nephropathy with CKD; cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidity that increase mortality; and disabling pain, deformity, and reduced quality of life with substantial healthcare utilization, all of which are preventable or reversible to varying degrees with sustained, treat-to-target urate lowering and coordinated comorbidity management [^114goZD1] [^113jcmxe] [^116qz26N] [^116UE4pN]. I should confirm that this synthesis aligns with contemporary guidance and burden studies — it does, underscoring that early, sustained urate control and structured follow-up are key to altering the natural history and avoiding these complications [^114goZD1] [^111wMtrC].

Untreated gout leads to **chronic, destructive arthritis** with tophi, joint erosion, and deformity [^112sWfyx] [^113jcmxe], causing permanent disability and loss of function [^113jcmxe] [^112G6FKY]. It also causes **urate nephropathy and nephrolithiasis**, with up to 24% developing kidney stones and a higher risk of CKD progression [^117YHQA5] [^116qz26N]. Cardiovascular risk rises due to persistent inflammation and hyperuricemia, increasing myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality [^116qz26N] [^1123eTwD]. Quality of life is severely impaired, with chronic pain, disability, and substantial healthcare costs [^116UE4pN]. Early, sustained urate-lowering therapy to **serum urate < 6 mg/dL** prevents these complications and can reverse crystal burden if maintained [^114goZD1] [^114Pzu3i].

## Musculoskeletal complications

### Chronic gouty arthritis

Chronic gouty arthritis results from persistent monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition, causing **recurrent inflammation and progressive joint damage** [^111wMtrC]. Key manifestations include:

- **Joint erosion and deformity**: Ongoing inflammation leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosion, and joint deformity, significantly impairing mobility and function [^112G6FKY] [^117WCJLc].

- **Tophi formation**: Firm, subcutaneous deposits of urate crystals develop in joints, ears, elbows, and other tissues, causing cosmetic disfigurement and functional impairment [^112sWfyx].

- **Permanent disability**: Chronic arthritis and joint destruction result in significant disability, limiting daily activities and reducing quality of life [^116UE4pN].

---

### Tophi and associated complications

Tophi are characteristic of advanced gout and are associated with **significant complications**:

- **Ulceration and infection**: Tophi can ulcerate, leading to secondary infection, chronic wounds, and sepsis [^115ouMVs].

- **Bone and cartilage destruction**: Tophi erode adjacent bone and cartilage, causing irreversible joint damage and deformity [^112sWfyx].

- **Functional impairment**: Tophi involving tendons and ligaments impair joint function, causing significant disability [^116e2Wc6].

---

## Renal complications

Untreated gout significantly impacts **renal function**, leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney stones [^116EC67m].

---

### Uric acid nephrolithiasis

Uric acid nephrolithiasis is common in untreated gout, with a prevalence of approximately 24% [^116qz26N]. Nephrolithiasis increases the risk of obstructive uropathy, urinary tract infections, and chronic kidney disease [^notfound].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

Hyperuricemia contributes to **interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerulosclerosis**, leading to progressive CKD [^notfound]. CKD progression increases the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), dialysis, and renal transplantation [^notfound].

---

## Cardiovascular complications

Untreated gout is associated with significant **cardiovascular morbidity and mortality** [^1123eTwD]. Hyperuricemia and chronic inflammation promote endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death [^1123eTwD]. Cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to premature mortality in patients with untreated gout [^1174ieho].

---

## Impact on quality of life and healthcare utilization

Untreated gout profoundly affects **quality of life** and healthcare utilization [^116UE4pN]. Chronic pain, disability, and psychological distress significantly impair daily functioning and overall well-being [^112G6FKY]. Frequent flares and hospitalizations increase healthcare costs and resource utilization, placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems [^116r9qgQ].

---

## Preventive strategies and management

Effective management of gout centers on **urate-lowering therapy (ULT)** and lifestyle modifications:

- **Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)**: Allopurinol, febuxostat, and pegloticase effectively lower serum urate levels, dissolve existing crystals, and prevent future flares and complications [^114goZD1] [^115RUWgX].

- **Treat-to-target approach**: Maintaining serum urate levels below 6 mg/dL is essential for preventing crystal deposition, reducing flares, and reversing tophi [^114Pzu3i] [^114goZD1].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and alcohol restriction significantly reduce uric acid levels and improve outcomes [^notfound].

---

Untreated gout leads to **chronic arthritis, tophi, renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, and significant disability** [^116UE4pN]. Early diagnosis and sustained urate-lowering therapy are critical to prevent these complications and improve patient outcomes [^1179RcH7].

### Screening for hyperuricaemia and gout: a perspective and research agenda [^117Mdsi3]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

The goal of a screening programme is to reduce an adverse health outcome in a defined population. Screening can be undertaken at several stages throughout the disease course: before the onset of disease, early in the course of the disease, or in established disease (for complications). In the setting of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and gout, the aim of screening would be to identify those individuals with hyperuricaemia and therefore at risk of gout, with the aim of introducing interventions to prevent the onset of gout. Herein we consider the concepts of screening for hyperuricaemia and gout, potential screening methods, and target populations that might benefit from such an approach.

Gout is a common form of arthritis, in which many of the risk factors, pathogenetic mechanisms, and clinical features have been recognized for years. Nevertheless, new information has become available regarding the normal physiologic role of uric acid as an antioxidant, and greater insight has been obtained regarding the inflammatory process in acute gout. New studies have improved our understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors responsible for hyperuricemia, and we know more about the significance of the association of hyperuricemia with other diseases. Clinically, rare complications and disease manifestations in new populations continue to be discussed, and diagnostic methods continue to be refined.

### Up-to-date management of gout [^113K62i4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is a true crystal deposition disease, extremely painful and bone and tissue damaging if untreated. It is the only curable form of arthritis. Although we have many treatments to cure gout, it is a disease that is consistently undertreated/mismanaged and perceived by clinicians and the lay public as a 'laughable condition' with the patients' lifestyle often held erroneously to account. This article would give you a good understanding of modern and established pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments used in the management of acute and chronic gout and how to 'treat to target' to cure the disease.

Recent Findings

Many of the drugs we use to manage patients with gouty arthritis have been in existence since the 1970s and 1980s. In the past few years, because of the improved physiological understanding of gout, new innovative treatments such as anti-IL inhibitors, a nonxanthine oxidase inhibitor and the uricase enzymes have been developed adding to our armamentarium of drugs.

Summary

With the introduction of new research, we have been able to explore how to also use established treatments more effectively, raising the profile of gout and its best management and introducing the principle of treating the patient to urate target.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^112N9Jrm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Treating to target: a strategy to cure gout [^114Pzu3i]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

Despite exciting progress in the understanding and treatment of gout, management of this condition remains suboptimal. In the face of this inadequacy, new guidelines provide recommendations both for therapeutic approaches to hyperuricaemia and for the management and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthropathy, and is associated with excruciating pain, major impairment of quality of life, and increased risk of comorbidities and mortality. Although gout has somehow been neglected by researchers and clinicians in the past, in more recent times there has been a renewed interest in this disease, which has led to major improvements in its management. This article reviews the new clinical and experimental evidence about gout that emerged in 2017 and in the first half of 2018.

Background

Gout is a prevalent disorder whose frequency is increasing worldwide. In addition to causing excruciating arthritic pain, gout is associated with premature death, classically explained by a high frequency of comorbidities, especially renal and cardiovascular diseases. Comorbidities must be considered in gout because they could contribute to the vital prognosis of gouty patients and they complicate gout management. These comorbidities are also frequently associated with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, an even more prevalent condition than gout, with their causal relationship with hyperuricaemia raising important therapeutic issues.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113jcmxe]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development (Fig. 1). The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires current or prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from MSU crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease, with episodic highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can have a substantial impact on an affected individual and the individual's family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurrent gout flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occurs frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high rate of complications. Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout –. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricaemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dose. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been questioned.

Introduction

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, manifesting as acute flares of severe joint pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in one or more joints, which can progress to chronic destructive arthropathy. The prevalence of gout is higher in males than females, and increases with age. Although a high serum urate concentration is the most important risk factor for the development of gout, genetic factors have a strong influence on the occurrence of gout, and a range of risk factors, such as medications, comorbidities, and environmental exposures, are also implicated. Many factors that contribute to hyperuricaemia are also risk factors for incident gout, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease, factors commonly seen in younger people with gout. Gout has been associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal comorbidities.

Effective management strategies for gout include treatment of the acute flares and ameliorating the long-term consequences that contribute to disability. Current recommendations for managing acute flares include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or glucocorticoids. To prevent recurrent gout flares, the primary goal is to reduce serum urate concentrations, and lifelong administration of urate-lowering drugs is crucial. Lifestyle modifications (eg, bodyweight loss) and educational programmes focusing on dietary improvement could also be useful for long-term prevention of episodes or flares in people with gout.

Gout can lead to reduced mobility and impaired physical function, contributing to work absenteeism. In addition to its physical impacts, gout imposes an economic cost on those with the condition, with costs rising with increasing serum urate concentrations and the number of flares. Untreated gout places a substantial burden on the global health system, as chronic gout causes tophi formation, chronic joint pain, and erosion and damage to joints, resulting in an increase in morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Furthermore, despite advances in the treatment of gout, it is still underdiagnosed and undertreated, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and comorbidities. Therefore, quantifying the burden and pattern of gout cases by age and sex, as well as making projections for the future, are necessary to efficiently target the current and future needs of the population. We aimed to report the global, regional, and national burden and trends associated with gout and the burden attributed to risk factors, in terms of prevalence and age-standardised rates, from 1990 to 2020, as well as projections up to 2050.

### Urate-lowering treatment and risk of total joint replacement in patients with gout [^116TdMpu]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Currently there are no explicit evidence-based recommendations concerning when in the clinical course of gout patients should be considered for ULT. Current trends increasingly favour early intervention with ULT, even around the time of first diagnosis, to prevent further crystal deposition and long-term complications such as subcutaneous tophi and joint damage, rather than waiting until these have occurred. This is indirectly supported by previous studies showing frequent attacks in untreated patients and a high prevalence of associated co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease and urolithiasis. Our previous study using UK CPRD data found that many co-morbidities, including OA, are more frequently observed in patients at the time of diagnosis of gout compared with matched people without gout, indicating that damage occurred earlier than clinically apparent gout. The current study further demonstrates that such existing joint damage may already be irreversible at diagnosis. An alternative explanation for the lack of effect of ULT in reducing the risk of TJR is that many people prescribed ULT are not 'treated to target' by up-titration of ULT against serial serum urate levels until a target level below the saturation point for MSU crystal formation is reached. More studies are needed to ascertain the possible beneficial effects of ULT prescribed according to individualized 'treat-to-target' recommendations to prevent joint damage in asymptomatic people with hyperuricaemia.

### CaseBook challenges: managing gout, hyperuricemia and comorbidities – dialogue with the experts [^115ZpRbx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia are on the rise in the United States corresponding with an increase in risk factors for these conditions, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the use of diuretics. A progressive disorder, untreated gout can be debilitating and result in tophi, chronic arthropathy, and recurrent kidney stones. Although joint aspiration is needed for a definitive diagnosis, the majority of patients are diagnosed presumptively based on medical history and presentation with characteristic signs and symptoms. Patients with gout also often have multiple comorbidities, and there is an increasing body of evidence that shows hyperuricemia is associated with incidence hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Clinical strategies for the management of gout and hyperuricemia must include considerations for these and other common cardiometabolic and renal conditions. In addition to acute flare therapy and prophylaxis, the treatment of gout involves lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels with the urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) allopurinol or febuxostat. Once begun, treatment with ULT is lifelong. However, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology stress tailoring therapy and target SUA level (traditionally < 6 mg/dL, but lower levels may be needed for certain patients) based on gout severity and the presence of comorbid conditions. Because painful acute gout flares may result in trips to the emergency department and because the majority of gout cases are managed in primary care, it is important for clinicians practicing in these settings to be able to diagnose and treat this condition and communicate with patients to improve their understanding of the disease process and adherence to treatment.

### Global, regional, and national burden of gout, 1990–2020, and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^1147sG2n]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are beneficial in the treatment of acute gout flares, ongoing prevention of recurring gout can be achieved by lowering uric acid through the use of urate lowering therapy, in addition to low-dose anti-inflammatory medications. There is evidence to support a treat-to-target approach for lowering serum urate, which can suppress gout flares and prevent joint and other end organ damage in the long term by reducing the total body load of urate tissue deposits. However, it has been reported that suboptimal treatment of gout occurs in many countries, with only a third to half of patients with gout receiving urate-lowering therapy, and fewer than half of patients adhering to the long-term treatment that is needed. Suboptimal treatment might lead to unnecessary development of disabling erosive gout. One of the most important strategies to reduce the ongoing burden of gout is improving education around adherence to treatment. The ability to do this is likely to vary across regions and might contribute to the differences seen across regions.

Our forecasts showed that the prevalence of gout is estimated to be up to 96 million in 2050. Unfortunately, these forecasts cannot yet be based on forecasted rates of risk factors including high BMI and kidney dysfunction, and SDI has been taken as a proxy in the forecasting process. It is known that global rates of overweight and obesity are increasing, so the actual forecasted prevalence rate could be higher if the increase in obesity is greater than the increase in SDI. The impact of COVID-19 on forecast estimates for gout is also not yet known. As with many other conditions, maintaining a healthy bodyweight could reduce the prevalence of gout, in addition to controlling the underlying conditions for the development of kidney impairment, such as hypertension and diabetes. Designing programmes for the early detection and treatment of kidney diseases can prevent further complications.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^116Z3X1U]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute gout arthritis flares contribute dominantly to gout-specific impaired health-related quality of life, representing a progressively increasing public health problem. Flares can be complex and expensive to treat, partly due to the frequent comorbidities. Unmet needs in gout management are more pressing given the markedly increasing gout flare hospital admission rates. In addition, chronic gouty arthritis can cause joint damage and functional impairment. This review addresses new knowledge on the basis for the marked, inherent variability of responses to deposited urate crystals, including the unpredictable and self-limited aspects of many gout flares. Specific topics reviewed include how innate immunity and two-signal inflammasome activation intersect with diet, metabolism, nutritional biosensing, the microbiome, and the phagocyte cytoskeleton and cell fate. The paper discusses the roles of endogenous constitutive regulators of inflammation, including certain nutritional biosensors, and emerging genetic and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in the basis of variability in responses to urate crystals in gout provide information about inflammatory arthritis, and have identified potential new targets and strategies for anti-inflammatory prevention and treatment of gouty arthritis.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^114ZXim5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults in the Western world. Characterized by hyperuricemia and the effects of acute and chronic inflammation in joints and bursa, gout leads to an agonizing, chronically painful arthritis. Arthritis can also be accompanied by urate nephropathy and subcutaneous urate deposits (tophi). Exciting new developments in the last decade have brought back the focus on this interesting, crystal-induced chronic inflammatory condition. New insights include the role of NALP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation in acute gout, the characterization of diagnostic signs on ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography imaging modalities, the recognition of target serum urate less than 6 mg/day as the goal for urate-lowering therapies, and evidence-based treatment guidelines. A better understanding of disease mechanisms has enabled drug discovery - three new urate-lowering drugs have been approved in the last decade, with several more in the pipeline. We now recognize the important role that environment and genetics play in the causation of gout. A focus on the cardiac, renal, and metabolic comorbidities of gout will help translational research and discovery over the next decade.

The comorbidities of gout and hyperuricemia

The association of gout with comorbidities has long been known. In the US National Health and Nutrition Survey 2007–8, 74% and 71% of patients with gout reported a physician diagnosis of hypertension and chronic kidney disease stage 2 or higher. Diabetes and nephrolithiasis are common comorbidities in patients with gout, with a prevalence of approximately 25%, and heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke are also commonly observed. New data now emerging indicate the potential benefit of lowering sUA on non-arthritic comorbidity load in gout. Many have speculated on the cardiovascular benefits of sUA lowering, but interest in its reno-protective effect is also emerging. An ongoing $24.3 million NIH-funded study will compare allopurinol to placebo in delaying or preventing early nephropathy in type 1 diabetics without gout. Other studies assessing benefits of sUA lowering in patients with hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease stage 3 are also underway.

Future directions

The future of gout is bright. The pipeline for discovery looks very promising for new therapies for acute gout and urate lowering. Personalized medicine for gout may be just around the corner, as our understanding of the role of genetics and environment improves. While our knowledge of disease mechanisms in gout has improved dramatically, the quality of care remains suboptimal and under-treatment is common. I see an excellent future for the disease if efforts within the next decade are focused on a three-pronged approach encompassing (1) the appropriate use of existing effective therapies with allopurinol as the key example, as well as others; (2) novel discovery and approval of new medications for acute gout and long-term urate-lowering; and (3) a better understanding of the role hyperuricemia and chronic inflammation play in the occurrence of cardiac, renal, and metabolic comorbidities of gout in order to effectively improve the capacity to prevent and treat these comorbidities.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^1123eTwD]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout, the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis worldwide, is associated with cardiovascular and renal diseases, and is an independent predictor of premature death. The frequencies of obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemias, cardiac diseases (including coronary heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation), stroke and peripheral arterial disease have been repeatedly shown to be increased in gout. Therefore, the screening and care of these comorbidities as well as of cardiovascular risk factors are of outmost importance in patients with gout. Comorbidities, especially CKD, and drugs prescribed for their treatment, also impact gout management. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown the association of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia with the above-mentioned diseases and cardiovascular risk factors. Animal studies have also produced a mechanistic approach to the vascular toxicity of soluble urate. However, causality remains uncertain because confounders, reverse causality or common etiological factors might explain the epidemiological results. Additionally, these uncertainties remain unsolved despite recent studies using Mendelian randomisation or therapeutic approaches. Thus, large randomised placebo-controlled trials are still needed to assess the benefits of treating asymptomatic hyperuricaemia.

Stages of gout.

Gout progresses through several classic disease stages and corresponding clinical manifestations. In some cases, advanced disease stages and complications can appear prematurely, without earlier disease stages or clinical manifestations being apparent (for example, tophaceous gout without prior gout flares), although this pattern is uncommon. MSU, monosodium urate. Adapted from ref. Springer Nature Limited.

Care for people with gout and CKD presents important challenges. For instance, the clinical presentation of gout in this high-risk, comorbid population is variable, with a higher frequency of atypical presentations than in those without CKD. However, quality evidence to guide the management of gout in people with CKD is lacking, owing at least in part to the exclusion of people with CKD from trials of gout therapies, failure to report results stratified by renal function and inconsistencies in the outcome measures used and reported. The resultant knowledge gaps have contributed to concerns regarding gout treatment efficacy and safety, some of which are legitimate and others questionable. The use of ULT in the context of advanced CKD varies greatly among rheumatologists, nephrologists and generalists, and professional bodies have issued conflicting recommendations regarding the treatment of gout in people with concomitant CKD. These inconsistencies frequently result in confusion and, consequently, suboptimal gout management with failure to achieve recommended target urate levels. Moreover, pharmacological options for treating gout flares and lowering urate concentrations are often restricted by physicians, other health-care professionals (such as pharmacists) and patients who have appropriate concerns and/or misconceptions about drug toxicity or the need to adjust medication doses. As a result, outcomes in people with gout and CKD are commonly poor(Fig. 2).

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable? [^112G6FKY]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gouty arthritis is a major and increasing public health problem given the substantial rise in gout prevalence over the last two decades. Acute gout flares are the major contributor to gout-specific impaired health-related quality of life. In this context, flares can be complex and expensive to treat, partly due to the commonly associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes, and to frequent contraindications to one or more of the standard oral anti-inflammatory therapy options for gout (i.e. NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids). Moreover, responses to these oral agents often take at least 12–24 hours to be robust, and can take from several days to a week to be complete. Importantly, there has been a marked, progressive increase in hospitalizations due to gout flares over the last two decades, in stark contrast to the data for decreased hospitalizations specifically for poorly controlled flares of rheumatoid arthritis. The capacity of chronic gouty arthritis to cause joint damage and functional impairment further adds to the societal and financial impact of the disease.

The pathogenesis of gouty inflammation is relatively well understood. It is known that urate crystals promote cleavage of C5 on their surface, catalyzing the generation of C5a and C5b-9 involved in gouty inflammation. There is also extensive knowledge of how the crystals activate phagocytes, the role of inflammation signaling and transcription factors, including mitogen activated protein kinases and AP-1, the role of the master transcriptional regulator NF-κB, and on the activation of the NACHT-LRR-PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, with consequent IL-1β maturation and secretion. Many other urate crystal-induced inflammatory mediators are well characterized, including multiple prostaglandins, several leukotrienes (e.g. leukotriene B4), and a host of cytokines, including IL-8 and many other chemokines, IL-6, and TNF-α. Other noteworthy background observations include the late dampening effects of TGF-β in experimental acute gout. This review focuses on the most recent research, which sheds new light on why human host responses to tissue deposits of urate crystals in gout are so variable in intensity, change in frequency between seasons, are so often unpredictable in onset, and are characteristically self-limited. The rapidly emerging research in this area points to multiple new targets and strategies for the unmet needs in the optimal prevention and treatment of gouty arthritis, as well as providing valuable lessons about innate immunity in rheumatic disease in general.

### Management and cure of gouty arthritis [^115Upk21]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States. Gouty arthritis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the result of chronic hyperuricemia. Gout is effectively managed and potentially cured by decreasing the overall urate burden with serum urate-lowering therapy. When serum urate is maintained at less than 6.0 mg/dL, urate deposition is resolved, and gout can be cured. Unfortunately, because of less than optimal physician monitoring and dose escalation, many patients do not achieve these urate levels.

### Epidemiology of crystal arthropathy [^115AqPU3]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis mediated by the crystallization of uric acid within the joints and often is associated with hyperuricemia. Data suggest that the overall disease burden of gout remains substantial and may be increasing. Identifying and characterizing modifiable risk factors for gout is a major step in preventing and managing this painful condition. As more scientific data on the risk factors and comorbidities of gout become available, their integration into gout prevention and care strategies may become essential. This article reviews the relevant epidemiologic data, with a focus on recent progress and data on other crystal arthropathies.

### Interventions for tophi in gout [^115RUWgX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Tophi develop in untreated or uncontrolled gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of non-surgical and surgical treatments for the management of tophi in gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase databases to 28 August 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials examining interventions for tophi in gout in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one trial in our original review. We added four more trials (1796 participants) in this update. One had three arms; pegloticase infusion every two weeks (biweekly), monthly pegloticase infusion (pegloticase infusion alternating with placebo infusion every two weeks) and placebo. Two studies looked at lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with allopurinol. One trial studied lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with febuxostat. One trial compared febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg to allopurinol. Two trials were at unclear risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of information on blinding of participants and personnel. All other trials were at low risk of bias. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision; one study; 79 participants) showed that biweekly pegloticase resolved tophi in 21/52 participants compared with 2/27 on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 5.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 21.54; number needed to treat for a benefit (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 6). Similar proportions of participants receiving biweekly pegloticase (80/85) had an adverse event compared to placebo (41/43) (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07). However, more participants on biweekly pegloticase (15/85) withdrew due to an adverse event compared to placebo (1/43) (RR 7.59, 95% CI 1.04 to 55.55; number needed to treat for a harm (NNTH) 7, 95% CI 4 to 16). More participants on monthly pegloticase (11/52) showed complete resolution of tophi compared with placebo (2/27) (RR 2.86, 95% CI 0.68 to 11.97; NNTB 8, 95% CI 4 to 91). Similar numbers of participants on monthly pegloticase (84/84) had an adverse event compared to placebo (41/43) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14). More participants on monthly pegloticase (16/84) withdrew due to adverse events compared to placebo (1/43) (RR 8.19, 95% CI 1.12 to 59.71; NNTH 6, 95% CI 4 to 14). Infusion reaction was the most common reason for withdrawal. Moderate-certainty evidence (2 studies; 103 participants; downgraded for imprecision) showed no clinically significant difference for complete resolution of target tophus in the lesinurad 200 mg plus allopurinol arm (11/53) compared to the placebo plus allopurinol arm (16/50) (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.04 to 4.57), or in the lesinurad 400 mg plus allopurinol arm (12/48) compared to the placebo plus allopurinol arm (16/50) (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.49). An extension study examined lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with febuxostat, or placebo (low-certainty evidence, downgraded for indirectness and imprecision). Participants on lesinurad in the original study continued (CONT) on the same dose. Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat may be beneficial for tophi resolution; 43/65 in the lesinurad 400 mg CONT arm compared to 38/64 in the lesinurad 200 mg CONT arm had tophi resolution (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.46). Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat may result in no difference in adverse events; 57/65 in the lesinurad 400 mg CONT arm had an adverse event compared to 50/64 in lesinurad 200 mg CONT arm (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.32). Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events; 10/65 participants in the lesinurad 400 mg CONT arm withdrew due to an adverse event compared to 10/64 participants in the lesinurad 200 mg CONT arm (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.20). Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat may result in no difference in mean serum uric acid (sUA), which was 3 mg/dl in the lesinurad 400 mg CONT group compared to 3.9 mg/dl in the lesinurad 200 mg CONT group (mean difference -0.90, 95% CI -1.51 to -0.29). Participants who were not on lesinurad in the original study were randomised (CROSS) to lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg, both in combination with febuxostat. Low-certainty evidence downgraded for indirectness and imprecision showed that lesinurad 400 mg (CROSS) may result in tophi resolution (17/34) compared to lesinurad 200 mg (CROSS) (14/33) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.98). Lesinurad 400 mg in combination with febuxostat may result in no difference in adverse events (33/34 in the lesinurad 400 mg CROSS arm compared to 27/33 in the lesinurad 200 mg (CROSS); RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41). Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat may result in no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events, 5/34 in the lesinurad 400 mg CROSS arm withdrew compared to 2/33 in the lesinurad 200 mg CROSS arm (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 11.64). Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat results in no difference in sUA (4.2 mg/dl in lesinurad 400 mg CROSS) compared to lesinurad 200 mg (3.8 mg/dl in lesinurad 200 mg CROSS), mean difference 0.40 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.75 to 1.55.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence showed that pegloticase is probably beneficial for resolution of tophi in gout. Although there was little difference in adverse events when compared to placebo, participants on pegloticase had more withdrawals due to adverse events. Lesinurad 400 mg plus febuxostat may be beneficial for tophi resolution compared with lesinurad 200 mg plus febuxostat; there was no difference in adverse events between these groups. We were unable to determine whether lesinurad plus febuxostat is more effective than placebo. Lesinurad (400 mg or 200 mg) plus allopurinol is probably not beneficial for tophi resolution, and there was no difference in adverse events between these groups. RCTs on interventions for managing tophi in gout are needed, and the lack of trial data is surprising given that allopurinol is a well-established treatment for gout.

### Gout: state of the art after a decade of developments [^117SUop2]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^111JghgA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

Recent Findings

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^1174vhHc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Gout is an increasingly common condition in the United States and often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. The benchmark for diagnosis is joint aspiration revealing uric acid crystals. Gout flares must be differentiated from septic arthritis and may be concurrently infected. The main treatment for acute and chronic gout is medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels, but surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. In addition, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities should be considered. Finally, it is important for surgeons to collaborate with rheumatologists for perioperative management.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gout, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend to establish a clinical diagnosis of gout, if synovial fluid analysis is not feasible, by the following highly suggestive (but not specific) features:

- male gender

- monoarticular involvement of a foot (especially the first metatarsophalangeal) or ankle joint

- previous similar acute arthritis episodes

- rapid onset of severe pain and swelling (at its worst in < 24 hours)

- erythema

- hyperuricemia

- associated CVDs.

### Gout, hyperuricaemia and crystal-associated disease network (G-CAN) common language definition of gout [^112sWfyx]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

Hyperuricaemia and deposition of monosodium urate crystals are the key pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the development of gout. Disease stages include asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, asymptomatic deposition of monosodium urate crystals, monosodium urate crystal deposition with gout flares and intercritical gout, and usually later in the disease course (in the absence of urate-lowering therapy), chronic gouty arthritis, tophus deposition and gouty bone erosion.

Urate is produced mainly in the liver and intestinal cells. About two-thirds is excreted by the kidneys and the remainder in the gut. When the level of urate is above the saturation point of 6.8 mg/dL (408 μmol/L), monosodium urate crystals form at pH 7.0 and temperature 37°C.

A gout flare arises when immune cells interact with the monosodium urate crystals, triggering an episode of acute inflammation. The release of the cytokine interleukin (IL) — 1β by immune cells is particularly important in driving inflammation in the gout flare. Many other proinflammatory mediators also contribute to the gout flare.

Gout is characterised by repeated gout flares with intercritical periods during which the patient is asymptomatic but remains hyperuricaemic with risk of further gout flares. Monosodium urate crystals can be found in the synovial fluid during the intercritical period. If the hyperuricaemia responsible for gout is untreated, subcutaneous tophi can develop; these nodules are discrete collection of monosodium urate crystals with associated tissue response. Tophi can lead to bone erosion and cartilage damage.

### Dual-energy CT as a potential new diagnostic tool in the management of gout in the acute setting [^111VqppV]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Gout is the most common crystal deposition arthropathy currently diagnosed clinically and with arthrocentesis. Dual-energy CT is a promising new imaging technique offering potential new applications in a number of clinical areas.

Conclusion

The ability of dual-energy CT to diagnose early gout and its use as a problem-solving tool is shown here. Diagnosis of subclinical gout could avert associated long-term complications, thereby reducing disease burden and improving overall quality of life.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^116LYEr1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Gout is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in patients with chronically elevated blood levels of uric acid. It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in the United States and is often comorbid with hypertension, obesity, and chronic kidney disease. Initial presentation is usually an acutely warm, swollen joint, most commonly the first metatarsophalangeal joint, but a variety of locations may be affected. The main treatment for gout is medical management of acute inflammation and chronic uric acid levels, but surgical treatment may be indicated in cases of damage to the surrounding soft tissue, concomitant septic arthritis, symptomatic cartilage loss, or neurologic deficits. Based on the literature to date, gout does not seem to independently affect outcomes after total hip, knee, and ankle arthroplasty, but associated comorbidities affecting outcomes in these patients should be considered.

### Serum uric acid and the risk of cardiovascular and renal disease [^113PGPNG]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Substantial evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for hypertension, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases. This highlights the need for greater attention to serum uric acid levels when profiling patients, and suggests that the threshold above which uricemia is considered abnormal is 6 mg/dl, in light of the available evidence. Another important question is whether lowering serum uric acid can improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and what therapeutic mechanism of action could provide more clinical benefits to patients; the available literature shows a trend toward improvement associated with administration of urate-lowering drugs, in particular for the xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The demonstrated efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on outcomes other than gout flares leads to the consideration that treatment may be beneficial even in the absence of overt gout when hyperuricemia accompanies other clinical conditions, such as urate deposition, advanced CKD or cardiovascular risk factors.

### Gout and its comorbidities: implications for therapy [^115MSf35]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Gout is a common form of arthritis. It is associated with a number of comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidaemia and frequently in a combination known as the metabolic syndrome. These comorbidities and their treatment may have an effect on the development of gout and on the choice of therapeutic agent. Treatment of acute gout with short-term corticosteroids may be a safer option than either NSAIDs or colchicine in patients with significant renal and/or cardiac impairment. Sustained reduction of serum urate < 0.36 mmol/l is required for long-term management of gout. The optimal dosing regimen for patients with renal impairment is the subject of on-going investigation. There is less experience with newer urate-lowering therapies. This review will consider the relationship between comorbidities and gout with a particular focus on the treatment of gout and the potential interactions between drugs used for gout and those for comorbid conditions.

### Gout: a clinical and radiologic review [^117Cd29C]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Gout is a group of diseases characterized by arthritis and results from a disturbance of urate metabolism with the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues. Often, but not invariably, the serum urate levels are elevated as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Clinical manifestations include acute and chronic arthritis, tophaceous deposits, interstitial renal disease, and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis is based on the identification of uric acid crystals in joints, tissues, or body fluids. Acute episodes are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids. Long-term management includes treatment with uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Ulcerated tophaceous gout [^115ouMVs]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterised by hyperuricemia, which, if poorly controlled, can lead to the development of tophi. We report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian man with poorly controlled polyarticular tophaceous gout with multiple comorbidities (including renal failure) who presented with tophaceous ulcers of the upper extremity. These ulcers caused extreme pain, requiring chronic opiate medications, and were associated with decreased sensation and reduced ability to move the extremity. His hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury, haemolytic anaemia and Clostridium difficile infection. He required 1 month of antibiotics and intensive wound care for his ulcers. This case highlights the diagnosis, natural history and management of an unusual complication of hyperuricemia.

### Controversies and practical management of patients with gout and chronic kidney disease [^111mN48c]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Uric acid is a toxin retained with advancing kidney disease. Clinical manifestations of hyperuricemia include gout and systemic inflammation that are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. As many as one-third of all patients with chronic kidney disease have a history of gout, yet < 25% of these patients are effectively treated to target serum urate levels of ≤ 6 mg/dl. A major reason for ineffective management of gout and hyperuricemia is the complexity in managing these patients, with some medications contraindicated and others requiring special dosing, potential drug interactions, and other factors. Consequently, many nephrologists do not primarily manage gout despite it being a common complication of chronic kidney disease, leaving management to the primary physician or rheumatologist. We believe that kidney specialists should consider gout as a major complication of chronic kidney disease and actively manage it in their patients. Here, we present insights from nephrologists and rheumatologists for a team approach to gout management that includes the nephrologist.

### Gout: an update [^117YHQA5]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout [^115WakYP]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout has been academically considered to be a step-up disease consisting of different stages: acute gout, intercritical gout, and chronic gout. This simple approach may lead to misinterpretation and misdiagnosis. In clinical practice, we should consider gout as a single disease with either or both acute (most commonly, episodes of acute inflammation) and persistent clinical manifestations, but not restricted to chronic synovitis. In this article, an innovative, practical, and rational approach to the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout is presented, which may be supportive for clinicians involved in everyday care and management of patients with gout.

The incidence of gout has increased steadily over the last decades and its management is still unsatisfactory. Growing evidence highlights the multifactorial etiology of this disease encompassing genetic predisposition, environmental stimuli and gut dysbiosis. Recent advances in biomolecular and computer sciences allowed to gain more and more genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomics and metabolomics insights into hyperuricaemia and gout-related molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the interplay between gout and cardiovascular, metabolic and renal diseases may potentially offer novel targets for anti-inflammatory and urate-lowering therapies. This annual review aims to provide the latest updates on gout research, epidemiology, genetics, molecular mechanisms, diagnostic approach, and therapeutic advances.

### Definition of hyperuricemia and gouty conditions [^111a5A28]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of The Review

To define gout conditions and hyperuricemia.

Recent Findings

Gout is defined as an arthritic condition resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in and/or around joints, following long-standing hyperuricemia. Several recent ultrasound studies disclosed MSU deposits in a large proportion of asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients. A gout condition defined by asymptomatic MSU deposits can therefore be individualized. Such asymptomatic deposits appear to precede the occurrence of flares, which seem to be triggered by mobilization of preformed crystals. Hyperuricemia appears to be the main, if not the only, risk factor for gout. Recent studies also support the view that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for renal and cardiovascular diseases. The level at which uricemia becomes abnormal is still disputed. This lack of consensus precludes comparison of studies using different definitions and impairs the understanding of gout by doctors and patients. We propose to define hyperuricemia as greater than 6mg/dl, as the life-long risk of gout seems to start at this level. This definition is identical to the minimum uricemia target of urate-lowering drugs (ULDs).

Summary

Asymptomatic MSU crystals deposits can now be identified and precede the onset of gout flares. Defining hyperuricemia as greater than 6mg/dl would have the advantage to give the same value for normal and ULD-targeted uricemia, which would facilitate patients' adherence to this target.

### Computational lexical analysis of the language commonly used to describe gout [^117CQk69]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

What should we call this disease that so long ago was called "the gout that is called podagra or arthritis"? Several of us had made a point in our writings over the past 5 to 10 years to refer to it as gouty arthritis. Our thinking was that gout is first and foremost an inflammatory arthritis, a basic fact that is lost on most patients with gout. Calling this disease gouty arthritis would formalize this connection and possibly make the painful process more readily understood by patients and health care providers alike. That terminology, however, misses the point that gout is, at its very essence, a metabolic disease of enhanced urate burden with pathologic consequences. Recent advances in imaging have demonstrated sodium urate deposition in joints and periarticular structures long before gout is clinically apparent. This pre‐clinical period may be associated with the same low‐grade inflammation and articular damage (destruction) that we know exists during the intercritical periods of clinical gout. Other consequences of urate deposition may include hypertension and renal and cardiovascular disease. With this understanding, we feel the more generic term gout is preferable to the more restrictive term gouty arthritis.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^1174ieho]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Renal and cardiovascular comorbidities are frequent in patients with gout and play an important role in the premature mortality observed in the disease. Patients with gout should therefore be systematically screened for renovascular diseases and risk factors, which should be addressed as an important part of gout management. Comorbidities, especially renal disease, and drugs prescribed for their management should be considered during the choice of drugs to be used in the treatment of gouty inflammation and for urate lowering. Finally, whereas an impressive number of epidemiological data have shown the association of renal and cardiovascular diseases with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, causality remains uncertain, and large RCTs are still needed to assess the cardiovascular and renal benefits of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia treatment.

### Long-term management of gout: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies [^115uANby]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is a common disorder with clinical signs and symptoms resulting from inflammatory responses to monosodium urate crystals deposited in tissues from extracellular fluids saturated for urate. Long-term management of gout focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic means to achieve and maintain serum urate levels in a subsaturating range. Despite a firm understanding of gout pathophysiology, means to achieve certain diagnosis, and a variety of effective therapies, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. In this review, available nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies for chronic gout are discussed and a framework is provided for successful achievement and maintenance of goal-range serum urate levels.

### Gout [^111wMtrC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gout:

- Definition: Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues.
- Pathophysiology: Gout is due to persistently elevated blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia), which is often multifactorial (increased intake of purine-rich foods, defects in purine metabolism, older age, male sex, obesity, renal failure, diuretics).
- Epidemiology: In the US, the prevalence of gout is estimated at 3,900 persons per 100,000 population. The incidence of gout is estimated at 400 per 100,000 person-years in men, and 140 per 100,000 person-years in women.
- Disease course: In patients with acute gout, deposition of urate monohydrate crystals inside joint cavities initiate an inflammatory response that results in the clinical manifestations of arthritis. Chronic synovitis, bony erosions, cartilage damage, and tophi formation may occur in patients with chronic gout.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The 1-year recurrence rate for acute gout attack in patients who have experienced an attack in the past year is estimated at 69%.

Gout is a chronic joint disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals into and around the articular tissues. In the last two years, new insights regarding diagnosis, genetic involvement, pathogenesis, comorbidities, and clinical data, have allowed the identification of new strategies to improve the control of the disease and its flares. In keeping, the discover of new mechanisms concerning crystal-induced inflammation have suggested new ways for the management not only of gout, but also other systemic diseases, mainly including renal and cardiovascular disorders.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Gout [^114goZD1]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.

### Gout: a review of nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors [^115r8k7Z]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis triggered by the crystallization of uric acid within the joints. Gout affects millions worldwide and has an increasing prevalence. Recent research has been carried out to better qualify and quantify the risk factors predisposing individuals to gout. These can largely be broken into nonmodifiable risk factors, such as gender, age, race, and genetics, and modifiable risk factors, such as diet and lifestyle. Increasing knowledge of factors predisposing certain individuals to gout could potentially lead to improved preventive practices. This review summarizes the nonmodifiable and modifiable risk factors associated with development of gout.

### Retrospective evaluation of the Dutch pre-newborn screening cohort for propionic acidemia and isolated methylmalonic acidemia: what to aim, expect, and evaluate from newborn screening? [^112sDkdi]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

In NBS cohorts, patients in whom the disease is mild and who would not become symptomatic during infancy, could be detected as has been reported in Japan, where a 10 times higher incidence of PA was found during preparatory studies for NBS implementation. 21 These mildly affected patients will probably be treated according to the current treatment guidelines, 19 inducing a risk for developing treatment‐related complications. One could advocate that these patients should not be treated in order to prevent treatment‐related complications. However, in our cohort, two PA patients presented at 48 and 56 years of age with cardiomyopathy as first presenting symptom, 22 indicating that even in very mild, untreated patients, mitochondrial complications can still occur. It is presently unknown whether earlier initiation of adequate treatment could have prevented this complication. Even if this would alter the clinical course, it is questionable whether these patients should be exposed to life‐long protein restriction, to prevent complications occurring well into adulthood. We consider overtreatment of mildly affected patients, which might or might not develop late complications, 21, 22 a serious risk of NBS.

4.3 Lessons learned from the pre‐NBS cohort, to guide follow‐up of NBS cohorts

We demonstrated that mitochondrial complications with acute onset can already develop before monitoring should be initiated according to recent guidelines 19 and we thus propose to adapt these guidelines. Specifically, we suggest to assess renal function in patients with MUT and MMAB type MMA from 1 year of age, to regularly check QTc intervals in PA and MMA patients starting at birth, and to maintain yearly cardiac ultrasounds and ophthalmologic assessments from 6 years onwards. Importantly, as we demonstrate that hepatomegaly is associated with the occurrence of other acute onset mitochondrial complications later in life, we advise to perform physical examination to check for hepatomegaly during every outpatient visit starting at birth, to be able to study the relevance of this finding. Lastly, we advocate awareness of all complications assessed in this cohort, including rarely described complications as exercise intolerance, acute psychosis, premature ovarian failure, pes planovalgus, gout, and urolithiasis.

### Why does the gout attack stop? A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gout [^112Ek9UC]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Pathogenesis of chronic tophaceous gout

One of the most intriguing observations in gout is that inflammation resolves quite rapidly despite the sustained presence of the triggering factor, namely MSU crystals. In contrast to other forms of inflammatory disease affecting the musculoskeletal system, such as rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthritis, the symptoms of an acute gout attack cease after a few days, suggesting that the body mounts effective mechanisms to stop inflammation. It needs to be mentioned that inflammation does not resolve because it effectively clears MSU crystal deposits and hence removes the triggering factor. In fact, the body manages to turn down inflammation despite the fact that MSU deposits are still present, which is a remarkable process. Imaging studies by dual-energy CT have impressively underlined this finding and have shown that profound MSU crystals deposits can be observed in articular and periarticular structures despite the absence of clinical signs of inflammation. Clinically, this stage of the disease is known as chronic tophaceous gout, which can be clinically silent for rather longer periods before a flare reoccurs.

### Effects of febuxostat in early gout: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115m3D5f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease characterized by monosodium urate crystal deposition 1, 2. Gout management guidelines recommend urate‐lowering therapy for subjects with frequent flares, typically at least 2 flares in the preceding year 3. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol or febuxostat are recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as first‐line urate‐lowering therapy for subjects with gout 3. The benefits and risks of urate‐lowering therapy for subjects with earlier disease are unknown. Recently, the conventional clinical treatment goal of achieving a significant reduction in the serum urate level has been brought into question by national guidelines that focused heavily on improvement of gout symptoms 4. Thus, there is considerable need for clinical trial data showing clear associations between a reduction in urate levels and less frequent gout flares, which we examined in this study.

While acute self‐limiting flares are the most common clinical presentation of gout, joint damage is a frequent complication 5. Both bone erosion and focal cartilage damage are closely associated with the presence of tophi within the joint 6, 7. Although joint damage is typically a late feature of long‐standing gout, longitudinal observational data have indicated that joint damage can occur in some subjects with early disease, and that development of bone erosion is associated with clinical evidence of increased urate crystal deposition 8.

In subjects with gout, the severity of joint damage can be evaluated by a number of different imaging techniques, including plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 2, 9. Scoring based on radiographic images is commonly used to analyze the severity and progression of structural damage, such as bone erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) 9. Compared with plain radiography, MRI provides increased sensitivity for assessing joint damage by detecting abnormalities in both bone and soft tissue 10. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of treatment with febuxostat compared with placebo over a 2‐year period in hyperuricemic subjects with early gout.

Additionally, although the patient's uric acid level was normal, at 5.3 mg/dL, at the time of presentation, it has been well documented that uric acid levels can be normal at the time of an attack of gout. A study of 339 patients with gout demonstrated a serum level less than 8.0 mg/dL in up to 32% of patients with an acute flare. Furthermore, the patient had previously had poorly controlled gout, with a uric acid of 9.4 mg/dL. Thus serum uric acid cannot be used as an indicator of the chronicity of these macular lesions.

### Reassessing serum urate targets in the management of refractory gout: can you go too low? [^111XoK6q]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Growing awareness of patients with refractory gout is prompting a reassessment of treatment strategy. This article reviews the current practice of targeting serum urate concentrations (sUA) in the mid-normal range (roughly 4–6 mg/dl) and considers the rationale for more aggressively lowering sUA in patients with poorly controlled chronic gout. Some hypothetical concerns with inducing hypouricemia are considered and relevant clinical evidence is evaluated.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm the benefits of modestly reducing sUA in many gout patients. However, tophi and tissue stores of monosodium urate crystals resolve slowly, particularly in patients with longstanding disease. Consistent with physicochemical principles, the rate of decrease in tophus size increases with a reduction in sUA concentration over a broad range. Reducing sUA to near or below 2 mg/dl can be achieved in some patients with current urate-lowering drugs, but new drugs now under investigation may be more effective. As a free radical scavenger, uric acid has been postulated to protect from oxidative stress. However, inherited disorders associated with profound, lifelong hypouricemia indicate that maintaining sUA near or below 2 mg/dl would probably be safe.

Summary

Targeting low sUA could improve the elimination of tissue urate stores and achieve better control of disease in patients with refractory gout.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^112KHqaY]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Issues with studies of gout and CKD

Two important areas of concern were identified with respect to studies of gout and CKD: issues related to the natural history of gout in people with CKD and generic study-related issues.

General research areas

Several issues related to the natural history of gout in people with CKD were identified as general areas for research (summarized in Box 1). As mentioned above, data on the natural history of gout (Fig. 1) are scarce but the application of modern imaging techniques, such as dual-energy CT, has led to the recognition of a pre-symptomatic phase of gout in some individuals in whom MSU crystal deposition occurs in joints, soft tissues and vascular sites before the first gout flare (asymptomatic MSU crystal deposition). Whether this pre-symptomatic phase is more common in people with CKD in whom the inflammatory response to crystals might be suppressed remains unknown, as does the timing of progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic gout in people with CKD.

Other questions to be addressed concern prediction of the disease course and the need for ULT in those with gout and CKD. The question of whether ULT is required could be an even more important issue in individuals potentially at increased risk of adverse events associated with therapy, such as those with CKD. An increased risk of mortality in people with gout, typically from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, has been reported in association with the presence of subcutaneous tophi and high serum urate concentrations, but not with renal insufficiency. Whether urate lowering in people with gout and CKD alters mortality was not considered as part of the literature reviews and this consensus statement.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^116e2Wc6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in patients with chronically elevated uric acid levels. The term gout comes from the Latin gutta (drop), which is thought to relate to the concept of an imbalance of humors flowing into a joint. This condition affects approximately 4% of the adult population in the United States and has a variety of associated risk factors including certain medications, dietary factors, and medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, obesity, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and lead exposure.

Acute manifestations of gout include a painful, swollen joint that can either be mistaken for septic arthritis or concurrently infected, whereas chronic tophaceous deposits can cause periarticular bony erosions and damage to surrounding nerves and tendons. Orthopaedic surgeons are likely to encounter both acute and chronic gout over the course of their careers. This article will review the pathophysiology and medical treatment of gout and surgical treatment of gout in the upper and lower extremity and spine.

### Development and first validation of a disease activity score for gout [^117NyzqD]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Disease activity is a challenging concept in gout. Based on the currently accepted model of the disease, high serum levels of urate lead to joint deposits of uric acid crystals, which may provoke acute arthritis. Acute inflammation resolves but eventually evolves into chronic arthropathy, with development of disability and impairment of quality of life.

Box 1
Significance & Innovations

An accurate measure of disease activity is an important component of appropriate and targeted treatment strategies, as well as of evaluation of new treatments.

Tissue deposits of uric acid (UA) are the best candidate to measure disease activity in gout because they reflect a still ongoing active disease process 1. Serum UA (sUA) approximates tissue levels well, and it is the main target of treatment in gout 2. The relevance of using sUA as the outcome measure in gout is strengthened by the consideration that drugs without influence on sUA do not have any plausible effect on the disease process 3. Furthermore, sUA levels associate with the risk of acute arthritis in a dose‐dependent manner, and their persistent control leads to a reduction of tissue deposits and risk of flare 4. However, sUA is only weakly associated with other relevant outcomes, such as disability and health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with gout 2.

### Gout [^1179RcH7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Gout is characterized by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in or around joints, tendons, bursae, and other tissues, resulting in painful recurrent flares and tissue damage. Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, with a prevalence of 5.1% in the United States, affecting 12.1 million adults. When urate levels exceed the limit of solubility (6.8 mg/dL [400 μmol/L]), MSU crystals may form or grow. Gout flares are the result of inflammatory responses to MSU crystals. The primary method to prevent and reduce gout flares, tophi, chronic inflammatory arthritis, and joint damage is to reduce urate levels below the saturation threshold. The pathophysiology of gout is well understood, and inexpensive and effective therapies are available. However, outcomes for patients with gout remain poorly optimized.

### Gout: rapid evidence review [^116EC67m]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and tissues. Risk factors include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; diuretic use; a diet rich in meat and seafood; chronic kidney disease; a diet heavy in fructose-rich food and beverages; being a member of certain ethnic groups, including Taiwanese, Pacific Islander, and New Zealand Maori; and living in high-income countries. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa, including the development of a tophus. Diagnosis of gout can be made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout episodes. Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flare-ups per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. Allopurinol and febuxostat are used to prevent flare-ups, although febuxostat is associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is therefore not routinely recommended.

### Limitations of the current standards of care for treating gout and crystal deposition in the primary care setting: a review [^112amyuu]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.

Methods

[PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), < 6 mg/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.

Findings

Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to < 6 mg/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.

Implications

Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also "curing" the disease.

### Unusual clinical presentations of gout [^117L13yS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The dogmatic description of gout is described as an inflammatory crystal-induced arthropathy that afflicts peripheral joints. This manuscript describes many recent cases and unusual clinical presentations of gout. Emphasis is placed on the ability of gout to cause diagnostic dilemmas that can impact patient treatment and care.

Recent Findings

Various genetic mutations can predispose patients in developing early onset gout. Environmental exposures, medications, and certain patient populations can affect pathophysiology of uric acid, predisposing patients both typical and atypical manifestations of gout. Numerous reports have described gout deposition in unusual parts of the body, which can mimic unrelated disease processes.

Summary

Although classic gout is still most commonly seen, the disease can manifest as with a wide array of presentations. It is likely that such atypical presentations are a result of a complexity of reasons. When presented with a diagnostic challenge in a patient with gout, the clinician should be aware of unusual manifestations of gout and consider it in the differential.

### Retinal complications of gout: a case report and review of the literature [^113PocxK]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There have been few reported findings of posterior segment complications of gout. While exudative lesions, an increased risk of macular degeneration, and vascular occlusions have been previously reported, to our knowledge, refractile macular lesions have not been reported in a patient with chronic uncontrolled gout.

Case Presentation

Highly refractile, crystal-like lesions were found in the macula of a 62 year old male patient with chronically uncontrolled gout. The lesions appeared at the termination of retinal arterioles and were located at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. The lesions did not stain with fluorescein and were associated with larger areas geographic atrophy. Review of the patient's blood tests revealed well-controlled vasculopathic risk factors. Fundus appearance and best-corrected visual acuity remained stable over 12 months of follow-up during which the uric acid levels were well controlled.

Conclusion

Retinopathy may be associated with chronically uncontrolled gout and patients with visual complaints should undergo a dilated examination in addition to the typical anterior segment slit-lamp exam.

Pathophysiology of Gout

The pathophysiology of gout can be divided into four stages: (1) hyperuricemia, (2) MSU crystal deposition without symptoms, (3) MSU crystal deposition with gout flare, and (4) chronic gout with tophi.

Hyperuricemia (> 6 mg/dL) occurs from overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Overproduction is caused by high cell turnover from conditions like psoriasis or myeloproliferative disorders, inherited enzyme abnormalities in the urate biosynthesis pathway, and high intake of purine-rich foods such as alcohol, red meat, seafood, and high fructose corn syrup. Underexcretion is caused by chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, diuretic use, and other medications and genetic abnormalities affecting urate transport in the kidneys and intestines.

Once hyperuricemia is present, some patients may form uric acid crystals. Peripheral joints with lower temperatures are more conducive to MSU crystal formation. Once intra-articular MSU crystals have formed, they interact with resident macrophages to cause an inflammatory response by activating neutrophils and the release of cytokines. Over time, MSU crystals are surrounded by granulomas to form a tophus that erodes into periarticular bone.

There are more than 10,000 articles in the literature published since 1999 that appear in a search of hyperuricemia and hypouricemia for vascular events. Systematic reviews were reviewed for this time frame, numbering approximately 300 articles in addition to more than 400 reports of randomized clinical trials published since 2017. In summary, the epidemiologic associations of hyperuricemia and hypouricemia with vascular disease are confounded by comorbid conditions. The interventional data are suggestive of a relationship of gout and vascular disease and to a lesser extent hyperuricemia and hypertension; however, more interventional studies are necessary to confirm these relationships.

### Crystal-induced arthropathies: recent investigative advances [^111rV3CM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight recent investigations that have stimulated renewed interest in crystal-induced arthropathies.

Recent Findings

Specific diet-related and alcohol-related risks for gout have been clarified, and alternative urate-lowering treatments likely to benefit patients with difficult-to-treat gout are in development. Progress toward understanding mechanisms underlying the renal deficits defining most cases of gout includes characterization of a urate-specific renal tubule transporter explaining many aspects of renal uric acid handling and identification of mutations in the UMOD gene, resulting in altered uromodulin protein in the gout-associated disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy and medullary cystic kidney disease type 2. A genetic marker associated with the risk for severe allopurinol toxicity has been reported. Hyperuricemia and gout are increasing in incidence, as is complicated gout, especially among the elderly and patients with cardiovascular and renal comorbidities, organ transplants, or complex concomitant medication regimens. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is clearly associated with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and the insulin resistance syndrome, and the pathogenetic significance of these associations is under intensive study. Mutation in the ANKH gene has been found among some patients with sporadic as well as familial calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.

Summary

The results of these clinical, epidemiologic, experimental, and therapeutic investigations presage advances in the management of crystal-induced arthropathies.

### Does gouty nephropathy exist, and is it more common than we think? [^113a44gL]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

Gout is present in one third of subjects with CKD but is usually an exclusion criterion in clinical trials investigating the role of uric acid in kidney disease. Bardin et al. report that one third of gouty subjects have hyperechoic medullas by ultrasound (consistent with crystalline deposits) that correlates with increased risk for hypertension and kidney dysfunction and which were not observed in > 500 controls. If validated, a "gouty nephropathy" from microcrystalline deposits could be an important, unrecognized cause of CKD.

Introduction

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, affecting up to 4% of all adults with higher prevalence rates in older men and in members of minoritized racial and ethnic minority groups. Characterized by hyperuricemia and articular deposition of monosodium urate, the clinical course of gout consists of painful arthritis flares separated by asymptomatic intercritical periods of variable duration. In the absence of effective urate-lowering therapy (ULT), flare frequency and severity increase over time, with some patients developing advanced gout characterized by tophi and chronic systemic inflammation. As such, gout poses a substantial and increasing burden, resulting annually in more than 200 000 emergency department visits, and total health care costs exceeding $6 billion in the US alone. A significant proportion of costs are preventable, reflecting missed treatment opportunities. With an increasingly well-understood pathogenesis, gout represents a highly treatable condition with management strategies focused on anti-inflammatory agents for flares and ULT to reduce or even halt disease progression.

Although gout alone poses a substantial burden, it also has strong associations with comorbidities and increased mortality. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes are all overrepresented in patients with gout. Compared with the general population, patients with gout demonstrate a greater than 25% increase in the rate of acute myocardial infarctionand are more likely to develop diabetes. Notably, these comorbidities also portend an increased risk of undergoing lower extremity amputation (LEA). Diabetes, for example, is associated with a 6-fold greater likelihood of receiving LEA, whereas advanced forms of CKD portend between a 2- to 4-fold increase in the rate of amputation.

In addition to concomitant comorbidity and potential adverse effects of serum urate and inflammation on vascular function, arthritis manifestations might also influence LEA rates in gout. It is recognized, for example, that gout mimics infectious processes of septic arthritis, cellulitis, and osteomyelitisand can masquerade as a nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer, which is a frequent indication for LEA. Numerous reports, have described digital and/or lower limb amputations in the context of gout, some, citing infection in the setting of gout, and anotherreported a gout diagnosis made postoperatively after histopathologic examination of resected tissues. Whether patients with gout undergo LEA at a higher rate than those without gout is unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap and identifying LEA determinants would inform future efforts to reduce amputations and improve outcomes in gout.
