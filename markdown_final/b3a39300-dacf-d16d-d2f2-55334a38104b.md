## Question

A 6-week-old child is brought to his pediatrician for a physical exam and hepatitis B booster. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a 19-year-old G-1-P-1. He was previously up to date on all vaccines and is mildly delayed in some developmental milestones. His mother is especially concerned with colic, as the boy cries endlessly at night. During the conversation, the infant's mother breaks down and starts crying and complaining about how tired she is and how she has no support from her family. She admits to repeatedly striking the infant in an effort to stop his crying. On physical exam, the infant's vitals are normal. The child appears cranky and begins to cry during the exam. The infant's backside is swollen, red, and tender to touch. Which of the following is the best response to this situation?
A. Confront the mother directly
B. Contact child protective services
C. Recommend treating the colic with a few drops of whiskey
D. Encourage the mother to take a class on parenting

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which action is most appropriate in a situation where a 6-week-old infant has admitted physical abuse and has concerning injuries, and the options include confronting the mother, contacting child protective services, recommending whiskey for colic, or encouraging parenting classes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and whether there is imminent risk. Then, I should verify the legal obligations for mandated reporting. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence base for each option. After that, I need to consider the timing and sequencing of actions, including documentation and medical evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize the best course of action and why the alternatives are inappropriate or unsafe.

> Let me first confirm the safety risk. The infant is 6 weeks old, non-ambulatory, and has a swollen, red, tender buttock consistent with recent blunt trauma; the mother has admitted to striking the infant repeatedly, which constitutes physical abuse and places the infant at high risk for escalation, including abusive head trauma, given the peak in infant crying at 5–6 weeks and the parallel peak in AHT hospitalizations shortly thereafter [^c769770b] [^85a7ab00]. Hold on, I should verify the sentinel injury concept: bruising in a non-mobile infant is a sentinel injury that is frequently missed and strongly predicts more severe abuse, so this presentation warrants urgent intervention rather than counseling alone [^33beb873] [^14a1bedd].

> Next, I should review my legal obligations. Physicians are mandated reporters; when child abuse is suspected, we must report to Child Protective Services or law enforcement promptly, and this is not discretionary even if the caregiver expresses remorse or requests confidentiality [^5d400681] [^225f954e]. Wait, let me verify the timing: most jurisdictions require immediate or same-day reporting when there is imminent risk, which clearly applies here given the infant's age, the admitted abuse, and the visible injury [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option A, confronting the mother directly. At first glance, I thought a direct conversation might elicit more details, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; confronting the perpetrator can increase risk to the infant, provoke flight, or lead to further harm, and best practice is to avoid confrontation until safety is secured and the appropriate authorities are involved [^edae3db1]. I should double-check: multidisciplinary guidance emphasizes safety-first strategies and non-accusatory history-taking only after immediate safety steps are in place, which argues against direct confrontation in this scenario [^edae3db1].

> Option C, recommending whiskey for colic, is dangerous and inappropriate. I need to ensure I state this clearly: alcohol is not a treatment for infant colic and poses serious health risks, including sedation, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression; this suggestion would constitute medical harm and is incompatible with pediatric standards of care [^notfound]. Let me reconsider: there is no credible evidence supporting alcohol for colic, and advising it would be unethical and potentially reportable misconduct.

> Option D, encouraging parenting classes, is reasonable for prevention in low-risk families, but wait, I should verify whether it addresses imminent safety here. In an active abuse scenario with a visible injury and admitted perpetration, parenting education is insufficient and delays necessary protective action; prevention frameworks are for risk mitigation, not for managing confirmed abuse with acute injury [^211d3f4d]. I should confirm: anticipatory guidance and classes are appropriate after safety is established, not as a substitute for reporting and immediate protection in this case [^211d3f4d].

> Now, Option B, contacting Child Protective Services, aligns with both safety and legal mandates. I should confirm the next steps: report immediately, ensure the infant is not discharged to an unsafe environment, and arrange a medical evaluation for occult injury, including a skeletal survey and consideration of neuroimaging per AAP and ACR guidance for suspected physical abuse in infants, given the high yield of occult fractures and the risk of AHT in this age group [^b1dab5a5] [^0d2651ef]. Hold on, I should verify documentation priorities: photograph injuries, record verbatim the mother's admission, and coordinate with a multidisciplinary team for evaluation and disposition planning [^225f954e] [^348d984b].

> But wait, what if the mother is experiencing postpartum depression or extreme stress — could that change the approach? I need to ensure we address caregiver needs without compromising infant safety; maternal mental health screening and support are important, yet safety must come first, and CPS involvement can also connect the mother with mental health and social supports while protecting the infant [^8ddfcdc3] [^a8430a66]. I should double-check: guidelines endorse trauma-informed, multidisciplinary care that supports the dyad after safety is secured, which is the appropriate sequence here [^348d984b].

> Final synthesis: the best response is to contact Child Protective Services immediately, avoid confrontation, and proceed with a structured medical evaluation for occult injuries, while documenting thoroughly and arranging safe disposition; the alternatives either increase risk, are harmful, or are inadequate to the severity and immediacy of the situation [^5d400681] [^b1dab5a5] [^edae3db1].

---

The best response is to **contact child protective services immediately** because the mother has admitted to physically abusing the infant, who has visible injuries and is at imminent risk of harm [^5d400681]. This fulfills the physician's legal obligation to report suspected child abuse and ensures the infant's safety [^225f954e]. Confronting the mother risks escalation or denial, parenting classes are insufficient for acute safety, and whiskey is dangerous and inappropriate. The infant should be evaluated for occult injuries, and the mother should be offered support resources, but safety comes first [^b1dab5a5].

---

## Clinical assessment and documentation

- **Document injuries**: Record the infant's swollen, red, and tender buttock with detailed descriptions and photographs [^0289d53e].

- **Assess for occult injuries**: Consider skeletal survey and neuroimaging for non-ambulatory infants with suspected abuse [^b1dab5a5] [^0d2651ef].

- **Screen for maternal depression**: Use the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and assess for postpartum depression, which is associated with increased risk of child abuse [^8ddfcdc3].

---

## Legal and ethical obligations

- **Mandated reporting**: Physicians are legally obligated to report suspected child abuse to child protective services (CPS) immediately [^5d400681] [^225f954e].

- **Confidentiality**: Maintain confidentiality while ensuring the infant's safety and complying with legal obligations [^db7f5478].

- **Ethical considerations**: Prioritize the infant's safety and well-being, balancing parental rights with the duty to protect the child [^f3826945].

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Confront the mother directly | Confrontation may escalate the situation, provoke denial, or increase risk to the infant | Not recommended |
| B. Contact child protective services | Immediate reporting fulfills legal obligations and ensures infant safety | Highly recommended |
| C. Recommend treating the colic with a few drops of whiskey | Alcohol is dangerous and inappropriate for infants; this is harmful advice | Strongly discouraged |
| D. Encourage the mother to take a class on parenting | Parenting classes are insufficient to address acute safety concerns and do not mitigate immediate risk | Not recommended |

---

## Recommended course of action

- **Immediate CPS report**: Contact CPS immediately to report suspected child abuse and ensure infant safety [^5d400681].

- **Medical evaluation**: Conduct a thorough medical evaluation, including skeletal survey and neuroimaging, to assess for occult injuries [^b1dab5a5] [^0d2651ef].

- **Support for mother**: Provide resources for maternal mental health support, including postpartum depression screening and referrals to social services [^8ddfcdc3].

- **Follow-up care**: Arrange follow-up care for the infant, including monitoring for developmental delays and ongoing assessment of safety [^0289d53e].

---

## Conclusion

The best response is to **contact child protective services immediately** because the infant is at imminent risk of harm due to admitted physical abuse. This action fulfills legal obligations, ensures infant safety, and allows for appropriate medical evaluation and support for the mother.

One percent to 2% of children in the United States are confirmed victims of child abuse, with many more likely affected. It can be difficult to diagnose, with often misleading medical histories, but acute care providers should be aware of its presenting warning signs and how to evaluate and document suspicious physical findings. Young children who cannot disclose are most vulnerable to forms of abuse with high morbidity and mortality, so it is important to keep it in the differential diagnosis and to be aware of and know how to rule out medical conditions that mimic abuse.

Skin injury is the most common form of child physical abuse. Although the pattern and visual appearance of skin injury and the treatment needed for the injury is similar in children and adults, characteristics of infant and childhood skin may complicate the diagnosis of injury. A good understanding of normal developmental presentation of accidental injury from infancy to adulthood, locations for injury that should trigger consideration of abuse, and cutaneous mimics of abuse across the lifespan are critical to the identification of suspected abuse. Adults and older children can provide a history directly to providers, though it should be noted that abused adults and children may not always disclose the true cause of their injuries. In infants and very young children, a history from the patient is lacking due to the verbal abilities of the child, and a parent or other caregiver may provide a false or misleading history that can complicate the diagnosis and treatment. The approach to taking the history, when abuse is suspected, is a critical part of the evaluation, and best practice will vary depending on whether your patient is a child or an adult.

Most critical care interventions for children occur in the framework of a supportive environment with loving parents that are present at the bedside to help to guide medical interventions through shared decision-making. What happens, however, if the parents are precluded from being at the bedside because of legal entanglements? How should clinical decisions progress in those cases? In this Ethics Rounds, we present the case of an infant with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy at birth whose mother was incarcerated shortly after delivery. We explore clinical and legal challenges that the medical team faces in determining best interests for the infant in this context and difficulties in deciding what therapies to provide and for how long.

For the cruiser or toddler period, topics include normal development and age-appropriate expectations (behaviors or temper tantrums, eating, language); sleep routines and issues; discipline = teaching; and toilet-training. Preschool anticipatory guidance includes sexual development, teach child names for genitalia; teach child self-stimulation is appropriate in private, but not in public; and safe touch or unsafe touch. In middle childhood or school, topics include normal development and age-appropriate expectations, appropriate supervision; respect private parts of others and others to do the same; personal safety; peer pressure; internet use; and family relationships, importance of family routines or time together. In adolescence, guidance includes dating violence and signs of healthy versus unhealthy relationships; model nonviolent anger management, emotion regulation or coregulation, and conflict resolution; and family relationships, importance of family routines or time together.

Suspected physical abuse — history and physical exam red flags include injury to a nonmobile infant (including bruises, oral injuries, or fractures), injuries in unusual locations (over the torso, ears or neck), patterned injuries, injuries to multiple organ systems, multiple injuries in different stages of healing, and significant injuries that are unexplained or inconsistent with the reported mechanism or the patient's age or stage of development. Imaging work-up is outlined in "ACR Appropriateness Criteria: Suspected Physical Abuse – Child," and it is based on the patient's age, evidence of neurological, thoracic, or abdominopelvic injury, as well as social factors, with the American Academy of Pediatrics providing a detailed report that guides evaluation.

### Clinical evaluation and management of children with suspected physical abuse [^0b74b6a7]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluating and managing children with suspected physical abuse is challenging. Few single injuries are pathognomonic for abuse and, as a result, child abuse is easily missed. As such, a healthy bit of skepticism is needed to recognize and protect abused children. The medical history and clinical presentation should guide evaluation. Medical providers must consider the differential diagnosis, epidemiology of injuries, and child development to inform the assessment. In this review, we address evidence-based recommendations to inform child physical abuse evaluations. We also discuss the role of medical providers in communicating with families, mandated reporting and interpreting medical information for investigative agencies and other non-medical colleagues entrusted with protecting children.

### Child abuse: behavioral aspects and other associated problems [^edae3db1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Although researchers in psychology and the social sciences will need to continue to identify the behavioral consequences of abuse and treatment strategies, pediatricians may still be the first line professionals to suspect and intercept victims. Remember that, especially in cases where there have been threats or falsification of illness, it is wise to enlist integrated multidisciplinary services to ensure the safety of the child before confronting any potential perpetrators. Physicians have become better trained to be more vigilant in detecting signs of physical abuse, but it seems that psychologic and sexual maltreatment may cause more long-term problems but are more difficult to detect. Although a book by Everett and Gallop is written for mental health professionals, the chapters on why a history of childhood trauma is often missed, recognizing signs and symptoms, and asking about abuse, are all helpful for pediatricians and other health care professionals. In certain situations, physicians should attempt to talk to children privately, so that those who are old enough might have an opportunity to relate events that are traumatic, and so that abusive parents will not have an opportunity to interrupt, instill additional fear in the child, or abruptly change providers. Children need someone to ask them directly about their experiences and act on any suspicions. Asking once may not be enough, because a frightened child may initially deny physical or sexual abuse, but be ready to tell at another time. A vocal adult survivor of Munchausen syndrome by proxy and severe physical abuse explains: The dilemma is how to be loved and accepted. Even once a child recognizes that it is wrong, victims may be afraid to speak up for fear of anger and more abuse at the hand of the abuser. By the time I reached eleven, I was angry enough at what my mother had gotten away with, I would have been more truthful. It would have been a relief to have someone else voice their own suspicions. But, no one ever asked and I could not be the one to give away my mother or the love of my family. Although society is still struggling with its ability to prevent abuse, it must also be concerned with dealing with its consequences. The problem seems overwhelming in its enormity and the resources do not seem to be adequate to tackle these issues so basic to the care and nurturing of children. Nonetheless, physicians must keep their eyes open to behaviors that signal distress, recognize and strive to eliminate the underlying cause, and make certain that children receive treatment to minimize the myriad of behavioral and other long-term problems that are associated with child abuse.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^0cca3c31]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Third, it was interesting that not all selected studies included maternal–infant opioid exposure as an essential component of the NAS definition. As noted above, NAS is most commonly conceptualized as withdrawal from opioids in exposed infants, but many studies may define NAS as withdrawal from a variety of exposures, not exclusively opioids. Other substance exposures beyond opioid use can affect NAS expression, including the demonstration of withdrawal signs/symptoms and their severity and/or pharmacotherapy decisions for the infant. In any case, the lack of inclusion of opioid exposure as an essential component in the diagnosis of NAS appears problematic given the prominent role of in utero opioid exposure — though often in the context of other exposures — in the development of NAS. Most noteworthy, this key knowledge gap highlights the critical need for addressing the definition of NAS at a point fundamentally upstream of the use of a scoring tool or administrative coding — namely, at the bedside at a clinical diagnostic level. It reinforces the importance of a standardized clinical definition for NAS as an essential step in advancing our discussions. This is crucial not only for clinical trials of new and existing therapeutics but also for improving downstream needs assessment and care for the appropriately identified mother–infant dyad.

### Physical abuse: cutaneous injuries [^922a449c]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous injuries are the most common presentation of child physical abuse. Identification of injuries concerning for physical abuse is a challenging but important responsibility of pediatric clinicians. It is important for pediatric clinicians to consider 3 key features including age/developmental abilities of child, location of injury, and pattern of injury when assessing injuries concerning for abuse. A thorough medical evaluation and consideration of a broad differential help ensure that a medical mimic is not mistaken for abuse. Early identification of concerning injuries and reporting to appropriate agencies may protect children from further harm.

### Ongoing pediatric health care for the child who has been maltreated [^0289d53e]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Skin findings and bruising — unclothed examination and documentation are emphasized, with specific bruise patterns raising suspicion. An unclothed physical examination may reveal evidence of malnutrition or other signs of neglect and identify injuries suspicious for abuse. Bruises and other soft tissue injuries are the most common injury caused by child abuse, and if an infant who is not yet cruising has a bruise, the pediatrician may consider that the child may have been abused. Patterned bruises and bruises on the face, neck, trunk, and upper arm may also raise suspicion of abuse. Bruises and scars from previous injuries should be documented, the pediatrician should also document any new injuries, and attempts should be made to ensure lesions have been recognized and investigated by CPS.

Child abuse evaluation in lower-risk BRUE — social risk assessment: Clinicians Should Obtain an Assessment of Social Risk Factors To Detect Child Abuse in Infants Presenting With A Lower-Risk BRUE (Grade C, Moderate Recommendation). Aggregate Evidence Quality is Grade C and Strength is a Moderate recommendation. Benefits include identification of child abuse, potential benefit to the safety of other children in the home, and identification of other social risk factors and needs with help connecting caregivers with appropriate resources (eg, financial distress); risks and costs include that this can be resource intensive and not always available, and some social workers may have inadequate experience in child abuse assessment. The benefit-harm assessment states that identifying child abuse and identifying and addressing social needs outweigh the cost of attempting to locate the appropriate resources or decreasing the trust in the medical team.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSuspected physical abuse-child [^0d2651ef]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The youngest children, particularly in the first year of life, are the most vulnerable to physical abuse. Skeletal survey is the universal screening examination in children 24 months of age and younger. Fractures occur in over half of abused children. Rib fractures may be the only abnormality in about 30%. A repeat limited skeletal survey after 2 weeks can detect additional fractures and can provide fracture dating information. The type and extent of additional imaging for pediatric patients being evaluated for suspected physical abuse depends on the age of the child, the presence of neurologic signs and symptoms, evidence of thoracic or abdominopelvic injuries, and social considerations. Unenhanced CT of the head is the initial study for suspected intracranial injury. Clinically occult abusive head trauma can occur, especially in young infants. Therefore, head CT should be performed in selected neurologically asymptomatic physical abuse patients. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen/pelvis is utilized for suspected intra-abdominal or pelvic injury. Particular attention should be paid to discrepancies between the patterns of injury and the reported clinical history. Making the diagnosis of child abuse also requires differentiation from anatomical and developmental variants and possible underlying metabolic and genetic conditions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Hepatitis B vaccine administration… [^13e4e6e2]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends hepatitis B vaccination among all infants at birth, unvaccinated children younger than 19 years of age, adults aged 19–59 years, and adults aged 60 years and older with risk factors for hepatitis B or without identified risk factors but seeking protection. People with risk factors, regardless of age.
- If never previously screened, test for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc
- Unless less than aged 18 years and completed a vaccine series as an infant
- If previously screened, but still unvaccinated, offer testing to people who have ongoing risk for exposure
- Vaccinate. PreHevbrio Pediarix For children aged 6 weeks through age 6 years People between 6 weeks and 6 years of age should receive three doses. See package insert for detailed dosage instructions. See the Pediarix package insert.

Vaxelis For children aged 6 weeks through age 4 years People between 6 weeks and 4 years of age should receive three doses. See package insert for detailed dosage instructions. See the Vaxelis package insert. Vaccine effectiveness Each of the HepB vaccines are highly effective in preventing infection. Studies indicate that immunity persists for at least 30 years among healthy people who initiate HepB vaccination at less than 6 months of age. Hemodialysis Providers should vaccinate adult hemodialysis patients needing HepB vaccination with high-dose Engerix-B or Recombivax HB. See package insert for detailed dosage instructions. Pregnancy Providers should vaccinate pregnant patients needing HepB vaccination with Engerix-B, Heplisav-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix. Safety and precautions Scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports the safety of HepB vaccines.

As a precaution, clinicians should ask the person getting the vaccine if they've previously experienced an allergic reaction to:

- A previous dose of HepB vaccine.
- Any part of HepB vaccine.
- Yeast. People who are moderately or severely ill should wait until they recover before getting a HepB vaccine. However, administering the vaccine to people with minor illnesses, such as a cold, is fine. Learn more about contraindications and precautions.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^2002c5b1]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Child welfare system and plans of safe care — The opioid crisis resulted in greater demands on the US child welfare system, and although evidence suggests that keeping the family intact improves outcomes for parents and infants, child safety must still be paramount. A report to child protective services should be considered when the mother has not received or been adherent to treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), when there is concern or evidence of polysubstance use during pregnancy, or when there is a concern for infant safety, and in cases in which a child cannot be safely cared for by his or her parents, appropriately trained kinship or foster care placement may be necessary. Referral to child protective services is not a substitute for referral to treatment of the pregnant or parenting woman. In 2016, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act amended the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to ensure that "plans of safe care" are created for infants "being affected by substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms, or a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder," and these plans should address the "health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver." States may interpret and implement legislation related to plans of safe care differently; therefore, it is important for pediatricians to be aware of their local requirements, and pediatricians should consider involvement in the development of plans of safe care in their communities. Because of their expansive nature of supporting the mother-infant dyad, some states have elected to call their plans of safe care "plans of supportive care," and such partnerships between pediatricians and child welfare professionals can help fill education gaps, foster positive partnerships, and promote understanding, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for the mother-infant dyad.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^4d11bdba]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Child abuse is a worldwide occurrence that impacts the well-being of millions across the globe. The youngest children are at the highest risk, with severe physical abuse being 120 times more common in infants compared to children over 5 years of age. The abused child is often non-verbal and may present with diffuse and non-specific symptoms of occult injury, particularly in cases of head and abdominal trauma. Consequently, imaging is central to the diagnosis.

This is a challenging area for the general radiologist, not least because it is known to be an area with serious child and family consequences of over- and under-diagnosis, and high litigation rates. Thus, up-to-date evidence and guidelines are essential to ensure uniformly high-quality care based on currently available literature and to enable confident, competent clinical practice. This article provides concise and clinically relevant practice recommendations for the general radiologist to guide the investigation of a child presenting with suspected physical abuse.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: conditions that predispose to bleeding [^0661feed]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Child abuse might be suspected when children present with cutaneous bruising, intracranial hemorrhage, or other manifestations of bleeding. In these cases, it is necessary to consider medical conditions that predispose to easy bleeding/bruising. When evaluating for the possibility of bleeding disorders and other conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, the pediatrician must consider the child's presenting history, medical history, and physical examination findings before initiating a laboratory investigation. Many medical conditions can predispose to easy bleeding. Before ordering laboratory tests for a disease, it is useful to understand the biochemical basis and clinical presentation of the disorder, condition prevalence, and test characteristics. This technical report reviews the major medical conditions that predispose to bruising/bleeding and should be considered when evaluating for abusive injury.

### Child abuse: approach and management [^95197216]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on child abuse:

- **Definition**: Child abuse is a violation of human rights, defined as an act, or failure to act, on the part of a parent, guardian, and/or caregiver that results in the death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or exploitation of a child, or which places the child in an imminent risk of serious harm, and/or seriously impacts the child's long-term development and potential.
- **Pathophysiology**: Child maltreatment encompasses physical, sexual (including sex trafficking), and emotional/psychological abuse and neglect.
- **Epidemiology**: Approximately 4.4 million children are reported to Child Protective Services each year, with about 9 out of 1,000 children in the US found to have evidence of maltreatment after investigation, and 9.2% of victimized children experiencing sexual assault. The global prevalence of self-reported child physical abuse is estimated to range from 7% to 19%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for child maltreatment include child factors (chronic illness, emotional or behavioral difficulties, physical disabilities, preterm birth, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy), caregiver factors (young parental age, criminal history, alcohol or substance abuse, depression or other mental health issues, poor impulse control, history of abuse, unrealistic expectations for the child, poor knowledge of the child, negative perception of normal childhood behavior, low educational attainment, low self-esteem), home environment (family or intimate partner violence, non-biologically related adult living in the home, single-parent home), and community environment (poverty, social isolation, or lack of social support).
- **Disease course**: Common findings of physical abuse include signs of non-accidental trauma such as bite marks, skin and mucosal abrasions, lacerations, and bruises (commonly on the head and face, as well as on ear, neck, torso, buttocks, or upper arms), patterned burns (object contact burns, scalding immersion burns), fractures (ribs, sternum, long bones, vertebrae, scapulae, or skull), and head trauma. Signs of sexual abuse include dysuria, genital or anal pain or bleeding, symptoms of STIs, and pregnancy. Children may present with anxiety, distress, or unwillingness to undress or be examined.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Abusive head trauma is a sequelae of child physical abuse which can result in often permanent and significant brain damage. The fatality rate from child abuse is estimated at 2.87 per 100,000 boys and 2.11 per 100,000 girls.

Skeletal injuries — key points for child abuse emphasize that skeletal fractures are a sentinel injury and the second most common presenting sign of physical abuse. Fractures more specifically associated with abuse include rib fractures, classic metaphyseal lesions, or long bone fractures in the pre-ambulatory infant; however, any fracture location or pattern can be accompanied by physical abuse. High suspicion for physical abuse is warranted with a skeletal fracture in younger children, especially infants prior to walking.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: conditions that predispose to bleeding [^45248ee3]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Child abuse might be suspected when children present with cutaneous bruising, intracranial hemorrhage, or other manifestations of bleeding. In these cases, it is necessary to consider medical conditions that predispose to easy bleeding or bruising. When evaluating for the possibility of bleeding disorders and other conditions that predispose to hemorrhage, it is important for pediatricians to consider the child's presenting history, medical history, and physical examination findings before initiating a laboratory investigation. Many medical conditions can predispose to easy bleeding. Before ordering laboratory tests for a disease, it is useful to understand the biochemical basis and clinical presentation of the disorder, condition prevalence, and test characteristics. This technical report reviews the major medical conditions that predispose to bruising or bleeding and should be considered when evaluating for abusive injury.

### Definitions of neonatal abstinence syndrome in clinical studies of mothers and infants: an expert literature review [^ff442a13]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

While our approach carries the limitations of a non-systematic review, it offers a conceptual summary of the limited number of available randomized control and cohort trials and the criteria they used to investigate various key outcomes for the mother–infant dyad. At least three limitations can be noted. Our emphasis on study designs with comparison groups may have excluded more descriptive literature that could also offer insight on how NAS has been historically defined. Likewise, some of the studies selected for this literature review demonstrated low population size, correlational design, and may be subject to underlying biases. Additionally, though the keyword search was informed by evidence-based guidelines and an environmental scan, it may have missed articles not captured by our focused search strategy and potentially retrievable by different search methods.

As the foundational step of an overarching RAM focusing on the clinical definition of NAS, the findings from this RAM literature review of comparative clinical studies will inform broader discussions on challenges with existing methods used to define NAS and important inconsistencies and gaps that need to be addressed. A key next step to closing fundamental knowledge gaps will be to develop standard clinical criteria for the diagnosis of NAS that are both practical and broadly applicable to clinical practice. The core consideration for criteria would be grounded in the infant's clinical signs of withdrawal independent of the need for pharmacologic treatment. A diagnosis of NAS in an infant who does not meet criteria for medication to alleviate symptoms may allow the application of targeted non-pharmacologic therapies to address NAS-related difficulties. Other important elements would include integration of (1) opioid and other substance exposures consistent with signs of neonatal withdrawal, (2) available maternal data, in a manner that does not contribute to further stigmatization of mothers with history of opioid/substance use, and (3) maternal–infant toxicology, when available, to document the exposure(s).

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^a664ff19]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Medical follow-up after discharge for opioid-exposed infants specifies that infants should be observed for 24 to 48 hours after finishing any medication taper, and ideally an infant with opioid exposure would be seen by a pediatrician within 48 hours of discharge from the hospital to monitor for adequate weight gain and any continued signs of withdrawal. The frequency of pediatrician visits may need to be higher than that for uncomplicated term infants, and although there are no data to inform the most optimal visit schedule, the infant should be seen within 48 hours of discharge, with a 1-week follow-up, and additional visits should be tailored to the needs of the dyad. Ideally, breastfed infants should also have outpatient lactation support.

### The pediatrician's role in optimizing school readiness [^eca82ca9]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Social-emotional well-being in early childhood — pediatricians identify risk factors that could interfere with bonding, provide anticipatory guidance and model healthy interactions, emphasize effective discipline, and discourage harmful practices. The page states that "The pediatrician's influence on the social-emotional well-being of the child begins with the identification of risk factors such as maternal depression, parental history of early childhood adversity, parental discord, or other family psychosocial stressors, such as poverty, that could interfere with initial parent-infant bonding," and "The pediatrician also provides anticipatory guidance regarding behaviors, such as infant crying, sleeping, and feeding, as well as parental self-care." It adds "Positive parenting techniques should also be discussed" and "Physicians can model appropriate adult-child interactions within the office and provide materials and resources to help promote healthy parent-child relationships." Emphasis is placed on the "3 essential components of effective discipline: (1) a positive, supportive parent-child relationship with many opportunities for 'times in' throughout the day; (2) the use of positive reinforcement strategies, including praise, to increase desired behaviors; and (3) the purposeful and appropriate use of strategies such as ignoring, redirection, 'time out,' or removal of privileges to reduce undesired behaviors." The directive states "The use of corporal punishment should be discouraged," culture is flagged as integral ("Consideration of cultural differences must always be part of this process."), and for significant behavioral/emotional issues or toxic stress exposure "the pediatrician can offer support and guidance and referral to behavioral health professionals who can provide evidence-based interventions," with note that "Integrated models of mental health care often allow families better access to services."

### Diagnosis and management of physical abuse in children [^225f954e]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Child abuse is the third leading cause of death in children between one and four years of age, and almost 20% of child homicide victims have contact with a health care professional within a month of their death. Therefore, family physicians are in an ideal position to detect and intervene in cases of suspected child maltreatment. There is currently insufficient evidence that screening parents or guardians for child abuse reduces disability or premature death. Assessment for physical abuse involves evaluation of historical information and physical examination findings, as well as radiographic and laboratory studies, if indicated. The history should be obtained in a nonaccusatory manner and should include details of any injuries or incidents, the patient's medical and social history, and information from witnesses. The physical examination should focus on bruising patterns, injuries or findings concerning for abuse, and palpation for tenderness or other evidence of occult injury. Skeletal survey imaging is indicated for suspected abuse in children younger than two years. Imaging may be indicated for children two to five years of age if abuse is strongly suspected. Detailed documentation is crucial, and includes photographing physical examination findings. Physicians are mandated by law to report child abuse to the local child protective services or law enforcement agency. After a report is made, the child protection process is initiated, which involves a multidisciplinary team approach.

### Bruising in infants: an approach to the recognition of child physical abuse [^85e26d73]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Infants (children < 12 months of age) are maltreated at more than twice the rate of any other child age group, and infants die because of maltreatment at 3 times the rate of any other age group in childhood. The incidence of hospitalization for serious physical abuse in children also is highest for infants. Successful recognition of medically mild signs of physical abuse in infants, such as certain bruising patterns, can, therefore, lead to lifesaving interventions. The importance of the recognition of medically mild injuries due to physical abuse is underscored by the finding that a high percentage of infants (27.5%) hospitalized with serious physical abuse were found to have previously sustained milder injuries, such as bruising. Clinicians must be aware of patterns of bruising suggestive of abuse to distinguish between infants who have been abused and those who have been accidentally injured. To maximize the likelihood that abused infants will be identified and protected, as well to minimize the likelihood that an accidentally injured infant will be mischaracterized as abused, the application of an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of bruised infants should be applied. A consistent, evidence-based practice in this setting also may reduce the influence of racial and socioeconomic bias and decrease disparities in care.

### Selective skeletal surveys for infants with skull fractures: examining the rates of return to medical care for concern of physical abuse [^4b717d10]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to describe which infants with a skull fracture (1) receive a child abuse pediatrician (CAP) consultation, (2) receive a skeletal survey, and (3) re-present to medical care before age 3 years with concerns for physical abuse.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of infants younger than 12 months who presented to the emergency department between January 1, 2005, and December 30, 2015, with a skull fracture. Medical records were reviewed for the skull fracture presentation and for all future medical evaluations at the same institution with concerns for physical abuse until 3 years of age.

Results

Of 366 infants with a skull fracture, a CAP was contacted for 272 (74%) and 76 (20.8%) infants who received a skeletal survey. Factors associated with skeletal survey acquisition included younger age (< 6 months), no history to explain the skull fracture, other injuries on examination, and social risk factors. Six children (1.6%) re-presented to medical care with concerns of physical abuse before age 3 years. Five of these infants did not have a skeletal survey at the time of their skull fracture, and 1 was likely a case of missed physical abuse at the time of the skull fracture.

Discussion

Most skull fractures in infancy occur accidentally, and a skeletal survey may not be necessary for every infant. Obtaining a thorough history including social risk factors, performing a complete physical examination, and consulting with a CAP is an effective first step in the evaluation of physical abuse in infants with skull fractures.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not." A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Global human trafficking and child victimization [^f6d3395e]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Trafficking of children for labor and sexual exploitation violates basic human rights and constitutes a major global public health problem. Pediatricians and other health care professionals may encounter victims who present with infections, injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidality, or a variety of other physical or behavioral health conditions. Preventing child trafficking, recognizing victimization, and intervening appropriately require a public health approach that incorporates rigorous research on the risk factors, health impact, and effective treatment options for child exploitation as well as implementation and evaluation of primary prevention programs. Health care professionals need training to recognize possible signs of exploitation and to intervene appropriately. They need to adopt a multidisciplinary, outward-focused approach to service provision, working with nonmedical professionals in the community to assist victims. Pediatricians also need to advocate for legislation and policies that promote child rights and victim services as well as those that address the social determinants of health, which influence the vulnerability to human trafficking. This policy statement outlines major issues regarding public policy, medical education, research, and collaboration in the area of child labor and sex trafficking and provides recommendations for future work.

Craniospinal trauma

How common is abusive head trauma (AHT) and how is it diagnosed?

AHT is common, with population incidence estimates of 14–53 per 100,000. AHT is the leading cause of death in infants and toddlers under the age of 2 years. The diagnosis for both accidental and AHT is made from a combination of clinical history and examination by a paediatrician (ideally subspecialising in child abuse), laboratory analysis, and imaging.

How does AHT present?

Presentation is variable, ranging from non-specific clinical features, altered neurological status and seizures, to death (Table 1a).

Developmental delay can be seen in survivors. When the history or proposed mechanism of injury is inconsistent with the clinical examination and severity of findings, a multidisciplinary pathway for assessment for AHT and inflicted injury is triggered.

Common injury patterns in AHT

The common injury patterns in the brain and spine that occur in AHT are outlined in Table 1b and Fig. 1.

Table 1
(a) Common presentations of AHT and (b) Common injury patterns that are more specific for abusive than accidental head trauma a

a While some findings may be more suggestive of abuse, no individual finding is pathognomonic, and the diagnosis will depend on the combination of all clinical, laboratory and imaging findings

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review [^7e63013c]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Skeletal fractures are diagnosed in up to a third of children who have been investigated for physical abuse. The fractures are often occult, and they occur in infants and toddlers who cannot give a causal explanation. Children who have been physically abused represent a small proportion of the total number of childhood fractures. Most children who sustain fractures do so from falls, motor vehicle crashes, or other non-abusive trauma. In addition, a small group of children are more susceptible to fractures owing to underlying conditions that contribute to bone fragility. All health professionals who see children should be able to recognise the characteristics of fractures resulting from abuse and initiate child protection investigations where necessary, to prevent further injury that could be fatal. In reality, the possibility of child abuse is often overlooked in clinical practice.

We systematically reviewed the published world literature to answer the question "what features differentiate fractures resulting from abuse from those sustained from other causes?" We aimed to identify indicators that can help clinicians to identify cases of suspected child abuse when a child presents with a fracture for which the cause cannot be confirmed. We explore the strengths and limitations of the current evidence base and make recommendations for future research in this field. We anticipate that this review will enable the development of evidence based clinical guidelines. It will also contribute to the knowledge and understanding of the scientific evidence that expert medical witnesses are expected to have to support their opinion in the family and criminal courts.

### Prescribing opioids and psychotropic drugs in pregnancy [^bbde741f]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Treating for two

Use of medications in pregnancy must balance the health of the mother with the potential impact on developing fetus. These concerns led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to launch an initiative called "Treating for Two," emphasizing the value of better research and reliable guidance that will better inform women's and clinicians' decisions about medication use during pregnancy.

For clinicians who provide care for pregnant women and their children, these data have some additional important implications. Given clinical challenges in predicting risk of withdrawal among infants exposed to opioids, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that all such infants should be observed for four to seven days after birth to monitor for signs of withdrawal. Huybrechts and colleagues found substantial differences in risk of withdrawal based on exposure to specific psychotropic agents, suggesting opportunities to tailor postnatal monitoring and treatment for the highest risk infants.

Lastly, these findings suggest a clear need for a comprehensive, evidence informed strategy regarding opioid use in pregnancy. To be effective, the strategy would specify opportunities for intervention in clinical and public health settings in all time periods related to pre-pregnancy, antepartum/prenatal, peripartum/perinatal, and postpartum/infancy. There remains a paucity of clinical guidance for obstetricians and pediatricians caring for the mother-child unit; development of a strategy will help to prioritize the development of specific evidence. As the US opioid epidemic accelerates in complexity, there is an urgent need to focus resources on this issue, including expansion of research funding for drug safety in pregnancy and improvement of outcomes for mothers and infants affected by opioid use disorder, more funding for the prevention of the disorder, and an expansion of treatment options for affected mothers and their infants.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) affects one in 4000–5000 infants every year and is one of the most serious forms of physical child abuse that has a high associated mortality and morbidity. Differentiating this form of abuse from another potential cause of brain injury is of utmost importance to the welfare of the child concerned and it is essential that the condition is correctly diagnosed. This article describes the evidence base behind the associated historical, clinical and neuroradiological features of AHT and spinal injury in physical abuse and sets out an algorithm of essential investigations that should be performed in any infant or young child where AHT is suspected.

### Providers' ability to identify sentinel injuries concerning for physical abuse in infants [^16ac527a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to assess the ability of pediatric health care providers and social workers to recognize sentinel injuries in infants under 6 months of age and to determine what factors influence their decision to evaluate for physical abuse.

Methods

A statewide collaborative focused on sentinel injuries administered a survey to pediatric health care providers and social workers in the emergency department, urgent care, and primary care. The survey contained 8 case scenarios of infants under 6 months of age with an injury, and respondents were asked if they would consider the injury to be a sentinel injury requiring a physical abuse evaluation. Respondents were then presented with several factors and asked how much each influences the decision to perform a physical abuse evaluation.

Results

A total of 565 providers completed the survey. Providers had moderate interrater reliability on their classification of the cases as sentinel injuries or not (κ = 0.57). Nearly all respondents (97%) recognized genital bruising as a sentinel injury, whereas 77% of respondents recognized intraoral injuries. Agreement was highest among social workers (κ = 0.76) and physicians with categorical pediatrics training and pediatric emergency medicine fellowship (κ = 0.63) and lowest among nurse practitioners (κ = 0.48) and residents (κ = 0.51). Concern over missing the diagnosis of abuse had the greatest influence on the decision to perform a physical abuse evaluation.

Conclusions

Sentinel injuries are not uniformly recognized as potential signs of child abuse requiring further evaluation by pediatric health care providers. Additional evidence and education are needed regarding sentinel injuries.

Metaphyseal injury

In the appropriate clinical setting, classic metaphyseal fractures (corner/chip or bucket handle fractures) are considered the most specific radiographic injury of physical abuse. They are most frequently seen in the distal femur, the tibia, and the proximal humerus, but also occur in the elbow, wrist (Fig. 5), and shoulder. Small undisplaced classic metaphyseal fractures tend to heal within 4 weeks without callus formation by gradual bone consolidation, whereas healing of larger or displaced fractures may take 6–8 weeks. When the adjacent periosteum is injured, subperiosteal haemorrhage occurs, which, during the healing process, is evident as a periosteal reaction. Classic metaphyseal fractures must be differentiated from normal growth variations, which may take the form of subtle irregularities, 'step-off' (also termed a metaphyseal collar) or even mimic a small avulsion. In children over the age of 12–15 months with genu vara, metaphyseal fragmentation can be seen due to abnormal stresses associated with early weight bearing.

Long bone fractures

In cases of suspected child abuse, long bone fractures have been documented in 26% of infants. Fractures to the long tubular bones in physically abused children most commonly involve the femur and tibia, followed by the forearm (Fig. 5). Mid-shaft fractures of the humerus in infants are more common in cases of physical abuse than non-abuse. Without a plausible explanation of a significant high-energy impact (e.g. a road traffic accident), discovering a long bone fracture in a pre-ambulant infant should always raise suspicion of physical abuse. Physiological periosteal new bone formation along the shaft of the long bones is a common feature in infants between the ages of 1–4 months of age, and should be differentiated from isolated subperiosteal new bone formation.

### Incorporating recognition and management of perinatal depression into pediatric practice [^a8430c66]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Infant and/or dyadic interventions — principles emphasize avoiding blame and focusing on dyadic strengths: in promoting evidence-based mental health treatments for infants and their mothers with perinatal depression, most approaches caution against implying any blame or carrying an exclusive focus on challenges faced by the mother; strengths-based approaches that are focused on the infant-mother dyad are promoted on the basis of some evidence of efficacy in generally addressing attachment issues and developmental concerns in other settings; most of these dyadic interventions are focused on infant-mother attachment.

### Global human trafficking and child victimization [^a17565f7]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Global Human Trafficking and Child Victimization — trafficking of children for labor and sexual exploitation violates basic human rights and constitutes a major global public health problem. Pediatricians and other health care professionals may encounter victims who present with infections, injuries, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidality, or a variety of other physical or behavioral health conditions. Preventing child trafficking, recognizing victimization, and intervening appropriately require a public health approach that incorporates rigorous research on the risk factors, health impact, and effective treatment options for child exploitation as well as implementation and evaluation of primary prevention programs. Health care professionals need training to recognize possible signs of exploitation and to intervene appropriately, and they need to adopt a multidisciplinary, outward-focused approach to service provision, working with nonmedical professionals in the community to assist victims. Pediatricians also need to advocate for legislation and policies that promote child rights and victim services as well as those that address the social determinants of health, which influence the vulnerability to human trafficking. This policy statement outlines major issues regarding public policy, medical education, research, and collaboration in the area of child labor and sex trafficking and provides recommendations for future work. A critical role of the pediatric health care professional is to advocate for the health and well-being of children and adolescents. Central to this role is the conviction that health and well-being depend on a guarantee of fundamental human rights.

### Evaluating young children with fractures for child abuse: clinical report [^87acb6ea]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Medical evaluation — history of present illness emphasizes obtaining a detailed account of how the injury occurred and timing, stating it is essential to obtain a detailed history and that caregivers may help narrow when the child was last well; in contrast to abusive injuries, 29% of caregivers of children with unintentional injuries provided some high-energy explanation, and most children with long bone fractures manifest external signs such as pain, swelling, or decreased use, though nondisplaced fractures may have minimal signs; the absence of any history, vague or inconsistent descriptions, delay in seeking care, or lack of explanation — particularly in a nonambulatory child — should increase the medical care provider's concern that an injury was caused by child abuse.

### Evaluating for suspected child abuse: conditions that predispose to bleeding [^62f3382a]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Clinical approach to evaluation in suspected abuse with bleeding — In many children with bruising or bleeding concerning for abuse, the evaluation for medical conditions causing or contributing to the findings noted on the physical examination can be completed by assessing the child's presenting symptoms, trauma history, medical history, family history, and medications. Before engaging in a laboratory evaluation, it is important for physicians to consider family history of bleeding or bruising or a history of specific coagulopathies or other conditions with the child's clinical characteristics and/or a previous history of bleeding or bruising; the known presentations and prevalence of the various bleeding disorders, collagen vascular disorders, or other medical conditions under consideration; the medical probability that a specific medical condition might cause or contribute to the child's bleeding or bruising; the statistical characteristics of the proposed laboratory testing; the history of the use of blood products or other factor replacement products that might alter laboratory test results; and the anticipated benefit of identifying conditions that might cause bleeding or bruising.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^aeed0403]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Preparing for discharge after opioid exposure — care coordination emphasizes that it is important to plan effectively for a safe transition from the hospital to home for the mother-infant dyad, because families of infants with opioid exposure are disproportionately impoverished, may face multiple economic and social challenges, and are frequently involved in the child welfare system, and adequate preparation for hospital discharge cannot be the pediatrician's responsibility alone; it requires hospital supports to appropriately assess and assist families. The immediate postnatal period is a time of high risk for mothers with opioid use disorder (OUD), especially if they lose access to medications for OUD, and recent data suggest that loss of access to medications for OUD after delivery is associated with overdose death. Partnering with mental health clinicians to provide comprehensive treatment is described as a key support to give mothers the best chance of remission of OUD and improved dyadic relational health, with maternal screening for treatable problems and referral to evidence-based, dyadic-focused interventions such as child-parent psychotherapy. Infants with opioid exposure are also at risk for adverse outcomes, including hospital readmission, so use of simplified electronic or print checklists can be helpful in improving discharge processes, and when possible, postdischarge care for the mother-infant dyad should be coordinated and comprehensive, with hospitals ensuring adequate handoffs and information transfer to postdischarge care providers including pediatricians, early intervention providers, and home-nurse visitation programs.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^48804d76]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The opioid crisis has grown to affect pregnant women and infants across the United States, as evidenced by rising rates of opioid use disorder among pregnant women and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome among infants. Across the country, pregnant women lack access to evidence-based therapies, including medications for opioid use disorder, and infants with opioid exposure frequently receive variable care. In addition, public systems, such as child welfare and early intervention, are increasingly stretched by increasing numbers of children affected by the crisis. Systematic, enduring, coordinated, and holistic approaches are needed to improve care for the mother-infant dyad. In this statement, we provide an overview of the effect of the opioid crisis on the mother-infant dyad and provide recommendations for management of the infant with opioid exposure, including clinical presentation, assessment, treatment, and discharge.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: a systematic review [^0cc1f005]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

A limitation of this study is the rigorous criteria used for including and excluding articles, which could have resulted in the exclusion of studies that reported commonly accepted indications for physical child abuse, particularly concerning radiographic findings. However, the intentional use of nonpooled data specifically focused on physical child abuse was a deliberate choice to ensure the study's results remained precise and specific to this form of abuse. Another limitation of this study was the variation in how data were reported in each article, which made direct comparison between articles difficult. This variability included how abuse was classified, as 'suspected', 'possible', or even 'probable,' which also limited comparable quantitative data, excluding the possibility of conducting a meta-analysis. In addition, many studies have focused on specific subpopulations or geographic regions, making it difficult to generalize findings to other populations.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^158c724c]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Child physical abuse — abdominal injury epidemiology and recognition indicate that children with abusive abdominal injuries were younger (2.5–3.7 years) than those with unintentional injuries (7.6–10.3 years), and mortality was higher (53% vs. 21%). In infants, 25% of abdominal trauma hospitalizations were the result of PCA, and data from the National Pediatric Trauma Registry reported 50% of abdominal trauma cases due to abuse. Presentation can be subtle, with abdominal wall bruising absent in up to 80% of children with abuse-related injuries, and associated abdominal injury was reported in 26% of abused children with acute rib fractures and 100% of children with thoracic or spine injuries. Hollow viscus injuries with late presentation significantly increase the rate of infectious complications and associated morbidity.

### Identifying child abuse fatalities during infancy [^9c9ec3d3]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Postmortem imaging — radiographic skeletal surveys and computed tomography (CT) imaging performed before autopsy may reveal traumatic skeletal injury or naturally occurring skeletal abnormalities; imaging should only be performed at the direction of the medical examiner or coroner, and skeletal survey and/or CT should be performed according to American College of Radiology guidelines and reviewed by an experienced radiologist, with prior imaging and thorough documentation considered. Radiographic skeletal surveys and CT performed before autopsy may reveal evidence of traumatic skeletal injury or skeletal abnormalities indicative of a naturally occurring illness, and the presence of both old and new traumatic injuries as well as fractures specific for abuse may suggest inflicted injuries. Ideally, such imaging should only be performed at the direction of the medical examiner or coroner, and protocols may be helpful. The skeletal survey and/or CT scan should be performed according to American College of Radiology guidelines as recommended for living infants in whom abuse is suspected and reviewed by a radiologist experienced in identifying subtle changes and findings confused with inflicted injuries. It is also important to review medical history for previous imaging that could show prior injuries or normal variants, and thorough documentation may require specimen resection, high-detail specimen radiography, CT, and histologic analysis to assess aging.

### The opioid dependent mother and newborn dyad: non-pharmacologic care [^70b75bbd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Opioid dependent pregnant and post-partum women and their infants are a complex and vulnerable population requiring individualized, comprehensive and multidisciplinary treatment. Though methadone maintenance in the setting of comprehensive service provision during pregnancy significantly improves pregnancy outcomes for opioid dependent women, its use has implications for the infant, most notably the Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). NAS is comprised of physiologic signs and behaviors that indicate a dysfunctional regulation of the central and autonomic nervous systems, and is variable in its expression in affected infants. The disorganized rather than adaptive behaviors displayed by each infant undergoing the effects of in-utero opioid exposure may impair basic functions such as feeding, sleeping, and the ability to be alert and communicate clear cues to caregivers. Understanding and responding to neurobehavioral dysfunction of the newborn may help to promote the infant's self-organization and self-regulating abilities. However, the substance abusing mother's physical and psychological wellbeing may be debilitated in the perinatal period, and her ability to recognize and respond to the newborn's cues may be limited. A multi-tiered comprehensive assessment and intervention of the methadone-maintained mother, her child, and the mother/infant dyad can improve early maternal nurturing interactions, a crucial component of early infant development, particularly in this vulnerable population. The purpose of this article is to review the contribution of maternal opioid dependency to the difficulties experienced by the mother-infant dyad and their treatment providers in the postnatal period, and the non-pharmacological treatment of the infants with suggestions for practical measures with emphasis on the treatment of the mother and baby as an interactional dyad.

Animal injury models for abusive head trauma (AHT) — animal models have been used to gain further understanding of injury mechanisms and injury thresholds when such information is not attainable using human subjects, with translatable outcomes to humans and animal welfare as key aims; the animal specimen must represent equivalent human structure and function with appropriate scaling, and the biologic response should parallel that of the human population; one research use is to gain insight into possible mechanisms of injury by subjecting an animal to similar mechanical phenomena that an infant or child might experience during an abusive event to enable understanding of predictors of outcome or response to interventions, and a second use is to facilitate study of factors influencing pathophysiology and evolution of injury by applying insults thought to be part of abusive head trauma and evaluating controlled variables, prognostic variables, or responses to treatment.

### Cutaneous signs of child abuse [^5d4176c6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Maltreatment of children is a major public health crisis, and it is estimated that each year more than 3 million children are victims of abuse. Safeguarding the welfare of children is a priority, and it is the moral and ethical responsibility of healthcare professionals to detect cases of abuse and intervene appropriately to prevent further harm. Clinicians are often challenged to differentiate signs of child abuse from skin conditions that mimic maltreatment. Because cutaneous injury represents the most recognizable and common form of abuse, dermatologists are often called upon to help distinguish signs of intentional injury from skin conditions that mimic maltreatment. However, few resources specific to dermatologic signs of abuse exist to aid in diagnosis. A review of the literature will provide an educational resource to assist dermatologists and other clinicians in differentiating cutaneous signs of child abuse, including physical and sexual abuse, from mimickers of inflicted injury.

Learning Objective

After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to distinguish signs of intentional injury from skin conditions that mimic maltreatment and understand the clinician's role in the diagnosis and reporting of cases of suspected child abuse.

### Identifying child abuse fatalities during infancy [^b20698fa]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Sudden unexplained infant death — Epidemiology, risk modifiers, and classification criteria are detailed: In US vital statistics, sudden unexpected infant death is the primary category of death for children between 1 and 12 months of age, with a peak incidence between 1 and 4 months of age and with 90% of these before the age of 6 months. Rates in 2013 were 2 to 3 times higher among non-Hispanic African American and American Indian or Alaskan Native children compared with non-Hispanic white children (172.4 and 177.6 vs 84.5 deaths per 100 000 live births, respectively). Increased risk for SIDS has been found with prone and side sleep positions, prenatal and postnatal tobacco and opioid exposure, sleeping on a soft surface, sharing a sleep surface with others, overheating, late or no prenatal care, young maternal age, preterm birth, low birth weight, and male sex; protective factors include breastfeeding, pacifier use, immunizations, and room sharing without bed-sharing, and there is no evidence that recurrent episodes of cyanosis, apnea, or apparent life-threatening events (brief resolved unexplained events) increase the risk. For classification, these deaths can be described as unexplained only when a complete autopsy has been performed with gross and microscopic findings failing to demonstrate an anatomic cause of death; there is no evidence of acute or remote inflicted trauma, significant natural disease, or significant and contributory unintentional trauma as judged by radiologic imaging, postmortem examination, and reliable clinical history; other causes and/or mechanisms of death, including meningitis, sepsis, aspiration, pneumonia, myocarditis, trauma, dehydration, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, significant congenital defects, inborn metabolic disorders, asphyxia, drowning, burns, and poisoning, have been sufficiently excluded as a cause of death; comprehensive testing has revealed no evidence of toxic exposure to alcohol, drugs, or other substances that may have contributed to death; and thorough review of the clinical history and death- and incident-scene investigation have revealed no cause of death.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^a8e7b288]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Screening and testing: mother and infant — In a community hospital cohort assessing universal maternal testing, 5.4% of pregnant women had a positive drug test at admission with 3.2% positive for opioids, and among women with a positive urine opioid result, 20% had a negative risk-based screen result. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) endorses informed consent for toxicology testing of pregnant women, and universal testing has resulted in disproportionately higher child protective services referrals for Black women compared with white women; pediatricians should be aware of and reduce institutional biases in implementing universal infant toxicology testing. For infants, toxicology testing can use urine, meconium, and umbilical cord tissue, and a urine sample should be collected as soon as possible after birth if the clinician is concerned because many drugs are rapidly metabolized and eliminated; after in utero exposure, opioids and their metabolites may no longer be detectable in an infant's urine after the first few days of life, and a positive urine screening result may only reflect recent exposure. Drugs excreted into the hepatobiliary system or fetal kidneys are concentrated in meconium, and meconium testing provides a longer window beginning as early as 20 weeks' gestation and is generally considered the gold standard, though collection can be labor intensive, require several days, and not reflect abstinence close to delivery; meconium must be collected before contamination by nonmeconium stools. Umbilical cord tissue testing is readily available at the time of birth and has logistic advantages; although some have suggested equivalence with meconium, other paired tests have been discordant, so clinicians should be mindful of modality differences and work with laboratories to determine the best testing modality. Infant toxicology testing should be completed when it will inform clinical management, and in some instances it would not be recommended, such as when a woman in treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is closely monitored and results are already available to the pediatrician.

### Toward the use of buprenorphine in infants for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome: summary of an NIH workshop [^64b93cd9]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The third session focused on feasibility and operational issues for a potential trial including buprenorphine for the treatment of NOWS. Numerous challenges exist. Identifying the most salient research question is challenging, given the variation in experiences for mothers with OUD and infants with NOWS, including what medication-assisted treatment (MAT) the mother received, when and how long she was treated during pregnancy, whether she received comprehensive treatment versus medication only, and if she used multiple substances during her pregnancy. Testable interventions might compare the effectiveness of the primary medications used among all infants with NOWS or compare the effectiveness of matching the infant's medication with the mother's MAT medication. Finding sufficient study sites for future trials may also be difficult, as many potential sites may not have equipoise for all study questions. Furthermore, many sites do not have the capacity to conduct these studies, as they do not have research pharmacy access to controlled-substance study drugs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The last session focused on next steps. Because current morphine, methadone, and buprenorphine formulations have much different routes of administration (oral versus sublingual), dose intervals, and weaning protocols, reliably masking study drugs is difficult. Selecting clinically meaningful neurodevelopmental and non-neurodevelopmental outcomes that allow feasible trial length and cost poses a formidable challenge as well. Because this study population may be in unstable living situations and infants are often placed in foster care, collecting long-term outcomes requires research staff to develop relationships with families, guardians, and stakeholders (e.g. foster care organizations and legal systems) to maintain contact and establish trust. Finally, several statistical considerations include selecting pragmatic, validated assessment instruments sensitive enough to quantify treatment effects and taking into account the myriad confounding factors (neonatal intensive care unit vs. special-care nurseries, varying non-pharmacologic approaches, polysubstance exposures in utero combined with post-natal adjuvant NOWS treatments, and clinical management practices).

In conclusion, considering the gaps in knowledge in whether and when to use buprenorphine to treat NOWS and the potential for better outcomes, a comparative-effectiveness, randomized controlled trial was recommended by the experts at the workshop to inform clinical practice. Numerous issues were identified during the workshop that need to be considered to design and implement this much needed study successfully.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^ff50c86b]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children

These guidelines are limited to the identification and treatment of STIs in prepubertal children. Management of the psychosocial or legal aspects of the sexual assault or abuse of children is beyond the scope of these guidelines.

Identification of STIs in children past the neonatal period strongly indicates sexual abuse. The importance of identifying a sexually transmitted organism for such children as evidence of possible child sexual abuse varies by pathogen. Postnatally acquired gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and T. vaginalis infection and nontransfusion, nonperinatally acquired HIV infection are indicative of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse should be suspected when anogenital herpes or anogenital warts are diagnosed. Investigation of sexual abuse among children who have an infection that might have been transmitted sexually should be conducted in compliance with recommendations by clinicians who have experience and training in all elements of the evaluation of child abuse, neglect, and assault. The social significance of an infection that might have been acquired sexually varies by the specific organism, as does the threshold for reporting suspected child sexual abuse (Table 8). When any STI has been diagnosed in a child, efforts should be made in consultation with a specialist to evaluate the possibility of sexual abuse, including conducting a history and physical examination for evidence of abuse and diagnostic testing for other commonly occurring STIs.

### Abusive head trauma in infants and children: technical report [^8c6bc32d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) prevention programs — takeaway points state that there is an evidence base among multiple initiatives that demonstrate AHT prevention programs improve caregiver knowledge on infant crying, the consequences of shaking an infant, and AHT in general. There is an evidence base among several initiatives that demonstrate AHT prevention programs improve caregiver response of walking away when frustrated or agitated by a crying infant. There is a small evidence base that indicates initiatives to reduce infant crying are effective, and there is a small evidence base that indicates AHT prevention programs reduce AHT incidence rates. Additional findings note that implementation of the Period of PURPLE Crying program diminished pediatric emergency department visits for crying and that similar positive results for caregiver response in walking away to frustration events have been reported for the Take Five Safety Plan for Crying initiative and the All Babies Cry initiative.

### Caregiver reports of infant distress and injury in abused infants [^b2dfa507]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine whether in infants evaluated for physical abuse, medical encounters for infant distress are correlated with physical abuse or a history of sentinel injuries.

Study Design

This retrospective, case-control analysis of infants aged < 12 months evaluated for physical abuse identified demographic characteristics, prior injuries, and medical encounters for infant distress. Variables were compared between abused infants and nonabused infants with and without sentinel injuries. A nonparametric recursive classification tree analysis assessed interactions between variables.

Results

Infant distress was associated with abuse (67.9% vs 44.7%; P = 0.008; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3–5.2). Infants with sentinel injuries had higher rates of infant distress (74.1% vs 42.4%; P ≤ .001) and crying (81.5% vs 62.7%; P = 0.012). Previous falls (32.6% vs 18.1%; P = 0.03) and nonsentinel injuries (18.2% vs 5.4%; P = 0.002) also were associated with abuse, although sentinel injuries were the most important predictor of abuse, followed by infant distress.

Conclusions

Infants with medical encounters for distress and injury may be at higher risk for abuse and may benefit from intensive educational and support services for their caregivers. Additional research evaluating the most effective interventions for caregivers of fussy infants is needed.

Neonatal opioid exposure — testing and social risk assessment note that multiple modalities of testing should be considered for the infant, including, infant urine, meconium, and umbilical cord tissue testing; for women in treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) who receive frequent toxicology testing, infant meconium and/or umbilical cord tissue testing may not be necessary; for many substances, urine toxicology only captures a short window of substance use for some systems; and pediatricians should assess additional social risks, including, but not limited to, food and housing insecurity, and connect to community resources.

### NICU discharge preparation and transition planning: guidelines and recommendations [^db7f5478]. Journal of Perinatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Some families will be considered high-risk and may need extra attention as part of the discharge planning process. Some examples of high-risk families include but are not limited to the following: families where there is active substance use or history of substance misuse, those who received inadequate prenatal care, teenage parents, those experiencing interpersonal violence, families experiencing housing or food insecurity, families where there is significant relationship instability, those with diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health conditions (especially anxiety or depression), families with limited socioeconomic resources, caregivers with low functional health literacy, those where a family member is incarcerated, and transient or migratory families. The reason a family is high-risk and how that information was discovered should be treated as private and sensitive information. This means that access to the information should be limited to those who need to know. To the extent possible, there may need to be an assurance of professional confidentially so that families feel comfortable disclosing information. If information can be used to potentially cause harm, such as a disclosure of substance use, families should be advised of the risks of disclosure and every effort should be made to limit the harm that the sharing of this information may lead to. If they are going to provide ethical care, staff should be aware of their own explicit and implicit biases and try to minimize their influence on the family and home assessment process.

A documented system of early intervention referral and communication with community resources is needed for babies going into foster or custodial care.

Always start by asking permission and explaining the purpose of doing an assessment or screening. A sample introduction could be, "I'd like to ask you more about your family and who's helping you already so that we can plan next steps together." Some other open-end questions include:
Where are you currently living? Is this where you will be living after discharge or will you be moving?
Who lives in the home with you? Who stays with you regularly? Who visits?
Are there any family members (e.g. extended family) or other support people who live near you?
Who are the support people that your family relies on?
Is there anything that the NICU staff should understand about your family to better serve you?
Are other children in the family receiving any services or supports? Do they have any unmet needs?
Who contributes to your family financially and economically? Who helps meet your needs?
How is your family's health care covered and paid for?

Takeaway points — There is an evidence base among multiple initiatives that demonstrate AHT prevention programs improve caregiver knowledge on infant crying, the consequences of shaking an infant, and AHT in general. There is an evidence base among several initiatives that demonstrate AHT prevention programs improve caregiver response of walking away when frustrated or agitated by a crying infant. There is a small evidence base that indicates initiatives to reduce infant crying are effective. There is a small evidence base that indicates AHT prevention programs reduce AHT incidence rates.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^fb6be216]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Assessment and clinical presentation — maternal and infant risk factors and confounders: Assessment of infants with opioid exposure should include a thorough maternal history and clinicians should also assess family needs; when evaluating infants with signs consistent with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), it is also important to consider other diagnoses that present similarly. The clinical presentation or risk of NOWS varies by opioid type, maternal drug history, maternal metabolism, placental transfer and metabolism, and infant metabolism and excretion, and maternal use of other substances such as cigarettes, benzodiazepines, and gabapentin may influence onset, severity, or duration. Higher cumulative opioid exposure may increase the risk of NOWS among infants exposed to immediate-release prescription opioids; however, studies of the relationship between maternal methadone and buprenorphine dosage and risk or severity of NOWS have generally found no relationship.

### Evaluating young children with fractures for child abuse: clinical report [^dda3bb4f]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Physical examination — growth and injury findings advises performing a comprehensive physical examination, including careful review of the growth parameters; growth parameters outside of expected may indicate neglect or may suggest genetic (eg, OI), endocrine, or metabolic disorders; it is important to document any signs or symptoms of fractures, such as swelling, limitation of motion, and point tenderness.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^78be2953]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — historical features for evaluating a potential brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) enumerates key domains and example questions: "Considerations for possible child abuse" (including "History of unexplained bruising" and "Incongruence between caregiver expectations and child's developmental stage, including assigning negative attributes to the child"), "History of the event" (who reported/witnessed, where it occurred, position, feeding, and "Objects nearby that could smother or choke?"), "State during the event" (for example, "Choking or gagging noise?," "Conscious? Able to see you or respond to voice?," "Breathing: yes/no, struggling to breathe?," and color changes), end and post-event details ("Approximate duration of the event?," "Treatment provided by parent/caregiver (eg, glucose-containing drink or food)?," and "Back to normal immediately/gradually/still not there?"), recent history and symptoms ("Illness in preceding day(s)?" with examples such as "fever, congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, vomiting, diarrhea"), past medical history (e.g., "Reflux? If yes, obtain details, including management"), and family history including "Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- or second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant?" as well as "Long QT syndrome?" and "Arrhythmia?".
