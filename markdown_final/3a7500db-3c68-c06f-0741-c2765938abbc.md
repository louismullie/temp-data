## Question

A watermelon weighs 23 pounds. If Farmer Kent sells his special watermelons for $2 a pound, how much money would he make for selling 18 watermelons of the same weight?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much money Farmer Kent would make from selling 18 watermelons, each weighing 23 pounds, at $2 per pound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total weight of all watermelons. Then, I should verify the price per pound and ensure the units align. Next, I will multiply total weight by the unit price to get the total revenue. Finally, I will double-check the arithmetic and consider whether any of the provided references affect the calculation before stating the answer.

> Let me first confirm the total weight. Each watermelon weighs 23 pounds, and there are 18 watermelons, so the total weight is 23 pounds multiplied by 18, which equals 414 pounds. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 20 times 18 is 360, and 3 times 18 is 54, so 360 plus 54 is indeed 414 pounds.

> Next, I should review the pricing. The problem states Farmer Kent sells the watermelons for $2 per pound, so the unit price is $2 per pound. I need to ensure the units match before multiplying, and here they do: pounds times dollars per pound will yield dollars.

> Now, I will calculate the total revenue. Total revenue equals total weight times price per pound, so 414 pounds times $2 per pound equals $828. Hold on, I should double-check that: 400 times 2 is 800, and 14 times 2 is 28, so 800 plus 28 is 828 dollars.

> I should confirm whether any of the provided references alter this calculation. The documents discuss watermelon pricing in different contexts, such as Vietnamese farmers selling watermelons domestically at very low prices during COVID-19 disruptions, but none of those figures change the arithmetic for this specific scenario with a fixed price of $2 per pound and 18 watermelons at 23 pounds each. Therefore, the calculation stands as is.

> Final answer: Farmer Kent would make $828 from selling 18 watermelons at $2 per pound, each weighing 23 pounds.

---

Farmer Kent would make **$828** by selling 18 watermelons at $2 per pound, since each watermelon weighs 23 pounds. Total revenue = 18 × 23 × $2 = **$828**.

---

## Calculation

- **Weight of one watermelon**: 23 pounds
- **Price per pound**: $2
- **Number of watermelons**: 18

Total revenue = weight per watermelon × price per pound × number of watermelons\
Total revenue = 23 × 2 × 18 = **$828**

---

## Conclusion

Farmer Kent would earn **$828** from selling 18 watermelons at $2 per pound.

Income and productivity loss

The disruption to the nation's economic activities has resulted in a shortage of work, loss of income and financial uncertainties, particularly for informal, low-skilled and blue-collar workers.

As an attempt from the government to mitigate the economic impact of the outbreak on individuals, quarantined cases being held outside of the home are entitled to a daily food allowance of 60,000 VND (US$2.59), while those remaining at home as part of the quarantine measure receive 40,000 VND (US$1.72). Given that the average monthly wage in Vietnam is US$150, this would slash an individual's income by 2–3 times while remaining in quarantine and unable to work. Assuming they are released after 14 days and could resume work again, social stigma directed toward people who have returned from an epidemic area could hinder their chance of returning to work promptly. For the residents in the locked down communes, it would likely be much longer than 14 days before they can exit their residential areas and return to the city or other provinces for work. In such cases, the loss of income could be felt over the course of weeks or months.

Other noteworthy cases of affected groups are farmers. Hundreds of hectares of land with massive unsold stocks are the results of closed borders. In one particular scenario, farmers are forced to sell their watermelons domestically at around 1,000 VND (US$0.043) per kilogram, down from the 8,000 VND (US$0.34) they had hoped for. This is not enough to break even, let alone to make ends meet. At this rate, farmers are losing over US$4,000 per hectare in overhead costs for the season, leaving them in a precarious state (figure 2).

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Watermelon and dietary advice compared to dietary advice alone following hospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum: a randomized controlled trial [^111M2mSE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

We avoided the mention of watermelon as much as possible during the recruitment process to minimize confounding arising from women in the control arm being motivated to consume watermelon. The study title in the Patient Information Sheet was "The effect of standard dietary advice in hyperemesis gravidarum patients: a prospective trial"; this approach was approved by the Ethics board.

The randomization sequence was generated in random blocks of 4 or 8 using random number generator at random.org by investigator (co-author PCT) who was not involved in enrolment. Numbered sealed opaque envelopes were prepared. The lowest numbered envelope available was assigned to the newest recruit. Randomization was by opening the sealed envelope just prior to discharge.

Participants randomized to watermelon and dietary advice leaflet were supplied with two fresh red-fleshed watermelon (approximately 4 kg weight) to take home (Supplementary material S 1) in addition to the dietary advice leaflet which they were advised to read and heed. The watermelons were sourced from a local supermarket at approximate cost of USD 3 per fruit. Written instruction was given on fruit handling, storage and hygiene (Supplementary material S 2). These participants were instructed to consume 1/8 of the whole fruit flesh daily, in further divided portions for the following two weeks and to read and heed the dietary advice leaflet. The advice leaflet was sourced online from a UK NHS university hospital trust website and freely available for patient information. Participants randomized to advice leaflet were provided with an identical advice leaflet to read and heed.

Identical, commercially procured ordinary electronic weighing scales (providing weight measure in 0.1 kg increments) were provided free of charge to every participant for their exclusive use within the trial. The participants used their allocated personal weighing scale for the predischarge, week 1 and week 2 weighings. A written standard operating procedure provided instructions on the timing, clothing worn and bladder emptying requirements for the weighing (Supplementary material S 3). At each weighing, three weights were obtained with the middle value taken if all three were discrepant and the concordant value taken if at least two of the three readings were identical,

Participants were not blinded to their allocated intervention as the nature of the interventions were obvious. However, the mention of watermelon was avoided prior to randomization and subsequently in interaction with the controls.

### Watermelon and dietary advice compared to dietary advice alone following hospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum: a randomized controlled trial [^1167Nejg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

In overweight and obese adults, daily consumption of watermelon elicited more robust satiety responses, decreased body weight and body mass index. These findings are in contrast to ours on weight change metrics and better appetite with daily watermelon consumption in the very different context of HG rather than for weight control. Dietary compensation is weaker for beverage compared to solid form with total daily energy intake significantly higher with watermelon juice than watermelon fruit; thus watermelon juice may have greater potential for promoting positive energy balance but this premise on watermelon texture is not tested in our HG trial.

Rehospitalization for HG within the next two weeks of the trial period was 9.4%-9.5%; this compared with a 2009 trial report from our center that reports a rehospitalization of 21.1–37.5% in the two weeks after hospital discharge for HG; indicating that the dietary advice leaflet might have a positive effect when compared to historic data. 93.8–98.4% of participants in this trial were discharged with solely oral metoclopramide: intravenous metoclopramide is first line antiemetic in our center for the inpatient treatment of HG with good response and responders were continued with metoclopramide orally after discharge.

### Watermelon and dietary advice compared to dietary advice alone following hospitalization for hyperemesis gravidarum: a randomized controlled trial [^113L2YzD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Weight change metrics over the 2 weeks trial period following hospital discharge for HG were significantly better for the watermelon arm both at the end of the first week and through to the end of the second week as hypothesized. PUQE-24, SNAQ and wellbeing point estimates were also better at end of week 1 in the watermelon arm but these across arm differences only reached significance at the 5% level by the end of week 2. In addition, maternal satisfaction was higher and recommendation of intervention rate to friend or family of allocated intervention was also higher in the watermelon arm. The confluence of these findings points to a consistent positive impact of watermelon. However, on rehospitalization for HG, there was no difference.

By the end of week 2, there was a 0.75 kg difference in weight change across trial arms, equivalent to body weight change of about 1.4%. HG has been defined as protracted NVP with the triad of more than 5% prepregnancy weight loss, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. In pregnancies affected by HG, inadequate total maternal weight gain and not regaining prepregnancy weight by week 13–18 is associated with small for gestational age and lack of catch-up in gestational weight gain up to the 2nd trimester associated with reduced fetal growth.

### Healthy housing reference manual [^116xJ1T9]. CDC (2006). Medium credibility.

Definitions of terms related to chlorination — chlorine concentration is measured in parts per million (ppm), and in 1 million gallons of water a chlorine concentration of 1 ppm would require 8.34 pounds of 100% chlorine. For surface water systems, a contact time of 20 to 30 minutes is common. Parts per million is a weight-to-weight comparison in which 1 ppm equals 1 pound per million pounds and, because water weighs 8.34 pounds per gallon, it takes 8.34 pounds of any substance per million gallons to equal 1 ppm; in water chemistry, 1 ppm equals 1 mg/L. Residual is the amount of chlorine left after the demand is met and total available chlorine = free chlorine + combined chlorine. Breakpoint chlorination is described as a process sometimes used to ensure the presence of free chlorine in public water supplies by adding enough chlorine to satisfy the chlorine demand and to react with dissolved ammonia, and dosage is the total amount of chlorine added to water given in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).

### Subsidized sachet water to reduce diarrheal disease in young children: a feasibility study in accra, Ghana [^115L3U5P]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Interventions.

The primary intervention was distribution of vouchers for bags of sachet water every 2 weeks. Households in the full-subsidy arm received vouchers for 15 L of sachet water (30 × 0.5 L bags) per week for each eligible child for a period of 4 months. The value of each 15-L voucher was US$0.63. Households in the partially subsidized arm received vouchers to obtain the same weekly volume of sachet water but at a 50% discount. The water quantity used for the intervention was based on daily recommendations for fluid intake in young children. The World Health Organization recommends a daily liquid intake of 1 L/day for children weighing 10 kg and 0.75 L/day for children weighing 5 kg. In the United States, the recommendation is a liquid intake of 0.8 L/day, including 0.6 L/day of beverages (e.g. breast milk, juice, or water), for children 7–12 months of age, and 1.3 L/day for children 1–3 years of age, including 0.9 L/day of beverages. The water quantity provided in the intervention exceeded those recommendations to allow for increased liquid consumption due to the hot climate and some consumption by other household members.

In both subsidy arms, the children's caregivers (a household member aged 18 or over, with primary caring responsibilities for the child[ren]) were instructed to make sure children drank exclusively sachet or bottled water. Sachet water was distributed via existing markets: local stores and kiosks were given a small initial payment and then reimbursed for the vouchers collected, plus a 10% commission. Before the start of the intervention, a sample of 34 sachets were collected from vendors in the study area, transported on ice to a laboratory, and tested for total coliforms, E. coli, and total heterotrophic bacteria. All 34 samples were compliant with national regulations for these parameters. In the first 4 weeks of follow-up, households were asked to retain any used sachet sleeves from vouchers for the research team to collect. Thereafter, because it transpired, there was a waste collection system in both neighborhoods that paid for bundles of used sachets, the research team simply asked to see the used sachets.

Wellbeing score, satisfaction with intervention score and recommendation of intervention to a friend rate were all also significantly higher in the watermelon arm. However, rehospitalization for HG rate 6/64 (9.4%) vs. 6/63 (9.5%) RR 95% CI 0.99 (0.34–2.89) P = 0.98 and antiemetic usage metrics were not different. No participant suffered major harms of food poisoning or Wernicke's encephalopathy within the trial follow up.

### Blenderized watermelon consumption decreases body mass index, body mass index percentile, body fat and HbA1c in children with overweight or obesity [^115sgRp9]. Pediatric Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Childhood obesity increases risk factors related to metabolic diseases. Watermelon's bioactive components can help reduce these risk factors. However, no study has investigated the effects of whole watermelon including both the flesh and rind or have assessed the impacts of any form of watermelon on children with overweight or obesity. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of whole-blenderized watermelon (BWM) consumption on cardiometabolic risk factors.

Methods

A randomized, cross-over clinical design was implemented. Boys and girls ages 10-17years with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile) consumed one cup of BWM or an isocaloric sugar-sweetened beverage (control) every day for 8weeks with a 4-week washout between trials. Anthropometrics, dietary, biochemical and clinical measures were obtained before and at the end of each trial.

Results

A total of 17 participants completed the study. Eight weeks of BWM intake significantly decreased BMI (p = 0.032), BMI percentile (BMIP) (p = 0.038), body fat percentage (p = 0.036), and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (p = 0.012) compared to the sugar-sweetened beverage. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption increased BMIP (p = 0.014) compared to baseline. No significant differences were observed for inflammation, blood glucose, insulin, lipids, liver function enzymes, and satiety hormones.

Conclusions

The results support that BWM consumption improved some cardiometabolic risk factors including BMI, BMIP, body fat, and HbA1c. Watermelon is a potential alternative to unhealthful snacks for improving anthropometry and some risk factors related to obesity in children.

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^112HJcWT]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This 1‐year randomized clinical trial provides evidence that NNS beverages may be an effective tool to aid in weight loss and maintenance, among regular users of NNS beverages, when used as part of a behavioral weight loss treatment program. In this equivalence trial design, when compared to the most commonly recommended beverage for good health, water 17, 18, NNS beverages were shown to be non‐equivalent and were superior for both weight loss 19 and maintenance. These findings are important as there continues to be uncertainty about the benefit of NNS for weight management based largely on observational studies showing associations between NNS consumption, obesity and weight gain 1, 2, 8. In addition, it has been suggested, based on some animal studies, that NNS promote obesity by interfering with normal mechanisms of energy balance through dissociating the link between sweet taste and metabolizable energy 3, 24. Results of the present trial are not consistent with the findings from observational studies in humans or studies in animals.

The present results are consistent with the few other published long‐term human trials that evaluated NNS for weight loss 12, 15. In a prospective randomized trial, Blackburn et al. found that people with obesity in a weight loss program using NNS food and beverage products lost more weight and maintained a greater weight loss over 2 years compared to subjects not using NNS 12. Tate et al. (2012) conducted a 6‐month randomized trial in people with obesity and found greater weight loss over 6 months and a greater likelihood of achieving a 5% weight loss in participants drinking beverages with NNS compared with participants in an attention control group. There was no difference in the likelihood of achieving a 5% weight loss between participants in the water group versus the control or between the water group versus the NNS group. Observational data from subjects in the National Weight Control Registry indicate that NNS beverages and foods are commonly used as tools to help maintain weight loss among individuals who maintained a weight loss of at least 30 pounds for at least 1 year 25, 26.

### Farmers' market incentives for low-income families: who uses, how much, and why [^112LJA9M]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Focusing on participation and utilization, this research helps to assess the potential impact and contributions of farmers' market incentive programs, often seen as means for improving nutrition and preventing disease among low-income families.

Methods

Evaluating the largest farmers' market incentive program in the U.S. (California Market Match), this study used (1) 3 administrative databases (n = 1,469, 6,799, and 30,506), (2) a participant survey (n = 2,723), and (3) longitudinal interviews (n = 163) with active and former participants. Quantitative data were analyzed with contingency tables and multiple regression. Qualitative data were coded into analytically significant themes. Data were collected in 2015–2018 and analyzed in 2018–2021.

Results

Participation was typically low and varied across localities (3.7%-19.8% of eligible families in a sample of ZIP codes). According to administrative records, market visits by participants in 2 California regions averaged 2.18 and 3.12 per season. However, 77.1% of participants in the shopper survey indicated that they were repeat customers, and 51.0% indicated that they were regular utilizers. Deterrents to utilization included perceptions of inconvenience and high prices but not availability of produce in the community or travel time to markets. Utilization was most frequent among Asian shoppers and residents of Southern California outside Los Angeles County.

Conclusions

Farmers' market incentive programs such as Market Match appear likely to benefit population health through a core of committed shoppers. Improvement in participation and utilization may be attained through a better understanding of the communities that the markets are intended to serve.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112KJwN7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society pediatric obesity — beverage intake and policy considerations: Fruit juice has no role in the diet of infants under 6 months of age, and after 6 months of age fruit juice must be limited to 4 to 6 ounces per day until children reach 6 years of age, after which 8 to 12 ounces is an acceptable serving; an Early Childhood Longitudinal Study — Birth Cohort of > 4000 children found that daily ingestion of fruit juice at 2 years of age resulted in an increase in BMI at 4 years compared with children who had no or infrequent fruit juice, with whole fruit providing increased nutritional benefit over juice. Since 1965, teens have doubled their consumption of sugar-sweetened and fruit-flavored beverages. School-based interventions can reduce soda consumption and reduce weight in students at the highest BMI percentiles, and although there has reportedly been a 95% decrease in the amount of regular sodas shipped to schools, other sweetened beverages have become more available in schools. Obese or normal weight children and adolescents who substituted noncaloric beverages in lieu of sugar-sweetened beverages had less of an increase in BMI at 1 year. As an alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages, the introduction of water jets to New York City elementary school students led to a 0.022 to 0.025 decrease in BMI and a 0.6% to 0.9% decrease in risk for overweight, possibly related to a 12.3% decrease in milk purchases. The Task Force placed a high value on decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages and a high value on strengthening the message to families that these beverages contribute to pediatric obesity, and the committee supports the suggestion by the WHO for worldwide tax leverage on calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods.

### Costs, contracts and the narrative of prosperity: an economic analysis of smallholder tobacco farming livelihoods in Kenya [^116gxEm6]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The tobacco industry has used the alleged negative impacts on economic livelihoods for tobacco farmers as a narrative to oppose tobacco control measures in low/middle-income countries. However, rigorous empirical evidence to support or refute this claim remains scarce. Accordingly, we assess how much money households earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers' decision to operate under contract directly with tobacco manufacturers and tobacco leaf-buying companies or to operate as independent farmers.

Methods

A stratified random sampling method was used to implement a nationally representative household-level economic survey of 585 farmers across the three main tobacco growing regions in Kenya. The survey was augmented with focus group discussions in all three regions to refine and enrich the context of the findings.

Results

Both contract and independent farmers experience small profit margins per acre, with contract farmers operating at a loss. Even when family labour is excluded from the calculation, income levels remain low, particularly considering the typically large households. Generally, tobacco farmers enter into contracts with tobacco companies because they have a 'guaranteed' buyer for their tobacco leaf and receive the necessary agricultural inputs (fertiliser, seeds, herbicides and so on) without paying cash up-front.

Conclusions

Tobacco farming households enter into contract with tobacco companies to realise perceived economic benefits. The narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic undertaking for smallholder farmers, however, is inaccurate in the context of Kenya.

### Don't just look east (the other way) when there's smoke billowing to the west [^114r5U1A]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Research is needed on various aspects of health and smoke. First, studies about the health effects of frequent but short-lasting rises in poor air quality (lasting < 1 h) are needed. Only annual and 24-hour averages for criteria air pollutants, of which PM 2.5 is one, are regulated, but we, as public health professionals, are concerned about significant health risks with even short-term spikes. This research could inform the creation of policy about regulatory limits for short-term spikes or mandates for greener harvesting. In addition, research on the differential health effects of smoke from various sources (sugarcane vs. other crops) is needed. Depending on which fertilizers or pesticides are used, smoke could contain toxic substances beyond PM 2.5.

That said, we should not wait for this research to adequately warn and protect communities living in this area. The death toll from pollution related to agricultural burning in Palm Beach County is estimated to be six excess deaths per year. The communities in southern Florida deserve a strong and engaged local department of public health. However, there have been few air quality health advisories issued for the citizens of Palm Beach County over the past 3 years, even when agencies in neighboring counties routinely issue health warnings. On October 3, 2023, when the Air Quality Index reached 111 because of transported smoke from the Canadian wildfires, the Florida Department of Public Health in Palm Beach County issued a health advisory. Warnings should be generated on the basis of projected smoke rather than measured smoke so that citizens can have enough lead time to protect their health. Burn permits should not be issued if projected smoke will disproportionately impact disadvantaged populations.

The sugarcane industry is a keystone of Florida's economy, and the financial incentive for cheap harvesting is obvious. However, this must be weighed against the cost of life in the surrounding predominantly disadvantaged communities. Similar burning practices have already been largely phased out in other countries, such as Brazil, in favor of greener harvesting strategies. There are various solutions available that would protect disadvantaged communities, such as requiring that mechanical harvesting be done near homes.

With the American Thoracic Society mantra in mind, "helping the world to breathe", we stand as advocates and leaders to protect the breathing of those in disadvantaged communities. We cannot simply look the other way on this matter (i.e. to the east while smoke billows to the west and poisons our disadvantaged neighbors).

### Costs, revenues and profits: an economic analysis of smallholder tobacco farmer livelihoods in Malawi [^111wsMqr]. Tobacco Control (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The preservation of the economic livelihood of tobacco farmers is a common argument used to oppose tobacco control measures. However, little empirical evidence exists about these livelihoods. We seek to evaluate the economic livelihoods of individual tobacco farmers in Malawi, including how much money they earn from selling tobacco, and the costs they incur to produce the crop, including labour inputs. We also evaluate farmers' decisions to contract directly with firms that buy their crops.

Methods

We designed and implemented an economic survey of 685 tobacco farmers, including both independent and contract farmers, across the 6 main tobacco-growing districts. We augmented the survey with focus group discussions with subsets of respondents from each region to refine our inquiries.

Results

Contract farmers cultivating tobacco in Malawi as their main economic livelihoods are typically operating at margins that place their households well below national poverty thresholds, while independent farmers are typically operating at a loss. Even when labour is excluded from the calculation of income less costs, farmers' gross margins place most households in the bottom income decile of the overall population. Tobacco farmers appear to contract principally as a means to obtain credit, which is consistently reported to be difficult to obtain.

Conclusions

The tobacco industry narrative that tobacco farming is a lucrative economic endeavour for smallholder farmers is demonstrably inaccurate in the context of Malawi. From the perspective of these farmers, tobacco farming is an economically challenging livelihood for most.

### Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods [^111V9zRB]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Method 1: diet diaries and food expenditures

All foods and beverages reported in each participant's coded 4-day diet diary were linked to corresponding items in the participant's receipts, collected during weeks 1–4 of the study. To compute the expenditure for each food portion of food or beverage consumed, the gram weight consumed was multiplied by the ratio of the purchase price over total grams purchased, correcting for edible portion (EP):

For example, the expenditure associated with a 1 cup portion (109 g) of fresh apple that was purchased for $1.49/pound (454 g) was 109 g × $1.99/(454 g × 0.90) = $0.531. Overall, approximately 80% of all foods and beverages consumed were accounted for in the participants' receipts. For missing receipt data, expenditures were imputed using food prices collected by study staff. The posted price was recorded for the product and matched for details provided by the participant. The key details were product brand, type, package size and the retail outlet from which it was purchased. When product or retail outlet information was not available, the closest match was identified from among three major supermarket chains (described below) and the lowest price was recorded. Expenditures were calculated for each day and were averaged over the 4 days.

Method 2: diet diaries and supermarket prices

Each item in the coded 4-day diet diary was matched with one of the foods in the database of supermarket prices for 384 foods and beverages in 152 categories. The database has been described before and contains lowest, non-sale prices collected from three major supermarket chains in the region as described previously. In brief, prices were collected from May to July 2006 from Safeway, Albertson's and Quality Food Centers (a subsidiary of Kroger), which were selected because of their large market share in the region. Prices were obtained during in-store visits and from supermarket home shopping websites (Safeway and Albertson's), which reported to list the same prices as those available to in-store customers. When no exact match from the 384 products was available, the closest match from among the broader food categories was used. As in Method 1, daily totals were computed and 4-day means were derived.

### Sustainable food systems and nutrition in the 21st century: a report from the 22nd annual harvard nutrition obesity symposium [^116siyJT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Food systems encompass everything from food production (and the ecological systems that underlie it) to the processing, packaging, distribution, retail, and consumption of foods, with many critical outcomes vital to sustainable development. Such outcomes include providing diets for nutrition, supporting livelihoods, and contributing to environmental and social benefits (Figure 1). Many components of food supply chains and food environments influence food systems' functionality, efficiency, and their relations with other health, education, and economic systems. Food systems are complex. They have many moving parts where diverse actors pull various levers and push food systems in different directions.

FIGURE 1
Food Systems Framework. Source: Fanzo et al.

Food systems affect everyone, in that they involve ∼1.5 billion producers (with one-third being smallholder farmers managing < 2 hectares of land) that feed almost 8 billion people. Although the number of producers is significant, there is increasingly a smaller number of actors and organizations that control the inputs to produce food (e.g. seeds, chemicals, animal breeds) and the trading, processing, packaging, distributing, and selling of food.

Food systems are critical to the types of foods that are available and accessible to consumers. They are the backbone of global diets and have become more connected, globalized, and efficient at moving a diversity of food worldwide. Although food systems have reaped many benefits for society, there are alarming trends that are affecting human health and the environment. As diets have become more diverse in terms of foods offered, a healthy diet remains unaffordable for many individuals. The composition of diets has also become increasingly made up of highly processed, packaged foods that consist of added sugars, high amounts of sodium, and unhealthy fats and chemical additives that are detrimental to human health. The quality of the world's diets influences health outcomes: the Global Burden of Disease identifies the makeup of diets as a significant risk factor for mortality and morbidity, with 11 million deaths and 255 million disability-adjusted life years attributable to dietary risk factors including high intake of sodium and low intake of whole grains and fruits. Diets — and the operationalization of food systems — also contribute to significant environmental degradation and climate change. Demand for animal-source foods is also increasing, particularly in emerging economies, which entails risks for the environment, including biodiversity loss, deforestation, and nutrient runoff into waterways, as well as animal welfare concerns.

### Recent declines in salmon body size impact ecosystems and fisheries [^114pyNcQ]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To calculate the change in female fecundity, we used fecundity–length relationships to estimate the fecundity of the average female before 1990 and after 2010 and found the difference. We used published, species-specific fecundity–length relationships estimated for populations within Alaska. Because fecundity data were not available for all regions, we based these relationships on high-quality datasets from representative populations within Alaska (Supplementary Table S4).

To consider the economic consequences of body size change, we focused on data sampled from commercial fisheries. For each location with sufficient data (three or more years in each time window), we asked how much higher per-fish ex-vessel prices would be if fish had not changed in size in the period between 1990 and 2010. That is, using current price-per-pound estimates, we compared the price of two fish: one that weighed the same as an average fish post-2010 and one that weighed the same as the average fish pre-1990. First, we identified the most recently reported ex-vessel prices for each species and region. For each species and region, we then multiplied the weight of the average pre-1990 salmon by its corresponding price-per-pound to calculate the average ex-vessel price for a pre-1990s salmon in today's market. This value was then subtracted from the average ex-vessel value of a post-2010 salmon, calculated in the same way, to estimate the change in ex-vessel per-capita salmon value due to salmon size change.

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^112dyLYy]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Measurements

All assessments, except for height, were conducted at baseline, 12 weeks (post‐weight loss phase) and 52 weeks (post‐weight loss maintenance phase). Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the screening visit prior to baseline and at 52 weeks with a wall‐mounted stadiometer. Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale. Waist circumference, measured at the top of the iliac crest, was determined based on two consecutive measures within 0.5 cm. Blood pressure (while seated) was recorded as the average of two measures. Standard venipuncture method was used to collect fasting blood samples for lipid and glucose measurements. Urine was provided for measurement of urine osmolality. Additional methodological details are described elsewhere 19.

Participants completed questionnaires at baseline and at 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks to assess changes in perceived hunger (using a 100 mm visual analog scale anchored at "not at all hungry" and "extremely hungry"). Beverage treatment adherence was determined from daily beverage logs collected monthly. Participants were compensated at intervals for meeting assessment requirements at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 (total compensation = $340).

Power of the study

The primary outcome addressed in this report is the change in body weight during the 1‐year trial. The study was designed as an equivalence trial with the hypothesis that there would be no clinically meaningful difference in weight between those consuming NNS beverages or water. The bounds of equivalence for between‐group differences at 1 year of weight loss were pre‐specified at ± 2.2 kg. Assuming the true difference was 0.73 kg (1/3 of the equivalence margin) and common SD of 4.2 kg, a sample size of 63 per arm was required using two, one‐sided t‐ tests to ensure at least 80% power with an alpha level of P < 0.05 to establish equivalence.

### Association between water consumption and body weight outcomes: a systematic review [^112CrkEY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Drinking water is often applied as a dietary means for weight loss and overweight/obesity prevention, but no evidence-based recommendation exists for this indication.

Objective

We summarized the existing evidence on the association between water consumption and body weight outcomes in adults of any body weight status.

Design

In a systematic review, we retrieved studies from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and COCHRANE), cross-references by PubMed functions and hand-searching, and experts' recommendations. Any type of study including adults aged > 18 y that reported the association between daily water consumption and any weight-related outcome, such as body weight, body mass index, or body weight classifications, was eligible.

Results

Of 4963 retrieved records, 11 original studies and 2 systematic reviews were included. In participants dieting for weight loss or maintenance, a randomized controlled trial, a nonrandomized controlled trial, and an observational longitudinal study showed that increased water consumption, in addition to a program for weight loss or maintenance, reduced body weight after 3–12 mo compared with such a program alone. In mixed-weight populations not primarily dieting for weight loss or maintenance, 2 short-term randomized trials showed no effect of water consumption on body weight; 6 cross-sectional studies showed inconsistent results.

Conclusions

Studies of individuals dieting for weight loss or maintenance suggest a weight-reducing effect of increased water consumption, whereas studies in general mixed-weight populations yielded inconsistent results. The evidence for this association is still low, mostly because of the lack of good-quality studies. This trial was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/Prospero as CRD42012002585.

### ": community perspectives on access barriers to visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) diagnosis and care in Southern gadarif, Sudan [^113uoeXq]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

An overarching barrier for accessing kala-azar care is the cost of an episode — being sick with kala-azar implies paying for multiple tests, treatments, and hospitalization. Financial constraints were given as the most plausible explanation for why kala-azar patients wait for weeks and months before going to the hospitals. The fact that the medicine is for free (and not the diagnostic tests) does not compensate for the considerable costs that the family has to spend from the pocket directly, and although we did not find evidence that treatment compliance is jeopardized, several coping mechanisms (such as borrowing or selling assets) were clearly in place. Financial barriers during the rainy season — due to increased transport cost related to the physical barriers — are particularly cumbersome for those without a stable income. Our findings are consistent with an earlier economic analysis of kala-azar in Sudan, which estimated the total cost at US$450 for an episode, totally unaffordable for most subsistence farmers in this area (61% of the population are reported to live below the poverty line of 250SDG [US$37] per month). Although women need their husband's permission to seek care in this culture, the delay is often due to lack of money. People also more readily travel to free-of-charge treatment centers or the ones known to offer more in-kind support (nutrition, etc.). However, the rigidly defined gender roles for women and their unequal access to resources compound more difficulties for women.

### Does the small farm exemption cost lives? [^116dDyrs]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Congress has exempted farms with fewer than 11 employees from enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Three states (California, Oregon, and Washington) do not observe the exemption.

Methods

We compared rates of fatal occupational injury in agriculture, by year, in 1993–2007, in California, Oregon, and Washington (aggregated), and the remaining states (as two aggregated groups): those with, and those without, state-designed occupational safety and health programs.

Results

Fatality rates were approximately 1.6 to 3 times as high in both groups of states observing the small farm exemption as in the group of three states not observing it. Comparisons excluding the agriculture industry showed weaker differences.

Conclusions

The three states' opting out of the small farm exemption may have had substantial direct effects. They may also reflect and/or encourage a generally more effective approach to occupational health and safety. Although alternative explanations must be considered, the stakes are high in terms of injury and loss of life; further investigation seems urgently indicated.

### Type 2 diabetes remission and lifestyle medicine: a position statement from the American college of lifestyle medicine [^114mDv1n]. American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Whole food, plant-based diets and energy density — calorie reduction strategies and associations: Control of SG can be accomplished, without negative side effects from medication, by reducing consumption of excess calories; this can be done in 1 of 2 ways: either by reducing the volume of food (holding energy density constant) or by reducing the energy density (holding the volume of food constant); in order of effect size, decreasing fat, increasing fruits and vegetables, and increasing water content decrease caloric content in ad libitum eating conditions; consumption of food with lower energy density has been found to produce satiety without feelings of hunger or deprivation, and portion size, independent of greater energy density, has been shown to affect satiety; the dietary pattern that offers the greatest reduction in fat and the greatest increase in fruits and vegetables and water content is a WFPB diet, which in observational studies largely overlaps with a vegan diet and is associated with lower BMI and prevalence of T2D; long-term prevention trials of T2D have applied diets emphasizing healthy dietary patterns with typical protein intake, and the primary goal of prevention of T2D is permanent weight reduction that can be achieved by healthy dietary patterns and increased physical activity.

### Changing behaviour for net zero 2050 [^111PrioZ]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Population level interventions to change behaviour for net zero diets and travel on land

Interventions that decrease the affordability of unhealthy unsustainable options and increase the affordability of healthier sustainable options would also help change public behaviour, particularly in combination. These include removing subsidies on high emission products such as livestock and fossil fuels and using taxes and other price based mechanisms to reflect the emissions associated with different products and activities.

The effect of price based interventions will depend on their size (eg, the price at which carbon is set) and the package of measures within which they are implemented. For example, participation in US energy conservation programmes varied by a factor of 10 depending on concomitant strategies and how the programmes were presented to participants. It will also vary by region, with more uncertainty about effects of interventions in middle and lower income countries where less evidence has been generated. A further layer of uncertainty reflects the difficulty of predicting collective behavioural responses to such interventions. Nonetheless, the strongest evidence on achieving changes in behaviour that would reduce emissions is for structural interventions. Given the need to halve emissions in the next decade, planning has to start now to implement all the interventions listed in table 1 and more, with evaluations designed into the rollout phases to enable rapid adjustments to optimise their outcomes.

Fair interventions

Interventions need to be fair and equitable as well as effective to gain public support, which in turn increases their political acceptability. Globally, the wealthiest 10% consume more than 20 times more energy than the poorest 10%. Pricing carbon on energy and land use at levels that could achieve net zero by 2050 — perhaps reaching more than $560 (£410; €480) per tonne of CO 2 equivalent — would increase the price of transport and food, disproportionately affecting the poorest and those living in rural areas. Any such policy would need to be part of a package that, at a minimum, shields poorer households but better, is part of broader sets of policies that tackle poverty and inequality both within and between nations.

### Retail prices, environmental footprints, and nutritional profiles of commonly sold retail food items in 181 countries [^115DtznG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Transitions towards healthier, more environmentally sustainable diets would require large shifts in consumption patterns. Cost and affordability can be barriers to consuming healthy, sustainable diets.

Objective

This study provides the first worldwide test of how retail food prices relate to empirically estimated environmental footprints and nutritional profile scores between and within food groups.

Methods

We use 48,316 prices for 860 retail food items commonly sold in 181 countries during 2011 and 2017, matched to estimated carbon and water footprints and nutritional profiles, to test whether healthier and more sustainable foods are more expensive between and within food groups.

Results

Prices, environmental footprints, and nutritional profiles differ between food groups. Within almost all groups, more expensive items have significantly larger carbon and water footprints. Associations are strongest for animal source foods, where each 10% increment in price is associated with 21 grams higher carbon footprint and 5 liters higher water footprint per 100kcal of food. There is no such gradient for price and nutritional profile, as more expensive items are sometimes healthier and sometimes less healthy depending on the food group, price range, and nutritional attribute of interest.

Conclusions

Our finding that higher-priced items have larger environmental footprints is contrary to expectations that a more sustainable diet would be more expensive. Instead, we find that within each food group, meeting dietary needs with lower environmental footprints is possible by choosing items with a lower unit price. These findings are consistent with prior observations that higher-priced items typically use more resources, including energy and water, but may or may not be healthful as measured by nutrient profile scores.

### Tackling psychosocial and capital constraints to alleviate poverty [^114N9bjS]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

These effects were driven largely by increases in off-farm business revenues and activities in all three arms (Extended Data Tables 2–4, Supplementary Tables 6, 9a, 9b, 11). Yearly household business revenues at the endpoint increased in the Capital arm (US$318.30, standard error = US$90.4, P < 0.001), Psychosocial arm (US$333.50, standard error = US$88, P < 0.001) and Full arm (US$540.50, standard error = US$96.3, P < 0.001). Following the intervention, households owned more off-farm businesses, often engaging in commerce or processing agricultural products, and beneficiaries allocated more labour to these businesses.

Increases in livestock and agricultural revenues also contributed to the overall impact on revenues, although less so than off-farm businesses, and with notable differences between treatment arms and over time (Extended Data Tables 2–5, Supplementary Tables 7–9b). Household livestock revenues increased at the endpoint, especially in the Capital arm (US$70.4, standard error = US$17.6, P < 0.001) and Full arm (US$72.6, standard error = US$18.2, P < 0.001), with marginally larger effects relative to the Psychosocial arm (differences of US$35.1, standard error = US$19.6, P = 0.074 and US$33, standard error = US$19.4, P = 0.09, respectively). The Capital and Full arms increased livestock asset value and labour allocated to livestock at both follow-ups, whereas the Psychosocial arm induced relatively less investment in livestock. By contrast, household harvest revenues at endpoint increased in the Psychosocial arm (US$91.1, standard error = US$23, P < 0.001) and Full arm (US$80, standard error = US$21.6, P < 0.001), with smaller effects in the Capital arm (differences of US$59.53, standard error = US$24.5, P = 0.016 and US$48.45, standard error = US$22.3, P = 0.03, respectively). This set of results suggests that the cash grants were partly used to accumulate livestock, whereas the psychosocial components contributed to the increase in agricultural revenues.

### Efficacy of a commercial weight management program compared with a Do-It-yourself approach: a randomized clinical trial [^113BS2QX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the efficacy at 3 and 12 months of a widely available commercial weight management program compared with a do-it-yourself approach?

Findings

In this 3-country randomized clinical trial that included 373 adults, reductions in weight were significantly greater at both 3 and 12 months for participants in the commercial weight management program, which included reduced requirements for dietary self-monitoring, than for participants using the do-it-yourself approach.

Meaning

This randomized clinical trial found that a commercial weight management program with reduced dietary self-monitoring produced clinically significant weight loss and may partially address the need for evidence-based approaches beyond the clinic setting.

### Financial markets value skillful forecasts of seasonal climate [^114sge58]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Scientific agencies spend substantial sums producing and improving forecasts of seasonal climate, but they do so without much information about these forecasts' value in practice. Here we show that financial market participants value the production of seasonal forecasts: options traders price the uncertainty generated by upcoming United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Winter and El Niño Outlooks. Each outlook affects firms throughout the economy, with total market capitalization of $6 and $13 trillion, respectively. A 1% improvement in the skill of the El Niño Outlook reduces firms' exposure to a one standard deviation shock by $18 billion and induces traders to spend an additional $2 million hedging the outlook's news.

### Effect of financial incentives and environmental strategies on weight loss in the healthy weigh study: a randomized clinical trial [^116Mo3CH]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Recruitment

For this study, we collaborated with 3 large urban employers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Initial outreach to employees used existing communication channels at each site. Interested participants were asked to access the Penn Way to Health (WTH) study platform for prescreening and eligibility ascertainment. WTH is a customizable web-based platform that supports recruitment, consent, randomization, and data collection for clinical trials.

Interventions

All interventions were conducted for 18 months. Participants in the 3 intervention groups received a free wireless scale (accurate to within 0.2 lb [0.09 kg]) to submit weights remotely. Participants in the usual care group did not receive wireless scales because it would not be consistent with usual care.

Financial Incentives

The lottery-based incentive group participants were given a weight-loss goal for the first 6 months of 0.5 lb (0.23 kg) a week. For each month from months 7 to 18, they were asked to set a goal to either maintain weight loss or lose more weight. Participants weighed themselves each morning, and their weights were automatically transmitted to the WTH system. Participants received automated verbal and graphic feedback on their progress relative to their goals and potential earnings.

Participants in the lottery group were eligible for a daily lottery prize with an expected value of $3.00 per day if they met their weight goal. Half of the winnings were paid out at the end of each month. To leverage loss aversion and the endowment effect to augment motivation, the other half was held in a virtual account and paid after 6 months if participants met or exceeded their monthly goals.

Treatment related effects on blood chemistries, subjective hunger, and physical activity time are shown in Table 3. Waist circumference decreased in both groups with the NNS group losing significantly more girth compared to the water group. Systolic blood pressure was reduced at 52 weeks in the NNS group and was significantly different than in the water group which saw no change from baseline. Both groups experienced significant declines in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and increases in HDL cholesterol as a function of weight loss although the difference between groups was only significant for triglycerides (P < 0.001). Urinary osmolality did not change with treatment and was not different between groups. Subjects in the water group reported feeling significantly more hungry at 52 weeks compared to baseline which was different than the NNS group which reported no increase in subjective hunger. Total amount of time spent engaging in moderate and vigorous activity increased similarly for both treatments over the year.

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^111YYsnP]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found no evidence that escalating lottery rewards resulted in significantly greater maintenance of weight loss than in an active control group. This finding occurred despite the incentives successfully increasing the frequency of participants weighing in at least 6 times per week. The incentive and control groups successfully maintained their initial weight loss, highlighting that this trial was conducted within a population of self-selected WW Digital members who not only achieved significant initial weight loss but who also were a small percentage (5.3%) of those eligible who chose to participate in this study.

Earlier work, indicated that a greater frequency of self-weighing was associated with greater weight loss. Based on that observation, we tested the premise that increasing the proportion of participants who self-weighed 6 or 7 days per week would enhance weight maintenance or increase further weight loss. Although we observed a 20–percentage point difference in the proportion of participants self-weighing at least 6 days per week, we did not observe any appreciable difference in maintenance of weight loss. Each of the following may have contributed to this finding: (1) in this self-selected group, participants in both groups were intrinsically motivated and did not need further inducements to succeed in maintaining weight loss; (2) the active control condition (with weekly feedback and wireless scale) was sufficiently potent that financial incentives provided no enhancement; (3) the incentive amounts or design were not sufficiently motivating; (4) the observation from the previous studyreflected differences in the type of people who self-weigh frequently rather than a causal relationship with weight loss; or (5) the degree of difference in self-weighing frequency was insufficient to lead to a difference in weight loss.

### Financial incentive strategies for maintenance of weight loss: results from an internet-based randomized controlled trial [^113HZukC]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2018). Low credibility.

Participants were considered at goal each day their transmitted weight was equal to or less than their goal weight for that week. Participants in the direct payment condition were eligible to receive US$2.80 each day their transmitted weight was at goal. For example, a participant who chose a weekly goal of −0.5 lb a week and succeeded in achieving their goal weight each day for 12 weeks would earn US$2.80 for 7 days a week for 12 weeks for a total of US$235. Participants in the lottery condition were eligible for a chance to win a daily prize each day their transmitted weight was at goal. Eligible lottery participants had an 18 in 100 chance of winning US$10 and 1 in 100 chance of winning US$100 for an expected value of US$2.80 per day. For example, a participant who chose a weekly goal of −0.5 lb a week and remained at goal weight each day for 12 weeks might win the small lottery 14 times and the large lottery once for a total of US$240. If a participant's lottery number was chosen but the participant did not transmit a weight or weight was above goal that day, a text message was sent indicating that the participant would have won the lottery if requirements had been met, an approach designed to induce anticipated regret and increase motivation. The monetary amount of US$2.80 per day was based on prior research demonstrating efficacy for weight loss.

In both incentive conditions, participants received their winnings via check every 3 months. The amount participants actually received depended on their in-person weight measurement at 3 and 6 months, respectively, relative to their goals. In other words, a participant 100% of the way toward the goal received the full winnings, but a participant 50% toward the goal received 50% of the winnings. For the direct arm example participant above who chose the −0.5 lb goal for 12 weeks, the expected weight loss would be 6 lbs; if the participant's in-person weight at the 3-month time point was only down 4 lbs, the participant would receive 4/6ths or 75% x US$135 = US$101.25. All participants were allowed to keep the scales and were compensated up to US$160 for participation in the study (US$30 for the visit at 3 and 9 months; US$50 for the visit at 6 and 12 months).

### Potential smoke-free dividend across local areas in england: a cross-sectional analysis [^117PUi4i]. Tobacco Control (2025). Medium credibility.

A limitation of our study is that it cannot provide information on what would be done with the money released to people who quit smoking if it were no longer spent on tobacco. This means that when we report our estimate of the potential smoke-free dividend to local economies, we are assuming that all the money that people who quit smoking get back would actually be spent locally on goods and services. That is a strong assumption, which is made for illustrative purposes in the knowledge that not all of that money would find its way into the economies local to where the people who smoke live. Research in the USA has suggested that following smoking cessation households spend less overall, suggesting that they might save the money previously spent on tobacco or use it to pay debts. Households were found to spend less on goods and in areas that were linked to their previous smoking, such as on alcohol and entertainment. The study also identified reduced spending on food at home following smoking cessation, although this was not sustained in the long run. Investigation of how resources previously spent on tobacco are reallocated is needed to improve understanding of the economic impact of stopping smoking. In particular, this study has not considered e-cigarettes; people who quit smoking may take up vaping and therefore still be spending money on addictive commodities. However, irrespective of how that money is spent, it is unlikely to be on a substance as harmful as tobacco. Finally, we assume that individuals include both legal and illicit spending in the total weekly spending they report, and also that the division of spending between these two sources is the same in all local authorities which may not be the case.

### Economic analysis of the health impacts of housing improvement studies: a systematic review [^111v6ibj]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2013). Low credibility.

Economic evaluations

Where budgets are constrained there is an unavoidable opportunity cost of undertaking any policy, as funds spent on one intervention will limit the funds available for other interventions. The aim of economic evaluation is to assist policy makers to identify interventions/policies which represent good value for money. The value for money associated with a new intervention is determined by comparing the additional costs required and additional outcomes achieved, with the status quo or current intervention. Where an intervention/policy provides greater outcomes at lower costs, it is said to 'dominate' the current intervention/policy and a decision about adopting the new intervention/policy is straightforward. However, where an intervention/policy provides greater outcomes at greater cost, a decision must be made about whether to spend these additional resources to achieve these additional outcomes. Where outcomes of different interventions/policies are valued using common metrics (see table 1), the value for money associated with them can be directly compared to indicate where these outcomes can be achieved at the lowest price. These interventions represent the best value for money compared with the alternatives available and, where resources are scarce, could be considered 'economically worthwhile'.

### 'We don't get money in our own hands': evidence from focus group discussions on economic abuse against women in two States of India [^1152fAfb]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Other participants listed instances that referred to the gold or jewellery that is commonly given to a bride by her natal family when she moves in with her family-in-law. This 'bequest dowry', referred to as 'streedhan' in India, serves as a premortem inheritance and is supposed to remain in the possession of the wife. Yet, several women indicated that their husbands had appropriated their streedhan against their will. One participant shared: ' My husband mortgaged my ornament and drank alcohol from that money' [34-year-old woman without employment, Maharashtra]. Other participants noted that their husband had used their gold for own purposes, for example, ' to buy something required for farming' [39-year-old woman without employment, Maharashtra] or ' to pay back his loan' [31-year-old woman without employment, Maharashtra].

Refusal to contribute financially

A recurrent narrative throughout the qualitative data referred to husband's refusal to contribute financial resources to (1) general household expenses, (2) health-related expenditures, (3) child-related expenditures and investments and (4) women's own needs. 15% of all coded statements referred to this category. It is important to note that we only included statements in which women had explicitly declared their husbands' refusal to contribute as expressions of inappropriate prioritisation of his own needs rather than as a consequence of a general lack of resources or poverty. For example, one woman noted: ' There was no money for food but he used to spend every day on alcohol' [24-year-old working woman, Rajasthan], and another one shared: ' He promises to buy things from the market, but he never buys anything' [27-year-old working woman, Maharashtra]. Several women complained that their husband's contributions to household expenses such as food or rent were insufficient and had to be topped up with their own money (' The only money he gives is for milk, tea and some vegetables, I take care of all other expenses'. [26-year-old working woman, Rajasthan]). In some more severe cases, the husbands' refusal to contribute financially even implied that ' the wife and children have to beg to eat sometimes' [27-year-old working woman, Maharashtra].

Conclusion

In conclusion, among participants enrolled in a comprehensive weight loss program, regular users of NNS beverages who were asked to consume NNS beverages lost significantly more weight, and maintained significantly greater weight losses, over 1 year than subjects asked to stop NNS beverage consumption and consume water alone. These results provide support for the use of NNS beverages as a tool to help with weight loss and maintenance.

### Why has the BMI gone up so drastically in the last 35 years? [^115yVQT3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

We attempted to answer the following questions: Why has the body mass index (BMI) increased so dramatically in the last 35 years? Are some food groups or additives more responsible than others?

Methods

Data for per capita food production available for consumption after spoilage for different food groups and additives from the US Department of Agriculture were used as independent variables to predict BMI increases. The heights and weights were taken from the Centers for Disease Control and the US Census Bureau for the years 1970 to 2004.

Results

The additives of fats and sugars in combination, not separately, best predicted increases in BMI accounting for 97% of the variance in the linear regression analyses. When all food groups were entered into regressions to predict increases in BMI, fats and sugars in combination accounted for 96% of the variance for women and 97% for men, with the other food groups adding very little. Path analyses showed that fat and sweeteners had direct effects on BMI and were also the mediators of increased caloric consumption.

Conclusions

In line with the major physiological theories emphasizing palatability as the addictive stimulus in models of incentives and addiction, fats and sugars in combination rather than calories per se or particular food groups accounted for the increases in BMI. These empirically based theories and data suggest that one should focus on palatability and addictive models in dealing with the increasing problem of obesity in the United States.

### Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis and planning for the future [^114EkDnR]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 AND THE U.S. ECONOMY

In early to mid-March, many U.S. state and local governments started implementing temporary restrictions on public life and nonessential work in an attempt to decrease the spread of the virus, leading to a temporary economic shutdown. Accordingly, U.S. economic output declined sharply and drastically for quarter 1 of 2020, with real gross domestic product decreasing at an annual rate of 5.0%. Simultaneously, the number of people filing for unemployment increased rapidly, reaching 43 million by the end of the second week in May. The unemployment rate increased from 3.5% in February to 14.7% in April, which, when considering all workers placed on temporary layoff, could have been as high as 22%. Simultaneously, U.S. retail sales declined by 16.4% (∼$80 billion) in April as compared with March 2020. In early May, the U.S. government started to place increasing emphasis on the necessary economic recovery from the COVID-19–related temporary shutdown. Given uncertainties about the further spread of COVID-19, it is not surprising that predictions about the shape and speed of economic recovery in the United States vary among experts and are adjusted continuously. For instance, predictions about the decline of real gross domestic product at an annual rate for quarter 2 of 2020 are in the range of 25%–40%, with an estimated growth of −5.6% for all of 2020 as compared with 2019. Of note, in the United States, consumer demand for goods and services has been a key element of economic growth over the past 50 years. Accordingly, as long as consumer confidence remains low, at least in part because of uncertainty about employment and health status, economic recovery will remain sluggish. In a recent survey among global business chief financial officers (91% from the United States), participants from all industries expressed less (!) optimism about the state of the economy and the financial prospects of their own company than during quarter 1 of 2020, and 60% did not expect a return to near-normal operating levels until sometime in 2021. In another survey among global business executives, only 48% of participants from North America expected a moderate or substantial improvement in the economy. The Congressional Budget Office projects a robust uptick in economic growth for the second half of 2020. Nevertheless, it may take until the end of 2021 or beyond for real gross domestic product to recover to pre–COVID-19 levels. Finally, global supply chains could be disrupted for an extended period.

### Pursuing sustainable productivity with millions of smallholder farmers [^111afQVL]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Sustainably feeding a growing population is a grand challenge, and one that is particularly difficult in regions that are dominated by smallholder farming. Despite local successes, mobilizing vast smallholder communities with science- and evidence-based management practices to simultaneously address production and pollution problems has been infeasible. Here we report the outcome of concerted efforts in engaging millions of Chinese smallholder farmers to adopt enhanced management practices for greater yield and environmental performance. First, we conducted field trials across China's major agroecological zones to develop locally applicable recommendations using a comprehensive decision-support program. Engaging farmers to adopt those recommendations involved the collaboration of a core network of 1,152 researchers with numerous extension agents and agribusiness personnel. From 2005 to 2015, about 20.9million farmers in 452 counties adopted enhanced management practices in fields with a total of 37.7million cumulative hectares over the years. Average yields (maize, rice and wheat) increased by 10.8–11.5%, generating a net grain output of 33million tonnes (Mt). At the same time, application of nitrogen decreased by 14.7–18.1%, saving 1.2 Mt of nitrogen fertilizers. The increased grain output and decreased nitrogen fertilizer use were equivalent to US$12.2 billion. Estimated reactive nitrogen losses averaged 4.5–4.7kg nitrogen per Megagram (Mg) with the intervention compared to 6.0–6.4kg nitrogen per Mg without. Greenhouse gas emissions were 328 kg, 812 kg and 434kg CO 2 equivalent per Mg of maize, rice and wheat produced, respectively, compared to 422 kg, 941 kg and 549kg CO 2 equivalent per Mg without the intervention. On the basis of a large-scale survey (8.6million farmer participants) and scenario analyses, we further demonstrate the potential impacts of implementing the enhanced management practices on China's food security and sustainability outlook.

### Afforestation or intense pasturing improve the ecological and economic value of abandoned tropical farmlands [^1141NcWw]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Economics

The modelled (afforestation) or measured (pasture) biomass production in the form of either timber volume (afforestation) or fodder for a specific number of cattle (pasture) forms the ecological data to be evaluated using local prices and costs. Local historical timber prices and harvesting expenses, reported in Supplementary Data 1, were applied to the afforestation areas to estimate the net revenues from timber production (see Supplementary Table 4 for biophysical timber production and 18 for financial household data). For pasture, extrapolation of simulated grazing generates expected fodder yield, and the number of cattle that can be fed is computed based on the measured nutrient value of the grass. Milk and meat yield, as well as corresponding prices and costs are given in Supplementary Data 1. The distribution of net revenues over the 20-year time period forms the basis for economic valuation (Supplementary Table 9). The sum of all discounted net revenues (NPV) is used to evaluate the economic returns from the various land-use options and discounting based on discount rates of 5 or 8%. Payback periods are calculated based on discounted net revenues (Supplementary Methods). For the scenario 'pasturing after forest clearing' (BAU), upfront net returns from forest clearing and pasture establishment were obtained from Knoke et al.and combined with subsequent net revenues from low-input pasture management (Supplementary Table 9). Uncertainty is modelled by means of MC simulation (3,000 repetitions for each restoration option) for the annual net revenues used to calculate NPV and payback periods. Here, net revenues are drawn as random variables for every single year of the 20-year period considered from a normal distribution with the previously estimated expected net revenue as the mean and the s.d. indicated in Supplementary Table 9. After completing the annual simulation of net revenues over the entire 20-year period, a random NPV and payback period are computed for all iterations and SEM is calculated according to equation (7). Year-to-year correlation is set to zero. This appears reasonable, because average year-to-year correlation of revenues (average price obtained times quantity produced) for 10 South American countries was 0.04 ± 0.21 according to a data set used by Knoke et al. Uncertainty coefficients for the land-use options in the study area are derived from coefficients of variation published in an earlier analysisin our study area. The coefficients of variation reflect compounded s.d. of prices and productivities from Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations time series data, as well as s.d. caused by failure due to fire (coefficients in Supplementary Table 9).

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^1133Y1iB]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we found that escalating incentives meant to encourage more frequent self-weighing in a population of volunteers who had experienced significant initial weight loss in a commercial weight management program succeeded in increasing the proportion of participants who weighed themselves at least 6 times per week but did not succeed in improving weight loss maintenance. However, both groups were successful in maintenance of initial weight loss, suggesting that, in this self-selected group of volunteers, further incentives, in addition to a wireless scale and weekly feedback, were not necessary to help them achieve weight loss maintenance.

### Outcomes in randomized clinical trials testing changes in daily water intake: a systematic review [^11669Q9y]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Weight Loss

Four studies (22%), evaluated the effect of water on weight change in participants with overweight and obesity. In 3 parallel group RCTs, adults with overweight and obesity randomized to consume 1500 mL of water per day before meals for a period of 12 weeks to 12 months had greater weight loss compared with those in the control groups (approximately 100%, 87%, and 44% more weight vs control groups).

In a fourth studyincluding 38 participants who reported drinking less than 1000 mL/d, drinking 2000 mL/d was not associated with weight over a 6-month period (effect estimate, 0.0 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0.1]; P = 0.88). The study recruited only 63% of its target, and at 6 months, the intervention group reported drinking 1135 (95% CI, 900 to 1400) mL/d. Compared with the other 3 studies assessing weight change, this study was distinct because it included adolescents aged 17 years or younger, whereas the other studies included adults only, and the water intervention in this study was not premeal intake.

Fasting Blood Glucose

Two studies (11%), assessed the effect of a water intervention on fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Sedaghat et alrandomized 40 patients with recently diagnosed (< 5 years) type 2 diabetes into a water intervention or control group that received no water recommendation. The water intervention consisted of drinking 250 mL before breakfast, 500 mL before lunch, and 250 mL before dinner for a total of 8 weeks. There was a significant between-group difference in mean change in FBG in the intervention (−32.6 mg/dL) vs the control group (5.3 mg/dL) (P = 0.003) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555). On the other hand, Nakamura et altested a water intervention consisting of drinking 550 mL within 2 hours of waking and 550 mL before bedtime and found that FBG increased by approximately 0.6 mg/dL after 12 weeks in both groups. This RCT consisted of 60 adults with baseline FBG between 90 and 126 mg/dL and excluded participants receiving medication and/or lifestyle modification for diabetes. Baseline FBG of study participants was approximately 97 mg/dL, substantially lower than that in Sedaghat et al, which was approximately 225.7 mg/dL in the intervention group and 221.7 mg/dL in the control group.

### Over-exploitation of natural resources is followed by inevitable declines in economic growth and discount rate [^113txUVy]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Choice of parameters

The parameter values used for all of the numerical simulations, which are given in the Source Data file, are within their realistic ranges. The rate of technological growth is around 1.5–2.0% year −1 in developed countries and is higher in some developing countries. In turn, the rate of growth in the yield per unit of sustainable harvest, g f, depends on the specific natural resource, where values that were considered in the literature vary from g c down to much lower (even negative) values. Next, the value of 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 (unitless) also depends on the particular system. In a fishery, for example, if non-sustainable harvest would imply catching all the fish and sustainable harvest would imply keeping the fish population size fixed, then a would be the growth rate of the fish (i.e. 2% year −1 for large fish and higher rates for smaller fish); In agriculture, sustainable management implies the use of environmentally friendly pest control methods and effective water management, which may result in a comparable crop yield (α ≲ 1), but may be more expensive (λ > 1). In turn, the ratio between c (t) and the direct costs, C 1 and C 2 (Eq. 9), determines the relative portion of c that is needed per unit of harvest. Specifically, c (and thus the ratio) is initially small but increases due to technological changes. Also, C 1 and C 2 may vary with x 1 and x 2 if the cost varies among regions (e.g. if near-shore regions are depleted, the average direct cost of harvest may increase). Next, note that 0 ≤ μ ≤ 1 (unitless) can be chosen arbitrarily by the policymaker, as it does not affect the harvest strategy and the future value of the natural resource; rather, it determines the currency unit, which, in turn, determines the relative role of the discount and the price in determining the future value of the natural resource. A reasonable choice would be the portion in the basket of goods of the natural resource (e.g. the portion of agricultural products in consumption is ~5% in the United States and is higher in various developing countries), but μ may be higher if non-market goods are incorporated. Finally, a variety of utility functions that incorporate both c and f were suggested in the literature, including the two that are used here (Eqs. B2, B10), where estimates of η vary between 1 and 3 (unitless), and suggested values for ρ varies between 0 and 3% (year −1).

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^116ukzRZ]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

There is continued controversy regarding the potential benefit of non‐nutritive sweeteners (NNS) for body weight management 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Some observational studies have reported a positive association between NNS consumption and BMI and weight gain over time 1, 2, 8, questioning the benefit of NNS for weight management. Observational studies, however, are unable to establish cause and effect. Randomized trials comparing foods and beverages sweetened with NNS versus caloric sweeteners have generally found that risk of weight gain is reduced among subjects consuming NNS 9, 10, 11. There have been relatively few long‐term (≥ 1 year) randomized trials of NNS for weight loss and maintenance 12, 13, 14. In particular, there have been few studies comparing beverages sweetened with NNS to water 13, 15, 16, which is the recommended beverage for maintaining good health 17, 18.

Because of the relative paucity of data examining the long‐term effects of NNS consumption on body weight management, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of low‐calorie sweeteners as a strategy for long‐term weight loss and weight maintenance 17. The Committee recommended that further prospective research was needed to establish the effects of low‐calorie sweeteners on body weight and other health outcomes.

This article reports data from a year‐long trial comparing beverages sweetened with NNS to water as part of a behavioral weight management program consisting of 12 weeks of active weight loss and 40 weeks of weight maintenance. Results from the 12‐week weight loss phase of this trial were published previously and showed non‐equivalence, with the NNS group showing greater weight loss at 12 weeks than the water group 19.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) overdrinking prevention — participant education on an osmotically driven "drinking to thirst" approach is an important prevention strategy, and individualized fluid replacement can be estimated from body weight changes such that every 1 pound of body weight lost should be replaced with 470 mL [16 oz] of fluid. Weight changes are not a reliable approach for excluding a diagnosis of EAH; in the presence of weight gain during exercise, fluid intake should be reduced, because no person should gain weight during exercise, and reducing fluid availability has been shown to reduce the incidence of EAH during endurance events. Participants in endurance athletic events or strenuous wilderness activities should focus on avoiding overdrinking during the activity (Recommendation grade: 1A), and participants should drink according to thirst or determine an estimation of individual fluid needs during pre-event training by assessing body weight losses per hour, which limits the potential for weight gain (Recommendation grade: 1C).

### MSH1-induced heritable enhanced growth vigor through grafting is associated with the RdDM pathway in plants [^115WecDS]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In 2018, a single-location trial was conducted by a third-party company in Huasna, CA. Graft progeny generation-4 seedlings were transplanted on 19 March 2018 and the final plant evaluation was taken on 7 September 2018. Plants were spaced 18 inches apart in raised beds with 6.66 feet between each bed for a final planting density of 4360 plants per acre. The soil had a pH of 7.4, a cation exchange capacity of 23 meq per 100 g soil, and 2.5% organic matter. The soil texture consisted of 37% sand, 29% silt, and 34% clay particles. Plot size was defined as 15 plants and yield evaluation was taken from the inner 11 plants. Total of three generation-4 entries were replicated six times in a RCBD. A standard fertility program was used for the area and soil type for optimum yields. Yield harvest data were reported on a total fruit count and weight per plot basis. The Rutgers/Rutgers control packet had contaminating Money Maker wild type (WT) seeds present. Each plot was scored for the presence of Money Maker plants and yield was adjusted to correct for excess yield of Money Maker over Rutgers. Money Maker was present in the same trial for a separate study, so a correction calculation could be properly made.

In 2018, a single-location trial was conducted at the Russell Larson Research and Education Center in Pine Grove Mills, PA. Seeds were sown under greenhouse conditions on 2 April 2018 and transplanted on 31 May 2018. Plants were spaced 18 inches apart in raised, plastic-covered beds with 6 feet between each bed. Plot size was defined as 20 plants and yield evaluation was taken from the inner 14 plants. Total of 31 entries, including graft progeny generations 2, 3, and 5 were replicated six times in a RCBD. A standard fertility program was used for the area and soil type for optimum yields. Three harvests were performed in the weeks of 27 August, 3 September, and 10 September 2018. Yield harvest data were reported on a total fruit count per plot basis. Development of WT/MSH1 and WT/WT graft progenies did not involve a phenotypic selection process. For each generation, the seed from each genotype and plot were collected, pooled, and used for the subsequent field trial without considering previous trial performance.

### Financial incentives for extended weight loss: a randomized, controlled trial [^111LGuFG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Previous efforts to use incentives for weight loss have resulted in substantial weight regain after 16 weeks.

Objective

To evaluate a longer term weight loss intervention using financial incentives.

Design

A 32-week, three-arm randomized controlled trial of financial incentives for weight loss consisting of a 24-week weight loss phase during which all participants were given a weight loss goal of 1 pound per week, followed by an 8-week maintenance phase.

Participants

Veterans who were patients at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center with BMIs of 30–40.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a weight-monitoring program involving a consultation with a dietician and monthly weigh-ins (control condition), or the same program with one of two financial incentive plans. Both incentive arms used deposit contracts (DC) in which participants put their own money at risk (matched 1:1), which they lost if they failed to lose weight. In one incentive arm participants were told that the period after 24 weeks was for weight-loss maintenance; in the other, no such distinction was made.

Main Measure

Weight loss after 32 weeks.

Key Results

Results were analyzed using intention-to-treat. There was no difference in weight loss between the incentive arms (P = 0.80). Incentive participants lost more weight than control participants [mean DC = 8.70 pounds, mean control = 1.17, P = 0.04, 95% CI of the difference in means (0.56, 14.50)]. Follow-up data 36 weeks after the 32-week intervention had ended indicated weight regain; the net weight loss between the incentive and control groups was no longer significant (mean DC = 1.2 pounds, 95% CI, -2.58–5.00; mean control = 0.27, 95% CI, -3.77–4.30, P = 0.76).

Conclusions

Financial incentives produced significant weight loss over an 8-month intervention; however, participants regained weight post-intervention.

MMO #23 — energy deficit rules and exercise — notes energy-expenditure proportions and cautions against oversimplified calorie rules: 'In individuals with moderate physical inactivity, 70% of daily energy expenditure is due to resting metabolic rate and 10% due to diet-induced thermogenesis. Only 20% of daily energy expenditure is often due to physical activity'. As a rough estimate, 'it takes an additional 10,000 steps per day per week to "burn" an additional 3500 Calories (kcal) per week, which is the approximate amount of energy found in one pound of fat', and 'Depending on the body mass index of the individual, walking on a level treadmill for 20 minutes may "burn" less than 100 Calories'. The page concludes that 'That said, the commonly cited 3500 Calories per pound of fat is blatantly misleading in how it is often applied to predicting the effects of' weight change.

### Mixed success for carbon payments and subsidies in support of forest restoration in the neotropics [^112Dku3x]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Net present value of the cattle options

We calculated the net present value of pasture and silvopasture from data collected by one of the authors (AM) as well as through personal conversations with landholders around the area of Agua Salud. The maximum capacity for cattle in the watershed in which we work is equal to 1 cow per hectare, a higher stocking for both treatments than in our focal farmsbut similar to reported densities in the Brazilian Amazon. Generally, a cow can give birth to a calf every two years. Most of the male calves are sold at age 2 for fattening or finishing as is common in the Brazilian Amazon, equivalent to US$300 per calf. Occasionally, when a calf is particularly robust, the owners will keep them and raise them for 5 years. The owners estimate they raise one of these more robust calves every 5 years and they are sold for US$600. The cost of raising the cows includes vaccines, feed, salt, building and maintaining fencing, manually cleaning pastures of woody shrubs and other unwanted vegetation. Based on the project's pasture and silvopasture costs, we estimate that the cost per year to maintain silvopasture is US$200 ha −1 and the cost per year to maintain pasture is US$100 ha -1. We estimated the NPV of silvopasture and pasture based on this information and using Eq. 1 from the main manuscript (Table 4). Our costs and revenues fall within the range found in Stefanski et al.(conducted in similar areas). We note that in real-world practice, the conversion of traditional cattle pasture to silvopasture as well as initial maintenance costs of the latter, are borne by the Panama Canal Authority for significant areas within the Panama Canal Watershed. In contrast to the tree planting methods, repeated visits to pastures to check on and tend cows are not monetized in this analysis. We do not include a carbon payment in the NPV for avoided cattle emissions or for trees on the silvopasture treatment. We did not have good data on either for our system, so have not included that in the cattle analysis.

### WITHDRAWN: advice on low-fat diets for obesity [^116j8UCD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Overweight and obesity are global health problems contributing to an ever increasing noncommunicable disease burden. Calorie restriction can achieve short-term weight loss but the weight loss has not been shown to be sustainable in the long-term. An alternative approach to calorie restriction is to lower the fat content of the diet. However, the long-term effects of fat-restricted diets on weight loss have not been established.

Objectives

To assess the effects of advice on low-fat diets as a means of achieving sustained weight loss, using all available randomised clinical trials. This review focused primarily on participants who were overweight or clinically obese and were dieting for the purpose of weight reduction. Since we were particularly interested in the ability of participants to sustain weight loss over a longer period of time, we focused on studies of 'free living' men and women who were given dietary advice rather than provision of food or money to purchase food.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (up to February 2002), and EMBASE (up to February 2002). We also searched the Science Citation Index (up to January 2001) and bibliographies of studies identified. Date of latest search: February 2002.

Selection Criteria

Trials were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: 1) they were randomised controlled clinical trials of low-fat diets versus other weight-reducing diets, 2) the primary purpose of the study was weight loss, 3) participants were followed for at least six months, 4) the study participants were adults (18 years or older) who were overweight or obese (BMI > 25 kg/m2) at baseline. Studies including pregnant women or patients with serious medical conditions were excluded. Two people independently applied the inclusion criteria to the studies identified. Disagreement was resolved by discussion or by intervention of a third party.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by three independent reviewers and meta-analysis performed using a random effects model. Weighted mean differences of weight loss were calculated for treatment and control groups at 6, 12 and 18 months.

Main Results

Four studies were included at the six month follow-up, five studies at the 12 month follow-up and three studies at the 18 month follow-up. There was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at six months (WMD 1.7 kg, 95% CI -1.4 to 4.8 kg). The weighted sum of weight loss in the low fat group was -5.08 kg (95% CI -5.9 to -4.3 kg) and in the control group was -6.5 kg, (95% CI -7.3 to -5.7 kg). There was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at 12 months (WMD 1.1 kg, 95% CI -1.6 to 3.8 kg). The weighted sum of weight loss in the low fat group was -2.3 kg (95% CI -3.2 to -1.4 kg) and in the control group was -3.4 kg (95% CI -4.2 to -2.6 kg). There was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at 18 months (WMD 3.7 kg, 95% CI - 1.8 to 9.2). The weighted sum of weight loss in the control group was -2.3 kg (95% CI -3.5 to -1.2 kg) and in the low fat group there was a weight gain of 0.1 kg (95% CI -0.8 to 1 kg). There was significant heterogeneity in the results for weight loss at six months and 12 months. Apart from one study which showed a slight but statistically significant difference in total cholesterol in the low fat group at one year follow-up, there were no significant differences between the dietary groups for other outcome measures such as serum lipids, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose. Studies measuring other factors such as perceived wellness and quality of life reported conflicting results.

Authors' Conclusions

The review suggests that fat-restricted diets are no better than calorie restricted diets in achieving long term weight loss in overweight or obese people. Overall, participants lost slightly more weight on the control diets but this was not significantly different from the weight loss achieved through dietary fat restriction and was so small as to be clinically insignificant.

### The effects of water and non-nutritive sweetened beverages on weight loss and weight maintenance: a randomized clinical trial [^113fFwjh]. Obesity (2016). Low credibility.

Study design

This was a 1‐year equivalence trial comparing beverages sweetened with NNS to water as part of a behavioral weight management program that included 12 weeks of weight loss followed by 40 weeks of weight maintenance. A computer‐generated randomization schedule assigned participants, within each site, to either the NNS beverage or water treatment arms stratified by sex, to ensure an equal distribution of women and men in each treatment group.

The study protocol specified preplanned data analyses on the primary outcome of weight loss at 12 weeks (weight loss period) and at the end of 1 year (weight loss maintenance period).

Intervention

Weight loss

For the 12‐week weight loss intervention, all participants received a comprehensive cognitive‐behavioral weight loss intervention called The Colorado Weigh 20 involving weekly, 60‐min instructional classes. Additional details regarding The Colorado Weigh classes and the weight loss intervention are described elsewhere 19.

Weight loss maintenance

All participants attended nine monthly, 60‐min group meetings led by registered dieticians or clinical psychologists as part of The Colorado Weigh 20. Participants attended group meetings stratified by treatment (NNS or water) group. Participants were weighed at each monthly meeting. Participants were advised to consume 25% to 35% of calories from fat (using a fat gram counter and total calorie guidebook) and to include 6 days of unsupervised exercise per week in order to meet the weight loss maintenance recommendation of 60 min of moderate activity daily 21. Participants in both treatment groups received the same curriculum, with the only difference being discussion regarding the type of beverages they were instructed to consume. Adherence to the treatment was assessed by study dietitians based on food, beverage, and physical activity logs as well as monitoring weight loss.

Daily energy intake targets were individualized and calculated as each participant's estimated resting metabolic rate (RMR) × 1.6 physical activity level (PAL). Energy intake targets were adjusted to maintain weight based on each individual's PAL. Physical activity was assessed using a Body Media armband activity tracking device (Manufacturer: Body Media, Model AB155) for 1 week at baseline and during weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52.

NNS beverage group

Participants randomized to the NNS beverage group were asked to consume at least 24 fluid ounces (710 ml) of NNS beverages per day during the entire year‐long trial, with unrestricted water consumption. Premixed beverages containing < 5 kcal per 8 ounce serving (237 ml) and containing NNS qualified as NNS beverages.

### The dynamics in food selection stemming from price awareness and perceived income adequacy: a cross-sectional study using 1-year loyalty card data [^112TrEwa]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

Total purchase prices for individuals were calculated by first adding up the expenditure (in euros), energy (megajoules), and volume (kilograms) of the purchased food items by group on each loyalty cardholder. One euro (€) is approximately US $1.18 (average conversion rate for 2018), and 1 MJ is equal to 239 kcal. The individuals' purchase prices of the foods in different categories were then obtained by dividing the expenditure of the group by either energy or volume of the group. Similarly, the proportion of energy and the proportion of expenditure from each food group were computed as the ratio of group-specific energy and expenditure to the total energy and total expenditure across all groups, respectively. Individual-level quantities were then summarized as medians for PIA levels because their distributions were skew.

To test for a trend in the prices, expenditures, and NRFI (outcome variables) between levels of PIA (ordinal grouping factors), nonparametric methods were chosen owing to deviations from a normal distribution. We used a 2-sided Jonckheere–Terpstra test, with a control of the false discovery rate by the Benjamini–Hochberg method set at 5% level. To control the potential confounding factors, we used the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method of the Jonckheere–Terpstra test. In practice, we estimated the probabilities of falling into one of the PIA levels by a multinomial model, including education and sex as explanatory variables, and the inverses of these probabilities were used as weights. The effect size was estimated by relating the intragroup variance of the medians across different levels of PIA to the variability of the medians across food groups and PIA levels. SAS, version 9.4, was used in the analysis. The correlation of price per kilogram and per megajoule between the food groups was examined by using group-based median price per megajoule and per kilogram and the Spearman correlation coefficients across groups.

In the figures, we showed the data without confounder adjustment because these indicate the food selection of actual participant groups instead of weighted yet artificial groups that would match the IPW-adjusted Jonckheere–Terpstra tests. We focused on price per kilogram (in contrast to price per megajoule) because this is the price consumers see, it is likely to be related to their food selection, and it is not associated with energy density of the food.

### Effect of escalating financial incentive rewards on maintenance of weight loss: a randomized clinical trial [^114n6shH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Identifying effective strategies for treating obesity is a public health priority.

Objective

To test an escalating lottery-based incentive tied to daily self-weighing for weight loss maintenance.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 2-phase, 2-arm randomized clinical trial enrolled participants aged 30 to 80 years with an initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30.0 to 45.0 who lost at least 5 kg during 4 to 6 months in a national online weight management program. Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.

Interventions

All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was weight change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included weight change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.

Results

A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000. Weight measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = 0.002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = 0.009) in phase 2. Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were -1.1 (95% CI, -2.1 to -0.1) kg in the incentive group and -1.9 (95% CI, -2.9 to -0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean weight changes were 0.2 (95% CI, -1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and -0.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, -1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = 0.41 for comparison).

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance weight loss maintenance.

### Influence of price discounts and skill-building strategies on purchase and consumption of healthy food and beverages: outcomes of the supermarket healthy eating for life randomized controlled trial [^114eJBnn]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fiscal strategies are increasingly considered upstream nutrition promotion measures. However, few trials have investigated the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of pricing manipulations on diet in real-world settings.

Objective

We assessed the effects on fruit, vegetable, and beverage purchasing and consumption of a 20% price-reduction intervention, a tailored skills-based behavior-change intervention, and a combined intervention compared with a control condition.

Design

The Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life trial was a randomized controlled trial conducted over 3 mo [baseline (time 1) to postintervention (time 2) with a 6-mo follow-up (time 3)]. Female primary household shoppers in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly assigned to a 1) skill-building (n = 160), 2) price-reduction (n = 161), 3) combined skill-building and price-reduction (n = 160), or 4) control (n = 161) group. Supermarket transaction data and surveys were used to measure the following study outcomes: fruit, vegetable, and beverage purchases and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption at each time point.

Results

At 3 mo (time 2), price reduction-alone participants purchased more total vegetables and frozen vegetables than did controls. Price reduction-alone and price reduction-plus-skill-building participants purchased more fruit than did controls. Relative to controls, in the price-reduction group, total vegetable consumption increased by 233 g/wk (3.1 servings or 15% more than at baseline), and fruit purchases increased by 364 g/wk (2.4 servings; 35% more than at baseline). Increases were not maintained 6 mo postintervention (time 3). Price reduction-alone participants showed a tendency for a slight increase in fruit consumption at time 2 (P = 0.09) that was maintained at time 3 (P = 0.014). No intervention improved purchases of bottled water or low-calorie beverages.

Conclusions

A 20% price reduction in fruit and vegetables resulted in increased purchasing per household of 35% for fruit and 15% for vegetables over the price-reduction period. These findings show that price modifications can directly increase produce purchases. The Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life trial was registered at Current Controlled Trials Registration as ISRCTN39432901.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^112S7SRu]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Finalizing recommendations — recommendations are formulated by content experts informed by the evidence; cost considerations may be included only if published formal cost-benefit analyses are available, with resource consultants or health economists conducting analyses as needed, and when cost constraints exist implementers are encouraged to use ADAPTE strategies; patient values and preferences are reflected in recommendations or remarks and are especially pertinent in weaker recommendations when wide variability in choices is anticipated; recommendations must be specific and actionable with as much detail as evidence allows, and measure developers are cautioned not to convert lower-evidence recommendations into performance measures.

### A minimum income for healthy living [^111u7VDg]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Half a century of research has provided consensual evidence of major personal requisites of adult health in nutrition, physical activity and psychosocial relations. Their minimal money costs, together with those of a home and other basic necessities, indicate disposable income that is now essential for health.

Methods

In a first application we identified such representative minimal costs for healthy, single, working men aged 18–30, in the UK. Costs were derived from ad hoc survey, relevant figures in the national Family Expenditure Survey, and by pragmatic decision for the few minor items where survey data were not available.

Results

Minimum costs were assessed at 131.86 pound sterling per week (UK April 1999 prices). Component costs, especially those of housing (which represents around 40% of this total), depend on region and on several assumptions. By varying these a range of totals from 106.47 pound sterling to 163.86 pound sterling per week was detailed. These figures compare, 1999, with the new UK national minimum wage, after statutory deductions, of pound 105.84 at 18–21 years and 121.12 pound sterling at 22+ years for a 38 hour working week. Corresponding basic social security rates are 40.70 pound sterling to 51.40 pound sterling per week.

Interpretation

Accumulating science means that absolute standards of living, "poverty", minimal official incomes and the like, can now be assessed by objective measurement of the personal capacity to meet the costs of major requisites of healthy living. A realistic assessment of these costs is presented as an impetus to public discussion. It is a historical role of public health as social medicine to lead in public advocacy of such a national agenda.

### Using internet snapshot surveys to enhance our understanding of the availability of the novel psychoactive substance 4-methylaminorex and 4, 4'-dimethylaminorex [^116zhZhE]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

4,4'-Dimethylaminorex is a stimulant novel psychoactive substance (NPS) first detected in Europe in November 2012. It is a derivative of 4-methylaminorex, a substance controlled under Schedule 1 of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. There is currently no information on the availability or cost of these substances from Internet suppliers. An Internet snapshot study was undertaken in English using established European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) methodology to determine the availability of 4-methylaminorex and 4,4'-dimethylaminorex in April 2014. Twenty Internet sites selling 4-methylaminorex were identified, 18 selling in US dollars and two in GB Pound Sterling. Fourteen (70%) Internet sites had a minimum purchase amount of ≥ 10 g (compared to user doses of 10–25 mg). For the 18 suppliers selling in US$, 9 quoted a fixed price per gram irrespective of the amount ordered and 11 had a reducing price per gram with increasing purchase quantity (US$30.8 ± 34.2/g for 1 g purchase to US$15.2 ± 20.3/g for 1 kg purchase). Only one Internet site selling 4,4'-dimethylaminorex was identified, selling in Euros. The minimum purchase quantity was 500 mg. The price per gram reduced from < euro > 36.08/g for a 500 mg purchase to < euro > 2.20/g for a 100 g purchase. This Internet snapshot demonstrated that there was a greater availability from Internet suppliers of products advertised as 4-methylaminorex than 4,4'-dimethylaminorex, despite the 4-methylaminorex being an internationally controlled substance. Whilst this may reflect misunderstanding by suppliers, it has the potential to put those purchasing at risk of contravening border control and/or local law enforcement legislation. The use of methodology such as Internet snapshot surveys is of increasing interest to clinical/medical toxicologists in their understanding of the supply, availability and cost of novel psychoactive substances.

### Supermarket discounts of low-energy density foods: effects on purchasing, food intake, and body weight [^113prAt3]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of a 50% discount on low-energy density (ED) fruits and vegetables (F&V), bottled water, and diet sodas on shoppers' purchasing, food intake, and body weight.

Design and Methods

A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at two Manhattan supermarkets, in which a 4-week baseline period (no discounts) preceded an 8-week intervention period (50% discount), and a 4-week follow-up period (no discounts). Twenty-four hour dietary recall, as well as body weight and body composition measures were obtained every 4 weeks. Participants (n = 47, 33f; 14m) were overweight and obese (BMI ≥ 25) shoppers.

Results

Purchasing of F&V during intervention was greater in the discount group than in the control group (P < 0.0001). Purchasing of these items by the discount group relative to the control group during follow-up was reduced from intervention (P = 0.002), but still remained higher than during baseline (P = 0.01), indicating a partially sustained effect. Intake of F&V increased from baseline to intervention in the discount group relative to the control group (P = 0.037) and was sustained during follow-up. Body weight change did not differ significantly between groups, although post hoc analysis indicated a change within the discount group (-1.1 kg, P = 0.006) but not within the control group.

Conclusions

Discounts of low-ED F&V led to increased purchasing and intake of those foods.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^116jgdRQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Energy from beverages sold, SSB purchases and SSB sales (one CBA and two ITS studies, very low‐certainty evidence)

Ng 2014a reports that the energy content of beverages (including SSB) sold by companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge decreased by −14 kcal/per capita/day compared to a decrease by −3 kcal/per capita/day for national‐brand companies not participating in the pledge at four years, and a decrease by −14 kcal/per capita/day for private‐label brands. (Study authors note that some private‐label brands covered by the analysis were produced by companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge; the comparison with national‐brand companies not participating in the pledge may therefore be the better comparison). Ng 2014a also reports that SSB sales by companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge decreased by −7 kcal/per capita/day at four years (no P values or CIs reported, data for the control group not reported).

Ng 2014b reports that SSB purchases from companies participating in the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation Pledge measured in kcal/household/day decreased less than expected, based on pre‐intervention trends during a four‐year follow‐up period in both the intervention and control groups (P < 0.001, results shown graphically only, see appendix figure C3 of Ng 2014b; for SSB purchases the study does not report a direct numerical comparison between the intervention and control groups).

Taillie 2015 reports that after the implementation of Walmart's Healthier Food Initiative the percentage volume of SSB purchased from Walmart decreased more steeply than expected, based on pre‐intervention trends (P < 0.01, results shown graphically only, see appendix exhibit 3 of Taillie 2015), and more than for other chain retailers during a three‐year follow‐up period (results shown graphically only).
