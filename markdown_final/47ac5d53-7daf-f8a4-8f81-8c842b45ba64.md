## Question

How does myelopathy affect the spinal cord?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how myelopathy affects the spinal cord. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining myelopathy and its major etiologies. Then, I should verify the primary mechanisms of injury, distinguishing static from dynamic compression and intrinsic cord changes. Next, I will examine the secondary pathophysiology, including ischemia, demyelination, and neuroinflammation. After that, I should review structural and functional consequences, including atrophy and tract-specific deficits. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, prognosis, and how imaging and timing of intervention modify outcomes, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't jump to conclusions: myelopathy is a clinical syndrome of spinal cord dysfunction that can arise from compressive (degenerative, neoplastic, epidural) or noncompressive (inflammatory, infectious, vascular, metabolic) causes, with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) being the most common nontraumatic cause in adults, and MRI being the preferred modality to characterize cord involvement and etiology [^c42a309f] [^a6e7df47] [^7047be49].

> I will now examine the primary mechanical mechanisms, because these drive much of the early injury. Static compression from spondylotic discs, osteophytes, ligamentous hypertrophy, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament narrows the canal and chronically deforms the cord, while dynamic factors during flexion–extension increase cord tension and dorsal buckling of the ligamentum flavum, together producing repetitive microtrauma and ischemia; in vivo MR studies show reduced cord motion and increased strain in myelopathic cords, supporting a biomechanical contribution to injury [^c42a309f] [^b8c1c9e5] [^98d27e64].

> Hold on, let's not conflate acute and chronic injury cascades. I should confirm the secondary pathophysiology unique to chronic compression: beyond direct mechanical deformation, chronic cord compression triggers ischemia from impaired small-vessel perfusion, blood–spinal cord barrier disruption, demyelination, axonal loss, and neuronal apoptosis, with emerging evidence that these secondary mechanisms differ temporally and biologically from acute traumatic SCI, explaining why recovery is often limited even after decompression [^c42a309f] [^558c6b4a] [^7679607d].

> Next, I should review structural consequences that correlate with disability. Chronic compression leads to cord atrophy with reduced cross-sectional area, flattening, and T2 hyperintensity reflecting edema, gliosis, or myelomalacia; quantitative MRI shows that atrophy and microstructural changes can extend beyond the compressive level, and multisegmental T2 hyperintensity predicts poorer postoperative recovery, underscoring the limited regenerative capacity of the CNS [^f48543b9] [^4f29f9e7] [^e621d74d].

> Let me consider functional tract-specific effects, because these map to clinical deficits. Corticospinal tract involvement produces spasticity, hyperreflexia, and motor weakness, posterior column injury causes proprioceptive loss and sensory ataxia, and spinothalamic involvement yields pain and temperature deficits; electrophysiology and diffusion MRI corroborate tract-specific dysfunction even when conventional MRI appears near-normal, aligning with the classic hand clumsiness and gait instability phenotype of DCM [^c42a309f] [^77d022ee] [^1242e86f].

> I should double-check the clinical implications and prognosis so counseling is accurate. Myelopathy is typically progressive, with 20–60% of untreated patients deteriorating neurologically over time, and longer symptom duration, multilevel T2 cord signal, and cord atrophy portend worse outcomes; importantly, surgical decompression can halt progression and improve function, but delays risk permanent deficits, and maximal recovery often plateaus by 6–12 months, after which residual deficits are likely permanent [^558c6b4a] [^cd242e24] [^a6bdace7].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or the MRI is normal? I need to ensure I account for mimics and early disease. Myelopathy can present asymmetrically or with fluctuating symptoms, and early or noncompressive etiologies may show minimal conventional MRI changes; in such cases, advanced MRI (DTI, MT, qMRI), electrophysiology, and careful correlation with exam findings help detect subclinical cord injury and guide timely intervention before irreversible damage accrues [^af9dd0b4] [^f48543b9] [^6025c04d].

> Let me reconsider the therapeutic angle to avoid overpromising recovery. The overarching principle is that decompressive surgery addresses the mechanical driver and can reverse some functional deficits, especially when performed earlier in the disease course; however, neuroprotective strategies remain investigational, and the limited regenerative capacity of the spinal cord means that preoperative severity and chronicity strongly constrain outcomes, reinforcing the need for early recognition and referral [^c42a309f] [^cd242e24] [^a6bdace7].

> In summary, myelopathy affects the spinal cord through a combination of static and dynamic mechanical compression superimposed on a cascade of secondary injury mechanisms including ischemia, demyelination, axonal loss, and neuroinflammation, producing structural atrophy and tract-specific dysfunction that manifest clinically as progressive motor, sensory, and autonomic deficits; because the CNS has limited regenerative capacity, timely decompression can halt progression but cannot fully reverse established injury, making early diagnosis and intervention critical to preserving function [^c42a309f] [^f48543b9] [^cd242e24].

Myelopathy damages the spinal cord through **chronic mechanical compression** [^c42a309f] and **secondary ischemia** [^b8c1c9e5], leading to demyelination, axonal loss, and neuronal apoptosis [^558c6b4a]. This causes progressive neurological deficits: hand clumsiness, gait instability, spasticity, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction [^616de4ab]. Early **MRI** [^a6e7df47] identifies compression and cord signal changes; **early surgery** halts progression and improves outcomes [^cd242e24], but delayed treatment risks permanent disability [^a6bdace7].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Myelopathy arises from **multiple interacting mechanisms**:

- **Mechanical compression**: Disc herniation, osteophytes, ligamentous hypertrophy, or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) reduce canal diameter and compress the cord [^c42a309f], causing direct neural injury and deformation [^b8c1c9e5].

- **Ischemia**: Compression impairs perfusion, causing ischemia, hypoxia, and neuronal death [^b8c1c9e5].

- **Secondary injury cascades**: Chronic compression triggers inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and apoptosis, with glutamate excitotoxicity and oxidative stress amplifying damage [^558c6b4a].

---

## Structural changes in the spinal cord

Myelopathy produces **characteristic structural changes**:

| **Structural change** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Demyelination | Loss of myelin around axons, impairing conduction [^558c6b4a] |
| Axonal loss | Degeneration of axons, causing permanent deficits [^f48543b9] |
| Neuronal apoptosis | Programmed cell death from chronic compression and ischemia [^558c6b4a] |
| Cord atrophy | Shrinkage and flattening of the cord, correlating with severity [^bcd8c8cb] |
| T2 hyperintensity | MRI signal indicating edema, gliosis, or myelomalacia [^2004d9e6] |

---

## Functional consequences

These structural changes cause **progressive neurological deficits**:

- **Motor dysfunction**: Weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and gait instability [^616de4ab].

- **Sensory deficits**: Numbness, paresthesia, and loss of proprioception [^616de4ab].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Urinary urgency, retention, and bowel dysfunction [^616de4ab].

- **Hand dysfunction**: Loss of dexterity, clumsiness, and difficulty with fine motor tasks [^616de4ab].

---

## Clinical progression and severity

Myelopathy typically progresses from **mild sensory symptoms to severe motor and autonomic deficits** [^c42a309f]. Severity is graded by clinical scales (e.g. mJOA) [^a03680fd] and MRI findings (cord compression, T2 hyperintensity, atrophy) [^e621d74d]. Early disease may be reversible, but chronic compression causes irreversible injury [^cd242e24].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

MRI is the **gold standard** [^a6e7df47] to identify compression, cord signal changes, and atrophy [^7047be49]; CT myelography is used when MRI is contraindicated [^be22acd0]. Electrophysiology (evoked potentials) can assess cord function and prognosticate recovery [^a11a44df].

---

## Treatment and prognosis

Surgical decompression is the **definitive treatment** for moderate-to-severe myelopathy, halting progression and improving function [^c42a309f]; outcomes are best when surgery is performed early [^cd242e24]. Mild cases may be managed conservatively with close monitoring, but many progress and require surgery [^e48cdb20]. Delayed treatment risks permanent disability [^a6bdace7].

---

Myelopathy causes **progressive spinal cord injury** from chronic compression and ischemia, with structural damage and functional decline that are often irreversible if treatment is delayed. Early diagnosis and decompression are critical to preserve neurological function [^c42a309f].

### ACR appropriateness criteria® myelopathy: 2021 update [^a6e7df47]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Myelopathy is a clinical diagnosis with localization of the neurological findings to the spinal cord, rather than the brain or the peripheral nervous system, and then to a particular segment of the spinal cord. Myelopathy can be the result of primary intrinsic disorders of the spinal cord or from secondary conditions, which result in extrinsic compression of the spinal cord. While the causes of myelopathy may be multiple, the acuity of presentation and symptom onset frame a practical approach to the differential diagnosis. Imaging plays a crucial role in the evaluation of myelopathy with MRI the preferred modality. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Imaging approach to myelopathies [^7047be49]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Myelopathy refers to spinal cord involvement from diverse etiologies resulting in neurologic symptoms. The presentation is variable, often posing a diagnostic challenge due to overlapping clinical and imaging features. Classification by symptom onset aids in the differential diagnosis and is based on hyperacute, acute/subacute, and chronic presentations, each carrying distinct prognoses. MR imaging is pivotal for diagnosis, providing detailed characterization of spinal cord involvement. This article offers a comprehensive overview of various diseases causing myelopathy, their imaging manifestations, differential diagnoses, and diagnostic algorithms, emphasizing the role of MR imaging in facilitating prompt identification of underlying causes and guiding optimal management.

Myelopathy refers to any pathologic process that involves the spinal cord, and can be caused by a variety of different diseases. MR imaging is the primary modality for evaluating the patient presenting with myelopathy. The first step must be the exclusion of spinal cord compression. Although the MR features of many causes of myelopathy overlap, careful attention to the time course of presentation, knowledge of common and uncommon causes of myelopathy, and identification of specific imaging patterns and features can help narrow the differential diagnosis or establish a definitive diagnosis.

Why does this matter?

Spinal cord compression results in progressive neurological decline and affects quality of life. Left untreated, it can lead to tetraplegia and wheelchair dependence (data on how many patients with DCM progress in this way are unavailable). Surgical decompression can halt the disease progression, however, the regenerative capacity of the spinal cord is limited and any damage is often permanent. Delayed treatment leads to poorer outcomes and lifelong disability. Findings from the AOSpine series (746 patients with DCM) indicate that treatment within six months of symptoms offers the best chance of recovery, but this time frame is some way from current average diagnosis times.

### Spinal cord MRI in multiple sclerosis – diagnostic, prognostic and clinical value [^3730c9af]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the CNS that affects both the brain and the spinal cord. MRI studies in MS focus more often on the brain than on the spinal cord, owing to the technical challenges in imaging this smaller, mobile structure. However, spinal cord abnormalities at disease onset have important implications for diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, later in the disease course, in progressive MS, myelopathy becomes the primary characteristic of the clinical presentation, and extensive spinal cord pathology — including atrophy, diffuse abnormalities and numerous focal lesions — is common. Recent spinal cord imaging studies have employed increasingly sophisticated techniques to improve detection and quantification of spinal cord lesions, and to elucidate their relationship with physical disability. Quantitative MRI measures of cord size and tissue integrity could be more sensitive to the axonal loss and other pathological processes in the spinal cord than is conventional MRI, putting quantitative MRI in a key role to elucidate the association between disability and spinal cord abnormalities seen in people with MS. In this Review, we summarize the most recent MS spinal cord imaging studies and discuss the new insights they have provided into the mechanisms of neurological impairment. Finally, we suggest directions for further and future research.

This article provides an overview of a variety of pathologies that afflict the spinal cord in an easy to understand format. Their respective imaging manifestations on MRI and differential diagnoses are focused in this review. Early diagnosis and treatment of Myelopathy is critical in preventing or arresting neurological morbidity.

### Pathobiology of radiation myelopathy and strategies to mitigate injury [^f7e3f0e6]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is a narrative review of the literature.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to review the current concepts underlying the pathobiology of radiation-induced spinal cord injury; to discuss potential biologic strategies to mitigate spinal cord injury following radiation; and to provide an update on the clinical guidelines to prevent injury in the era of image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

Setting

This study was conducted in Toronto, Canada.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed using the following terms: radiation injury; radiation myelopathy; CNS radiation injury; brain necrosis, radiation; demyelination, radiation; blood-brain barrier, radiation; white matter necrosis; and SBRT.

Results and Conclusion

The biologic response of the spinal cord after radiation is a continuously evolving process. Death of vascular endothelial cells and disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier leads to a complex injury response, resulting in demyelination and tissue necrosis. At present, there is no evidence that the pathobiology of cord injury after SBRT is different from that after standard fractionation. Although permanent myelopathy has become a rare complication following conventional fractionated radiation treatment, cases of radiation myelopathy have re-emerged with the increasing role of spine stereotactic body radiation therapy and reirradiation. Experimental biologic strategies targeting the injury response pathways hold promise in mitigating this dreaded late effect of radiation treatment.

### Spinal cord disorders: myelopathy [^c704a2ae]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Myelopathy is a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and physical examination findings. Laboratories and imaging, particularly with magnetic resonance imaging, can suggest a cause. Compressive myelopathy from degenerative disease of the vertebral column is the most common cause of myelopathy in older adults and should be screened for first in most cases. There are many other causes of myelopathy, including infectious, immune-mediated, nutritional, vascular, and neoplastic etiologies.

### Pathobiology of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^9719d878]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

In this narrative review, we aim to outline what is currently known about the pathophysiology of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction. In particular, we note the unique factors that distinguish it from acute spinal cord injury. Despite its common occurrence, the reasons why some patients develop severe symptomatology while others have few or no symptoms despite radiographic evidence confirming similar degrees of compression is poorly understood. Neither is there a clear understanding of why certain patients have a stable clinical myelopathy and others present with only mild myelopathy. Moreover, the precise molecular mechanisms which contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease are incompletely understood. The current treatment method is decompression of the spinal cord but a lack of clinically relevant models of CSM have hindered the understanding of the full pathophysiology which would aid the development of new therapeutic avenues of investigation. Further elucidation of the role of ischemia, currently a source of debate, as well as the complex cascade of biomolecular events as a result of the unique pathophysiology in this disease will pave the way for further neuroprotective strategies to be developed to attenuate the physiological consequences of surgical decompression and augment its benefits.

### Abstract… [^d494de73]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The disc also calcifies, further stabilizing the vertebrae. Osteophytes increase the weight-bearing surface of the end plates and, therefore, decrease the effective force being placed on them. In addition to osteophytic overgrowth, the ligamentum flavum may stiffen and buckle into the spinal cord dorsally. Osteophytic overgrowth ventrally and, in some cases, buckling of the ligamentum flavum dorsally can cause direct compression of the spinal cord resulting in myelopathy. Symptoms are believed to develop when the spinal cord has been reduced by at least 30 percent. 4 Dynamic mechanical factors relate to the fact that the normal motion of the cervical spine may aggravate spinal cord damage precipitated by direct mechanical static compression. During flexion, the spinal cord lengthens, thus stretching over ventral osteophytic ridges.

During extension, the ligamentum flavum may buckle into the spinal cord causing a reduction of available space for the spinal cord. Clinical History Patients with CSM will generally have these symptoms: neck stiffness; unilateral or bilateral deep, aching neck, arm and shoulder pain; and possibly stiffness or clumsiness while walking. Imaging and Diagnostic Studies Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine is the procedure of choice during the initial screening process of patients with suspected CSM. 15 MRI is noninvasive and provides images of the spine and spinal cord in several planes. In addition to giving an assessment of the degree of spinal canal stenosis, an MRI can identify intrinsic spinal cord lesions that can also present with myelopathy. High signal changes seen in the spinal cord of patients with CSM may indicate myelomalacia or permanent spinal cord damage.

SURGICAL TREATMENT Once frank myelopathy occurs, surgical intervention is necessary. The primary goal of surgery is to decompress the spinal cord, thus giving the neural elements more room. Traditionally, cervical laminectomy, a posterior approach, has been used for surgical treatment of CSM. However, over the past 20 years, it has been increasingly recognized that laminectomy is not appropriate for all patients. Further neurologic deterioration after laminectomy is attributed to a development of latent instability of the spine with development of kyphotic spinal deformities and to the inability of posterior approaches to directly address anterior vector compression secondary to osteophytic overgrowth.

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^56338c9a]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

The severity of DCM can vary depending on the extent of the damage to the spinal cord and the location of compression. Some individuals may experience only mild symptoms that do not significantly impact their daily lives, while others may experience significant disability and may require surgery. Not all of the clinical manifestations present as pain. Whilst the etiological factors for non-specific neck pain are poorly understood, neck pain correlates with spinal degeneration such as cervical spondylosis, however, in the context of DCM, neck pain is a confounder.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy-update and future directions [^c42a309f]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. DCM encompasses various acquired (age-related) and congenital pathologies related to degeneration of the cervical spinal column, including hypertrophy and/or calcification of the ligaments, intervertebral discs and osseous tissues. These pathologies narrow the spinal canal, leading to chronic spinal cord compression and disability. Owing to the ageing population, rates of DCM are increasing. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment of DCM are needed to avoid permanent disability. Over the past 10 years, advances in basic science and in translational and clinical research have improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and helped delineate evidence-based practices for diagnosis and treatment. Surgical decompression is recommended for moderate and severe DCM; the best strategy for mild myelopathy remains unclear. Next-generation quantitative microstructural MRI and neurophysiological recordings promise to enable quantification of spinal cord tissue damage and help predict clinical outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive, evidence-based review of DCM, including its definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, and non-operative and operative management. With this Review, we aim to equip physicians across broad disciplines with the knowledge necessary to make a timely diagnosis of DCM, recognize the clinical features that influence management and identify when urgent surgical intervention is warranted.

### The dancing cord: inherent spinal cord motion and its effect on cord dose in spine stereotactic body radiation therapy [^650550f0]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Metastases to the spine are a common complication of cancer, occurring in up to 40% of cancer patients, and can result in major functional morbidity, including pain, pathological vertebral fractures, myelopathy, and radiculopathy from compression of adjacent neural structures. With the rapid advancement in the precision of imaging and radiation therapy delivery, spine stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has become an effective noninvasive treatment option for realistic long-term local disease control, maintenance of neurological function, and pain relief in spine metastasis patients.

The spinal cord is the major radiation dose-limiting tissue in spine SBRT, and the risk of irreversible neurological deficits from radiation myelopathy remains a feared complication of this treatment. For the safe practice of spine SBRT, dose constraints have been established for the spinal cord. However, the definition of the spinal cord as a planning organ at risk volume (PRV) has varied considerably with no consensus regarding the use of safety margins (PRV expansions) around the cord to account for setup uncertainties, contouring variations, and organ motion. In clinical practice, PRV expansions have ranged from no expansion to 1.5- to 2-mm PRV margins. While the high-precision delineation of the spinal cord and its spatial relationship to the spinal tumor is now generally performed on high-resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, the dose effects from inherent motion of the spinal cord have not been considered in the SBRT plan design and dosimetry process.

### Myelopathy but normal MRI: where next? [^6025c04d]. Practical Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

For most patients presenting with a spinal cord syndrome MR scanning has become the key investigation in establishing the diagnosis. However, myelopathy with normal spinal imaging remains a common clinical conundrum. In this review we discuss the diagnoses to consider for the neurologist presented with a patient with "MR normal myelopathy". We will illustrate this scenario with a series of short cases and consider the further investigation of "MRI normal" myelopathy.

### Cervical myelopathy: diagnosis, contemporary treatment, and outcomes [^2f03c37c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Cervical myelopathy is a clinical syndrome caused by compression of the spinal cord between the levels of the C1 and T1 vertebrae. Its clinical presentation can mimic other degenerative and neurological pathologies, making diagnosis challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate imaging studies carefully correlated with history and physical examination. Treatment options are focused on decompression of the spinal canal from an anterior, posterior, or combined anterior and posterior surgical approach depending on the location of compression and patient factors. Outcomes are favorable if treatment is performed prior to severe symptom onset.

### Guidelines for the management of acute cervical spine and spinal cord injuries: 2013 update [^0648404a]. Neurosurgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) — natural history and clinical prognostic factors state that there is Class II evidence to suggest that the clinical condition remains stable when observed over a 3-year period in patients with mild-to-moderate CSM and age younger than 75 years, and there is consistent Class III evidence that the duration of symptoms, and possibly advancing age, negatively affect outcome in patients with CSM.

### Management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy with insights from metabolic imaging of the spinal cord and brain [^30ab17bb]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a potentially debilitating disorder primarily related to spinal cord injury caused by degenerative changes of the spine. As the population continues to age and live longer, it is likely that this disorder will be encountered with increasing frequency.

Recent Findings

Surgical management continues to be a mainstay of treatment of CSM patients, but some studies have indicated that nonoperative treatment may be equivalent to surgical management in some patients. Recent advances in neuroimaging of the spinal cord and brain have provided novel information regarding the pathogenesis of CSM, as well as compensatory mechanisms to preserve neurological function.

Summary

CSM is a complex disorder whose incidence is likely to increase in coming years. Prospective, randomized studies are required to help establish the optimal treatment paradigm. Recent advances such as novel neuroimaging techniques and the continued development of neural repair strategies to treat the secondary biological injury associated with this disorder are likely to play key roles in the future management of CSM.

### The dancing cord: inherent spinal cord motion and its effect on cord dose in spine stereotactic body radiation therapy [^45344a75]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Interpretation

While a range of α/β ratios (0.87–3 Gy, see Supplemental Digital Content) have been reported, and the radiosensitivity of the cord may vary at different spinal levels, we employed an α/β ratio of 2 Gy, as proposed by HyTECfor all spinal levels. The EQD2 based on the LQ cell survival model interpolation of the maximum tolerated spinal cord dose of 12 Gy in 1 fraction (accepted cord dose constraint for myelopathy in single-fraction regimens) corresponds to 36 Gy (α/β = 3 Gy) to 53.8 Gy (α/β = 0.87 Gy) based on the accepted range of α/β between 0.87 and 3 Gy. For a single-fraction SBRT regimen, a motion-induced cord dose (cord dyn) in excess of 10% would correspond to an EQD2 cord dose of 14.9% (α/β = 3 Gy) to 16.1% (α/β = 0.87 Gy) higher than the accepted SBRT constraint. These considerations suggest that in situations of expected high cord dose (eg, because of close proximity to the target, and/or diminished cord tolerance from prior radiation), combined with significant cord motion, caution should be exercised to lessen cord motion-induced dose effects by delivering treatments in multiple (3–5 fractions) rather than a single fraction. The impact of spinal cord motion on spinal cord dose may also explain the observation of radiation-induced myelitis that have been reported in single-fraction SBRT regimens after relatively low doses, as computation of these cord doses was based on static cord assessments.

### Symptomatic progression of cervical myelopathy and the role of nonsurgical management: a consensus statement [^38f5a021]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

This section of the cervical spondylotic myelopathy Spine focus issue collates the existing evidence related to natural history and nonoperative management. In the case of patients with symptomatic cervical spondylotic myelopathy treated nonoperatively, while 20% to 62% will deteriorate at 3 to 6 years of follow-up, no specific patient or disease characteristics have been shown to predict this change reliably. For patients without myelopathy with spondylotic cord compression, the rate of myelopathy development is approximately 8% at 1 year and approximately 23% at 4 years of follow-up. Clinical and/or electrophysiological evidence of cervical radiculopathy has been shown to predict such progression and should prompt strong consideration of surgical decompression. With respect to nonoperative care, in the case of mild myelopathy, there is low evidence that such treatment may have a role; for moderate and severe myelopathy, this treatment results in outcomes inferior to those of surgery and is not recommended. Given the unpredictably progressive nature of cervical myelopathy, the indications for nonoperative management are ostensibly limited. Finally, the preclinical rationale and clinical translation of a putative neuroprotective drug, which may one day serve to augment the effects of surgery in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy, is presented and discussed.

### Progressive ascending myelopathy: atypical forms of multiple sclerosis or what else? [^4244acad]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The spinal cord can be affected by multiple heterogeneous disorders often difficult to diagnose. We describe ten patients affected by a progressive ascending myelopathy with a poor prognosis. The patients, during the follow-up period, underwent neurological examinations, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, hematological, microbiological, auto-antibodies screening, brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroneurophysiological study. At disease onset spinal cord MRI showed ≥ 1 myelopathic lesions extended for < 2 segments and then evidenced a progressive spinal cord atrophy without any new lesion. All patients showed an increase of the visual evoked potential P100 latency. All of them showed two or more clinical recurrences of myelitis and then, after a period ranging from 3 to 5 years from the disease onset, a progressive course. Five patients became unresponsive to intravenous high-dose steroid treatments and/or intravenous immunoglobulins and to any other therapeutic attempts, developed a progressive ascending myelopathy to tetraplegia and died from respiratory failure. The other five patients are in progressive phase of the disease with an initial involvement of the upper limbs and show mild cervical spinal cord atrophy at MRI, configuring the early stage of an ascending progressive myelopathy. In our opinion, the more suitable diagnosis is an atypical form of MS although is not possible to exclude a new nosological entity that could be included in the expanding range of spinal cord diseases.

### The dancing cord: inherent spinal cord motion and its effect on cord dose in spine stereotactic body radiation therapy [^9b72dcf1]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Generalizability and Implications for Practice

Our results are generalizable to the treatment of patients with metastatic spinal lesions with respect to the PRV margin for the spinal cord in SBRT planning. Based upon the overall consistency of our cord motion findings with the literature, the unlikely excursion of the cord beyond 1.5 to 2 mm from its static position, and our observed dosimetric effects of spinal cord motion, we recommend to employ a 1.5 to 2 mm margin for the spinal cord PRV in SBRT dosimetry planning to mitigate motion-related dose effects from the "dancing" cord. Our data also suggest that a 1-mm PRV margin is inadequate based on our observation that the cord moves beyond 1 mm of its static position in nearly half (43%) of the patients and that 78% of these showed a motion-induced excess in cord dose.

In challenging cases, where the spinal cord is anticipated to closely approach the cord constraint, a dynamic motion study of the cord can be easily obtained with an added approximately 2.5- to 5-min dynamic MRI sequence to provide additional guidance.

Limitations

Our patient and lesion numbers were limited, which did not allow meaningful subgroup analyses, such as associations of cord motion and dose with lesion size, spinal level, extent of vertebral involvement, Bilsky grade, or patient-related variables, such as coexisting spine pathologies. Assessment of these factors may enable a more patient-tailored approach. Our study is a physics/dosimetry and imaging assessment of motion-induced changes in spinal cord dose, and our cohort is too small to correlate the observed dosimetric findings with clinical myelopathy. Further, while our 2.5- to 5-min imaging time readily assesses physiological motion, it may not capture all bulk motion that may occur during a typical SBRT fraction delivery.

Additionally, the BFFE images were obtained only in the axial plane, which did not allow assessment of craniocaudal cord motion that has been reported as larger than AP and lateral motion. However, the target and cord are usually assessed and contoured in the axial plane. Thus, we believe that the effects of craniocaudal cord motion on the critical cord–target distance have likely been incorporated, at least in part, in the dose calculations derived from the axial dynamic BFFE images.

### Nonoperative management of cervical myelopathy: a systematic review [^e48cdb20]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review investigating the evidence of (1) efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of nonoperative treatment of patients with cervical myelopathy; (2) whether the severity of myelopathy affects outcomes of nonoperative treatment; and (3) whether specific activities or minor injuries are associated with neurological deterioration in patients with myelopathy or asymptomatic stenosis being treated nonoperatively.

Summary Of Background Data

Little is known about the appropriate role of nonoperative treatment in the management of cervical myelopathy, which is typically considered a surgical disorder.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library for articles published between January 1, 1956, and November 20, 2012. We included all articles that compared nonoperative treatments or observation with surgery for patients with cervical myelopathy or asymptomatic cervical cord compression to determine their effects on clinical outcomes, including myelopathy scales (Japanese Orthopaedic Association, Nurick), general health scores (36-Item Short Form Health Survey), and pain (neck and arm). Nonoperative treatments included physical therapy, medications, injections, orthoses, and traction. We also searched for articles evaluating the effect of specific activities or minor trauma in neurological outcomes. Case reports and studies with less than 10 patients in the exposure group were excluded.

Results

Of 54 citations identified from our search, 5 studies reported in 6 articles met inclusion criteria. In 1 randomized controlled study, there was low evidence that nonoperative treatment may yield equivalent or better outcomes than surgery in those with mild myelopathy. For moderate to severe myelopathy, nonoperative treatment had inferior outcomes versus surgery in 2 cohort studies, despite the fact that surgically treated patients were worse at baseline. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether specific activities or minor trauma is a risk factor for neurological deterioration in those with myelopathy or asymptomatic cord compression.

Conclusion

There is a paucity of evidence for nonoperative treatment of cervical myelopathy, and further studies are needed to determine its role more definitively. In particular, for the patient with milder degrees of myelopathy, randomized studies comparing nonoperative with surgical treatment would be particularly helpful, as would trials comparing specific types of nonoperative treatments with the natural history of myelopathy. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation 1

Because myelopathy is known to be a typically progressive disorder and there is little evidence that nonoperative treatment halts or reverses its progression, we recommend not routinely prescribing nonoperative treatment as the primary modality in patients with moderate to severe myelopathy.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong.

Recommendation 2

If there is a role for nonoperative treatment as a primary treatment modality, it may be in the patient with mild myelopathy. However, it is not clear which specific forms of nonoperative treatment provide any benefit compared with the natural history. If nonoperative treatment is selected, we suggest care be taken to observe for neurological deterioration.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak.

Recommendation 3

In those with asymptomatic spondylotic cord compression but no clinical myelopathy, the available literature neither supports nor refutes the notion that minor trauma is a risk factor for neurological deterioration. We suggest that patients should be counseled about this uncertainty.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak. Recommendation 4: In those with a clinical diagnosis of cervical spondylotic myelopathy but no ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, the available studies did not specifically address the issue of neurological deterioration secondary to minor trauma. However, in those with underlying ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, trauma may be more likely to cause worsening of existing myelopathy or even initiate symptoms in those who were previously asymptomatic. We suggest that patients should be counseled about these possibilities.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Low.

Strength Of Recommendation

Weak.

### Measurement of in vivo spinal cord displacement and strain fields of healthy and myelopathic cervical spinal cord [^98d27e64]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cervical myelopathy (CM) is a common and debilitating form of spinal cord injury caused by chronic compression; however, little is known about the in vivo mechanics of the healthy spinal cord during motion and how these mechanics are altered in CM. The authors sought to measure 3D in vivo spinal cord displacement and strain fields from MR images obtained during physiological motion of healthy individuals and cervical myelopathic patients.

Methods

Nineteen study participants, 9 healthy controls and 10 CM patients, were enrolled in the study. All study participants had 3T MR images acquired of the cervical spine in neutral, flexed, and extended positions. Displacement and strain fields and corresponding principal strain were obtained from the MR images using image registration.

Results

The healthy spinal cord displaces superiorly in flexion and inferiorly in extension. Principal strain is evenly distributed along the spinal cord. The CM spinal cord displaces less than the healthy cord and the magnitude of principal strain is higher, at the midcervical levels.

Conclusions

Increased spinal cord compression during cervical myelopathy limits motion of the spinal cord and increases spinal cord strain during physiological motion. Future studies are needed to investigate how treatment, such as surgical intervention, affects spinal cord mechanics.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy surgical trial: randomized, controlled trial design and rationale [^f6e6ecef]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in the world. There are significant practice variation and uncertainty as to the optimal surgical approach for treating CSM.

Objective

To determine whether ventral surgery is associated with superior Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary outcome at the 1-year follow-up compared with dorsal (laminectomy/fusion or laminoplasty) surgery for the treatment of CSM, to investigate whether postoperative sagittal balance is an independent predictor of overall outcome, and to compare health resource use for ventral and dorsal procedures.

Methods

The study is a randomized, controlled trial with a nonrandomized arm for patients who are eligible but decline randomization. Two hundred fifty patients (159 randomized) with CSM from 11 sites will be recruited over 18 months. The primary outcome is the Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score. Secondary outcomes include disease-specific outcomes, overall health-related quality of life (EuroQOL 5-dimension questionnaire), and health resource use.

Expected Outcomes

This will be the first randomized, controlled trial to compare directly the health-related quality-of-life outcomes for ventral vs dorsal surgery for treating CSM.

Discussion

A National Institutes of Health-funded (1R13AR065834-01) investigator meeting was held before the initiation of the trial to bring multiple stakeholders together to finalize the study protocol. Study investigators, coordinators, and major stakeholders were able to attend and discuss strengths of, limitations of, and concerns about the study. The final protocol was approved for funding by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (CE-1304-6173). The trial began enrollment on April 1, 2014.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^3f4dc165]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

SPINAL CORD DISTRESS AND TIMELY MANAGEMENT

The translation of these techniques is most likely to benefit patients with mild forms of DCM where there is greater diagnostic uncertainty, for example, with fewer displaying the more objective examination findings (e.g. Hoffman sign), but also given the management uncertainty; are the risks of surgery warranted against the natural history of mild DCM? In keeping with DCM research in general, relatively few imaging studies have investigated mild myelopathy. Martin et al used microstructural MRI, in particular T2✱ gray matter/white matter ratio assessment, to identify subclinical evidence of spinal cord damage in a cohort of patients with cervical stenosis, thus confirming promise. This finding is supported by similar studies using multimodal evoked potentials, suggesting solutions may also lie outside of imaging. Whatever the modality, the development of assessments to unlock this conundrum is crucial: being able to identify who requires surgery, and perform it before there is irreversible damage, would transform outcomes for DCM, moving it from a paradigm of reactive to pre-emptive care.

### Anterior cervical approach for the treatment of cervical myelopathy [^236f7fb9]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Compression of the spinal cord by the degenerating cervical spine tends to lead to progressive clinical symptoms over a variable period of time. Surgical decompression can stop this process and lead to recovery of function. The choice of surgical technique depends on what is causing the compression of the spinal cord. This article reviews the symptoms and assessment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (clinically evident compression of the spinal cord) and discusses the indications for decompression of the spinal cord anteriorly.

### Imaging approach to the cord T2 hyperintensity (myelopathy) [^2004d9e6]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

In clinically suspected cases of myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging without and with gadolinium remains the modality of choice. The first and best imaging approach in the evaluation of myelopathy is to identify whether the cause of myelopathy is compressive or noncompressive. The commonest imaging finding in myelopathy is either focal or diffuse cord hyperintensity on the T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. Detailed clinical history, acuity of symptoms (acute vs insidious onset), distribution of the signal abnormalities, including length of cord involvement, specific tract involvement, and the region of the spinal cord that is affected, are very useful in making the diagnosis.

### The blood-spinal cord barrier: morphology and clinical implications [^7679607d]. Annals of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is the functional equivalent of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the sense of providing a specialized microenvironment for the cellular constituents of the spinal cord. Even if intuitively the BSCB could be considered as the morphological extension of the BBB into the spinal cord, evidence suggests that this is not so. The BSCB shares the same principal building blocks with the BBB; nevertheless, it seems that morphological and functional differences may exist between them. Dysfunction of the BSCB plays a fundamental role in the etiology or progression of several pathological conditions of the spinal cord, such as spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and radiation-induced myelopathy. This review summarizes current knowledge of the morphology of the BSCB, the methodology of studying the BSCB, and the potential role of BSCB dysfunction in selected disorders of the spinal cord, and finally summarizes therapeutic approaches to the BSCB.

### Spinal cord atrophy as a measure of severity of myelopathy in adrenoleukodystrophy [^bcd8c8cb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

All men and most women with X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) develop myelopathy in adulthood. As clinical trials with new potential disease‐modifying therapies are emerging, sensitive outcome measures for quantifying myelopathy are needed. This prospective cohort study evaluated spinal cord size (cross‐sectional area ‐ CSA) and shape (eccentricity) as potential new quantitative outcome measures for myelopathy in ALD. Seventy‐four baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, acquired in 42 male ALD patients and 32 age‐matched healthy controls, and 26 follow‐up scans of ALD patients were included in the study. We used routine T 1 ‐weighted MRI sequences to measure mean CSA, eccentricity, right‐left and anteroposterior diameters in the cervical spinal cord. We compared MRI measurements between groups and correlated CSA with clinical outcome measures of disease severity. Longitudinally, we compared MRI measurements between baseline and 1‐year follow‐up. CSA was significantly smaller in patients compared to controls on all measured spinal cord levels (P < .001). The difference was completely explained by the effect of the symptomatic subgroup. Furthermore, the spinal cord showed flattening (higher eccentricity and smaller anteroposterior diameters) in patients. CSA correlated strongly with all clinical measures of severity of myelopathy. There was no detectable change in CSA after 1‐year follow‐up. The cervical spinal cord in symptomatic ALD patients is smaller and flattened compared to controls, possibly due to atrophy of the dorsal columns. CSA is a reliable marker of disease severity and can be a valuable outcome measure in long‐term follow‐up studies in ALD.

Synopsis

A prospective cohort study in 42 adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) patients and 32 controls demonstrated that the spinal cord cross‐sectional area of patients is smaller compared to healthy controls and correlates with severity of myelopathy in patients, hence it could be valuable as a much needed surrogate outcome measure.

### Spinal cord delineation based on computed tomography myelogram versus T2 magnetic resonance imaging in spinal stereotactic body radiation therapy [^532054cf]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Spinal cord delineation is critical to the delivery of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Although underestimating the spinal cord can lead to irreversible myelopathy, overestimating the spinal cord may compromise the planning target volume coverage. We compare spinal cord contours based on computed tomography (CT) simulation with a myelogram to spinal cord contours based on fused axial T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods and Materials

Eight patients with 9 spinal metastases treated with spinal SBRT were contoured by 8 radiation oncologists, neurosurgeons, and physicists, with spinal cord definition based on (1) fused axial T2 MRI and (2) CT-myelogram simulation images, yielding 72 sets of spinal cord contours. The spinal cord volume was contoured at the target vertebral body volume based on both images. The mixed-effect model assessed comparisons of T2 MRI- to myelogram-defined spinal cord in centroid deviations (deviations in the center point of the cord) through the vertebral body target volume, spinal cord volumes, and maximum doses (0.035 cc point) to the spinal cord applying the patient's SBRT treatment plan, in addition to in-between and within-subject variabilities.

Results

The estimate for the fixed effect from the mixed model showed that the mean difference between 72 CT volumes and 72 MRI volumes was 0.06 cc and was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, –0.034, 0.153; P = 0.1832). The mixed model showed that the mean dose at 0.035 cc for CT-defined spinal cord contours was 1.24 Gy lower than that of MRI-defined spinal cord contours and was statistically significant (95% confidence interval, –2.292, –0.180; P = 0.0271). Also, the mixed model indicated no statistical significance for deviations in any of the axes between MRI-defined spinal cord contours and CT-defined spinal cord contours.

Conclusions

CT myelogram may not be required when MRI imaging is feasible, although uncertainty at the cord-to-treatment volume interface may result in overcontouring and hence higher estimated cord dose-maximums with axial T2 MRI-based cord definition.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: a multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^56469da4]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is the most common form of nontraumatic spinal cord injury in adults, with a rising incidence among the global ageing population. DCM‐induced disability can differently manifest in individuals, spanning a spectrum from mild pain and minor hand numbness to severe cases of incomplete tetraplegia. These severe cases can result in long‐lasting impairments of upper extremity function, gait difficulties, and bladder dysfunction. DCM is characterized by chronic spinal cord compression, leading to neural tissue destruction at the site of compression, but also remote changes of the spinal cord, and can even affect the brain. The current standard of care for moderate to severe DCM is surgical decompression. Nevertheless, in the case of mildly affected DCM patients, the ideal timing for surgical intervention remains uncertain. Additionally, it is worth noting that even after anatomically successful surgery, some DCM patients may still experience progressive disability.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) techniques have the potential to offer biomarkers that are sensitive to pathophysiological changes with clinical significance. Consequently, these techniques hold promise for enhancing the prediction of recovery in patients with DCM and helping with clinical decision‐making. The robustness and reproducibility of qMRI methods across multiple clinical sites are crucial prerequisites for the development of such biomarkers. Furthermore, there is a growing need to enhance statistical power to improve the efficiency of clinical trials. We here use an established qMRI protocol sensitive to microstructural changes in the brain and cervical cord that has already been applied and validated in a multicentre study in healthy subjects in the scope of a European multicentre/multivendor clinical trial. These studies showed high repeatability and reproducibility of multiparametric mapping (MPM) in the brain and cervical cord across different vendors and sites.

To simultaneously track changes in the brain and cervical cord, we further make use of a probabilistic brain–spinal cord template (SPM‐BSC). This approach has been successfully applied to traumatic spinal cord injury patients and patients with multiple sclerosis. We aim to simultaneously map the regional distribution of neurodegeneration in the brain and cervical cord in patients with mild–moderate DCM by means of qMRI. We further aim to assess the effects of the severity of intramedullary injury (i.e. radiologically established cervical myelopathy) on remote microstructural changes and clinical impairments.

### Risk factors for development of myelopathy in patients with cervical spondylotic cord compression [^f077dc36]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To clarify risk factors for the development of myelopathy in patients with cervical spondylotic cord compression.

Method

The authors reviewed articles in which risk factors for the development of myelopathy in patients with cervical spondylotic cord compression were discussed. Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) was also reviewed as a disease which causes cervical cord compression to clarify pathomechanism of the development of myelopathy.

Results

Cervical motion segment disorders are considered to be multifactorial, and developmental size of the canal and foramina, pathological encroachment, biomechanical effects, and circulatory deficiencies are always present to some degree. Static and dynamic factors should be considered for the development of myelopathy. To clarify the pathomechanism of the development of myelopathy in patients with cervical spondylotic spinal cord compression, the exact natural history of CSM should be understood.

Conclusion

Several predictable risk factors for the development of myelopathy have been proposed in CSM or OPLL studies, but they were not definitive. Further prospective population-based study is needed to clarify the mechanism.

### Spinal cord atrophy as a measure of severity of myelopathy in adrenoleukodystrophy [^cadf0efc]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, no disease‐modifying treatment is available to halt or slow the progression of myelopathy in ALD, but new potential therapies are under development (eg, NCT03231878). Clinical trials to determine efficacy are difficult because current measures for the severity of myelopathy are not sensitive to small changes in disease severity (requiring long studies with large numbers of patients), 7, 13 are affected by floor and ceiling effects (which means patients at the extreme ends of the disease spectrum cannot be included in trials) and are not disease specific (ie, walking tests can be influenced by other diseases such as joint arthrosis). Therefore, new surrogate outcome measures are needed.

Spinal cord atrophy measured by conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been studied in various neurodegenerative disorders. In diseases such as hereditary spastic paraplegias, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a significant smaller spinal cord cross‐sectional area (CSA) was found in patients compared to healthy controls. 14, 15, 16 Furthermore, CSA was associated with disease severity and progression in multiple sclerosis. 17 In addition to CSA, morphometric spinal cord parameters, such as eccentricity, right‐left (RL) and anteroposterior (AP) diameters, have been used for a more detailed description of structural changes in the spinal cord in neurological diseases like Friedreich's ataxia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 18, 19, 20, 21 Although spinal cord degeneration is the pathological hallmark of ALD and atrophy has been previously described, 22, 23 only one dedicated study on quantifying spinal cord atrophy has been performed to date. Cervical and thoracic CSA was reduced 26%‐40% in 13 ALD males compared to 12 healthy controls, but the degree of reduction did not correlate to a clinical disability or disease duration. 24 Confirmation of these data in larger cohorts and longitudinal data are lacking.

The main objective of this prospective cohort study was to quantify the degree of spinal cord atrophy in ALD. We measured different spinal cord MRI metrics (ie, CSA, eccentricity and RL and AP diameters). We correlated spinal cord CSA with conventional clinical outcome measures and evaluated this parameter as a potential surrogate outcome measure for the severity of myelopathy in ALD.

### Guidelines for the management of acute cervical spine and spinal cord injuries: 2013 update [^8d76e478]. Neurosurgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy — prognostic indicators and functional assessments indicate there is consistent Class III evidence that the duration of symptoms, and possibly advancing age, negatively affect outcome, and multidomain measures such as the Myelopathy Disability Index, mJOA (or JOA), the Short Form-36, and quantitative gait analysis were found to be valid, reliable, and responsive in patients with CSM; there is clearly a need for further validation of outcome measures used in CSM as the gold standard has yet to be defined, and patient satisfaction scores remain important but standardized measurement remains a challenge.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: current state of the art and future directions [^730addd3]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

Narrative overview of the focus issue on cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

Objective

To provide an introduction to this special focus issue of Spine journal that deals with CSM.

Summary Of Background Data

CSM is a progressive spine disease and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction worldwide. The shift in population demographics in many parts of the world has motivated the development of this focus issue. With the overall aging of the population, we can predict that global health care systems will be confronted with an increase in patients presenting with degenerative spine changes and various stages of cervical myelopathy.

Methods

The articles in this issue vary in their methods-there are systematic reviews, narrative reviews, a study protocol, and 2 primary research articles.

Results

A summary of the findings of each article is provided as a table within this introduction.

Conclusion

By way of this issue, we have summarized current knowledge gaps and limitations in the evidence to provide direction for future research and investigation. These include the need for a unified nomenclature for referring to CSM, the need to specify the incidence of myelopathy and the prevalence of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, and the need to explore both the safety and efficacy of neuroprotective and neuroreparative pharmacological strategies. Further work is also required to optimize the management of patients with minimal symptoms.

Degenerative disease of the cervical spine commonly occurs in the natural process of aging. This can lead to compression of the spinal cord and symptomatic myelopathy. We review the pathophysiological factors that lead to myelopathy and the controversial natural history of untreated myelopathy. Signs and symptoms at presentation, examination findings, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic studies are also discussed.

### Long-term results after surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^d36f2161]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a frequent cause of spinal cord dysfunction, and surgical treatment is considered safe and effective. Long-term results after surgery are limited. This study investigated long-term clinical outcomes through data from the Norwegian registry for spine surgery.

Methods

Patients operated at the university hospitals serving Central and Northern Norway were approached for long-term follow-up after 3 to 8 years. The primary outcome was change in the Neck Disability Index, and the secondary outcomes were changes in the European Myelopathy Scale score, quality of life (EuroQoL EQ-5D); numeric rating scales (NRS) for headache, neck pain, and arm pain; and perceived benefit of surgery assessed by the Global Perceived Effect scale from 1 year to long-term follow-up.

Results

We included 144 patients operated between January 2013 and June 2018. In total, 123 participants (85.4%) provided patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at long-term follow-up. There was no significant change in PROMs from 1 year to long-term follow-up, including Neck Disability Index (mean 1.0, 95% CI -2.1–4.1, P = 0.53), European Myelopathy Scale score (mean -0.3, 95% CI -0.7–0.1, P = 0.09), EQ-5D index score (mean -0.02, 95% CI -0.09–0.05, P = 0.51), NRS neck pain (mean 0.3 95% CI -0.2–0.9, P = 0.22), NRS arm pain (mean -0.1, 95% CI -0.8–0.5, P = 0.70), and NRS headache (mean 0.4, 95% CI -0.1–0.9, P = 0.11). According to Global Perceived Effect assessments, 106/121 patients (87.6%) reported to be stable or improved ("complete recovery", "much better", "slightly better", or "unchanged") at long-term follow-up compared with 88.1% at 1 year. Dichotomizing the outcome data based on severity of DCM did not demonstrate significant changes either.

Conclusion

Long-term follow-up of patients undergoing surgery for DCM demonstrates persistence of statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement across a wide range of PROMs.

### Pathophysiology and natural history of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^558c6b4a]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Study Design

This study is a combination of narrative and systematic review.

Objective

Clinicians who deal with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) should be up-to-date with the emerging knowledge related to the cascade of pathobiological secondary events that take place under chronic cervical spinal cord compression. Moreover, by performing a systematic review, we aim to (1) describe the natural history and (2) determine potential risk factors that affect the progression of CSM.

Summary Of Background Data

The pathophysiology, natural history, as well as the factors associated with clinical deterioration have not been fully described in CSM.

Methods

For the first part of the study, a literature review was performed. To answer key questions 1 and 2 of the second goal, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration Library for articles published between January 1, 1956, and November 7, 2012. We included all articles that described the progression and outcomes of CSM for which no surgical intervention was given.

Results

By performing a narrative literature review, we found that the assumption that acute traumatic spinal cord injury and CSM share a similar series of cellular and molecular secondary injury events was made in the past. However, recent advances in basic research have shown that the chronic mechanical compression results in secondary injury mechanisms that have distinct characteristics regarding the nature and the temporal profile compared with those of spinal cord injury. For the purpose of the systematic review, 10 studies yielding 16 publications met inclusion criteria for key questions 2 and 3. Moderate-strength evidence related to the natural history of CSM suggests that 20% to 60% of patients will deteriorate neurologically over time without surgical intervention. Finally, there is low-strength evidence indicating that the area of circumferential compression is associated with deteriorating neurological symptoms.

Conclusion

CSM has unique pathobiological mechanisms that mainly remain unexplored. Although the natural history of CSM can be mixed, surgical intervention eliminates the chances of the neurological deterioration. EVIDENCE-BASED CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

Recommendation

Evidence concerning the natural history of CSM suggests that 20% to 60% of patients will deteriorate neurologically over time without surgical intervention. Therefore, we recommend that patients with mild CSM be counseled regarding the natural history of CSM and have the option of surgical decompression explained.

Overall Strength Of Evidence

Moderate.

Strength Of Recommendation

Strong. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: Chronic compression of the spinal cord results in progressive neural cell loss related to secondary mechanisms including apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and vascular disruption.

### Is decompressive surgery effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy? [^0c116063]. Spine (2010). Low credibility.

Study Design

A retrospective multicenter study of series of 12 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery.

Objective

To evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive myelopathy and effect of decompressive surgery on the prognosis of sarcoidosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease. It is difficult to differentiate spinal cord sarcoidosis from cervical compressive myelopathy. There are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery.

Methods

Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005. A total of 12 patients (0.08% of cervical myelopathy) were identified spinal cord sarcoidosis treated with decompressive surgery. As a control subject, 8 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis without compressive lesion who underwent high-dose steroid therapy without surgery were recruited.

Results

In the surgery group, enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were mostly seen at C5-C6, coincident with the maximum compression level in all cases. Postoperative recovery rates in the surgery group at 1 week and 4 weeks were -7.4% and -1.1%, respectively. Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from other organ and steroid therapy should be needed.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: a spectrum of related disorders affecting the aging spine [^1ba31905]. Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Cervical spinal cord dysfunction can result from either traumatic or nontraumatic causes, including tumors, infections, and degenerative changes. In this article, we review the range of degenerative spinal disorders resulting in progressive cervical spinal cord compression and propose the adoption of a new term, degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). DCM comprises both osteoarthritic changes to the spine, including spondylosis, disk herniation, and facet arthropathy (collectively referred to as cervical spondylotic myelopathy), and ligamentous aberrations such as ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum. This review summarizes current knowledge of the pathophysiology of DCM and describes the cascade of events that occur after compression of the spinal cord, including ischemia, destruction of the blood-spinal cord barrier, demyelination, and neuronal apoptosis. Important features of the diagnosis of DCM are discussed in detail, and relevant clinical and imaging findings are highlighted. Furthermore, this review outlines valuable assessment tools for evaluating functional status and quality of life in these patients and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of each. Other topics of this review include epidemiology, the prevalence of degenerative changes in the asymptomatic population, the natural history and rates of progression, risk factors of diagnosis (clinical, imaging and genetic), and management strategies.

### Proposing a framework to understand the role of imaging in degenerative cervical myelopathy: enhancement of MRI protocols needed for accurate diagnosis and evaluation [^2fdd6220]. Spine (2022). Medium credibility.

IMMEDIATE OUTLOOK

While these new modalities remain in development, there are many simpler gains. For example, from discussions within the RECODE DCM working group, it became apparent the imaging framework would support educational initiatives. For example, those living with DCM referenced the common "lay" misconception that a diagnostic test provides certainty. For similar reasons, this could help raise awareness among nonexpert professionals, to identify those with seemingly mild stenosis and symptoms and allow for timely management, while avoiding surgery in patients with asymptomatic stenosis.

Future directions in the neuroimaging evaluation of DCM require a standardized definition of spinal canal narrowing, spinal cord compression and intrinsic cord signal changes. Systematic literature reviews with consensus-based evidence synthesis could set the stage for the development of an objective imaging diagnostic framework for DCM. Creating a simple framework for diagnosis in DCM has the potential to dramatically change care and outcomes. Novel methods for determining spinal cord distress are currently under examination and may reshape our view on DCM, but remain a work in progress. We look forward to the feedback and perspectives of the community and hope more will work with us on this endeavor.

### Does age affect surgical outcomes in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy? Results from the prospective multicenter AOSpine international study on 479 patients [^92a2ffab]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Currently, the global population is experiencing a shift in its age structure. According to the WHO, the proportion of the population over 60 years of age is projected to double from 11% in 2010 to 22% in 2050. With this ageing of the population, clinicians worldwide will be required to manage an increasing number of spinal disorders related to advancing age, including degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).

DCM is a progressive, degenerative spine disease and the most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in adults worldwide. It is caused by age-related alterations to the spinal axis including (1) degeneration of the facet joints, intervertebral discs and/or vertebral bodies; (2) hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum; and (3) ossification of the longitudinal ligament (OPLL), all of which may chronically compress the spinal cord. Of patients with evidence of spinal degeneration, approximately one-quarter will develop symptoms of neurological impairment due to mechanical compression of the neural elements.

When patients present with symptomatic myelopathy, surgery is effective at halting further deterioration and improving neurological outcomes, functional status and quality of life. However, there is controversy regarding whether surgical decompression is equally effective and safe in elderly patients as it is in younger patients. Several studies to date have identified age as a significant predictor of surgical outcome, including the recent prospective multicenter AOSpine CSM-North America and CSM-International studies. In general, older patients have reduced recovery potential following surgery due to comorbidities, diminished physiological reserves and age-related changes to the spinal cord, including a decrease in the number of myelinated fibres in the corticospinal tracts and posterior funiculus. Furthermore, the elderly are likely to have more substantial degenerative pathology and may require a more complex surgery.

There are several methodological limitations and knowledge gaps in the current body of literature. These include (1) a lack of multicentre prospective studies with large sample sizes; (2) insufficient evidence reporting the association between age and quality of life (QOL) outcomes such as the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36); and (3) a lack of statistical analyses appropriately adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics and surgical factors.

### Myelopathy: chameleons and mimics [^af9dd0b4]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of spinal cord disease may be delayed or missed if the presentation does not conform to the expected pattern of a symmetrical spastic paraparesis with sphincter dysfunction and a sensory level. This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^11494cf1]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, our SCT-based analysis pipeline provides a robust, scalable, and clinically relevant tool for the assessment of DCM. By automating the segmentation, labeling, and registration of spinal cord images, the pipeline generates standardized and reproducible morphometric measures that are directly translatable to clinical practice. These metrics allow clinicians to quantify spinal cord damage, assess disease progression, and tailor treatment strategies to individual patients. The integration of MT and T2✱ further enhances the pipeline's ability to assess both white and gray matter integrity, offering valuable insights into the microstructural changes that accompany.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of acute intramedullary myelopathy: radiological differential diagnosis for the on-call radiologist [^ba73bff2]. Clinical Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Spinal cord disease is often viewed as having a poor outcome. Although in certain conditions this is true, non-traumatic myelopathy encompasses a vast array of diseases some of which are exquisitely responsive to treatment. Accurate diagnosis becomes important as damage is often progressive and long-term disability and morbidity is related to the degree of neurological impairment when the diagnosis is reached. Out-of-hours magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally requested and performed to ascertain whether there is spinal cord compression; however, there are other causes of a cord syndrome, which are more subtle. This review aims to provide a summary of the imaging features of non-traumatic intramedullary spinal cord emergencies, many of which may appear radiologically similar.

### Myelopathies in patients with cancer… [^3d8ea87a]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Accurate neurologic assessment of patients is crucial for early diagnosis and correct therapy. Myelopathy in patients with cancer is not rare. Epidural spinal cord compression affects an estimated 5% of patients with cancer; other disorders such as intramedullary spinal cord metastases, adverse effects of therapy, and paraneoplastic spinal cord syndromes, although less common, are equally devastating. Extension of paravertebral tumor through the neural foramina may compress the cord without vertebral involvement. Rarely, tumor spreads directly to the epidural space itself. 2 In keeping with relative size and blood flow, metastases to the thoracic cord are most common, followed by the lumbar and cervical regions. 2 Symptom onset may be gradual in the case of a slowly expanding mass or rapid in the case of a vertebral fracture with herniation of bone or disc elements into the epidural space.

The resulting SCC causes initially reversible edema followed by eventually irreversible vascular occlusion, lending urgency to the evaluation. 3 Back pain is the presenting symptom in more than 80% of patients. 4, 5Weakness is present in 35% to 75% of patients at diagnosis, with one-half unable to walk. 4 Functional status at diagnosis is the strongest prognostic factor, with inability to ambulate or sphincter dysfunction suggesting poor neurologic outcomes. 3, 4Urgent evaluation of new or worsening back pain or any other neurologic symptom is essential in any patient with cancer. The physician confronted with a patient with cancer who has back pain or a patient with or without cancer who develops myelopathic symptoms must move quickly. After a careful history and examination, the physician should order an MRI of the entire spine with and without contrast. This test usually establishes the diagnosis and dictates treatment.

If a mass lesion with cord compression is found, high-dose corticosteroids should be administered and the patient should be assessed for surgical intervention as surgical removal of the lesion, when feasible, usually yields the best palliation and prognosis. Spinal cord complications in patients with cancer are not rare and drastically affect prognosis and quality of life when they occur. Many are amenable to therapy with steroids, radiation, surgery, chemotherapy, and symptomatic treatment. Early recognition and early diagnosis of symptoms are essential for potentially improved neurologic outcome. Astute clinical assessment can help guide appropriate therapy and maximize its benefit to improve patient survival and quality of life.

### Fractionated radiotherapy for spinal tumors: a literature review regarding spinal glioma, ependymoma, and meningioma [^f107b495]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Spinal tumors are a notably rare disease in adults, with an estimated frequency of only around 1 case per 1 000 000 persons per year. In addition to surgical intervention, radiotherapy (RT) plays a significant role in managing these tumors. Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance to recognize that the spinal cord is exceptionally sensitive to radiation exposure, which poses a substantial risk of causing myelopathy. Such complications can significantly diminish a patient's quality of life and even prove to be life threatening. This inherent sensitivity must be carefully taken into consideration when prescribing treatment doses for spinal tumor therapy. According to the QUANTEC (Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) estimations, the likelihood of myelopathy is projected at 0.2%, 6%, and 50% for dose levels of 50Gy, 60Gy, and 69Gy, respectively, when considering equivalent doses of 2Gy. For diseases located outside the spine, a common conventional dose constraint for the spinal cord is often established at 45Gy. The aim is to minimize the potential risk for myelopathy, particularly as the spinal cord serves as an organ at risk. In the context of spinal RT, higher doses are necessary to achieve an effective local control. As a result, doses of up to 54Gy are commonly used, even though they harbor a risk of approximately 1%–2% for myelopathy. To justify this risk, a certain level of treatment success must be attainable.

There are mainly 2 types of radiation-induced myelopathy: early and late myelopathy. Early myelopathy appears typically 2–4 months after radiotherapy, and is associated with large volumes of irradiated spine than higher doses. It typically shows electrifying pain, the L´hermitte syndrome, and is mostly self-limiting after a few months. Late myelopathy is associated with higher irradiation doses, often leads to serious neurological deficits, and can be permanent. Treatment usually consists of corticosteroids. Similar to radionecrosis after cranial radiotherapy, bevacizumab is a potential treatment option for radiation myelopathy and has shown promising results in some case reports. Another recent case report suggests intravenous immune globulin as a treatment for delayed radiation myelopathy. To conclude, there are several treatment approaches to this serious adverse effect, but none of them is reliable and mostly only alleviates the symptoms. Avoiding this radiation-induced toxicity should, therefore, be of high priority while treating tumors of the spinal cord.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^cb619ac8]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive and disabling condition resulting from chronic compression of the spinal cord, leading to functional impairments that can severely affect quality of life. Traditional methods for assessing spinal cord injury and morphometrics rely on subjective visualization of contrast changes and manual segmentation, which are nonstandardized, time-consuming, and inconsistent across patients. This variability limits understanding of DCM pathology and hampers timely clinical intervention.

METHODS:

We introduce a semiautomated pipeline using the Spinal Cord Toolbox, an open-source platform that uses advanced algorithms, including optimization and computational efficiency algorithms, support vector machine, and convolutional neural networks, to streamline the assessment of spinal cord shape, microstructural changes, and gray and white matter integrity. By integrating spinal cord segmentation, anatomical labeling, and registration to a standardized template, the pipeline extracts normalized morphometric measures, providing efficient and reliable analysis of spinal cord pathology in DCM.

RESULTS:

We extracted normalized spinal cord morphometrics, including cross-sectional area (CSA), anterior-posterior diameter, right-left diameter, eccentricity, solidity, gray matter CSA, white matter CSA, and regional and tract-based magnetization transfer ratio measures. Our analysis demonstrates that DCM patients exhibit significant reductions in these morphometrics compared with healthy controls, even in regions without visible compression. Furthermore, CSA reductions across the spinal cord highlight areas of severe compression, including at the intervertebral disks, which may not be apparent on standard imaging.

CONCLUSION:

These quantitative measures give clinicians easily interpretable data on the extent of spinal cord injury, even in regions without obvious compression. This enables a comprehensive understanding of DCM pathophysiology. By eliminating the subjectivity of manual segmentation and accounting for intersubject and intrasubject variability, this approach supports consistent cross-subject comparisons and is poised to reshape how clinicians assess and manage DCM.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^6f628d0f]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Spinal metastases with radiographic spinal cord compression — management includes steroid initiation and surgery or radiotherapy according to stability and histology. For tumors occurring below L1, any canal compression of 50% or more should be considered of equal importance as spinal cord compression, and patients with radiographic cord compression should start on dexamethasone (10–100 mg) to alleviate symptoms. Decompressive surgery (concomitant stabilization if indicated) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is the preferred treatment (category 1) where there is spinal instability and no surgical contraindication; primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone is appropriate for patients with radiosensitive cancers (hematologic malignancies) and without evidence of spinal instability. Many fractionation schemes are available (8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fractions); the most common is a total of 30 Gy in 3-Gy daily fractions for 10 days. Primary systemic therapy is also an option for chemo-responsive tumors in the absence of clinical myelopathy, with close neurologic monitoring, and in general, a treatment interval of at least 6 months is recommended.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^a03680fd]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is an umbrella term for symptomatic spinal cord compression, secondary to degenerative changes of the cervical spine. Symptoms are often debilitating and progressive, typically resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.

Disease severity is often quantified using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) score, an objective physician evaluation of neurological dysfunction. Moderate and severe DCM are defined as cases where mJOA ≤ 14 and surgery has been recommended for such patients, as outlined in the most recent clinical practice guidelines. Prior to surgery, many factors contribute to a delay in diagnosis in moderate/severe DCM. Nonetheless, there is a consensus amongst surgeons in support of operative management.

In contrast, there is weak evidence informing the management of mild DCM, most commonly defined in the literature as mJOA 15–17. Amongst mild DCM patients, there is a subpopulation that deteriorates and another which remains stable. An absence of prognostic biomarkers and symptoms means that there are no strong predictions to support decision making.

Guidelines therefore currently suggest surgical intervention or a trial of structured rehabilitation in mild DCM, with the latter escalating to the former in cases of deterioration. This tentative guidance is reflected in variable practice, as has been anecdotally reported by surgeons. There is no specification on what structured rehabilitation or surveillance should entail.

Similar heterogeneity is believed to exist in the management of ASCC, a precursor to DCM. In this case, the guidelines cite weak evidence supporting non-operative management, involving counselling and education. Likewise, what this should constitute remains undefined.

Whilst widespread underdiagnosis so far limits the number of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease in spinal clinics, this is estimated to be vast (one meta-analysis estimates 1 in 5 adults could have ASCC) and rising with aging. Initiatives to accelerate diagnosis are on-going, and anticipated to increase case ascertainment.

On this background of weak evidence and variable practice, and driven by projected demand, efforts to better inform care for mild DCM and ASCC are a critical priority. The objective of this study was to assess current practices in the assessment and management of mild DCM and ASCC. This work also aligns with two other research priorities of the AO Spine RECODE-DCM initiative: diagnostic criteria and assessment and monitoring. We hypothesise that there is substantial variability in the definition, assessment, and management of mild DCM and ASCC.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^b9bb2411]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Spondylotic degeneration in the cervical spine may result in static and/or dynamic spinal cord compression that can lead to the associated signs and symptoms of myelopathy. Clinical examination combined with appropriate imaging studies help to confirm the diagnosis. Classic natural history and basic science studies suggest a pernicious course of demyelination and neurologic decline in a large subset of patients. The characterization of disease severity and progression in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy has improved in recent years with imaging and data from prospective and multicenter studies. Additionally, advances in surgical techniques, implants, and imaging modalities have improved the identification of surgical candidates with cervical spondylotic myelopathy and associated treatment strategies. Surgical treatment, via an anterior, posterior, or a combined approach, is primarily intended to arrest neurologic progression, although it can improve function in many patients. Alignment and the characteristics and location of spinal cord compression help determine the ideal surgical approach. Distinct complications associated with each technique may be mitigated by appropriate patient selection and should be discussed preoperatively to ensure informed decision making.

### Recovery following ischemic myelopathies and traumatic spinal cord lesions [^c1c2c830]. Spinal Cord (2011). Low credibility.

Background

As the general population ages, the rising prevalence of vascular lesions of the spinal cord will become significant. The aim of this study was to compare the neurological and functional outcomes of patients with ischemic spinal cord injury (ISCI) and traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).

Setting

Spinal cord unit of a rehabilitation hospital in Italy.

Study Design

Retrospective study.

Patients and Methods

We studied 179 patients with a TSCI and 68 with an ISCI. At admission and discharge, patients were examined by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards, Barthel Index, Rivermead Mobility Index and Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury. Bowel and bladder management and discharge destination were recorded at discharge. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and logistic regression models were used to analyze the effects of the etiology of the lesion, AIS level at admission, site of the lesion and the presence of complications on measured outcomes.

Results

Patients with an ISCI were older and experienced fewer cervical lesions and complications at admission. By ANCOVA and logistic regression, age, AIS level and lesion level were the chief predictors of neurological and functional outcome, whereas etiology had no effect on outcome.

Conclusions

A diagnosis of ischemia and trauma is not a determinant of neurological and functional recovery in spinal cord injury patients. Instead, the outcome of these patients is influenced by age, lesion level and AIS level.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^a6bdace7]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

How is it managed?

Often cord compression is an incidental finding and at least initially does not cause symptoms. Reassure the patient that no further management is required at this stage but advise them to report any symptoms promptly in the future.

Guidelines from AOSpinean international community of spine surgeons advise that all patients with DCM should be assessed by a specialist surgeon, who might fall under the remit of neurosurgery or orthopaedics. The guidelines use the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, which classifies patients as having mild or severe symptoms based on arm, leg, and bladder function. Surgery is recommended in patients with moderate or severe DCM and in those with disease progression. Treatment of symptoms (for pain, for example) and regular follow-up might be offered for patients with mild, stable DCM.

The AOSpine series showed that decompressive surgery can halt disease progression and enable meaningful, albeit limited, recovery across a range of measures including pain, function, and quality of life. The optimal timing of surgery is debatable because the progression of disease is poorly understood. Preoperative physiotherapy should only be advised by specialist services; neck manipulation is strictly contraindicated as it might cause further damage.

It is not possible to predict the long term outcome of surgery. Maximal recovery occurs at around 6–12 months. Residual symptoms beyond this are likely to be permanent and should be managed appropriately. Functional deficits are common, and include falls and reduced mobility, incontinence, depression, sleep deficits, and struggles with self-care, and often the most troublesome symptom is pain. Discuss with your patient that complete resolution of pain is unlikely. Neuropathic analgesia and anti-spasticity medication can be offered to manage the pain. Early referral to specialist pain clinics is often helpful.

### Effect of spinal cord signal intensity changes on clinical outcome after surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy [^4f29f9e7]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The presence of intramedullary T2 high signal intensity changes in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) indicates the existence of a chronic spinal cord compressive lesion. However, the prognostic significance of signal intensity changes remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of spinal cord T2 signal intensity changes on the outcome after surgery for CSM.

Method

In a prospective study, 64 patients with CSM who underwent surgical treatment between October 2006 and April 2008 using an anterior approach were included. Based on the clinical symptoms and signs present, the severity of neurological deficits of all patients was scored according to a modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale score for CSM just before the surgery and at 6 months follow-up. Recovery rates were calculated at 6 months.

Results

There were 22 patients who did not have spinal cord intensity changes on MR imaging and 44 who demonstrated high-intensity signal changes on T2-weighted images (focal or segmental). No statistically significant differences were found in recovery rates between cases with T2 signal intensity changes and those with no signal intensity changes. However, the postoperative modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale scores and the recovery rates were much lower in patients with multisegmental signal intensity changes compared with those without these changes or those with focal signal intensity change, and ANOVA demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Multisegmental spinal cord signal intensity changes on T2-weighted MR imaging are predictors of a poor outcome in terms of functional recovery rate in patients undergoing operations for CSM.

### Spinal cord atrophy as a measure of severity of myelopathy in adrenoleukodystrophy [^4c3cddf9]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study shows that the spinal cord in male ALD patients is smaller and flatter compared to controls, likely due to atrophy predominantly affecting the dorsolateral columns. Moreover, spinal cord CSA is strongly associated with disease severity and represents a promising biomarker in the myelopathy of ALD. Due to a slowly progressive disease course, there is no detectable change after 1‐year follow‐up. In studies with a longer follow‐up period or multi‐centre studies, CSA can be of use since it requires only routine MRI sequences. Our future research is aimed at identifying more sensitive and dynamic outcome measures able to detect change after a shorter follow‐up period, such as optical coherence tomography, body sway measurement and other quantitative MRI techniques like DTI. These studies will hopefully contribute to clinical trial readiness in ALD.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a guide to diagnosis and management [^be22acd0]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is a neurologic condition that develops insidiously over time as degenerative changes of the spine result in compression of the cord and nearby structures. It is the most common form of spinal cord injury in adults; yet, its diagnosis is often delayed. The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis, and management of CSM with a focus on the recommended timeline for physicians suspecting CSM to refer patients to a spine surgeon. Various processes underlie spondylotic changes of the canal and are separated into static and dynamic factors. Not all patients with evidence of cord compression will present with symptoms, and the progression of disease varies by patient. The hallmark symptoms of CSM include decreased hand dexterity and gait instability as well as sensory and motor dysfunction. magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice in patients with suspected CSM, but computed tomography myelography may be used in patients with contraindications. Patients with mild CSM may be treated surgically or nonoperatively, whereas those with moderate-severe disease are treated operatively. Due to the long-term disability that may result from a delay in diagnosis and management, prompt referral to a spine surgeon is recommended for any patient suspected of having CSM. This review provides information and guidelines for practitioners to develop an actionable awareness of CSM.

### Do intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI affect surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament? [^f5226361]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Some controversy still exists over the optimal treatment time and the surgical approach for cervical myelopathy due to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). The aim of the current study was first to analyze the effect of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity (hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on surgical opportunity and approach for cervical myelopathy due to OPLL. This was a prospective randomized controlled study. Fifty-six patients with cervical myelopathy due to OPLL were enrolled and assigned to either group A (receiving anterior decompression and fusion, n = 27) or group P (receiving posterior laminectomy, n = 29). All the patients were followed up for an average 20.3 months (12–34 months). The clinical outcomes were assessed by the average operative time, blood loss, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, improvement rate (IR) and complication. To determine the relevant statistics, we made two factorial designs and regrouped the data of all patients to group H (with hyperintensity on MRI, n = 31), group L (with hypointensity on MRI, n = 19) and group N (no signal on MRI, n = 25), and then to further six subgroups as well: AH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group A, n = 15), PH (with hyperintensity on MRI from group P, n = 16), AL (with hypointensity on MRI from group A, n = 10), PL (with hypointensity on MRI from group P, n = 9), AN (no signal intensity on MRI from group A, n = 12) and PN (no signal intensity on MRI from group P, n = 13). Both hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging and hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging had a close relationship with the JOA score and IR. The pre- and postoperative JOA score and postoperative IR of either group H or group L was significantly lower than that of group N (P < 0.05), regardless of whether the patients had received anterior or posterior surgery. On the other hand, both the JOA score and IR of subgroup AH were higher than those of subgroup PH at 1 week, 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.05), as well as between subgroup AL and PL; but in group N, there was no difference between the subgroup AN and PN (P > 0.05). In conclusion, regardless of hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging or hypointensity on T1-weighted imaging in patients with OPLL, severe damage to the spinal cord is indicated. Surgical treatment should be provided before the advent of intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI. The anterior approach is more effective than posterior approach for treating cervical myelopathy due to OPLL characterized by intramedullary spinal cord changes in signal intensity on MRI.

### High-resolution quantitative MRI of multiple sclerosis spinal cord lesions [^1ebea3b7]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The myelin sheath is an extended and modified plasma membrane wrapped around axons in a spiral fashion. Myelin is composed of about 40% water, whereas the dry mass consists of about 80% lipids, primarily the glycolipid galactocerebroside, and 20% protein. Due to its importance for normal function of the nervous system, and severe consequences of myelin damage in demyelinating diseases (such as multiple sclerosis [MS]), the noninvasive in vivo assessment of myelin remains a key focus of imaging research, not least in the era of regenerative medicine.

The spinal cord is most commonly affected in people with MS at presentation. Lesions in the spinal cord have been shown to predict both a diagnosis of MS in patients with radiologically isolated, as well as clinically isolated, syndromes of demyelination; they are also associated with more severe disability. As MS evolves over time, much of the permanent and deteriorating disability in people with MS affects lower body functions, including lack of sphincter control, sexual dysfunction, and impaired leg movement and coordination, resembling the clinical syndrome of progressive myelopathy., Metrics such as spinal cord cross‐sectional area have been shown to be associated with MS‐related disability in vivo. However, the cross‐sectional area is affected by numerous elements of MS pathology including inflammation, edema, myelin content, the number of axons and gliosis.

### Increasing awareness of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a preventative cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^6a5019c1]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Perspective

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) (historically termed "cervical spondylotic myelopathy" [CSM]) is the most common non-traumatic, progressive spinal cord disorder with an estimated 2% prevalence. The disorder is indeed imprecisely and insufficiently characterized by neck and radicular pain, fine motor dysfunction, gait instability, and bladder dysfunction and for most lacks common diagnostic criteria. If not recognized and treated timely, patients may eventually present as incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). This letter aims to raise awareness of these shortcomings in the neurological community and emphasize an ongoing initiative to improve clinical care and foster global research. The neurological field should not be left out in this effort.

Due to a variety of symptoms, patients eventually get referred to different specialists, commonly orthopedics, neurosurgeons, neurologists, or physiotherapists. While surgical decompression of the encroached spinal cord is recommended in patients experiencing already moderate/severe, or progressive symptoms, the goal of enabling earlier and/or preventative treatment has now been defined as a priority research need. In its early stages, DCM is frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome or peripheral neuropathy, until patients develop more severe impairments of upper and lower limb function urging the consideration of incomplete cervical SCI. Given that DCM is a progressive but preventable neurological condition, the delayed diagnosis and late referral for evaluation of surgical decompression, can lead to poorer neurological outcomes. In addition, the pre-operative neurological status significantly influences post-operative recovery. Therefore, an early diagnosis is important to achieve good clinical results. The diagnosis of DCM is currently based on clinical signs and symptoms, eventually complemented by cervical spine MRI. However, there is still no consensus on diagnostic criteria for DCM, leading to ambiguous, descriptive clinical diagnoses, and heterogenous definitions of DCM applied in clinical studies. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the UK, DCM is rarely covered in the medical curriculum. AO Spine RECODE-DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) (aospine.org/recode) is an international, interdisciplinary, and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM, which aims to accelerate knowledge discovery that can change outcomes. This has included the formation of research priorities such as the development of common diagnostic criteria. Alongside its importance for clinical care, a sensitive and specific set of diagnostic criteria is required to foster research, particularly for those studies aiming at investigating neuroprotective strategies. Diagnostic criteria for DCM can help to overcome several shortcomings in patient care and research (Fig. 1). The development of diagnostic criteria for DCM would benefit from the experiences of the neurological community; a UK cohort study identified 45% of cases are initially diagnosed by Neurologists, whilst Neurologists are familiar with their development and implementation. Common criteria will help the dialog between neurologists, general practitioners (primary care providers), and spine specialists, and propagate the knowledge of red flags in DCM that require timely and specific actions, before established SCI. The development of diagnostic criteria involves both comprehensive diagnostic criteria for research and spine specialists, as well as easily applicable algorithms that speed up referral to cervical spine MRI and spine specialists. We have established an initial working group to act upon this opportunity (AO Spine RECODE DCM Diagnostic Criteria Incubator).

### Guidelines for the management of acute cervical spine and spinal cord injuries: 2013 update [^36fcb62d]. Neurosurgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy — natural history and mild disease definitions note that mild CSM is defined as a score of ≥ 12 on the mJOA scale, and there is evidence to suggest that the clinical condition remains stable when observed over a 3-year period in patients younger than 75 years of age; in the AOSpine North America study, mild CSM is defined more strictly as a myelopathic deficit with an mJOA scale score ≥ 15 and surgical decompression may be associated with improved clinical outcomes in this subgroup, and a prospective, multicenter study in 300 patients is expected.

### Malformed vertebrae: a clinical and imaging review [^6046589a]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The vertebral column and spinal cord develop early in gestation in a fine-tuned, sequential manner. Any disruption of this normal sequence of events can lead to variations in the structural anatomy of the spine and spinal cord. Structural malformations of the spine are often simple and may either go undetected or be discovered fortuitously. Occasionally, these may be complex with serious structural or neurological implications. These may occur sporadically, in isolation or as an accompaniment to multiorgan developmental malformations. When symptomatic, these abnormalities can predispose the affected individual to biomechanical instability, spinal canal narrowing and myelopathy and can even be life-threatening. Developmental defects of cardiovascular, neurological, urinary and reproductive systems may be associated.

This article overviews the embryology of the vertebral column and imaging appearance and clinical impact of the spectrum of abnormalities arising as a consequence of disordered development. It is difficult to separate discussion of the spine from that of the enclosed spinal cord, so associated spinal cord/brain anomalies will be mentioned where applicable but will not be elaborated.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^8d02b4a0]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Central nervous system cancers — spinal metastases with radiographic spinal cord compression are characterized by deformation of the spinal cord due to epidural tumor or retropulsed bone fragment, and for tumors occurring below L1, any canal compression of 50% or more should be considered of equal importance as spinal cord compression. Patients with radiographic cord compression should start on dexamethasone (10–100 mg) to alleviate symptoms, and decompressive surgery (concomitant stabilization if indicated) and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is the preferred treatment (category 1) where there is spinal instability and no surgical contraindication. Primary external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone is appropriate for patients with radiosensitive cancers and without evidence of spinal instability; many fractionation schemes are available (8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, or 30 Gy in 10 fractions); the most common is a total of 30 Gy in 3-Gy daily fractions for 10 days. Primary systemic therapy is also an option for chemo-responsive tumors in the absence of clinical myelopathy with close neurologic monitoring, and in general, a treatment interval of at least 6 months is recommended.

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a review of the evidence [^91804d48]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the most common progressive spinal cord disorder in patients more than 55 years old. This disease is also the most common cause of acquired spasticity in later life and may lead to progressive spasticity and neurologic decline. This article explores some of the controversies about CSM and reviews pertinent articles, specifically prospective and randomized clinical trials when possible, to obtain the cleanest and least biased data. The 4 current controversial topics that surround CSM are: (1) natural history of mild CSM; (2) surgical approach: anterior versus posterior; (3) laminoplasty or laminectomy; and (4) cervical arthroplasty for CSM.

### How has electrophysiology changed the management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy? [^1242e86f]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Cervical spondylosis occurs universally, with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) as its most serious consequence. The electrical property of the spinal cord and its susceptibility to injury renders electrophysiology relevant to the management of CSM, as addressed in this review. Somatosensory-evoked potentials evaluate spinal cord integrity with regards to posterior column functions exclusively. Although motor-evoked potentials may be more sensitive than the former and may be utilized intraoperatively, they are susceptible to interference by inhalational anaesthetics. Electromyography may play a role in minimizing C5 root damage and spinal cord-evoked potentials can localize spinal conduction block during CSM surgery. Critically reviewing the available evidence, electrophysiology cannot be universally recommended as mandatory in the management of CSM at present. It may, however, play emergent, isolated roles in the diagnosis, follow-up and treatment of this common disorder.

### Diagnosis and treatment of tethered spinal cord: a systematic review [^9fc60f73]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Improved reporting and concurrently controlled studies are urgently needed to advance the evidence base for this important clinical condition. Although we found numerous studies in which the authors reported on experience with a diagnostic modality, the reporting of diagnostic accuracy outcomes was lacking. Despite the importance of the outcomes, we identified no treatment studies in which the authors reported on key outcomes such as the number of participants with adverse events, and the available research for many other important outcomes was also insufficient to derive any evidence statements. Similarly, we identified hundreds of case series in which the authors reported on patients with tethered spinal cords. However, reporting within these studies was sparse, and limitations related to study design, in particular the lack of control or comparator information and the frequent lack of numerical outcome data for the complete sample, provided little information that can be adapted to clinical practice recommendations.

The authors of the existing research need to improve studies by including a control or comparison group. A tethered spinal cord is a progressive disease, and single-arm studies cannot distinguish the effects of the intervention from the natural course of the disease. The authors of diagnostic accuracy studies should clearly report on the performance of a test compared with a reference standard. For treatment studies, assignment to treatments not based on patient characteristics, such as randomized controlled trials, are needed to formulate stronger evidence statements. Ideally, the authors of randomized controlled trials would stratify tethered cord patients with similar degrees of neurologic impairment. Such studies might yield results that address the question of whether surgery or non-surgical treatments are better for tethered cord patients. Alternatively, large prospective observational studies that closely follow asymptomatic and symptomatic tethered cord patients with quantitative outcome measures and neurologic assessments would provide valuable information on the natural history and risk of progression for these patients.

### Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a review of structural changes and measurement techniques [^31b5fd72]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a spectrum of age-related structural changes of the cervical spine that result in static and dynamic injury to the spinal cord and collectively represent the most common cause of myelopathy in adults. Although cervical myelopathy is determined clinically, the diagnosis requires confirmation via imaging, and MRI is the preferred modality. Because of the heterogeneity of the condition and evolution of MRI technology, multiple techniques have been developed over the years in an attempt to quantify the degree of baseline severity and potential for neurological recovery. In this review, these techniques are categorized anatomically into those that focus on bone, ligaments, discs, and the spinal cord. In addition, measurements for the cervical spine canal size and sagittal alignment are also described briefly. These tools have resulted collectively in the identification of numerous useful parameters. However, the development of multiple techniques for assessing the same feature, such as cord compression, has also resulted in a number of challenges, including introducing ambiguity in terms of which methods to use and hindering effective comparisons of analysis in the literature. In addition, newer techniques that use advanced MRI are emerging and providing exciting new tools for assessing the spinal cord in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.

### Increasing awareness of degenerative cervical myelopathy: a preventative cause of non-traumatic spinal cord injury [^b65a355c]. Spinal Cord (2021). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a common non-traumatic spinal cord disorder and characterized by progressive neurological impairment. Generally, it is still underdiagnosed and referral to spine specialists is often late, when patients already present with incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). To improve early diagnosis and accelerate referral, diagnostic criteria for DCM are required. Recently, AO Spine RECODE- DCM (REsearch Objectives and Common Data Elements for Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy) (aospine.org/recode), an international, interdisciplinary and interprofessional initiative, including patients with DCM, was funded with the aim to accelerate knowledge discovery that can change outcomes. In this perspective we advocate for the participation of SCI specialists in this process, where the expertise and perspective on this disorder and requirements for the diagnostic and therapeutic work up is well developed.

### Acute traumatic myelopathy: rethinking central cord syndrome [^040037cb]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Central cord syndrome (CCS) is an incomplete spinal cord injury that consists of both sensory and motor changes of the upper and lower extremities. CCS most commonly occurs after trauma to the cervical spine leading to acute neurological changes. Despite being the most common incomplete spinal cord injury with the best outcomes, optimal treatment remains controversial. Although clinical practice has shifted from primarily conservative management to early surgical intervention, many questions remain unanswered and treatment remains varied. One of the most limiting aspects of CCS remains the diagnosis itself. CCS, by definition, is a syndrome with a very specific pattern of neurological deficits. In practice and in the literature, CCS has been used to describe a spectrum of neurological conditions and traumatic morphologies. Establishing clarity will allow for more accurate decision making by clinicians involved in the care of these injuries. The authors emphasize that a more precise term for the clinical condition in question is acute traumatic myelopathy: an acute cervical cord injury in the setting of a stable spine with either congenital and/or degenerative stenosis.

### Association of preoperative cervical spine alignment with spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensity and myelopathy severity: analysis of a series of 124 cases [^6b459944]. Spine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Design

This is an ambispective analysis of a prospectively followed cohort of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of sagittal alignment on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities in the cervical spinal cord as well as myelopathy severity in a prospective series of surgical patients.

Summary Of Background Data

There is emerging evidence that sagittal alignment of the cervical spine in patients with CSM may be associated with disease severity. The impact on actual spinal cord pathology is unclear, with suspected mechanisms including focal static ventral compression, repeated dynamic injury, and increased cord intramedullary tension. The relationship between sagittal imbalance and disease severity remains undefined.

Methods

An ambispective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed of surgical patients with CSM at a single tertiary-care neurosurgical center. Demographic data and measures of neurological disability were collected and analyzed for dependency on cervical spine alignment parameters including qualitative (kyphotic vs. lordotic) and quantitative (sagittal Cobb angle (C2-C7) and sagittal vertical axis (SVA, C2-C7)). MRI cord signal hyperintensity at the most pathological level was also evaluated for dependency on the same alignment metrics. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used at the 0.05 level of significance with correction for multiple comparisons.

Results

Among 124 patients with CSM, kyphotic alignment was seen in 34% of patients and hyperintense T2 MRI signal was observed in 55% of patients. No difference in MRI signal or myelopathy severity was observed in univariate analysis on global alignment. Among patients with kyphosis, quantitative MRI parameters and myelopathy severity were both correlated with increasing SVA, an observation not seen among patients with lordosis.

Conclusion

Global sagittal alignment and SVA interactively associate with quantitative MRI spinal cord signal abnormalities and worse CSM-related disability. The reciprocal relationships of SVA effect in patients with kyphosis and those with lordosis may reflect an optimal spinal alignment to achieve during surgical management.

### Treatment of metastatic spinal epidural disease: a review of the literature [^85e06211]. Neurosurgical Focus (2003). Low credibility.

Object

Spinal cord compression is one of the most dreaded complications of metastatic cancer. It can lead to a number of sequelae, including pain, spinal instability, neurological deficits, and a reduction in the patient's quality of life. Except in selected circumstances, treatment is palliative. Treatment options include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to summarize the existing data on the outcomes of various treatment methods for metastatic spinal epidural disease and to make appropriate recommendations for their use.

Methods

The authors used a search strategy that included an electronic database search, a manual search of journals, analysis of bibliographies in relevant review papers, and consultation with the senior author. There is good evidence, including Class I data, that steroid drugs constitute a beneficial adjunctive therapy in patients with myelopathy from epidural compression. Historically, conventional radiation therapy has been viewed as the first-line treatment because it has been shown to be as effective as a decompressive laminectomy, with a lower incidence of complications (Class II data). Nevertheless, in the last 20 years there has been remarkable progress in surgical techniques and technology. Currently, the goals of surgery are to achieve a circumferential decompression of the spinal cord, and to reconstruct and immediately stabilize the spinal column. Results in a large body of literature support the belief that surgery is better at retaining or regaining neurological function than radiation and that surgery is highly effective in relieving pain. Most of the data on the treatment of metastatic spinal disease are Class II or III, but the preliminary results of a well-designed, randomized controlled trial in which surgery is compared with standard radiation therapy represents the first Class I data.

Conclusions

As the number of treatment options for metastatic spinal disease has grown, it has become clear that effective implementation of these treatments can only be achieved by a multidisciplinary approach.

Imaging predictors in cervical spondylotic myelopathy — there appears to be a consensus that the presence of a low signal on preoperative T1-weighted images, multisegment and focal high signal on T2-weighted images, and the presence of cord atrophy on MR images are indicators of a poor outcome, and these changes occur late in the evolution of CSM with a continuing challenge to find indicators with prognostic power in mild myelopathy or cervical stenosis with minimal clinical symptoms.

Cervical spondylosis — prevalence, age association, and affected levels are described, noting that in most symptomatic cases spondylosis is associated with aging and with compression of the spinal cord in patients older than 55. Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are seen in approximately 10% of individuals by age 25 and in 95% by age 65, and the levels most commonly affected by both disc herniation and chronic spondylosis are C6/C7 followed by C5/C6. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy refers to clinically evident spinal cord dysfunction with the presence of long-track signs due to compression of the spinal cord.

### Traumatic and nontraumatic spinal cord injury: pathological insights from neuroimaging [^f48543b9]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Pathophysiological changes in the spinal cord white and grey matter resulting from injury can be observed with MRI techniques. These techniques provide sensitive markers of macrostructural and microstructural tissue integrity, which correlate with histological findings. Spinal cord MRI findings in traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) and nontraumatic spinal cord injury - the most common form of which is degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) - have provided important insights into the pathophysiological processes taking place not just at the focal injury site but also rostral and caudal to the spinal injury. Although tSCI and DCM have different aetiologies, they show similar degrees of spinal cord pathology remote from the injury site, suggesting the involvement of similar secondary degenerative mechanisms. Advanced quantitative MRI protocols that are sensitive to spinal cord pathology have the potential to improve diagnosis and, more importantly, predict outcomes in patients with tSCI or nontraumatic spinal cord injury. This Review describes the insights into tSCI and DCM that have been revealed by neuroimaging and outlines current activities and future directions for the field.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy — prognostic testing and imaging indicate there is Class II evidence that somatosensory evoked potentials have prognostic value in patients with CSM; there is Class I evidence to show that electromyographic abnormalities (as well as the presence of radiculopathy) are predictive of the development of myelopathy in minimally symptomatic patients with cervical stenosis and spinal cord compression; and the presence of a low signal on T1-weighted images, high signal on T2-weighted images, and cord atrophy on preoperative MR images are indicators of a poor outcome in CSM.

Cervical spinal stenosis — epidemiology and imaging reliability note that cervical spinal stenosis is a common disease that results in considerable morbidity and disability, and tandem spinal stenosis accounts for between 5% and 25% of all cases of stenosis. Cervical spinal stenosis has been detected in 26% of older asymptomatic individuals. For the past 4 decades, attempts to correlate clinical symptoms with the degree of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have not yielded a validated methodology; however, measurements of maximum canal compromise, maximum spinal cord compression, and compression ratio were reported as reliable and correlated well with the clinical severity of cervical myelopathy.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy: recognition and management [^616de4ab]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy encompasses a collection of pathologic conditions that result in progressive spinal cord dysfunction secondary to cord compression. Patients are typically male (3: 1 male-to-female ratio), and the average age of presentation is 64 years. The exact incidence is unclear because of differences in terminology and because radiographic findings can be present in asymptomatic individuals. Common examination findings include neck pain or stiffness, a wide-based ataxic gait, ascending paresthesia in the upper or lower extremities, lower extremity weakness, decreased hand dexterity, hyperreflexia, clonus, Babinski sign, and bowel or bladder dysfunction in severe disease. Definitive diagnosis requires correlation of physical examination findings with imaging findings. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine with and without contrast media is the preferred imaging modality. Cervical spine computed tomography, computed tomography myelography, and plain radiography are helpful in certain situations. Treatment depends on the presence and severity of symptoms. Surgery is recommended for patients with moderate to severe symptoms or rapidly progressive disease. Conservative treatments with monitoring for progression may be considered in patients with mild to moderate disease. The evidence for the effectiveness of conservative treatments is scarce and of low quality, and outcomes can vary with individual patients. Primary care physicians play a vital role in recognizing the typical presentation of degenerative cervical myelopathy, coordinating treatment as indicated, and managing comorbidities.

### Impact of commonly administered drugs on the progression of spinal cord injury: a systematic review [^b819f6c7]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

To allow for a comprehensive characterization of potential effects of commonly administered drugs on neurological recovery, we deliberately decided to include preclinical studies involving animal models and clinical studies in humans. Nonetheless, the high degree of heterogeneity across studies, even in a single species, was surprising. A large variability in population characteristics, exact administration parameters, and timing of assessment is observed. In combination with a wide range of spinal levels subjected to injury and different species being studied, comparisons between experiments are challenging or impossible. One exception is the study by Popovich et al.aiming to replicate findings, which noted a strong connection between initial injury characteristics and detectable drug effects. This highlights the need for varying as few parameters as possible to allow for meaningful comparisons. In human studies we suspect that the majority reporting mixed or no effects also reflects the heterogeneity in injury patterns included. This likely results in effects which vary widely between individuals and cannot be detected in a group-level analysis. This extensive heterogeneity means that, currently, meta-analyses are not feasible, even for the most commonly studied drugs (Fig. 8). This constitutes a notable limitation as the large fraction of positive effects reported might hint towards a publication bias (Section "Risk of bias (RoB)"). Methylprednisolone constitutes the most interesting example of this pattern, as it has been extensively studied in both pre-clinical and clinical environments with mostly positive results or no effect reported (Figs. 3, 5). While methylprednisolone is still used as an active control in some animal studies, it is no longer an accepted treatment for acute SCI in humans.

Segmentation

Accurate segmentation of the spinal cord is critical for extracting morphometric data such as CSA, which is a key biomarker for spinal cord atrophy. Our pipeline uses the SCT DeepSeg algorithm, a deep learning–based tool that applies optimization and computational efficiency algorithms and convolutional neural networks to automatically detect and segments the spinal cord from surrounding tissues (Figure 1). In regions of compression, automatic segmentation may be less reliable because of reduced contrast, but the SCT quality control (QC) interface allows clinicians to manually adjust segmentations where necessary (Figure 2). This ensures that even in challenging regions, segmentation is accurate, enabling reliable downstream analyses.

### Clinical biomarkers differentiate myelitis from vascular and other causes of myelopathy [^0a46a05e]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Transverse myelitis (TM) is an inflammatory disorder affecting the spinal cord. TM is recognized to be a heterogeneous syndrome, which manifests with motor, sensory, and autonomic symptoms attributable to spinal cord dysfunction. The term TM has been applied broadly to myelopathic syndromes in the setting of autoimmune, demyelinating, infectious, and postinfectious disorders. The diagnosis of TM presents a challenge to the clinician as the list of possible differential diagnoses is extensive and non-inflammatory myelopathies with neoplastic, vascular, compressive, or metabolic etiologic origin often mimic TM. While CSF pleocytosis or lesion enhancement on MRI have been widely used to define inflammatory myelopathies, similar features have been reported in non-inflammatory myelopathies. The overlap of clinical, MRI, and CSF features among the wide spectrum of myelopathies may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of TM, and subsequent unwarranted treatments with potentially harmful immunosuppressive therapies and delays in adequate therapeutic measures.

We performed a detailed evaluation of different types of myelopathies and determined the value of the clinical features, the temporal profile, spinal cord MRI, and CSF characteristics for establishing a more accurate diagnosis in a group of over 450 patients presenting with myelopathy.

However, there remains "a paucity of Class I or II data which assesses the role and timing of surgical intervention in patients with CSM," and "rigorous longitudinal data with long-term follow-up are required to define the role of cervical arthroplasty in the management of symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease."

### Is neck pain a marker for something serious? Like myelopathy [^b8c1c9e5]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Structural changes

The degenerative changes seen in DCM, overlap with osteoarthritis and changes in the intervertebral discs (IVD), uncovertebral, and facet joints. Capsular ligaments in the cervical spine, which are integral to spinal stability, can become lax over time due to repetitive stress, potentially causing cervical instability. Demonstrated evidence of capsular laxity in the context of DCM is lacking in the literature. It is yet to be determined whether it is stiffness of the cervical spine joints with increasing age or the laxity of the cervical spine ligaments that contribute to people becoming myelopathic (Supplementary 2C). The pathogenesis of myelopathy in patients with DCM can be attributed to three main components:
Static factors: processes that lead to cervical canal stenosis and consequent cord compression. Acquired spondylosis of the disc, facet vertebral bodies, and ligaments and subsequent loss of lordotic curvature. Congenital cervical stenosis (< 13 mm in diameter is considered stenotic). Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum.
Dynamic factors: resulting in cervical cord injury, can be multifactorial. Movements of a severely compressed cord are restricted. Flexion of the spine results in overstretching of the cord. This effect is more severe in the setting of a prominent ventral osteophyte complex and kyphotic deformity. Extension causes posterior cord compression by buckling of the ligamentum flavum and shingling of the laminae.
Ischemia: Spondylotic cord compression causes the pathologic butterfly pattern of cord ischemia which affects the grey and medial white matter. This pattern is also consistent with a vascular hypoperfusion injury. Compression affects the flow in the small pial and intermedullary arterioles, as well as the larger anterior spinal artery. Venous congestion may also play a role, with the potential for venous infarction to occur. Collectively these processes can result in cavitation within the spinal cord, known as syrinx formation.

### Management of mild degenerative cervical myelopathy and asymptomatic spinal cord compression: an international survey [^ce0edd88]. Spinal Cord (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future work

The survey was principally disseminated by two global spinal organisations; AO Spine and CSRS and it is noted that some groups may have been underrepresented. For example, Asia contributed 29% of responses, and Africa only 3%. Further the survey used a clinician's recollection of practice, making it vulnerable to recall bias. The overall large sample size, and the broad heterogeneity, with absence of trends event amongst subgroups, suggest this has not limited the findings.

The most pressing future work is to generate robust guidelines for non-operative patients.

This would benefit from a more detailed characterisation of DCM natural history, including the identification of any predictors of deterioration. Standardised patient follow-up is necessary to perform this analysis. A combination of clinician education and practical decision support tools may form first steps to ensure that this is conducted, using expect opinion to bridge known evidence gaps.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^3399d9ee]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN recommendations — workup of suspected spinal metastases: Initial workup depends on the presence or absence of symptoms. For incidental, asymptomatic, metastatic lesions confirmed by systemic imaging, patients can be observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and in the absence of symptoms it is not mandatory to obtain a spinal MRI for every incidental metastatic lesion seen on surveillance bone scans. For symptomatic presentations such as severe or new back pain, increasing intensity, duration, and changes in the character of pain should trigger an evaluation with an MRI study, and immediate spinal MRI is warranted when neurologic symptoms occur, including weakness, paresthesias, and bladder or bowel incontinence. Contrast can be used to highlight and further evaluate any focal abnormality, the MRI can be used to image the entire spine or a focal area of interest, and if the patient is unable to have an MRI, then a CT myelogram is recommended. A normal neurologic examination implies that there is no spinal radiculopathy or myelopathy correlating with the patient's symptoms and other causes should be considered; an abnormal neurologic examination includes motor abnormalities, sphincter abnormalities, and/or sensory deficits attributable to a dysfunction of nerve root(s) and/or the spinal cord, so detection of radiculopathy, myelopathy, or cauda equina syndrome is indicative of an abnormal examination.

Current Lack of Integration of Multi-System Effects of Spinal Cord Injury

Symptoms, then are in reality nothing but the cry from suffering organs. — Jean-Martin Charcot, 1868

Science may be described as the art of systematic oversimplification — the art of discerning what we may with advantage omit. — Karl Popper, 1982 1

Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most complex medical conditions, an acute event followed by both recovery and chronic disease. Severe cervical SCI impacts nearly all bodily organ systems. This is reflected in SCI medicine textbooks, where each system requires a separate expert chapter. However, integrated models of how the altered systems interact after injury are lacking (Fig. 1). Normally, the spinal cord is instrumental in the homeostatic feedback circuits of multiple systems. The acute injury abruptly disrupts these systems that evolve into different functional states with differing time courses across individuals. Thus, we observe that the severity of neuropathic pain, dysautonomia, immunological dysfunction, spasticity, and age-accelerating states like metabolic syndrome vary among people with the same initial injury pattern. Data gaps between the acute, subacute, and chronic phases also impede detecting key events that drive eventual phenotypes. Although we often speak of the post-injury phase as recovery, on a systems level, it primarily consists of adaptations to the loss of prior homeostatic feedback controls, some of which are maladaptive. Previously, most acute research has focused on the injury site, and numerous localized molecular effects limiting recovery were identified in experimental models. However, as the importance of multi-system-distributed changes becomes increasingly evident, a broader perspective is required.

### A practical approach to the diagnosis of spinal cord lesions [^409d18ba]. Practical Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Every neurologist will be familiar with the patient with atypical spinal cord disease and the challenges of taking the diagnosis forward. This is predominantly because of the limited range of possible clinical and investigation findings making most individual features non-specific. The difficulty in obtaining a tissue diagnosis further contributes and patients are often treated empirically based on local prevalence and potential for reversibility. This article focuses on improving the diagnosis of adult non-traumatic, non-compressive spinal cord disorders. It is structured to start with the clinical presentation in order to be of practical use to the clinician. We aim, by combining the onset phenotype with the subsequent course, along with imaging and laboratory features, to improve the diagnostic process.

### Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging reveals tract-specific microstructural correlates of electrophysiological impairments in non-myelopathic and myelopathic spinal cord compression [^77d022ee]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging acquisition

All participants were scanned on a 3 T Siemens Prisma scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) using 64‐channel head/neck and 32‐channel spine coils. Lordosis, which could introduce a partial volume effect from the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid and negatively influence field homogeneity, was minimized by keeping the spinal cord as straight as possible. An optimized multi‐shell diffusion protocol with reduced field of view with total acquisition time (TA) of 12 min, 46 s covering C3‐6 levels with 21 gradient waveform directions with b 1 = 550 s/mm 2, 42 directions with b 2 = 1000 s/mm 2 and seven b 0 images with anterior–posterior phase encoding, voxel size 0.65 × 0.65 × 3 mm 3 after interpolation in Fourier space, original voxel size 1.30 × 1.30 × 3.00 mm 3 was acquired. An additional five b 0 images with reversed posterior–anterior phase encoding were collected. All gradient waveforms were uniformly sampled over a q ‐space sphere. Axial T 2 *‐weighted MEDIC images with high grey/white matter contrast using interleaved acquisition (voxel size 0.35 × 0.35 × 2.5 mm 3 after interpolation in Fourier space, original voxel size 0.70 × 0.70 × 2.5 mm 3, TA ≈ 8 min) and T 2 ‐weighted sagittal turbo spin‐echo images (voxel size 0.28 × 0.28 × 1.3 mm 3 after interpolation in Fourier space, original voxel size 0.56 × 0.56 × 1.3 mm 3, TA ≈ 9 min) were also collected. Detailed sequence parameters are listed in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

### Myelopathy and spinal deformity: relevance of spinal alignment in planning surgical intervention for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^d4cc1d83]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Surgical management of degenerative cervical myelopathy requires careful pathoanatomic consideration to select between various surgical options from both anterior and posterior approach. Hitherto, unexplored is the relevance of cervical deformity to the pathophysiology of such neurological disability, and whether correction of that deformity should be a surgical objective when planning for reconstruction after spinal cord decompression. Such correction could address both the static cord compression and the dynamic repetitive cord injury, while also restoring more normal biomechanics to the cervical spine. The articles in this focus issue's section on cervical spinal deformity reveal that cervical sagittal alignment is geometrically related to thoracolumbar spinal pelvic alignment and to T1 slope, and that it is further clinically correlated to regional disability and general health scores and to myelopathy severity. These conclusions are based on narrative reviews and a selection of primary research data, reflecting the nascency of this field. They further recommend for preoperative assessment of spinal alignment when significant deformity is suspected, and that correction of cervical kyphosis should be an objective when surgery is planned.

### Malignant spinal-cord compression [^e2d5c25f]. The Lancet: Oncology (2005). Medium credibility.

Malignant spinal-cord compression (MSCC) is a common complication of cancer and has a substantial negative effect on quality of life and survival. Despite widespread availability of good diagnostic technology, studies indicate that most patients are diagnosed only after they become unable to walk. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical features of MSCC. Clinical trials have informed the optimum management of MSCC, and we review the role of corticosteroids, radiotherapy, and surgery in the management of patients. We also emphasise advances in radiation delivery and the results of a randomised trial that supported aggressive debulking in patients with MSCC.

### Efficacy and safety of surgery for mild degenerative cervical myelopathy: results of the AOSpine north America and international prospective multicenter studies [^9339aa7b]. Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive degenerative spinal condition, and the leading cause of spinal cord dysfunction among adults worldwide. This clinicopathological entity encompasses osteoarthritic degeneration (ie, cervical spondylosis) and ligamentous aberrations (eg, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum [HLF]). Over 70% of individuals over 60 to 65 yr old demonstrate pathological or radiological evidence of cervical degeneration, and approximately one-quarter of these people become clinically symptomatic from mechanical neural compression. The proportion of the United States population 65 yr or older is expected to nearly double from 13% in 2010 to 22% in 2050, making optimal diagnosis and treatment of DCM a key public health priority.

Controversy in the treatment of DCM has stemmed by and large from mixed reports regarding the natural history of this condition. Although there is some variability, a large number of patients, ranging from 20% to 60%, will deteriorate neurologically over time when treated nonoperatively. Traditionally, surgical decompression for DCM was performed to halt progression of neurological dysfunction and prevent further disability. However, more recent evidence indicates that surgical intervention for DCM is actually associated with improvement in function and quality of life. As a result, surgery is now becoming standard of care for patients with clearly symptomatic DCM. Nonetheless, controversy persists regarding the optimal management of patients with only mild symptomology. The latest clinical guidelines recommend surgery for patients with moderate and severe DCM, and nonoperative treatment with serial clinical follow-up for asymptomatic patients with imaging evidence of cervical spinal cord compression. For patients with mild DCM, the guidelines suggest that either surgery or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation is reasonable initial management strategy; the less definitive nature of this suggestion likely reflects the paucity of clinical evidence surrounding the effectiveness of surgery for patients with mild DCM. These patients present a conundrum to the surgeon. On one hand, if the disease is only causing mild symptoms, the risk-benefit scale may tip in favor of risk, with a lot to be lost, and little to be gained. The contrary view is that these patients stand to gain the most from intervention by halting progression of potentially irreversible neurological deficits early on in the course of the pathological process. Moreover, even "mild" DCM may be associated with a derangement in quality of life that patients consider unacceptable, and can perhaps be helped with operative intervention. To this end, the objectives of the present study were 2-fold: (1) to evaluate quality of life in mild DCM compared to population norms and (2) to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with mild DCM following surgical intervention. We hypothesized that (1) patients would have significant derangement in quality of life, despite having what is considered only "mild" DCM and (2) surgery in these patients would halt progression of symptoms, and in fact lead to improved functional status and quality of life.

### Semiautomated pipeline effectively assesses severity and monitor disease progression in compressed spinal cord of degenerative cervical myelopathy patients [^ae6b2008]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The SCT pipeline successfully segmented the spinal cord and extraction of several key morphometric and microstructural metrics that are directly relevant to clinical practice were obtained.

Shape Morphometrics from T2-Weighted Image

This includes CSA, a key metric for assessing spinal cord atrophy, which correlates with the severity of DCM (Figure 6). By normalizing CSA to noncompressed levels, clinicians can better assess the impact of compression on spinal cord structural integrity. A reduction in CSA has been shown to elucidate the extent and progression of spinal cord atrophy in conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Many studies show that CSA is a clinically useful measure that provides insights into the spinal cord's overall health. In our study, we show a clear reduction in normalized CSA at all cervical vertebral levels in DCM patients compared with HC (Figure 6 B). The CSA is reduced across all vertebral levels in the DCM group, with more pronounced reductions at the intervertebral disk levels Figure 6 B. In conservatively treated DCM patients, we observed a progressive decrease in CSA at the 6-month follow-up relative to baseline measures Figure 6 C. This finding suggests that spinal cord atrophy can worsen over time without surgical intervention. Furthermore, we have shown a strong association between CSA measurement and clinical symptoms. The Anterior-Posterior and Transverse Diameters provide valuable insights into the degree of spinal cord stenosis. The AP diameter is particularly useful in identifying the severity of spinal cord compression, while the transverse diameter (RL) provides information about the extent of lateral (side-to-side) involvement and potential foraminal narrowing. Together, these metrics offer a quantitative measure of localized compression severity. In our research, we have demonstrated that AP diameter measurements can effectively identify the extent of spinal cord compression, even in patients with asymptomatic spinal cord compression. The Compression metric (maximum spinal cord compression) is a computed normalized morphometrics at the region of maximum compression. In other studies, maximum spinal cord compression has been shown to be a reliable biomarker of spinal cord injury, correlating with the severity of injury and neurological impairments. It has also been used to assess the outcomes of acute traumatic spinal cord injuries.
