## Question

what are the clinical findings and labratory work up for myasthenia gravis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical findings and laboratory workup for myasthenia gravis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical phenotype and how to elicit fatigability on history and exam. Then, I should verify which bedside tests meaningfully shift pretest probability. Next, I will review the laboratory workup, starting with antibody assays and their limitations, followed by electrophysiology and imaging. After that, I need to consider special populations and mimics, and finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm and highlight pitfalls and controversies, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical hallmark: fluctuating, fatigable skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with repeated use and improves with rest, with a predilection for ocular, bulbar, axial, and proximal limb muscles. This pattern is the anchor for pretest probability and should guide test selection and interpretation [^113pkdFU]. I should double-check the ocular features because they are the most common initial manifestation: ptosis that fatigues on sustained upgaze and diplopia from extraocular muscle weakness are classic, and the peek sign (orbicularis oculi fatigue with sustained gentle lid closure) is highly suggestive when present [^112SgANq]. Wait, let me verify bulbar features too: dysarthria that worsens with prolonged talking, dysphagia with aspiration risk, and chewing fatigue are red flags for airway and feeding safety and should prompt urgent evaluation for respiratory involvement [^1139yVpz].

> Next, I should review bedside diagnostic maneuvers that meaningfully change the likelihood of MG. The ice test is simple and useful: placing ice over a ptotic eyelid for 2–3 minutes and observing improvement improves the odds substantially when positive, and a normal response meaningfully lowers the likelihood; I need to ensure I interpret a negative ice test cautiously in non-ocular presentations [^112SgANq]. Hold on, I should verify the edrophonium (Tensilon) test: a short-lived improvement in ptosis or dysarthria after 1–2 mg IV edrophonium increases the probability of MG, but I must have resuscitation equipment available due to bradyarrhythmia risk and avoid it in patients with cardiac comorbidity where the ice test is safer [^112SgANq] [^1146sTAP]. Let me consider the rest/sleep test as well: observing improvement in weakness after brief rest or overnight can support the diagnosis, though it is less specific than ice or edrophonium and should be integrated with other data [^112SgANq].

> I will now examine the laboratory workup, starting with antibody testing, because serology both confirms the diagnosis and stratifies subtypes. Anti–acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are detected in roughly 85–90% of generalized MG and about 50–70% of ocular MG, with high specificity; I should confirm that binding antibodies are most sensitive and that combining binding and blocking assays increases yield to about 97% in AChR-positive cohorts [^1165XXDx]. Wait, let me verify ocular MG nuances: AChR seropositivity in ocular MG may be higher than traditionally taught, approaching 70% in large cohorts, and higher titers associate with progression to generalized disease, so I should not under-order serology in isolated ocular presentations [^114QdXvf]. I need to ensure I also test for MuSK antibodies, especially in patients with prominent bulbar, neck, or respiratory weakness and poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, using RIPA or cell-based assays where available because ELISA alone can miss cases and yield false positives in low-pretest-probability settings [^114AB7ps] [^112chCXG]. But wait, what if both AChR and MuSK are negative? I should consider LRP4 antibodies and clustered AChR assays, which can detect a subset of otherwise seronegative MG, particularly in younger patients or those with ocular disease, improving sensitivity without sacrificing specificity when performed in expert laboratories [^114HP1ku] [^1165XXDx].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if serology is negative; electrophysiology is the next pillar. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) at 2–3 Hz can show a decrement of compound muscle action potential amplitude of at least 10% in a distal hand muscle or a facial/bulbar muscle if clinically involved; sensitivity is lower in ocular or MuSK MG, so I should tailor the muscles tested to the phenotype and accept that a normal RNS does not exclude MG [^112zHQeQ] [^114AB7ps] [^112oL79n]. I should double-check single-fiber EMG (SFEMG): it is the most sensitive test for neuromuscular junction impairment, detecting increased jitter and blocking even in seronegative or ocular MG, but it is technically demanding and less specific, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when possible, combined with other tests to improve specificity [^112zHQeQ] [^112oL79n]. Let me reconsider the yield: SFEMG sensitivity ranges from about 64–100% depending on muscle selection and expertise, whereas RNS sensitivity varies widely, reinforcing the need to match the test to the suspected distribution of weakness [^112zHQeQ].

> Next, I should review imaging and respiratory assessment because they influence both diagnosis and immediate management. All patients with suspected MG should undergo chest CT to evaluate for thymoma, which occurs in about 10–15% and alters surgical and oncologic planning; I need to ensure this is not overlooked even in ocular presentations [^114omPiw]. I need to check pulmonary function in any patient with dyspnea, dysphagia, or bulbar symptoms, obtaining at least vital capacity and maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures, and consider polysomnography or overnight oximetry if symptoms suggest sleep-disordered breathing or hypoventilation; these data guide timing of noninvasive ventilation and ICU transfer decisions in impending crisis [^1139yVpz] [^1148ikmM] [^112J8wJz]. Hold on, I should verify follow-up cadence: in patients with established neuromuscular weakness at risk for respiratory complications, periodic PFTs every 6 months are reasonable to detect insidious decline early [^113kvnbB].

> Let me consider special populations and mimics so I do not anchor prematurely. In children, congenital myasthenic syndromes should be considered if antibodies are negative and symptoms begin in infancy; genetic testing via NGS panels can identify presynaptic, synaptic, or postsynaptic defects that alter treatment choices, and SFEMG may be adapted with specialized techniques in neonates [^113n3km4]. In older adults, late-onset MG is increasingly recognized and may be misattributed to aging or stroke; I should maintain a high index of suspicion and remember that thymic hyperplasia is less common while thymoma remains relevant [^114TtXpp] [^115dZYo3]. I should double-check for overlapping autoimmune disease, especially Graves' orbitopathy, which can mimic or coexist with ocular MG; careful examination for fatigability, diurnal fluctuation, and multimodal testing (serology, neurophysiology, imaging) helps disentangle these entities [^11371BQQ] [^1174gNWy]. But wait, what if the presentation is bulbar-predominant with atrophy and poor response to pyridostigmine? MuSK MG and bulbar-onset ALS can overlap clinically and electrophysiologically; age, sex distribution, ocular involvement, and crisis frequency can help differentiate, and repeating or escalating antibody assays with attention to assay type improves diagnostic accuracy [^112JmL4N] [^114AB7ps].

> I should now synthesize a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm while acknowledging controversies. Start with a careful history and examination to establish fluctuating fatigability, then use bedside tests (ice, rest/sleep, edrophonium when safe) to raise or lower suspicion before ordering labs and electrophysiology; concurrently screen for respiratory compromise and arrange chest CT for thymus evaluation [^112SgANq] [^114omPiw]. Next, obtain AChR and MuSK antibodies, and if negative but suspicion remains high, pursue RNS and SFEMG in clinically involved muscles and consider LRP4 and clustered AChR assays; if all are negative and symptoms persist, broaden the differential and consider congenital myasthenic syndromes or alternative neuromuscular diagnoses, with genetics where appropriate [^112zHQeQ] [^114HP1ku] [^113n3km4]. Hold on, I should verify that this multimodal approach aligns with contemporary reviews: yes, modern guidance emphasizes combining clinical phenotype, serology, electrophysiology, and imaging to classify MG subtypes and guide therapy, while recognizing that a minority remain seronegative despite robust clinical-electrophysiologic evidence [^114TtXpp] [^113iRPzm].

> Finally, I need to ensure I highlight limitations and avoid overinterpretation. Seronegative MG persists in roughly 10–15% even with modern assays, so a negative antibody panel does not exclude disease; likewise, SFEMG can be abnormal in non-MG conditions, reducing specificity if used in isolation, and edrophonium is contraindicated in patients with bradyarrhythmias or asthma, necessitating caution and informed consent [^117BgD9U] [^112zHQeQ] [^1146sTAP]. I should confirm that serial antibody levels are not routinely recommended for monitoring; although some studies suggest correlations between titer changes and clinical status, expert appraisal concludes evidence is limited and heterogeneous, so management should remain clinically driven rather than titer-chasing [^116sg5F5]. Let me reconsider the overall message: MG diagnosis remains a clinical-electrophysiologic-immunologic synthesis, with test selection tailored to phenotype and pretest probability, and with explicit attention to mimics and special populations to minimize delays and misclassification [^114TtXpp].

Myasthenia gravis (MG) presents with **fluctuating, fatigable weakness** [^113pkdFU] of ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles, worsened by activity and improved by rest [^115tAk4x]. The key clinical findings include ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, proximal limb weakness, and respiratory compromise; the **ice pack test** and edrophonium test can support the diagnosis at the bedside [^112SgANq]. Laboratory workup should include **AChR and MuSK antibodies** (with LRP4/agrin/titin/ryanodine receptor as indicated) [^113iRPzm], and electrophysiology with repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and single-fiber EMG (SFEMG) [^112zHQeQ]. Chest CT is mandatory to assess for thymoma, and pulmonary function tests are essential to evaluate respiratory involvement and guide management [^113iRPzm] [^1139yVpz].

---

## Clinical findings

MG is characterized by **fatigable weakness** of skeletal muscles [^113pkdFU], typically worsening with repeated use and improving with rest. The clinical presentation varies depending on the affected muscle groups:

- **Ocular muscles**: Ptosis (drooping eyelids) and diplopia (double vision) are common initial symptoms, often fluctuating throughout the day [^111sLHPH].

- **Bulbar muscles**: Dysarthria (slurred speech), dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and chewing difficulties are frequent, particularly in MuSK antibody-positive MG [^113tniP7].

- **Limb muscles**: Proximal limb weakness, affecting the shoulders and hips, is common and can significantly impair daily activities [^113BnMrG].

- **Respiratory muscles**: Respiratory weakness can lead to dyspnea, orthopnea, and respiratory failure, necessitating urgent intervention [^116iNGzG].

- **Fatigability**: Muscle weakness worsens with sustained or repeated activity and improves with rest, a hallmark feature of MG [^115tAk4x].

---

## Bedside diagnostic tests

Several bedside tests can aid in the clinical diagnosis of MG:

| **Test** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Ice pack test | Application of ice to the affected eyelid for 2–5 minutes, assessing for improvement in ptosis | High sensitivity and specificity for ocular MG [^112SgANq] [^1146sTAP] |
| Edrophonium (Tensilon) test | Short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor administered intravenously, assessing for rapid improvement in muscle strength | Useful for generalized MG, but limited availability and potential side effects [^notfound] |
| Sleep test | Observation of improvement in ptosis or ophthalmoplegia after brief rest | Useful for ocular MG [^112SgANq] |

---

## Laboratory workup

Laboratory testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis of MG, characterize the subtype, and guide management [^116iNGzG]:

---

### Serological testing

Serological testing is a cornerstone of MG diagnosis, with **AChR antibodies** detected in ~85% of generalized MG and ~50% of ocular MG [^1165XXDx]; **MuSK antibodies** are found in ~1–10% and are associated with bulbar-predominant disease [^114AB7ps]. Additional antibodies — including LRP4, agrin, titin, and ryanodine receptor — may be tested in seronegative cases or when clinically indicated [^113177zx] [^115utdkN].

---

### Electrophysiological testing

- **Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS)**: Demonstrates a decremental response (> 10% decline in compound muscle action potential) in MG, particularly in proximal or facial muscles [^113BnMrG].

- **Single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG)**: Highly sensitive (> 90%) for detecting neuromuscular transmission defects, especially useful in seronegative or ocular MG [^112oL79n].

---

### Imaging studies

Chest CT is mandatory to evaluate for thymoma, present in ~10–15% of MG patients [^115dZYo3] [^114omPiw], and to characterize thymic pathology [^113iRPzm]. MRI is not routinely indicated but may be considered in selected cases to further evaluate thymic or mediastinal structures.

---

### Pulmonary function testing

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal inspiratory/expiratory pressures, are essential to assess respiratory muscle involvement and guide management decisions, particularly in patients with bulbar or respiratory symptoms [^1139yVpz] [^1148ikmM].

---

## Summary of clinical findings and laboratory workup

MG presents with fluctuating, fatigable weakness of ocular, bulbar, limb, and respiratory muscles. Bedside tests such as the ice pack and edrophonium tests can support the diagnosis, while **serological testing for AChR and MuSK antibodies**, electrophysiological studies (RNS, SFEMG), chest CT for thymoma evaluation, and pulmonary function tests are essential components of the laboratory workup [^113iRPzm]. This comprehensive approach ensures accurate diagnosis, subtype classification, and appropriate management of MG patients.

INTRODUCTION

In myasthenia gravis (MG), the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is one of the targets for autoantibodies. MG is a neuromuscular autoimmune disease featuring fluctuating muscle weakness and exhaustion worsening upon exertion. In MG, one of the pathological mechanisms in anti‐AChR‐positive patients is the loss of postsynaptic AChR due to anti‐AChR antibodies (ab). The decrease of functional AChR at the endplate leads to less binding of acetylcholine, which results in muscle weakness. Depending on the affected muscle groups, MG is more defined in ocular MG (diplopia and ptosis), bulbar MG (dysarthria and dysphagia), or generalized MG (muscle weakness to the limbs and neck). MG has high morbidity when treated inadequately. Serum anti‐AChR‐ab are present in 90% of patients with generalized MG and in 50% of patients with ocular MG. One in 10 patients with MG develops a thymoma, and vice versa, one in four patients with a thymoma have MG. The presence of anti‐AChR‐ab is found in most patients with thymomatous MG.

In clinical practice, the majority of anti‐AChR‐ab analyses are used to confirm the diagnosis of MG. Although MG is considered a life‐long autoimmune disease, there is no consensus on the use of anti‐AChR‐ab during the years of follow‐up. Previously, multiple studies have been performed on this topic. Some of these studies reported a significant association between change in anti‐AChR‐ab serum levels and clinical severity, especially after thymectomy or when patients used immunosuppressants. Other studies did not report a significant association, but these studies did not have consistent follow‐up durations, there was differential use of serial dilutions in the assay kit, or they included a relatively small number of patients.

Anti‐AChR‐ab are measured with a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIA). The sensitivity and specificity are high at 87% and 100%, respectively. For follow‐up of MG patients, quantitative values of the anti‐AChR‐ab level are essential and this often requires serial dilutions due to the restricted measuring range of both enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and RIA.

The primary aim of this retrospective study was to analyse the longitudinal association between reduction in serum anti‐AChR‐ab levels and clinical symptoms, using a clinically relevant follow‐up duration and the most accurate assay kit available, with inclusion of a substantial number of patients.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^111sLHPH]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is one of the most well characterised autoimmune disorders affecting the neuromuscular junction with autoantibodies targeting the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) complex. The vast majority of patients present with ocular symptoms including double vision and ptosis, but may progress on to develop generalised fatiguable muscle weakness. Severe involvement of the bulbar muscles can lead to dysphagia, dysarthria and breathing difficulties which can progress to myasthenic crisis needing ventilatory support. Given the predominant ocular onset of the disease, it is important that ophthalmologists are aware of the differential diagnosis, investigations and management including evolving therapies. When the disease remains localised to the extraocular muscles (ocular MG) IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies against the AChR (including clustered AChR) are present in nearly 50% of patients. In generalised MG this is seen in nearly 90% patients. Other antibodies include those against muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and lipoprotein receptor related protein 4 (LRP4). Even though decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation is the most well recognised neurophysiological abnormality, single fibre electromyogram (SFEMG) in experienced hands is the most sensitive test which helps in the diagnosis. Initial treatment should be using cholinesterase inhibitors and then proceeding to immunosuppression using corticosteroids and steroid sparing drugs. Patients requiring bulbar muscle support may need rescue therapies including plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Newer therapeutic targets include those against the B lymphocytes, complement system, neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) and various other elements of the immune system.

Blood tests for existing therapies — individualize monitoring based on local risk. Risks and benefits of routine blood monitoring should be weighed, and because some MG therapies require frequent blood work, decisions about ongoing testing should be individualized and based on regional COVID‑19 incidence.

### Ravulizumab and efgartigimod in myasthenia gravis: a real-world study [^116PT7JT]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by localized or general muscle weakness, which is caused by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Abs) binding to acetylcholine receptors or functionally related molecules in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Recently approved treatment options specifically targeting Ab-mediated disease mechanisms include ravulizumab, targeting the terminal complement component C5, and the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) modulator efgartigimod, which enhances degradation of endogenous IgG including AChR-specific Abs. Both therapies led to sustained meaningful improvement in the MG-specific Activities of Daily Living scale (Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living [MG-ADL]), the primary end point in pivotal placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials.

Although diagnosis in patients with typical symptoms and a positive Ab test is usually unambiguous, patients present remarkably heterogeneous in terms of disease phenotype, clinical course, and response to immunotherapy. This study aimed to estimate clinical efficacy of ravulizumab and efgartigimod and to profile their biological effects on auto-Ab features in a real-world cohort of patients with AChR-Ab + generalized MG (gMG).

### Clinical and laboratory-reconfirmed myasthenia gravis: a population-based study [^117KvNJK]. European Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinically based prevalence of myasthenia gravis (MG) with the prevalence of laboratory-confirmed cases. All patients with a diagnosis of MG living in Estonia as on 1 January 1997 were asked to participate in re-examination. The criteria for laboratory-supported MG were weakness and rapid fatigue and a positive outcome of at least one of three laboratory tests: (i) blinded acetylcholinesterase inhibitor test; (ii) determination of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor and (iii) neurophysiological examination using repetitive nerve stimulation and single-fibre EMG. Eighty-nine patients were re-examined and 70 patients (79%) fulfilled the criteria of laboratory-supported MG. The corrected prevalence ratio was 78 per million. In the non-confirmed MG group, there was more women (92%) than men (43%) whose diagnosis was established within 1 year from onset of symptoms (P = 0.016). In all women with non-confirmed MG the diagnosis was established within 1 year from referral to the physician, whereas 68% of women with confirmed MG was diagnosed within 1 year (P < 0.0001). Thus, we conclude that, in Estonia the prevalence of MG based on medical records seems overestimated by 21% and women are at higher risk of obtaining an uncertain diagnosis of MG.

### MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis: questions from the clinic [^114KCHSw]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical vignettes are presented of five patients with MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis, each of which demonstrates a diagnostic or therapeutic issue that is unique to or characteristic of this condition. Consideration of these issues leads to questions, many of which are unanswered at this time, about the immunopathology and management of this subset of myasthenia gravis.

### Concordance between radioimmunoassay and fixed cell-based assay in subjects without myasthenia gravis: optimizing the diagnostic approach [^116gQ4dq]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, a multicenter, prospective, double‐blind study compared the accuracy of diagnostic assays in myasthenia gravis. F‐CBA showed 11.3% increased sensitivity with 97.8% specificity in AChR‐Ab detection compared with RIA (cutoff for positivity = 0.5 nmol/L). Mirian et al. found 4% increased sensitivity with 99% specificity for F‐CBA versus RIA. Our study underlines the importance of testing for AChR‐Abs only when clinical features suggestive of MG are detected. However, in real‐world clinical practice, diagnostic tests are not always requested by MG experts. Our findings suggest that F‐CBA may be performed as an additional tool to increase diagnostic accuracy when clinical presentation and electrodiagnostic studies are deemed atypical for MG. Of late, improved recognition of MG has facilitated earlier diagnosis and contributed to an apparent increase in disease prevalence. However, this also entails the risk of MG overdiagnosis.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that AChR detection by F‐CBA may offer greater specificity for identifying pathogenic AChR‐Abs compared to RIA. Future research should investigate whether these likely nonpathogenic Abs bind to intracellular epitopes of the AChR or to other antigens complexed with the receptor.

### Clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes in patients with double-seronegative myasthenia gravis [^112Hus6J]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to impairment of neuromuscular transmission in skeletal muscles. Antibodies to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) are the most commonly identified autoantibodies followed by muscle‐specific kinase (MuSK) amongst seropositive MG patients. These autoantibodies are well established as sensitive and specific diagnostic markers, instrumental for patient classification and prognosis in MG.

Double‐seronegative MG (dSNMG) represents a heterogeneous group and includes patients with clinical and electrophysiological presentations consistent with MG but without detectable antibodies to AChR and MuSK. Some patients have low affinity antibodies detected by specific assays or less common related antibodies such as lipoprotein related protein 4 associated MG. In dSNMG patients, in particular if there is no response to immunosuppressive therapy, alternative diagnoses should be considered such as other myasthenic syndromes (e.g. congenital MG) and other neuromuscular disorders. Although dSNMG clinical features have been described in terms of muscle weakness distribution and disease severity in cross‐sectional studies, detailed disease characterization and treatment outcomes have not been described in larger series.

Myasthenia gravis has significant implications for both patients and the healthcare system. There is a paucity of evidence on the detailed clinical features and prognosis in dSNMG patients. In addition, seronegative patients are commonly excluded from clinical trials, limiting the evidence of treatment efficacy in this group of patients. The present study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in dSNMG based on MG scales and compare them with an AChR‐positive MG population.

### Complement inhibitors for myasthenia gravis in adults [^116qSaaQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease whereby the person's immune system produces antibodies against components of the neuromuscular junction, where the nerves controlling muscle movement meet the muscles. Myasthenia gravis is the most commonly acquired disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction, with an incidence of around 15.7 cases per million person‐years and a prevalence of 20 to 475 cases per million person‐years. The incidence and prevalence of myasthenia gravis are increasing, particularly in older people. People with myasthenia gravis present with weakness that gets progressively worse the more the muscle is used (known as fatigability), and it commonly affects the ocular (eye), bulbar (swallowing and speech), respiratory (breathing), and proximal limb muscles (those closest to the centre of the body, specifically in the shoulders, upper arms, hips, and thighs). The clinical severity of myasthenia gravis can vary greatly; ranging from mild ocular symptoms, such as double vision (diplopia) and drooping of the eyelids (ptosis), to frequent and severe bulbar and respiratory crises requiring hospital admission.

### Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update [^1136yrMg]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This paper has reviewed a number of evolving areas in GMG. In particular, patient diagnosis and management will improve as the pool of 'seronegative' MG decreases. However, care should be taken to establish the pathogenicity of newly identified antibodies. It is likely the field of IgG4-mediated disease will continue to gain scientific momentum.

More work is required to understand the phenomenon of increasing incidence of LOMG, with elderly patients posing a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Within the next 12 months, the results of the MGTX trial may answer one of the longest-standing questions in MG, namely, the role of thymectomy in non-thymomatous disease.

Methods

Patients

Following institutional review board approval, we searched the institutional databases of the MD Anderson Cancer Center to identify cancer patients who received at least one dose of an FDA-approved ICI (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, or avelumab) between January 2011 and December 2018. Patients who had a diagnosis of MG preceding or following the initiation of ICI in the cohort were identified.

We also searched Medline, Web of Science, PubMed ePubs, EMBASE and the Cochrane library through August 2018, with no language or study design restrictions, for case reports, series and observational studies that described patients with cancer and MG receiving ICI. Search strategy and terms are provided in Additional file 1. Titles and abstracts were screened by three independent investigators (in pairs) to identify potentially relevant articles. Then, full text of selected articles was retrieved and reviewed. References of the included articles were hand-searched. A detailed clinical description of each patient was generated. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

For both MD Anderson and literature identified cases, definite diagnosis of MG was considered on the basis of having ocular and/or systemic muscle weakness, and at least one of the following criteria: (1) elevated titers of anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies, (2) findings suggestive of MG on electrodiagnostic studies, (3) positive edrophonium test, or (4) positive ice pack test. Probable diagnosis of MG was also considered based on the neurologist's report confirming the diagnosis of MG on the basis of high clinical suspicion alone.

Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis

The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis involves assessment of the clinical phenotype, serological (blood) testing for autoantibodies, and neurophysiology testing (nerve tests). All people with suspected myasthenia gravis will also require a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest to look for a thymoma. Clinical assessment will involve obtaining a typical history of fatigable weakness and demonstrating this on examination, such as progressive ptosis while the affected person is looking upwards, or proximal muscle weakness following repetitive exercises. Serological testing includes AChR and MuSK autoantibodies, while neurophysiology can demonstrate a progressive reduction in muscle response following repetitive nerve stimulation and jitter on single fibre electromyography. In people who have negative serology and neurophysiology tests, further investigations may be required to rule out other causes of muscle weakness; for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head to rule out a brain disorder.

### Myasthenia gravis: a clinical-immunological update [^115PSQRq]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the archetypic disorder of both the neuromuscular junction and autoantibody-mediated disease. In most patients, IgG1-dominant antibodies to acetylcholine receptors cause fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles. In the rest, a variable proportion possesses antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase while the remainder of seronegative MG is being explained through cell-based assays using a receptor-clustering technique and, to a lesser extent, proposed new antigenic targets. The incidence and prevalence of MG are increasing, particularly in the elderly. New treatments are being developed, and results from the randomised controlled trial of thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG, due for release in early 2016, will be of particular clinical value. To help navigate an evidence base of varying quality, practising clinicians may consult new MG guidelines in the fields of pregnancy, ocular and generalised MG (GMG). This review focuses on updates in epidemiology, immunology, therapeutic and clinical aspects of GMG in adults.

### A reappraisal of diagnostic tests for myasthenia gravis in a large Asian cohort [^112oL79n]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by weakness of bodily skeletal muscles. Office-based diagnostic tests such as repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), single fiber electromyography (SFEMG), and the ice test, are used to refine the differential clinical diagnosis of this disease. Evaluating the clinical sensitivity and specificity of these tests, however, may be confounded by lack of a gold standard, non-blinding, incorporation bias, use of non-representative populations and retrospective data.

Objective

In this study comprising a large Asian cohort of 127 patients recruited from a Neuro-ophthalmology clinic, we minimized aforementioned confounders and tested the diagnostic value of 3 office-based tests against 2 reference standards of MG by virtue of clinical features, antibody assay and response to treatment.

Results

Regardless of the reference standard used, the ice and SFEMG tests displayed a higher sensitivity (86.0 to 97.3%) compared to the RNS test (21.3 to 30.6%). Conversely, the specificity of the ice (31.3%) and SFEMG (21.7% and 17.2%) tests were reduced compared to the RNS test (82.6% and 84.4%). The combined use of the ice test and SFEMG, improved the specificity of MG diagnosis to 63.6% and 64.3%, without affecting the sensitivity of those tests.

Conclusion

Our findings indicate, in an Asian population, high sensitivity of the SFEMG test and suggest the ice test as a valid, affordable and less technically demanding approach to diagnose MG with ocular involvement. Both ice test and SFEMG alone, however, yielded poor specificity. We suggest that the combination of SFEMG and ice test provides a more reliable diagnosis of MG.

Disease classification

Myasthenia gravis can be classified by disease onset (early versus late), although there is considerable clinical overlap between the two categories. Early‐onset disease (people under 45 years of age) is more common in women. It is thought to result from an overactive immune system, and these people typically have thymic hyperplasia (enlargement of the thymus). Late‐onset disease (people over 45 years of age) is more common in men. The mechanism of autoantibody development is thought to differ from early‐onset disease, with loss of immune tolerance, resulting in a loss of the ability of the immune system to recognise molecules of the body as self.

Myasthenia gravis can also be classified by clinical phenotype; these are the observable characteristics of a disease, such as the symptoms experienced by the affected people, or the clinical signs observed by the clinician when they examine the patient, or both. Myasthenia gravis presents as either an ocular or generalised disease. In ocular myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness is limited to the eyelids and the extraocular muscles (muscles around the eyes). In generalised myasthenia gravis, the weakness involves a variety of different muscle groups, including ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and limb muscles. While most people with ocular myasthenia gravis eventually develop generalised myasthenia gravis, some people have a milder disease form that remains restricted to the ocular muscles. Although the disease process is similar between ocular and generalised myasthenia gravis, the two phenotypes (sets of observable characteristics or traits of an organism) can vary in their sensitivity to diagnostic tests and response to treatment.

CONCLUSION

Double‐seronegative MG is a diverse group with limited clinical characterization. It was found that the initial severity based on clinical scores is similar to that in antibody‐positive MG patients, and there is significant clinical improvement in dSNMG patients after treatment, supporting an immune pathophysiology in this cohort and encouraging efforts to improve response to treatment.

### AChR-myasthenia gravis switching to double-seropositive several years after the onset [^117Da6AJ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2014). Low credibility.

We report an early onset AChR-myasthenia gravis (MG) with biphasic clinical course. The clinical "switch" from AChR-MG to MuSK-MG emerged 16 years after the onset and 11 years after thymectomy. MuSK antibodies were detected only by cell-based assay and only upon clinical "switch", while AChR antibodies remained positive and at high titers during the whole disease course. Although the occurrence of AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies in the same individual is rare, the re-assessment of the antibody status, using all available assays, is advisable when there is clinical indication.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^115rrPH2]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study was retrospective, and the results might have been affected by possible selection bias and variation in clinical practice among participating physicians. Both ELISA and CBA were performed in all 89 patients, but RIPA in a subset of patients (n = 51). This limitation of the study was due to the practical difficulties of obtaining clinical serum samples from a large number of varying sources. In line with previous works, however, we confirmed a very high agreement between the results of CBA and RIPA in these 51 patients, which may support the validity of our findings. Diagnostic certainty of double seronegative MG may be another limitation of this study. It may be related in part to the sensitivity shortfall of ancillary tests and a lack of the formal established diagnostic criteria for seronegative MG. While we screened an initial cohort of patients with a high index of suspicion for seronegative generalized MG, we noted that the level of suspicion varied among cases and making a clinical diagnosis are often challenging particularly at initial presentation. Indeed, there were no abnormal findings consistent with MG in either RNS or pharmacologic test in 27% (17/62) of double seronegative MG patients. Single-fiber EMG was rarely performed in our group of patients, probably because it is technically demanding and non-specific. Instead of excluding these patients, we decided to make a diagnostic judgment based on disease course and treatment response during clinical follow-up of at least 6 months. To elucidate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests in seronegative MG, we propose that formal consensus in clinical diagnostic criteria should be established. Lastly, the specificity of MuSK ELISA was assessed only in disease controls in this study. Although the specificity of CBA and RIPA was examined in a subset of disease controls (12/63), the result was well in line with previous works supporting the well-established validity of these assays.

Antibody tests

Anti-AChR antibodies

The first and still the most common antibody test used is the anti-AChR antibody assay. Traditionally these AChR antibodies have been detected using radio-immuno-precipitation assays (RIPA). Some of the patients (10–15% of generalised MG and 50% of ocular MG cases) classified as 'seronegative' using RIPA, have low-affinity antibodies to AChR that cannot be detected in standard solution RIPA. However, about two-thirds of sera from patients previously found to be negative for binding AChR in solution, have been found to be positive for anti-AChR antibody using a cell-based assay method in which antibodies to rapsyn-clustered AChR are detected. Clinically they resemble patients with AChR antibodies detected by standard RIPA apart from the fact that patients with antibodies only to clustered AChR have been found to be younger, have milder disease and generally have a good prognosis. Furthermore, cell-based assays can also be useful in the diagnosis of RIPA-negative MG in children. This method is the primary technique for detecting other antibodies such as anti-LRP4 and it may also be used for anti-MuSK antibodies.

Patients with positive anti-AChR antibodies generally do not express a single monoclonal antibody population. The heterogeneous nature of the anti-AChR antibody response has led to the categorisation of AChR antibodies into 3 types: binding, blocking, and modulating antibodies. Both binding and blocking antibodies correlate with disease severity in MG. The most sensitive assay in a study analysing serum samples from 41,180 patients (12% of these had AChR antibodies from any one of the above three categories) was the AChR binding antibody assay, which was positive in 4178 (88%) of the 4740 AChR antibody-positive serum samples. Modulating antibodies were detected in 70% (n = 3297) of the samples, and blocking antibodies were least prevalent, detected in only 65% (n = 3074) of AChR antibody-positive sera. Combining binding and blocking AChR antibody testing identified 97% of the patient population with detectable AChR antibodies.

The sensitivity of AChR antibody in adults is 85–90% in cases with generalised MG and 50–70% in cases of ocular MG. It is only 50% sensitive in cases of childhood-onset MG but nearly 100% in cases of thymoma-associated MG. Specificity of anti-AChR for myasthenia is 95–100%.

### Clinical and biological heterogeneity of autoimmune myasthenia gravis [^114wd9Q4]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2011). Low credibility.

Although myasthenia gravis (MG) has long been considered a well-established autoimmune disease associated with autoantibodies, which are convincingly pathogenic, accumulating data indicate both clinical and biological heterogeneity similar to many other putative autoimmune disorders. In a subset of patients, thymus plays a definite role: thymic autoimmunity results in generation of autoantibodies within the thymus, which cross-react with antigens at the neuromuscular junction, or thymoma leads to deficient central tolerance and impaired T cell selection. Heterogeneity on the autoantibody level may be associated with genetic heterogeneity and clinical phenotypes with different treatment responses.

### The best and worst of times in therapy development for myasthenia gravis [^116w18f3]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Medium credibility.

Within the last 5years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved complement and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN) inhibitors for treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis, and several other therapies are in late-stage clinical trials or under regulatory review. However, questions about which patients are most likely to benefit from which therapies, and the relative effectiveness of these very expensive drugs, has resulted in uncertainty around the place that they should occupy in the existing therapeutic armamentarium. MGNet (a Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium funded by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke) held two meetings during the 14th International Conference of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America to discuss the most critical needs for clinical trial readiness and biomarker development in the context of therapy development for myasthenia gravis. Herein we provide a summary of these discussions, but not a consensus opinion, and offer a series of recommendations to guide focused research in the most critical areas. We welcome ongoing discussion through comments on this work.

### Treating myasthenia gravis beyond the eye clinic [^111F7Q62]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A good proportion of patients with MG will present to the eye clinic with ptosis and double vision. It is important to be aware of the differential diagnosis and the bedside tests as well as neurophysiological and immunological tests which will aid the diagnosis. A stepwise approach to diagnosis and treatment with clinical clues to looks out for impending myasthenic crisis is shown in Fig. 4. Traditional treatments with cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and steroid sparing immunosuppressants are still the mainstay in the management of vast majority of patients with MG. However, ophthalmologists would need to be aware of the vast array of newer treatments which are being used in MG and where possible, work in collaboration with specialist neuroimmunology clinics.

### Frequency and clinical features of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis [^1137NX9z]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we retrospectively investigated the frequency and clinical features of patients with treatment-refractory generalized myasthenia gravis. We found that 11.1% of our study population met the respective criteria indicating persistent myasthenic symptoms despite adequate treatment with at least two concurrent immunosuppressive drugs, usually steroids plus a steroid-sparing agent for at least the last year before assessing resistance. The other main finding of the study was that patients who became treatment-refractory during their course of disease, still had a worse outcome at last follow-up despite more aggressive ensuing treatment.

In comparison with previous studies, the percentage of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis in our cohort is within the reported range of 9.2–14.8%. In contrast to these studies, however, we excluded patients with pure ocular myasthenia gravis, thus our findings are applicable only to patients with generalized symptoms developing within the first year of the disease. As detailed above, we used a strict definition of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis based on the duration of treatment and symptoms, which partly differs from previously suggested criteria. Most importantly, we limited our definition to moderate to severe patients (i.e. a MGFA class of III or more). While we acknowledge that patients with persistent milder symptoms might also be affected to a relevant degree in their abilities of daily living and that these patients are potentially better captured by more lenient proposed definitions of refractory myasthenia gravis, we believe that our criteria complement previous criteria because they specifically target refractory patients who are clinically severely affected despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment.

### Myasthenia gravis in conjunction with Graves' disease: a diagnostic challenge [^1174gNWy]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an association between Graves' disease and myasthenia gravis and discuss the clinical features and laboratory tests that may help distinguish these two diseases.

Methods

The clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiologic findings in a patient with Graves' disease and myasthenia gravis are presented.

Results

A 28-year-old African American man was admitted to the University of Louisville Hospital with generalized muscle weakness, exophthalmos, diplopia, weight loss, and mild dysphagia. The diagnosis of Graves' disease with ophthalmologic involvement was suspected clinically and confirmed by an undetectable thyrotropin level (< 0.03 mIU/mL), high total thyroxine (20.5 mg/dL), and increased homogeneous 123I thyroid uptake. Because of the generalized muscle weakness and mild dysphagia, assessment was done by a neurology team, and severe thyrotoxic myopathy was diagnosed. He was treated with 131I and b-adrenergic blocking agents and scheduled for follow-up as an outpatient. Two weeks later, the patient presented in acute respiratory failure. The neurology team was reconsulted because of suspected myasthenic crisis. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were undetectable in the serum, and computed tomography of the chest showed no thymic enlargement. Repetitive nerve stimulation testing, however, showed findings consistent with an abnormality of the neuromuscular junction. The patient responded dramatically to an anticholinesterase agent and corticosteroids.

Conclusion

The overlapping clinical features may cause diagnostic confusion when myasthenia gravis and Graves' disease coexist, and numerous tests may be needed to distinguish these two conditions, which have differing treatments and prognoses.

### Pathophysiology and immunological profile of myasthenia gravis and its subgroups [^1124siJz]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune antibody-mediated disease characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability. It is believed that the initial steps triggering humoral immunity in MG take place inside thymic tissue and thymoma. The immune response against one or several epitopes expressed on thymic tissue cells spills over to neuromuscular junction components sharing the same epitope causing humoral autoimmunity and antibody production. The main cause of MG is acetylcholine receptor antibodies. However, many other neuromuscular junction membrane protein targets, intracellular and extracellular proteins are suggested to participate in MG pathophysiology. MG should be divided into subgroups based on clinical presentation and immunology. This includes onset age, clinical characteristics, thymic pathology and antibody profile. The immunological profile of these subgroups is determined by the antibodies present.

### FcRn inhibitors for myasthenia gravis [^114omPiw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In some people with MG the development of the disease is due to abnormalities of the thymus, a gland that is involved in the development and monitoring of the immune system. A tumour of the thymus (known as a thymoma) is found in 15% of people with MG. Unlike thymic carcinoma (an aggressive cancer of the thymus gland), thymomas are usually slow growing and do not tend to spread from the thymus gland to other parts of the body. Treatment of people with MG and thymoma involves surgery to remove the thymoma, which can result in improvement in MG symptoms.

The clinical presentations of MG are grouped according to which areas of the body are affected. MG is typically classified as either ocular (eye involvement only) or generalised disease, where several areas of the body are affected (e.g. ocular, bulbar, respiratory and/or limb involvement). Some people with ocular MG will continue to have eye involvement only; however, most will progress to generalised MG during the course of the disease.

The approach to diagnosis in MG is multimodal and warrants evaluation by a specialist neurologist. Patients will require a clinical assessment, including a full history and examination to detect signs of fatigable weakness. Investigations will include serological (blood) testing for autoantibodies (namely AChR and MuSK), while neurophysiology (nerve tests) can be used to demonstrate a waning/decrement in the response of the muscles to repetitive stimulation. In all cases of suspected MG, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest should be done to check for a thymoma. Additional investigations (e.g. brain or spine imaging) may be warranted for patients with negative serology and neurophysiology testing, to rule out brain or spinal causes of muscle weakness.

An MG crisis is defined as a sudden worsening of MG symptoms that is life‐threatening and involves the respiratory muscles, which can result in the affected person requiring intubation and ventilation in an intensive care unit. People in MG crisis may be treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg, which comprises donated antibodies that can help dampen down the immune response) or plasma exchange (a process whereby the blood plasma, the part of the blood that contains antibodies, is removed and replaced). These therapies work within days to reduce the effects of autoantibodies, but are only effective for four to six weeks. Due to the potential risks, high cost, and low availability of these therapies, they are not suitable for long‐term therapy.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^112chCXG]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although we did not present the sensitivity of MuSK-ELISA, it can be inferred to be rather lower than that of CBA from direct comparisons of the results. As for the positive predictive value of MuSK-ELISA, it is proportional not only to the sensitivity but also to the prior probability for the diagnosis. We've encountered many instances in which patients with bulbar onset MND were referred for MuSK ELISA mainly based on the complaints of fatigable weakness and a decremental response in RNS test. Given the caveat of false-positives in MuSK ELISA, our results indicate that the prior probability of MuSK MG should be adjusted with careful consideration of the diagnostic pitfalls. Meanwhile, it also should be emphasized that the negative result of MuSK-ELISA should not preclude the diagnosis of MuSK MG. Tests with higher sensitivity should be considered when MuSK MG is clinically suspected with exclusion of alternative diagnoses.

In conclusion, we confirmed the diagnostic accuracy of MuSK-ELISA in a large cohort of AChR Ab-negative generalized MG patients. Our results highlight the clinical pitfalls in making a diagnosis of MuSK MG, and support a diagnostic utility of MuSK-ELISA in clinical practice particularly where either RIPA or CBA is not available.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^113n3km4]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Genetic testing for congenital myasthenic syndromes

All the above-mentioned tests can sometimes be technically challenging in newborns suspected to have a CMS. The diagnosis of CMS is typically considered on the clinical basis of fatigable weakness involving ocular, bulbar and limb muscles at birth to early childhood (though adult onset is increasingly recognised), presence of an abnormal neurophysiological study suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder and absence of myasthenic autoantibodies in the sera.

While SFEMG may be challenging in newborns due to lack of voluntary muscle contraction on command, SSFEMG can still be performed in those suspected to have a CMS. A newer algorithm, that analyzes the entire SSFEMG waveform, from which cross-correlational coefficients (between 0 and 1.0) are calculated for consecutive pairs of 100 SSFEMG waveforms obtained at each needle position in orbicularis oculi, which are then averaged, has better specificity (87% vs. 53%) but similar sensitivity (88% for both), compared to conventional MCD measurements.

Most CMS result from molecular defects in the muscle nicotinic AChR, but they can also be caused by mutations in presynaptic proteins or proteins associated with the synaptic basal lamina, defects in the endplate or defects in protein glycosylation. Sophisticated neurophysiological studies could determine whether the molecular defect lies at the presynaptic terminal or synaptic or post-synaptic terminal; however, apart from the standard tests (RNS showing decrement, SFEMG showing jitter), these are not performed in routine clinical practice.

Furthermore, next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel testing of the genes involved in CMS is now commercially available. In those cases of CMS that remain undiagnosed through to their adult years, because of milder symptoms in early life, refractoriness to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and immunotherapy should prompt CMS as a differential diagnosis and genetic testing should be considered. A precise genetic diagnosis is important for therapeutic reasons, as treatments that are effective can be different in the various CMS. The genetic basis of the various types of CMS is outlined in Supplementary Table 1.

The search for an aetiology at a molecular level enables further characterisation of subgroups of CMS as a significant number of CMS patients may present in the neonatal period with variable clinical expression. Genetic testing using NGS may be a more convenient and accurate way to establish the molecular diagnosis in these cases. One shortcoming of this approach is that the genetic panel may not include all the 32 genes implicated in CMS and there is also the issue that such testing is not available in all countries.

### Myasthenia gravis-autoantibody characteristics and their implications for therapy [^113N2Nd9]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder caused by autoantibodies that target the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigability. Currently available treatments for the disease include symptomatic pharmacological treatment, immunomodulatory drugs, plasma exchange, thymectomy and supportive therapies. Different autoantibody patterns and clinical manifestations characterize different subgroups of the disease: early-onset MG, late-onset MG, thymoma MG, muscle-specific kinase MG, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 MG, seronegative MG, and ocular MG. These subtypes differ in terms of clinical characteristics, disease pathogenesis, prognosis and response to therapies. Patients would, therefore, benefit from treatment that is tailored to their disease subgroup, as well as other possible disease biomarkers, such as antibodies against cytoplasmic muscle proteins. Here, we discuss the different MG subtypes, the sensitivity and specificity of the various antibodies involved in MG for distinguishing between these subtypes, and the value of antibody assays in guiding optimal therapy. An understanding of these elements should be useful in determining how to adapt existing therapies to the requirements of each patient.

### Expert consensus recommendations for improving and standardising the assessment of patients with generalised myasthenia gravis [^11481KYP]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic, immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐mediated, neuromuscular autoimmune disease, which causes debilitating and potentially life‐threatening muscle weakness. Most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) first present with ocular symptoms only; however, approximately 80% will have gMG within 2 years of initial disease onset. gMG is classified by degree of muscle weakness, which, along with other symptoms of the disease, may vary greatly among individuals and fluctuate over time. This variation in symptoms, combined with infrequent and isolated evaluations, means accurate tracking of symptom state and full comprehension of disease burden is difficult. The impact of gMG on patient's lives can therefore be underappreciated.

In addition, the impact of gMG on key areas of patient health and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) is profound, increasing substantially with increased disease severity. Many patients also continue to experience substantial disease burden while on treatment, and poor HRQoL may persist even if gMG is considered to be well managed. Nonetheless, current measures of impairment have the potential to provide a good score‐based measure of the impact of symptoms and treatment on HRQoL in patients, if used consistently.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^116NugSq]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

We have reported on the comprehensive autoantibody profiles (MuSK, LRP4, clustered AChR) in patients with anti-AChR Ab-negative generalized MG in South Korea. Following the study, we have continued to collect clinical data and serum samples of the patients with anti-AChR Ab-negative generalized MG. This provided us an opportunity to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ELISA for anti-MuSK Ab compared to CBA and RIPA. We also aimed to investigate the clinical contexts (clinical features and differential diagnoses) in which the test for anti-MuSK Ab is requested in a real-world setting.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^112JmL4N]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MuSK-ELISA in a large multi-center cohort of 89 AChR Ab-negative generalized MG, and confirmed that the ELISA results are consistent with those of CBA and RIPA in the vast majority of patients with Cohen's kappa of 0.80 and 0.90, respectively. We also found significant correlations of anti-MuSK Ab concentrations in ELISA with CBA scores and RIPA values. Taken together with the high specificity of MuSK-ELISA in our disease controls, our results support a diagnostic utility of MuSK-ELISA in clinical practice.

This study highlights real-world challenges and clinical pitfalls in a diagnosis of seronegative generalized MG, particularly without the aid of serological testing. Though initially suspected of AChR Ab-negative generalized MG, a final diagnosis in a considerable portion of the patients (56/160, 35.0%) turned out to be not MG. The most common differential diagnosis in our cohort was motor neuron disease, particularly of bulbar onset. It is noteworthy that there were remarkably overlapping clinical and electrophysiological features between MuSK MG and motor neuron disease at presentation. More than two thirds of MuSK MG patients (70%) showed predominantly bulbar involvement, often with tongue and facial muscles atrophy. Meanwhile, in about 40% of motor neuron disease patients, RNS test revealed abnormal (> 10%) decrements in CMAP amplitudes, reflecting the neuromuscular junction transmission defects. In bulbar-onset motor neuron disease, symptoms may be confined to the bulbar region for several months or even years before wider generalization often with a lack of EMG findings of subclinical lower motor neuron involvement at limb muscles. These clinical and electrodiagnostic overlaps and pitfalls might account for partly at least why motor neuron disease constituted such a large proportion of differential diagnoses in our cohort. Of note, however, the motor neuron disease patients were found to be significantly different from those with MuSK MG in that they were significantly older at symptom onset, the sex ratio was not biased to female, none had ocular manifestations, and the myasthenic crisis or mimics were very rare.

### Role of autoantibody levels as biomarkers in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis: a systematic review and expert appraisal [^116sg5F5]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although myasthenia gravis (MG) is recognized as an immunoglobulin G autoantibody-mediated disease, the relationship between autoantibody levels and disease activity in MG is unclear. We sought to evaluate this landscape through systematically assessing the evidence, testing the impact of predefined variables on any relationship, and augmenting with expert opinion.

Methods

In October 2020, a forum of leading clinicians and researchers in neurology from across Europe (Expert Forum for Rare Autoantibodies in Neurology in Myasthenia Gravis) participated in a series of virtual meetings that took place alongside the conduct of a systematic literature review (SLR).

Results

Forty-two studies were identified meeting inclusion criteria. Of these, 10 reported some correlation between a patient's autoantibody level and disease severity. Generally, decreased autoantibody levels (acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase, and titin) were positively and significantly correlated with improvements in disease severity (Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score, Myasthenia Gravis Composite score, Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America classification). Given the limited evidence, testing the impact of predefined variables was not feasible.

Conclusions

This first SLR to assess whether a correlation exists between autoantibody levels and disease activity in patients with MG has indicated a potential positive correlation, which could have clinical implications in guiding treatment decisions. However, in light of the limited and variable evidence, we cannot currently recommend routine clinical use of autoantibody level testing in this context. For now, patient's characteristics, clinical disease course, and laboratory data (e.g., autoantibody status, thymus histology) should inform management, alongside patient-reported outcomes. We highlight the need for future studies to reach more definitive conclusions on this relationship.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of disorders with a well characterised autoimmune or genetic and neurophysiological basis. We reviewed the literature from the last 20 years assessing the utility of various neurophysiological, immunological, provocative and genetic tests in MG and CMS. Diagnostic sensitivity of repetitive nerve stimulation test ranges between 14 and 94% and specificity between 73 and 100%; sensitivity of single-fibre EMG (SFEMG) test ranges between 64 and 100% and specificity between 22 and 100%; anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody sensitivity ranges from 13 to 97% and specificity ranges from 95 to 100%. Overall, SFEMG has the highest sensitivity while positive anti-AChR antibodies have the highest specificity. Newer testing strategies that have been investigated over the last couple of decades include ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials, otoacoustic emissions and disease-specific circulating miRNAs in serum for autoimmune myasthenia, as well as next-generation sequencing for genetic testing of CMS. While there has been significant progress in developing newer testing strategies for diagnosing MG and CMS over the last couple of decades, more research is needed to assess the utility of these newer tools regarding their sensitivity and specificity.

Literature search and development of evidence‐based statements

Search terms and strings were created to interrogate the questions developed using the PICO framework (Appendix, Table A2) and systematic literature searches, based on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, were conducted under the supervision of the Sub‐committee (Figure 1). Trained medical writers performed the literature search: two writers independently performed the systematic review using the search strings, and a third writer independently adjudicated any discrepancies. The writers assessed the level of evidence for each question using the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐based Medicine (OCEM) criteria, and presented these to the Sub‐committee in a report which summarised the literature review results and highlighted key findings for each question, study limitations and knowledge gaps. The Sub‐committee were provided with full access to all the results and a review meeting was held during which they discussed the evidence alongside their own expert opinions and clinical experience to direct development of draft consensus statements. These were refined by the authors in a follow‐up review meeting, prior to being sent for voting.

### Update on muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody positive myasthenia gravis [^113tniP7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Important concepts regarding the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive myasthenia gravis will be reviewed. Special attention will be paid to clinical phenotypes and treatment, particularly encouraging responses that have been reported to rituximab.

Recent Findings

Worldwide studies confirm three major phenotypes in MuSK antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MMG) patients: indistinguishable from acetylcholine receptor antibody positive patients, prominent faciopharyngeal weakness, usually with marked muscle atrophy, and relatively isolated neck extensor and respiratory weakness. MMG predominates in women and weakness is typically more severe, with more frequent respiratory crises than non-MuSK myasthenia gravis. Patients with sub-acute bulbar, shoulder, and neck weakness pose unique challenges in terms of differential diagnosis and electrodiagnosis. Electrodiagnostic studies evaluating for disorders of neuromuscular transmission should focus on proximal limb and facial muscles, as well as clinically weak muscles. The response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is often disappointing. Long-term outcomes appear favorable though patients typically require more aggressive immunosuppression. Uncontrolled observations report encouraging results with rituximab in the treatment of refractory MMG. The role of thymectomy in the management of these patients remains uncertain.

Summary

MuSK antibody positive patients represent a unique subset of myasthenia gravis. Identification of these patients has important diagnostic and disease management implications.

Management when MG/LEMS patients have already contracted COVID‑19 — continue usual care in mild disease; adjust for severe illness. Most patients have mild disease and should continue the current best practice standard of care for MG/LEMS. Corticosteroid doses might need to be increased per standard infection/stress protocols. If symptoms are severe with hospitalization, it may be necessary to consider pausing current immunosuppression temporarily, especially with concurrent infections or sepsis, and immune depleting agents should not be given under such conditions.

Epidemiological, immunological, and genetic features of distinct MG subtypes

Based on clinical, epidemiological, immunological and genetic findings as well as thymus pathology, MG has been further sub-classified (Table 1): pure ocular MG (OMG;) is distinguished from generalized MG with early onset (< 45 years "early-onset" MG, EOMG) and generalized MG with late onset (> 45 years "late-onset" MG, LOMG). EOMG is often associated with lymphofollicular hyperplasia of the thymus, and LOMG is characterized by age-dependent involution of the thymus. In contrast, 10–15% of all patients do have thymoma (thymoma-associated MG, TAMG).

Table 1
Features of different subtypes of MG

n. a. not applicable

a Currently there is no agreement in the literature regarding the age differentiating EOMG from LOMG

MG is due to a reduction of functional skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) at and structural alterations of the neuromuscular endplate due to the effects of different autoantibodies. In about 85%, autoantibodies against the AChR itself can be detected. The AChR is a pentameric ligand-gated monovalent cation channel that exists in two forms with defined stoichiometry of the homologous alpha (α), beta (β), gamma (γ), delta (δ) and epsilon (ε) subunits: the fetal AChR shows an α 2 βδγ subunit composition, and the adult AChR shows an α 2 βδε subunit stoichiometry. The α-subunit contains two functionally important domains: (a) an extracellular cystein loop that mediates ligand (acetylcholine, ACh) binding; and (b) an extracellular sequence to which most AChR autoantibodies are binding termed the main immunogenic region (MIR).

### Bedside testing for myasthenia gravis: the ice-test [^1146sTAP]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

A 67-year-old man presented to the acute medical take with a history of droopy eyelids and difficulty swallowing. A diagnosis of myasthenia gravis was suspected from the clinical history. The patient's symptoms were progressive, raising concerns of aspiration pneumonia or respiratory compromise if untreated. Definitive diagnosis of myasthenia gravis relies upon a combination of serological and electrophysiological investigations, the results of which are not immediately available in an acute situation. Bedside tests are therefore of practical clinical importance to enable prompt and effective initiation of treatment, particularly where critical symptoms are present. The ice-test is a straightforward and non-invasive investigation with a high sensitivity for myasthenia gravis and is a useful alternative to edrophonium testing. It is especially helpful in patients with cardiac and respiratory co-morbidities for whom acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are contraindicated. We describe a case where this simple bedside test successfully expedited the correct treatment and improved patient care.

### Epidemiology, diagnostics, and biomarkers of autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders [^114TtXpp]. The Lancet: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders are rare. However, myasthenia gravis is being increasingly recognised in people older than 50 years. In the past 5–10 years, epidemiological studies worldwide suggest an incidence of acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive myasthenia gravis of up to 29 cases per 1 million people per year. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody-positive myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are about 20 times less common. Several diagnostic methods are available for autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorders, including serological antibody, electrophysiological, imaging, and pharmacological tests. The course of disease can be followed up with internationally accepted clinical scores or patient-reported outcome measures. For prognostic purposes, determining whether the disease is paraneoplastic is of great importance, as myasthenia gravis can be associated with thymoma and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with small-cell lung cancer. However, despite well defined diagnostic parameters to classify patients into subgroups, objective biomarkers for use in the clinic or in clinical trials to predict the course of myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome are needed.

### Rethinking the diagnosis of double-seronegative myasthenia gravis [^114uF4Rr]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

The authors' main diagnostic method for dSNMG relied primarily on clinical symptoms combined with the assessment of abnormal results from repetitive nerve stimulation and/or single fiber electromyography. However, this approach may inadvertently include other conditions that mimic MG, as certain conditions may present with abnormal repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber electromyography findings similar to those observed in MG. Notably, the neostigmine test response was not included in the diagnostic process for MG. As the authors themselves point out, patients diagnosed with dSNMG should be thoroughly evaluated for possible alternative diagnoses such as other myasthenic syndromes and various neuromuscular disorders, especially if they do not respond to treatment.

The authors did not investigate other MG autoantibodies such as low‐density lipoprotein receptor‐related protein 4, titin, ryanodine receptor, agrin and cortactin. For improved diagnostic accuracy, a comprehensive analysis of additional MG autoantibodies may be required to differentiate true dSNMG patients.

In conclusion, the study by Martinez‐Harms et al. significantly advances our understanding of the clinical aspects and treatment outcomes of dSNMG. As highlighted by the authors, authentic dSNMG is considered to be part of the same MG spectrum as AChR‐ antibody‐positive MG, with comparable clinical features and a positive response to conventional immunotherapy. However, the reliability of this contribution depends on an accurate diagnosis within this cohort.

### Autoimmune myasthenia gravis: emerging clinical and biological heterogeneity [^115wFo9Z]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction in which patients experience fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that often affects selected muscle groups preferentially. The target of the autoimmune attack in most cases is the skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR), but in others, non-AChR components of the neuromuscular junction, such as the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, are targeted. The pathophysiological result is muscle endplate dysfunction and consequent fatigable muscle weakness. Clinical presentations vary substantially, both for anti-AChR positive and negative MG, and accurate diagnosis and selection of effective treatment depends on recognition of less typical as well as classic disease phenotypes. Accumulating evidence suggests that clinical MG subgroups might respond differently to treatment. In this Review, we provide current information about the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of MG, including emerging therapeutic strategies.

### Seronegative autoimmune diseases: a challenging diagnosis [^1125UNCQ]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Autoimmune diseases (AID) are increasingly prevalent conditions which comprise more than 100 distinct clinical entities that are responsible for a great disease burden worldwide. The early recognition of these diseases is key for preventing their complications and for tailoring proper management. In most cases, autoantibodies, regardless of their potential pathogenetic role, can be detected in the serum of patients with AID, helping clinicians in making a definitive diagnosis and allowing screening strategies for early -and sometimes pre-clinical- diagnosis. Despite their undoubted crucial role, in a minority of cases, patients with AID may not show any autoantibody, a condition that is referred to as seronegative AID. Suboptimal accuracy of the available laboratory tests, antibody absorption, immunosuppressive therapy, immunodeficiencies, antigen exhaustion, and immunosenescence are the main possible determinants of seronegative AID. Indeed, in seronegative AID, the diagnosis is more challenging and must rely on clinical features and on other available tests, often including histopathological evaluation and radiological diagnostic tests. In this review, we critically dissect, in a narrative fashion, the possible causes of seronegativity, as well as the diagnostic and management implications, in several AID including autoimmune gastritis, celiac disease, autoimmune liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune encephalitis, myasthenia gravis, Sjögren's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and autoimmune thyroid diseases.

### Seronegative myasthenic crisis: a multicenter analysis [^117BgD9U]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease with antibodies (Abs) targeting the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. Ultimately, muscle fatigability and weakness are caused by disrupted neuromuscular signaling. Nearly 90% of all MG patients have positive test results for AChR, Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP4) autoantibodies, with the majority tested positive for AChR-Abs. However, in around 10–15% of MG patients no specific autoantibodies can be found. This group of seronegative patients is also thought to include patients with very low antibody titers, low-affinity antibodies and yet to be defined autoantigens.

Myasthenic crisis (MC) is the most severe form of MG and is potentially life threatening. MC is mostly provoked by infections, but also fever, aspiration, inadequate treatment, various medications, or following surgery. In the first two years after diagnosis, around 15–20% of MG patients suffer from a MC. Characteristic symptoms are extensive weakness, dysphagia, and dyspnea which can result in respiratory insufficiency. The clinical management of MC is well defined and has led to a significant decline in mortality from around 40% in the early 1960s to 5% to 12% in recent studies.

However, to date little is known about the management of MC in seronegative MG. Here, we therefore investigated seronegative patients with MC and compared their crises to AChR-MCs regarding clinical features, therapeutic management, and outcome.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^117JBu4R]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical features of our MuSK MG patients agreed well with the known characteristics, including female preponderance, predominantly bulbar involvement, rare thymic pathology, rapid progression and frequent myasthenic crisis. Notably, some of these features (female preponderance, predominant bulbar impairment, frequent crisis, and greater severity) were also significantly over-represented in MuSK MG compared to double seronegative MG in our cohort. Further research to discover new self-antigens and autoantibodies would be required to understand the composition and clinical characteristics of MG subtypes within this group.

The overall proportion of ocular form at onset was relatively low in our cohort of AChR Ab-negative generalized MG patients. Unexpectedly, however, the ocular form at onset was significantly associated with the diagnosis of MuSK MG when compared to double seronegative generalized MG. Although the involvement of extra-ocular muscles was initially thought to be rare in MuSK MG, a recent study of Italian patients showed that it was frequent as in AChR MG, reporting it as the first manifestation in almost 60% of patients. Given the large variation across studies, it is likely that the ocular manifestations in MuSK MG may be subtle or atypical and therefore require careful attention to notice.

### Recommendations for myasthenia gravis clinical trials [^111wamAZ]. Muscle & Nerve (2012). Low credibility.

The recommendations for clinical research standards published in 2000 by a task force of the Medical Scientific Advisory Board (MSAB) of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) were largely successful in introducing greater uniformity in the recording and reporting of MG clinical trials. Recognizing that changes in clinical trial design and implementation may increase the likelihood that new therapies are developed for MG, the MGFA MSAB Task Force here presents updated recommendations for the design and implementation of clinical trials in MG, including (a) the use of a quantitative measure, such as the MG-Composite, that is weighted for clinical significance and incorporates patient reported outcomes; (b) consideration of nontrial strategies; and (c) development of biomarkers that support mechanistic studies of pharmacotherapies. The hope is that these updated task force recommendations will expedite the development and acceptance of more effective and less noxious therapies for MG.

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^114mCGy4]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

Combinations of antibody tests for different epitopes

To overcome the shortcomings of using only anti-AChR antibody tests, which can miss a substantial proportion of cases, some have argued that testing for acetylcholine receptor, acetylcholinesterase, titin and ryanodine receptor antibodies together can offer a better diagnostic method for MG than each antibody test alone but this is not accepted as a standard in routine clinical practice. In a study designed to test for multiple antibodies in 89 MG patients, AChR, acetylcholinesterase, titin and RyR antibodies were detected in 54%, 20%, 64% and 55% of MG patients, respectively. These levels were higher compared to a matched group of patients with other neurological disease (n = 66) and a group of controls (n = 66). The combination of the four antibodies assays provided 94% sensitivity and 84% specificity for the diagnosis of MG.

### Reply to letter in response to rethinking the diagnosis of double-seronegative myasthenia gravis [^113gHZPD]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

We wish to thank Drs. Seok, Kim, Eun, and Lee for their valuable comments about our recently published original article "Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Outcomes in Patients with Double‐Seronegative Myasthenia Gravis". We are very glad to see that our paper is stimulating further discussion on the topic of patients without detectable antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and muscle‐specific kinase. The authors correctly point out that we found a significant clinical improvement in double‐seronegative myasthenia gravis (dSNMG) patients in the last clinical evaluation, based on the Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index and Single Simple Question scores strongly suggesting an immune‐based mechanism and the benefit of immunotherapy in this group of patients.

dSNMG represents a heterogeneous group, and the diagnosis is challenging and commonly based on the clinical presentation and progression. It is fundamental to exclude differential diagnoses such as congenital myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophies, or other disorders of neuromuscular transmission. The authors think that the electrophysiological findings based on single fiber electromyography and repetitive nerve stimulation are essential in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). There are additional complementary diagnosis tests for MG, for example, the edrophonium and neostigmine tests, which can be reliable, but are rarely used in clinical practice. Therefore, we did not use these tests as an inclusion criterion in our study. We agree fully with Seok et al. that patients who have refractory seronegative MG should be extensively reviewed for the possibility of alternate diagnoses, although we understand that refractoriness alone does not exclude a diagnosis, as seropositive MG patients can be refractory to treatment.

### Neuromuscular junction autoimmune disease: muscle specific kinase antibodies and treatments for myasthenia gravis [^112virME]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Some of the 20% of myasthenia gravis patients who do not have antibodies to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) have antibodies to muscle specific kinase (MuSK), but a full understanding of their frequency, the associated clinical phenotype and the mechanisms of action of the antibodies has not yet been achieved. Moreover, some patients do not respond well to conventional corticosteroid therapy. Here we review recent clinical and experimental studies on MuSK antibody associated myasthenia gravis, and summarize the results of newer treatments for myasthenia gravis.

Recent Findings

MuSK antibodies are found in a variable proportion of AChR antibody negative myasthenia gravis patients who are often, but not exclusively, young adult females, with bulbar, neck, or respiratory muscle weakness. The thymus histology is normal or only very mildly abnormal. Surprisingly, limb or intercostal muscle biopsies exhibit no reduction in AChR numbers or complement deposition. However, patients without AChR or MuSK antibodies appear to be similar to those with AChR antibodies and may have low-affinity AChR antibodies. A variety of treatments, often intended to enable corticosteroid doses to be reduced, have been used in all types of myasthenia gravis with some success, but they have not been subjected to randomized clinical trials.

Summary

MuSK antibodies define a form of myasthenia gravis that can be difficult to diagnose, can be life threatening and may require additional treatments. An improved AChR antibody assay may be helpful in patients without AChR or MuSK antibodies. Clinical trials of drugs in other neuroimmunological diseases may help to guide the treatment of myasthenia gravis.

### Clinical utility of acetylcholine receptor antibody testing in ocular myasthenia gravis [^114QdXvf]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The sensitivity of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody testing is thought to be lower in ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) compared with generalized disease, although estimates in small-scale studies vary. There is little information in the literature about the implications of AChR antibody levels and progression from OMG to generalized myasthenia gravis.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that serum AChR antibody testing is more sensitive in OMG than previously reported and to examine the association between AChR antibody levels and progression from OMG to generalized myasthenia gravis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted of 223 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [16.4] years; 139 [62.3%] male) diagnosed with OMG between July 1, 1986, and May 31, 2013, at 2 large, academic medical centers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Baseline characteristics, OMG symptoms, results of AChR antibody testing, and progression time to generalized myasthenia gravis (if this occurred) were recorded for each patient. Multiple logistic regression was used to measure the association between all clinical variables and antibody result. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to examine time to generalization.

Results

Among the 223 participants, AChR antibody testing results were positive in 158 participants (70.9%). In an adjusted model, increased age at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01–1.04; p = 0.007) and progression to generalized myasthenia gravis (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18–7.26; p = 0.02) were significantly associated with positive antibody test results. Women were less likely to have a positive antibody test result (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19–0.68; p = 0.002). Patients who developed symptoms of generalized myasthenia gravis had a significantly higher mean (SD) antibody level than those who did not develop symptoms of generalized myasthenia gravis (12.7 [16.5] nmol/L vs 4.2 [7.9] nmol/L; p = 0.002).

Conclusions and Relevance

We demonstrate a higher sensitivity of AChR antibody testing than previously reported in the largest cohort of patients with OMG available to date. Older age, male sex, and progression to generalized myasthenia gravis were significantly associated with a positive antibody test result. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first report of an association between high AChR antibody levels and progression from OMG to generalized disease.

### Clinical features and diagnostic usefulness of antibodies to clustered acetylcholine receptors in the diagnosis of seronegative myasthenia gravis [^114HP1ku]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Cell-based assays (CBAs) were shown to improve detection of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Herein, we asked whether these assays were able to help determine the diagnosis in patients studied in routine clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic usefulness of CBAs in the diagnosis of MG and to compare the clinical features of patients with antibodies only to clustered AChRs with those of patients with seronegative MG (SNMG).

Design, Setting, and Participants

All patients with clinical suspicion of MG who were seen within the Division of Clinical Neurology at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2013. Their serum antibodies and clinical features were studied.

Exposures

Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and CBA were used to test for standard AChR antibodies and antibodies to clustered AChRs in 138 patients. All available samples from patients with SNMG were retrospectively tested for lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) antibodies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Demographic, clinical, neurophysiological, and laboratory data.

Results

In total, 138 patients were tested for antibodies to clustered AChRs, and 42 had a final diagnosis of MG. The clustered AChR CBA detected antibodies in 38.1% (16 of 42) of RIPA-negative patients with MG with 100% specificity. All patients with SNMG who were tested for LRP4 antibodies (21 of 26) were negative by CBA. Compared with patients with SNMG, patients with antibodies only to clustered AChRs had frequent prepubertal onset (62.5% [median age, 6 years; age range, 1–52 years] vs 11.5% [median age, 38 years; age range, 2–72 years], P ≤ .05), high prevalence of ocular MG (62.5% vs 42.3%), milder disease severity with less bulbar involvement (25.0% vs 46.2%), and absence of respiratory symptoms (0% vs 23.1%). Response to treatment and prognosis was good, with a reduced need for thymectomy (6.3% vs 19.2%) and a high proportion of patients going into remission (50.0% vs 8.3%, P ≤ .05). These observations also apply to the classic AChR MG phenotype seen in large series.

Conclusions and Relevance

Cell-based assay is a useful procedure in the routine diagnosis of RIPA-negative MG, particularly in children. Patients with antibodies only to clustered AChRs appear to be younger and have milder disease than other patients with MG. These observations will have implications in planning treatment.

### Differences between females and males in the diagnostic delay and clinical course of thymectomised myasthenia gravis [^116YHEwo]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody‐mediated autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction, in which skeletal muscle fatigability and fluctuating weakness are the clinical hallmarks. Ocular symptoms are the first manifestation in about 85% of patients with MG (pwMG), and the mean age of onset is 40 years. Within 2 years from onset, in 50%–60% of ocular pwMG, the symptoms become generalized, additionally affecting proximal muscles of the extremities, trunk, or the bulbar area. Generalized muscle weakness has been reported as the onset symptom in 15% of pwMG. MG is commonly divided into early‐onset MG (EOMG) and late‐onset MG (LOMG), with the age of 50 years as the cut‐off point. Patients with EOMG (pwEOMG) are mostly females, whereas there is no clear sex difference among patients with LOMG (pwLOMG).

### Challenges in diagnosing coexisting ocular myasthenia gravis and thyroid eye disease [^11371BQQ]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Medium credibility.

Ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG) and thyroid eye disease are two autoimmune conditions that have several overlapping clinical features, and these coexist with a small but not insignificant frequency. Segregating these diagnoses is typically straightforward, but, when the two diseases co-occur in the same individual, making a diagnosis of OMG can be very challenging. In this review we address what is known about the coexistence of OMG and thyroid eye disease and we highlight the clinical features that are suggestive of overlapping conditions. We also describe the major testing approaches used in the diagnosis of these two entities, with special emphasis on the potential shortcomings of individual tests in patients with overlapping disease. In patients with thyroid eye disease, securing a diagnosis of OMG may not be possible on the basis of a single positive test. A multimodal approach using clinical, serologic, imaging, and electrodiagnostic data, is typically required.

### Myasthenia gravis: new developments in research and treatment [^115Bw6B3]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Myasthenia gravis, a rare disorder of the neuromuscular transmission, is increasingly acknowledged as a syndrome more than as a single disease. This review summarizes recent advances in pathophysiology which confirm the disease heterogeneity, and may help find disease-targeted and patient-targeted therapies.

Recent Findings

Antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor, the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase and the lipoprotein receptor protein 4, characterize disease subtypes with distinct clinical traits and immune-pathogenic mechanisms. Genome-wide approaches have identified susceptibility loci within genes that participate in the immune response. Regulatory T and B cells appear to be defective in myasthenia gravis. In patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies, thymectomy associated with prednisone proved more effective than prednisone alone in a multicenter randomized trial. New therapeutic options target B cells, B-cell growth factors and complement inhibition, and are currently reserved for patients with refractory disease.

Summary

In the recent past, there has been an active search for new antigens in myasthenia gravis, whereas clinical and experimental studies have provided new insights of crucial pathways in immune regulation, which might become the targets of future therapeutic interventions.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^113BnMrG]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is regarded an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission as (a) auto-antibody depositions are detectable at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ); (b) autoantibodies from MG patients cause MG symptoms when passively transferred into rodents; (c) active immunization of animals with auto-antigens reproduces the disease; and (d) antibody-depleting therapies decrease the severity of MG symptoms.

The incidence of MG ranges from 0.25 to 2.0 per 1,000,000. Due to effective treatment strategies and normal life expectancy, the prevalence of MG has risen in recent years to about 72:1,000,000 (range 15–179). About 10% of patients are children and adolescents. There is an increased familial risk for MG. Siblings or first-grade relatives of affected patients have a risk of 4.5% for developing MG reflecting a profound genetic disposition for the disorder.

The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. A pragmatic clinical classification distinguishes pure ocular myasthenia from generalized myasthenia with mild, moderate and severe manifestation. Ocular myasthenia exclusively affects the outer ocular muscles including the M. levator palpebrae and presents with ptosis and double vision. Ptosis and double vision may be transient, fluctuating or progressive during the day. Only 10–20% of patients show muscle fatigability and weakness persistently restricted to the outer ocular muscles. The majority of patients proceed to generalized muscle fatigability and weakness within 24 months after the disease onset. Generalized myasthenia is defined as any clinical affection of muscle groups other than outer ocular muscles independent of its severity.

The fluctuating muscle fatigability and weakness is illustrated by a typical decremental response of the amplitude and/or area under the curve of the elicited muscle compound action potential of the fifth compared to the first stimulus upon repetitive supramaximal stimulation of the accessory or facial nerve with a frequency of 3 Hz before and after isometric tetanic contraction. The lack of an incremental response of amplitudes and areas under the curve of the compound muscle action potential upon supramaximal repetitive nerve stimulation using a frequency of 30 Hz or upon pre- and post-tetanic single stimulation proofs the post-synaptic nature of the neuromuscular transmission defect. Single fiber electromyography typically shows increased jitter and intermittent conduction blocks reflecting instable neuromuscular transmission.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^1153UTkh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Criteria Tool for Early Diagnosis of Botulism in Crisis and Contingency Settings

Because diagnosing botulism can be challenging, a tool with evidence-based clinical criteria has been developed to aid clinicians in early identification of botulism in settings of crisis or contingency standards of care, when the probability of botulism increases above the level of extremely rare; the tool may be used in conventional settings as well (Box 1). Cases of botulism from several sources were used to identify signs and symptoms of acute botulism onset, which were compared and ranked by frequency to identify criteria that are optimally sensitive for a case of botulism (Tables 3 and 4). The tool was modified to account for reasons illnesses were not captured, and expert input from clinicians and other experts was applied to the criteria that comprise the tool. Ancillary results, including those from electrodiagnostic, neuroimaging, and Tensilon (edrophonium) tests and lumbar puncture, were not included in the tool. The tool was designed for maximum objectivity and reproducibility when used among health care workers; therefore, signs that frequently occurred but were difficult to quantify (e.g. sluggishly reactive pupils) were not included. Also omitted were epidemiologic risk factors that are often not confirmed early in the course of an investigation when most severely ill patients seek care for symptoms. The tool can be used for children and adults, including pregnant women, and by various health care workers without supervision after brief, focused training during contingency and crisis situations such as large outbreaks. The tool is not intended to replace a thorough physical examination and ancillary testing or to diagnose botulism; rather, the purpose is to help clinicians determine when to consider a diagnosis of botulism, without the distractions that can result from atypical or incidental findings. In a setting of conventional standard of care, the tool can be used to stimulate consideration of botulism, followed by a more detailed evaluation. In a setting of crisis standard of care, meeting these criteria alone might be sufficient to treat for presumed botulism. If only some of the criteria are met, physicians might categorize patients as having a medium likelihood of botulism and monitor them (Figures 1 and 2). Fulfillment of these criteria should not be considered diagnostic of botulism; patients with illnesses commonly confused with botulism, including myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, might meet the criteria. During outbreaks, "worried well" persons (i.e. persons who have anxiety about becoming ill during an outbreak) who do not have objective signs or symptoms of botulism often seek care at hospitals for subjective symptoms. Because triaging these patients can be time consuming and delay treatment of other patients, a response to a large botulism outbreak requires managing numerous persons who seek hospital care but do not need treatment and educating the public about which signs and symptoms do not require a hospital visit.

### Clinical pitfalls and serological diagnostics of MuSK myasthenia gravis [^114AB7ps]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction, caused in most patients by antibodies (Ab) to the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) Ab are detected in about 1–10% of all MG patients, with varying regional prevalence. Anti-MuSK IgG4 Ab block interaction with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), which interferes with MuSK activation and AChR clustering. Although there have been significant advancements in understanding clinical and pathophysiological features of MuSK MG, a diagnosis of this MG subtype may be challenging due to its often atypical clinical manifestations. The unusual clinical features include predominantly regional involvement of bulbar and respiratory muscles, facial and tongue muscle atrophy, and poor response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or even cholinergic hypersensitivity, and lower diagnostic yield of electrophysiological tests such as repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS). Accumulating knowledge on the clinical characteristics has contributed significantly to the improvement of diagnosis of MuSK MG. However, a clinical diagnosis of this MG subtype is still often challenging particularly without serological confirmation of anti-MuSK Ab, which may lead to delayed diagnosis and poor treatment outcome.

For detection of anti-MuSK Ab, there are three different laboratory techniques currently available which include the live cell-based assay (CBA), radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RIPA is the most commonly used test with almost 100% specificity, and CBA was demonstrated to provide a higher sensitivity. Although CBA and RIPA are considered as the gold standard for anti-MuSK Ab detection, they involve either radioactivity or genetically engineered cells which may not be easily available for clinical practice in many regions of the world. As an alternative, there are commercially available ELISA kits for detecting anti-MuSK Ab. However, the diagnostic accuracy of MUSK-ELISA has not been formally tested in a large cohort, and its current use is still limited for the research purpose.

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^111YD3uZ]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune antibody-mediated disorder of neuromuscular synaptic transmission. The clinical hallmark of MG consists of fluctuating fatigability and weakness affecting ocular, bulbar and (proximal) limb skeletal muscle groups. MG may either occur as an autoimmune disease with distinct immunogenetic characteristics or as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with tumors of the thymus. Impairment of central thymic and peripheral self-tolerance mechanisms in both cases is thought to favor an autoimmune CD4(+) T cell-mediated B cell activation and synthesis of pathogenic high-affinity autoantibodies of either the IgG1 and 3 or IgG4 subclass. These autoantibodies bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) itself, or muscle-specific tyrosine-kinase (MuSK), lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) and agrin involved in clustering of AchRs within the postsynaptic membrane and structural maintenance of the neuromuscular synapse. This results in disturbance of neuromuscular transmission and thus clinical manifestation of the disease. Emphasizing evidence from clinical trials, we provide an updated overview on immunopathogenesis, and derived current and future treatment strategies for MG divided into: (a) symptomatic treatments facilitating neuromuscular transmission, (b) antibody-depleting treatments, and

### Does this patient have myasthenia gravis? [^112SgANq]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Clinicians must be able to diagnose myasthenia gravis, since delays in establishing the diagnosis may put patients at risk for complications from this treatable disease.

Objective

To determine if items in the history and examination or results of simple tests change the likelihood of myasthenia gravis as a diagnosis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search of English-language articles (January 1966-January 2005) using the terms myasthenia gravis, diagnosis, and test, and a search of bibliographies of retrieved articles.

Study Selection

Studies evaluating a particular symptom or sign in patients both with and without myasthenia gravis. Of 640 articles retrieved, 33 were eligible for review. Of these, 15 met inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using previously published criteria.

Data Synthesis

A history of "speech becoming unintelligible during prolonged speaking" and the presence of the peek sign increase the likelihood of myasthenia gravis (likelihood ratio [LR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–17.0 and LR, 30.0; 95% CI, 3.2–278.0, respectively). Their absence does not significantly reduce the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. The identified studies only assessed 1 other historical feature and sign each ("food remaining in the mouth after swallowing" and quiver eye movements, respectively), and neither of these significantly changes the likelihood of myasthenia. The ice test is useful when the response is abnormal (summary positive LR, 24.0; 95% CI, 8.5–67.0) and diminishes the likelihood of myasthenia gravis when the response is normal (summary negative LR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.09–0.27). A positive response to an anticholinesterase medication (mainly edrophonium test) increases the probability of a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (summary positive LR, 15.0; 95% CI, 7.5–31.0), and a negative response reduces the diagnostic probability of myasthenia (summary negative LR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.21). An abnormal sleep test result is useful in confirming the diagnosis (LR, 53.0; 95% CI, 3.4–832.0). The rest and sleep tests make the probability of myasthenia unlikely when results are normal (LR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.95 and LR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00–0.16, respectively).

Conclusions

Items in the history and physical examination along with results of certain simple tests performed in the office (ice test, sleep test, and edrophonium test) are useful in predicting the likelihood of myasthenia gravis. These results must be interpreted with caution, however, given the high prevalence of disease in the populations reported in clinical studies. This review is limited by the small number of signs and symptoms scientifically studied and reported in the literature. Future studies evaluating the value of common historical features and easy maneuvers commonly known and practiced by experts in the clinical diagnosis of myasthenia are needed.

### Standardization of myasthenia gravis outcome measures in clinical practice: a report of the MGFA task force [^117BPkay]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Myasthenia gravis (MG) specific outcome measures are being used in clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness. These validated tools are also becoming a necessity in clinical practice, with payors in the US market often requiring them to be used to monitor disease state. There is considerable variation and subjectivity regarding their use. This study aimed to develop consensus-based recommendations for the standardization of MG specific outcome measures in clinical practice.

Methods

A panel of 10US-based MG specialists developed consensus-based recommendations based on three rounds of formal voting using the UCLA-RAND appropriateness method after surveying myasthenia gravis clinicians and developing a focus group.

Results

Twenty one expert consensus statements based on six themes were developed following clinician survey result review and focus group theme development. Some key recommendations include: the MGFA Clinical Classification assesses disease at that examination and should be updated at intervals of 3–6months to reflect current clinical status. MGFA PIS represents the overall clinical judgment of the evaluator without the requirement for a defined change in scores on any outcome measure. Patient-reported items, such as MG-ADL and MGC, should be referenced to the previous 1week to optimize recall. Additional recommendations include scoring outcome measures in the presence of co-morbidity, scoring specific physical exam findings, and clarification regarding the administration of outcome measures.

Discussion

This method provided expert consensus-based recommendations for the use of MG-specific outcome measures and exam findings to help standardize how they are used in clinical practice.

### Serological diagnostics in myasthenia gravis based on novel assays and recently identified antigens [^115utdkN]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the most common immune-mediated disorder of the neuromuscular junction with a prevalence of 200–300/million population and its study has established paradigms for exploring other antibody-mediated diseases. Most MG patients (~85%) have autoantibodies against the muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR-MG), whereas about 6% of MG patients have autoantibodies against the muscle specific kinase (MuSK-MG). Until recently no autoantibodies could be detected in the remaining patients (seronegative MG). Probably, the most sensitive assays for the detection of the autoantibodies in MG sera have been the radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPA) for both types of MG. However, with recent novel methods, not yet used routinely, it has been shown that the "seronegative" MG group includes patients with low levels of autoantibodies or of low affinity, against the known autoantigens, or even with antibodies to recently identified autoantigens. Since MG is heterogeneous in terms of pathophysiology, depending on the autoantigen targeted and on other factors (e.g. presence of thymoma), the serological tests are crucial in verifying the initial clinical diagnosis, whereas frequent measurement of autoantibody levels is important in monitoring the course of the disease and the efficacy of treatment. In addition, in AChR-MG, autoantibodies against the muscle proteins titin and ryanodin receptor have been identified; these antibodies are useful for the classification of MG, indicating the concomitant presence of thymoma, and as prognostic markers.

### Seronegative generalised myasthenia gravis: clinical features, antibodies, and their targets [^1117qwsZ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2003). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a well-recognised disorder of neuromuscular transmission that can be diagnosed by the presence of antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). However, some patients (about 15%) with generalised MG do not have detectable AChR antibodies. There is some evidence, however, that this "seronegative" MG is an antibody-mediated disorder. Plasma from patients with the disorder seems to contain various distinct humoral factors: IgG antibodies that reversibly inhibit AChR function; a non-IgG (possibly IgM) factor that indirectly inhibits AChR function; and an IgG antibody against the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK). The presence of antibodies against MuSK appears to define a subgroup of patients with seronegative MG who have predominantly localised, in many cases bulbar, muscle weaknesses (face, tongue, pharynx, etc) and reduced response to conventional immunosuppressive treatments. Moreover, muscle wasting may be present, which prevents complete response to these therapies.

### Autoimmune mediated neuromuscular junction defects [^115B2Rrm]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the recent advances on pathogenesis of antibody-mediated disorders of the neuromuscular junction, and results of studies on clinical assessment and treatments.

Recent Findings

The incidence of myasthenia gravis, particularly in patients older than 50 years, is rising, and this is not solely due to improved disease recognition. It is uncertain how muscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive myasthenia gravis results in neuromuscular transmission failure since MuSK antibodies alter neuromuscular junction morphology without altering acetylcholine receptor numbers or turnover. Clinical tools have been developed that allow rapid and reliable disease assessment. The myasthenia gravis composite score addresses items commonly affected in myasthenia gravis, is sensitive to detect clinical change and helps guide the physician in therapy prescription. Immunosuppression remains the mainstay of myasthenia gravis treatment. Other therapies, such as rituximab, are increasingly prescribed for refractory myasthenia gravis, and drugs that inhibit complement are being explored in myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). In Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), SOX antibodies help distinguish between tumour and nontumour LEMS. Ganglioside complexes in GBS and Miller-Fisher syndrome are frequently present and are more pathogenic.

Summary

Developments in serological assays, particularly of cell-based assays, are continuing to improve the diagnosis and investigation of these conditions. Learning more on pathogenicity has helped us to apply newer therapies.

### Towards personalized management of myasthenia gravis phenotypes: from the role of multi-omics to the emerging biomarkers and therapeutic targets [^1153C7sT]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Predicting the onset, progression, and outcome of rare and chronic neurological diseases, i.e. neuromuscular diseases, is an important goal for both clinicians and researchers and should guide clinical decision-making and personalized treatment plans. A prime example is myasthenia gravis (MG), an antibody-mediated disease that affects multiple components of the postsynaptic membrane, impairing neuromuscular transmission and producing fatigable muscle weakness. MG is characterized by several clinical phenotypes, defined by a broad spectrum of factors, which have contributed to the current lack of consensus on the optimal management and treatments of this disease and its related phenotypes (subtypes). This represents a crucial challenge in MG and encourages a revolutionary change in diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic guidelines. Emerging factors, such as demographic, clinical and pathophysiological factors, must also be considered. Consequently, the different MG phenotypes are characterized by precise biological signatures, which could represent appropriate biomarkers and targets. Here we describe and discuss these new concepts, highlighting that, thanks to multi-omics technologies, the identification of emerging diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers, such as miRNAs, and the subsequent development of new diagnostic/therapeutic algorithms could be facilitated. The latter, in turn, could facilitate the management of different MG phenotypes also in a personalized manner. Limitations and advantages are also reported.

Methods

Patients

This is a retrospective multi-center cohort study. Clinical data and serum samples of adult patients with a high index of suspicion for anti-AChR Ab-negative generalized MG were collected from 26 general hospitals in South Korea between January 2014 and January 2019. Data were entered into a standard case report form designed to record the clinical and laboratory features of the patients. Seronegative generalized MG was diagnosed based on 1) the clinical diagnosis of generalized MG, i.e. the presence of exertional weakness which may affect ocular, limb, axial, bulbar or respiratory muscles but not confined to ocular muscles, and 2) negative result for anti-AChR Ab by RIPA. The results of ancillary diagnostic tests such as low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) and pharmacological test (e.g. neostigmine) may support the diagnosis of MG, but the absence of abnormalities does not rule out the diagnosis considering their low sensitivity in MuSK MG.

Collected data were reviewed and assessed for inclusion by two authors (YN Kwon, YH Hong). If there is diagnostic uncertainty, additional data on the disease course and treatment response during clinical follow-up of at least 6 months were requested, and the final diagnosis was reassessed. Disease severity was evaluated by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification and the Myasthenia Gravis composite scale (MGCS). The ocular form at onset was defined as purely ocular manifestations within one month after the symptom onset. Patients with a final diagnosis other than MG in the initial cohort and those with AChR Ab-positive MG were used as disease control to evaluate the specificity of MuSK-ELISA test.

Serum samples were stored at − 80 °C at the central laboratory of the Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Medical Center. This study was approved by the local ethics committee of Seoul National University, Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Medical Center (IRB 16–2014–29). All patients provided written informed consents.

### Myasthenia gravis [^116iNGzG]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease caused by antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) or other AChR-related proteins in the postsynaptic muscle membrane. Localized or general muscle weakness is the predominant symptom and is induced by the antibodies. Patients are grouped according to the presence of antibodies, symptoms, age at onset and thymus pathology. Diagnosis is straightforward in most patients with typical symptoms and a positive antibody test, although a detailed clinical and neurophysiological examination is important in antibody-negative patients. MG therapy should be ambitious and aim for clinical remission or only mild symptoms with near-normal function and quality of life. Treatment should be based on MG subgroup and includes symptomatic treatment using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, thymectomy and immunotherapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are fast-acting treatments used for disease exacerbations, and intensive care is necessary during exacerbations with respiratory failure. Comorbidity is frequent, particularly in elderly patients. Active physical training should be encouraged.

### Myasthenia gravis [^113pkdFU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on myasthenia gravis:

- **Definition**: MG is an autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable muscle weakness which results from antibodies targeting the postsynaptic neuromuscular membrane.
- **Pathophysiology**: MG is caused by autoantibodies directed mainly against AChRs, muscle-specific kinase, and lipoprotein receptor-related peptide.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence and prevalence rate of MG is estimated at 0.53 cases per 100,000 person-years and 7.8 persons per 100,000 population, respectively.
- **Disease course**: Antibodies belonging to IgG1 and IgG3 subclass direct antibodies mainly against AChRs, which disrupt neuromuscular transmission causing ocular, oropharyngeal, limb, axial, and respiratory muscle weakness. Thymoma and myasthenia crisis may even cause death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Mortality associated with MG is about 5–14%.

### Clinical evaluation and management of myasthenia gravis [^115tAk4x]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a syndrome of fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness that worsens with use and improves with rest. Eye, facial, oropharyngeal, axial, and limb muscles may be involved in varying combinations and degrees of severity. Its etiology is heterogeneous, divided initially between those rare congenital myasthenic syndromes, which are genetic, and the bulk of MG, which is acquired and autoimmune. The autoimmune conditions are divided in turn between those that possess measurable serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and a smaller group that does not. The latter group includes those MG patients who have serum antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Therapeutic considerations differ for early-onset MG, late-onset MG, and MG associated with the presence of a thymoma. Most MG patients can be treated effectively, but there is still a need for more specific immunological approaches.

### Myasthenia gravis: subgroup classification and therapeutic strategies [^116Whhje]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that is characterised by muscle weakness and fatigue, is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor, muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients with myasthenia gravis should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated myasthenia gravis might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. Pyridostigmine is the preferred symptomatic treatment, and for patients who do not adequately respond to symptomatic therapy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and thymectomy are first-line immunosuppressive treatments. Additional immunomodulatory drugs are emerging, but therapeutic decisions are hampered by the scarcity of controlled studies. Long-term drug treatment is essential for most patients and must be tailored to the particular form of myasthenia gravis.

### Advances in the diagnosis of neuromuscular junction disorders [^117GLyBw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of the neuromuscular junction have a wide range of clinical presentations, which frequently poses a diagnostic challenge to evaluating clinicians. This article describes the tests used in the diagnosis of diseases of the neuromuscular junction, reviews the evidence supporting the use of each test, and proposes guidelines for their efficient utilization. A focused review of the literature was employed. Reports from four main categories of diagnostic tests (pharmacologic, electrodiagnostic, immunologic, and miscellaneous tests) were reviewed, and the sensitivity and specificity of each test in the diagnosis of specific neuromuscular junction diseases were examined. The clinical presentation determines which diagnostic tests should be utilized in individual cases of suspected neuromuscular junction disease. However, knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of each test can help to focus the diagnostic evaluation and maximize the diagnostic yield of each test.

### Electrophysiological testing is correlated with myasthenia gravis severity [^112tiQ6f]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Electrophysiological studies play an important role in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). The objectives of this study was to explore the correlation of jitter and decrement with various clinical symptoms and signs and disease severity.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of 75MG patients who attended the neuromuscular clinic from April 2013 to May 2014. We compared clinical characteristics between patients with high jitter (> 100µs) and decrement (> 10%), and patients with lower values to explore the correlations and optimal thresholds of jitter and decrement for different clinical features.

Results

High jitter and decrement values were associated with more severe disease, manifested by more frequent symptomatic bulbar and limb muscle weakness, more frequent ocular and limb muscle weakness on examination, higher quantitative MG score, and generalized disease.

Conclusions

The yield of the electrophysiological assessment in MG extends beyond disease diagnosis and correlates with disease severity and the presence of generalized disease. Muscle Nerve 56: 445–448, 2017.
