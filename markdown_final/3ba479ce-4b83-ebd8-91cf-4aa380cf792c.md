## Question

dose of ferrous sulfate for 6 year old with iron deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of ferrous sulfate for a 6-year-old with iron deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the child has iron deficiency anemia versus iron deficiency without anemia. Then, I should verify the recommended elemental iron dose range and whether it applies to a 6-year-old. Next, I will consider dosing frequency and absorption strategies, including hepcidin-mediated effects. After that, I should review duration of therapy and monitoring. Finally, I will check formulation choices, safety, and when to consider intravenous iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because treatment dosing differs between iron deficiency anemia and iron deficiency without anemia. For iron deficiency anemia, the standard pediatric dose is 2 to 6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, typically given in 1 to 3 divided doses for 3 to 6 months, whereas for iron deficiency without anemia, lower daily doses and shorter courses may suffice alongside dietary counseling, so I need to ensure I tailor the dose to the presence or absence of anemia and the child's weight [^40982441] [^40982441].

> Wait, let me verify the age applicability of the 2–6 mg/kg/day range. The AAFP guidance explicitly addresses infants and children, and a 6-year-old falls within the pediatric population for whom this dosing is recommended, so the 2–6 mg/kg/day elemental iron range is appropriate for a 6-year-old with iron deficiency anemia, with ferrous sulfate preferred over iron polysaccharide complex due to superior efficacy in nutritional anemia [^40982441] [^778ecaed].

> I should confirm the practical calculation. Ferrous sulfate contains about 20% elemental iron, so a 20 kg child would receive roughly 40–120 mg elemental iron per day, which corresponds to about 200–600 mg of ferrous sulfate per day in divided doses. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with pediatric formulation strengths and safety ceilings before finalizing the exact milligram amount, but the elemental iron target of 2–6 mg/kg/day is the key clinical anchor [^0f63a457].

> Next, I should review dosing frequency and absorption. Traditional teaching favored divided doses on an empty stomach, but newer data show that once-daily dosing can be effective and may improve adherence, and alternate-day dosing in adults can increase fractional absorption by bypassing hepcidin-mediated inhibition. Let me consider that pediatric data are less definitive, so while I can start with once-daily dosing, I should remain open to splitting if adherence or tolerability is problematic and monitor response accordingly [^fa92b80f] [^bde6cc85] [^daad4201].

> I need to ensure duration and monitoring are correct. The typical course is 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin to replete iron stores, with a hemoglobin rise of about 1 g/dL expected within 2–4 weeks. If there is inadequate response, I should double-check adherence, ongoing blood loss, malabsorption, or alternate diagnoses, and consider referral or intravenous iron if oral therapy fails despite good adherence [^40982441] [^586f90e2].

> Let me think about formulation and safety. Liquid ferrous sulfate allows flexible weight-based dosing, but tablets are acceptable if the child can swallow them and the dose is adjusted to deliver the correct elemental iron amount. I should confirm that iron is kept out of reach because accidental overdose is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6, and I should counsel on gastrointestinal side effects and strategies to improve tolerability such as taking with a small amount of food or using vitamin C to enhance absorption, while avoiding calcium, PPIs, or antacids close to dosing [^0f63a457] [^17454bc9] [^2bcd92de].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate beyond oral iron. Intravenous iron is reasonable for failure of oral therapy, malabsorption, chronic inflammatory conditions with high hepcidin, or when rapid repletion is needed. Pediatric data support ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose as options, with ferric carboxymaltose allowing single or few infusions in many cases, though I need to ensure appropriate pediatric dosing and safety monitoring if I go this route [^ecfa2708] [^1b68a1e4].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: for a 6-year-old with iron deficiency anemia, prescribe ferrous sulfate at 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, typically as a single daily dose or divided into two doses if needed for tolerability, for a total of 3 months after normalization of hemoglobin, with reassessment of hemoglobin at 2–4 weeks to confirm an adequate response. If the child has iron deficiency without anemia, use a lower daily dose with dietary counseling and shorter duration, and adjust based on follow-up labs and clinical context [^40982441] [^40982441] [^586f90e2].

---

For a 6-year-old with iron deficiency, the recommended dose of ferrous sulfate is **2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron** [^40982441], given once daily or divided into two doses for 3 months [^6ff026bf]. Start at the lower end and titrate to effect, monitoring hemoglobin and ferritin at 4 weeks [^586f90e2]. If not tolerated, consider alternate-day dosing or switching to a different oral iron formulation [^73dba1e6]; reserve IV iron for severe intolerance or nonresponse [^ecfa2708].

---

## Recommended dose and administration

- **Standard dose**: 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron [^40982441], given once daily or divided into two doses [^6ff026bf].
- **Duration**: Treat for 3 months [^40982441] to replenish iron stores and normalize hemoglobin.
- **Formulation**: Liquid ferrous sulfate is preferred for accurate dosing and palatability; tablets may be used if the child can swallow them [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

- **AAFP guidelines**: 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron is the most effective oral iron supplementation for pediatric iron deficiency anemia [^6ff026bf].
- **RCT evidence**: Low-dose ferrous sulfate (3 mg/kg/day) is effective and well tolerated in young children with nutritional iron deficiency anemia [^fa92b80f].
- **Systematic review**: Moderate-dose iron supplements are more effective than low-dose at improving hemoglobin and ferritin, but all doses improve outcomes [^3337928e].

---

## Factors influencing dosing

Several factors influence **ferrous sulfate dosing** in children:

| **Factor** | **Impact on dosing** |
|-|-|
| Age and weight | Dose is weight-based; older children may require higher total doses but same per-kilogram dosing [^40982441] |
| Severity of anemia | Severe anemia may require higher doses within the recommended range [^notfound] |
| Gastrointestinal tolerance | Poor tolerance may necessitate lower doses, alternate-day dosing, or switching formulations [^73dba1e6] |
| Dietary habits | Vitamin C enhances absorption; calcium and dairy inhibit it [^2bcd92de] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure **effective treatment** and prevent complications:

- **Hemoglobin response**: Expect a 1 g/dL rise in hemoglobin within 4 weeks [^a06e018d]; adjust dose if response is inadequate [^a06e018d].
- **Ferritin levels**: Monitor to confirm repletion of iron stores [^40982441].
- **Adverse effects**: Watch for gastrointestinal upset, constipation, or dark stools; adjust dosing or formulation as needed [^1d3a5465].

---

## Alternative treatments

If ferrous sulfate is not tolerated or is ineffective, consider:

- **Alternate-day dosing**: May improve tolerability and absorption due to reduced hepcidin-mediated inhibition [^bde6cc85].
- **Different oral formulations**: Ferrous fumarate or ferrous gluconate are alternatives [^2bcd92de].
- **Intravenous iron**: Reserved for severe intolerance, malabsorption, or failure of oral therapy [^ecfa2708].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Overdose risk**: Keep iron products out of reach; accidental overdose is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 [^17454bc9].
- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Common but usually manageable; consider dose adjustment or formulation change if severe [^1d3a5465].
- **Drug interactions**: Calcium, antacids, and PPIs reduce absorption; separate dosing by at least 2 hours [^5cce280b].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial dose**: 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron, once daily or divided into two doses [^40982441].
- **Duration**: 3 months [^40982441].
- **Monitoring**: Hemoglobin and ferritin at 4 weeks; adjust dose as needed [^586f90e2].
- **Alternatives**: Alternate-day dosing, different formulations, or IV iron if oral therapy fails [^73dba1e6] [^ecfa2708].

---

The recommended ferrous sulfate dose for a 6-year-old with iron deficiency is **2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron** for 3 months, with dose adjustments based on response and tolerability [^40982441].

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^cc96f6fd]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common micronutrient deficiency globally, with children at particular risk. Among children aged 6–59 months, approximately half of the 273 million cases of anaemia in 2011 were estimated to be due to ID. ID is furthermore a key risk factor for cognitive impairment, impaired immune function and decreased capacity for physical activity.

WHO recommends daily oral iron supplementation for all children in regions with a prevalence of anaemia ≥ 40%. In malaria-endemic settings, iron supplementation is recommended in conjunction with measures to prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. These recommendations are supported by prior meta-analyses establishing the benefits of iron supplementation in the treatment of anaemia along with safety in the presence of malaria control programmes. However, prior meta-analyses have not investigated the optimal delivery of iron supplementation among children. The 2016 WHO guidelines therefore highlight the need for additional evidence regarding the optimal schedule, duration and dose of iron supplementation, as well as the efficacy of iron supplementation in the presence of cosupplemented micronutrients.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of oral iron supplementation among children and adolescents aged < 20 years and compared the impact of interventions by schedule, duration, dose and cointerventions. Haematologic, anthropometric, infectious and developmental outcomes were included to assess both safety and efficacy.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^40982441]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for iron deficiency anemia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to offer iron-rich foods in infants and children with iron deficiency without anemia. Offer oral iron supplementation of 2–6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron given 1–3 times daily for 3–6 months for the treatment of iron deficiency with anemia.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^c8af318c]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

Meta-analysis was conducted for outcomes reported by four or more trials. We used inverse-variance weighted random-effects meta-analysis to account for underlying differences in the trial populations. Binary outcomes were summarised using risk ratios, prevalence ratios (PR) or rate ratios with 95% CIs. Continuous measures on the same scale were presented using mean differences, and measures reported on different scales using standardised mean differences (SMD). For ferritin, geometric means or medians were included when arithmetic means were not reported. Heterogeneity of effects was measured using the I² statistic. We assessed effect modification using univariate meta-regression for prespecified supplementation variables: schedule (1–2 times/week; 3–7 times/week), duration (1–3 months; 4–6 months; ≥ 7 months), dose (age-adjusted tertiles; see online supplemental appendix 3) and cointerventions (zinc; vitamin A). In secondary analyses, we explored effect modification by baseline anaemia (all anaemic; all non-anaemic; mixed population of anaemic and non-anaemic; missing baseline anaemia data), child age (0–5 months; 6–23 months; 2–4 years; 5–11 years; 12–19 years), child sex (all female; all male; mixed female and male; missing baseline sex data), WHO region (Africa; Americas; Eastern Mediterranean; Europe; South-East Asia; Western Pacific) and iron formulation (ferrous sulfate; ferrous fumarate; other or unspecified). We conducted multivariate meta-regression to investigate collinearity between potential effect modifiers. Small study effects were assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test for all outcomes reported by ≥ 10 iron intervention groups. Sensitivity analyses correcting for small study effects were conducted using trim and fill.

Role of the funder

The funder was not involved in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation or manuscript writing. The corresponding author had access to all data in the study and assumes full responsibility for the accuracy of the results.

Patient and public involvement

Our prior clinical and research experiences with iron-deficient paediatric patients led us to develop the idea for this study. No patients were involved in the meta-analysis design or conduct, though we aim to present findings of clinical relevance to patients. We anticipate that the results of this study would be of interest to clinicians and health policy makers globally, which could in turn contribute to improved patient care.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bba815d5]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts remain the mainstay of oral iron supplementation. Their high efficacy is offset by poor tolerability and reduced compliance, which sparked the development of alternative oral iron supplements. Recent studies with ferrous sulfate provided new insights on optimal dosage and frequency. Additional adequately powered RCT are required to address open questions on efficacy, side effects, optimal dosage and frequency of different types of oral iron supplements for selected groups of patients. As none of the old or new oral iron formulations has shown non-inferiority versus intravenous iron, comparisons against the gold standard (ferrous sulfate) would be more informative. The effects of oral iron supplements on hepcidin should also be investigated in animal models and clinical studies. Based on current knowledge, the choice between iron formulations should depend on the individual's iron status, tolerance, absorption capacity, and specific therapeutic goals.

### Randomized, controlled trial of single versus 3-times-daily ferrous sulfate drops for treatment of anemia [^9946a1aa]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Adherence to treatment of iron-deficiency anemia often is poor in both developed and developing countries. The current standard therapy is ferrous sulfate drops (or syrup) administered 3 times daily. It is possible that adherence would improve with a single-dose daily treatment regimen. We compared the use of single versus 3-times-daily ferrous sulfate drops, at the same total iron dose, on treatment of anemia in infants.

Methods

To obtain a large enough cohort of anemic subjects, we performed the study in rural Ghana. Using a prospective, randomized, controlled design, we studied 557 anemic children (age range: 6–24 months; hemoglobin values: 70–99 g/L). One group (n = 280) received ferrous sulfate drops once daily (40 mg elemental iron), and the control group (n = 277) received ferrous sulfate drops 3 times per day (total dose, 40 mg elemental iron). Treatment lasted for 2 months. Hemoglobin and serum ferritin values were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.

Results

Successful treatment of anemia (hemoglobin > 100 g/L) occurred in 61% of the single-dose and in 56% of the 3-times-daily group. Geometric mean ferritin levels increased significantly in each group from baseline to the final visit. Side effects were minimal and similar between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

A single versus a 3-times-daily dose of ferrous sulfate drops over 2 months resulted in a similar rate of successful treatment of anemia, without side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the use of a single-dose daily regimen to treat anemia. Although not examined in the current study, use of a single-dose daily regimen may improve adherence to treatment of anemia in infants.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia: a survey of pediatric hematology / oncology specialists [^10b402a9]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is the most common hematologic condition in children and adolescents in the United States (US). No prior reports have described the management of IDA by a large cohort of pediatric hematology/oncology specialists.

Procedure

A 20-question electronic survey that solicited responses to two hypothetical cases of IDA was sent to active members of the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) in the US.

Results

Of 1,217 recipients, 398 (32.7%) reported regularly treating IDA and completed the survey. In a toddler with nutritional IDA, 15% (N = 61) of respondents reported ordering no diagnostic test beyond a complete blood count. Otherwise, wide variability in laboratory testing was reported. For treatment, most respondents would prescribe ferrous sulfate (N = 335, 84%) dosed at 6 mg/kg/day (N = 248, 62%) divided twice daily (N = 272, 68%). The recommended duration of iron treatment after resolution of anemia and normalized serum ferritin varied widely from 0 to 3 months. For an adolescent with heavy menstrual bleeding and IDA, most respondents recommended ferrous sulfate (N = 327, 83%), with dosing based on the number of tablets daily. For IDA refractory to oral treatment, intravenous iron therapy was recommended most frequently, 48% (N = 188) using iron sucrose, 17% (N = 68) ferric gluconate, and 15% (N = 60) low molecular weight iron dextran.

Conclusion

The approach to diagnosis and treatment of IDA in childhood was widely variable among responding ASPHO members. Given the lack of an evidence base to guide clinical decision making, further research investigating IDA management is needed.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia [^99564ccb]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^d9d50c24]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2006 recommendation on screening for iron deficiency anemia.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the association between change in iron status as a result of intervention and improvement in child health outcomes, as well as screening for and treatment of iron deficiency anemia with oral iron formulations, in children ages 6 to 24 months.

Population

This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia. It does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia.

Recommendation

The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 24 months. (I statement).

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines? [^8157aa96]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Approximately, one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are because of iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy is still an appropriate and effective treatment.

Recent Findings

Numerous guidelines are available, but none go into detail about therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be best treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency or in regard to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

Summary

The study points to major issues to be considered in revisions of future guidelines for the true optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, when to start and when to stop treatment, when to follow-up for relapse, which dosage and type of therapy should be recommended or not recommended, and if some patients should not be treated.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^984ab28b]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for iron deficiency anemia — children ages 6 to 24 months: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for iron deficiency anemia in children ages 6 to 24 months (I statement). This recommendation applies to children ages 6 to 24 months living in the United States who are asymptomatic for iron deficiency anemia and does not apply to children younger than age 6 months or older than 24 months, children who are severely malnourished, children who were born prematurely or with low birth weight, or children who have symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. The rationale notes that the estimated prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in children ages 1 to 5 years in the United States is ~1% to 2%.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^896c53cc]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 4: Avoid packed red blood cell transfusion for asymptomatic children with IDA and no active bleeding.

The fourth ASH-ASPHO recommendation advises against the transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in asymptomatic children with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) with no evidence of hemodynamic instability or active bleeding. IDA is the most common cause of anemia across all age groups, and it affects 2 billion individuals worldwide, including 2 million in the United States. IDA usually develops over time (ie, chronic process), and most patients are asymptomatic, even those with very low hemoglobin. The 2 key steps in managing IDA in children are (1) initiating iron replacement therapy by oral or intravenous routes, which usually leads to a rapid increase in hemoglobin levelsand (2) treating the underlying etiologies (eg, restricting excessive cow's milk intake for toddlers or starting hormonal contraceptive therapy for adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding). Ferrous sulfate is a frequently prescribed oral iron formulation divided into 2 or 3 daily doses, or as a low-dose once-per-day regimen. Often ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated because of adverse gastrointestinal effects. Furthermore, there has been growing evidence to support the utility and the benefits of using alternate-day oral iron supplementation among adults with IDA, especially women. Several studies, including recent randomized controlled trials, reported evidence to suggest comparable hemoglobin response with higher fractional iron absorption and better tolerability using an alternate-day regimen compared with a twice-per-day regimen; there are no similar data in the current literature on pediatric IDA, and future studies are needed to address this research question. Recent studies have also reported data supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron replacement in children and teenswho have demonstrated a poor response to oral iron formulations.

Interventions

The IHAT powder clinical batch was manufactured under cGMP ICH Q7 rules by Sterling Pharma Solutions (Dudley Cramlington, UK). Pharmaceutical grade ferrous sulphate monohydrate and sucrose (placebo) were sourced by Capsugel-Lonza.

In line with the WHO and Gambian guidelines for iron supplementation in this age group the ferrous sulphate dose was 12.5 mg elemental Fe (38 mg ferrous sulphate monohydrate) once a day. The iron dose for IHAT was the anticipated dose with comparable iron-bioavailability: 20 mg elemental Fe (equivalent to 74 mg IHAT powder), determined taking into account IHAT's relative bioavailability to ferrous sulphate based on data from single-dose iron bioavailability studies in adults (see full protocol in Supplementary Data S1).

### Management of iron deficiency in children, adults, and pregnant individuals: evidence-based and expert consensus recommendations [^d26ff216]. The Lancet: Haematology (2025). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency worldwide. Oral iron is often recommended as first-line treatment, but there is no consensus on the optimal formulation, dosing strategy, or which patients should be treated preferentially with intravenous iron. To address these challenges, the Iron Consortium at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) convened an international panel of 26 experts in haematology, primary care, paediatrics, obstetrics, gastroenterology, cancer, and patient advocacy among its members. This panel was supplemented by insights from a four-person patient focus group to develop current recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The panel developed clinically relevant questions in five priority topic areas, a systematic literature search was performed, and studies meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables for recommendation development. Evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations were made through a structured anonymous consensus voting process at an in-person meeting in Portland, OR, USA, hosted by OHSU on Feb 16–17, 2024. The expert panel made seven evidence-based recommendations for three demographic groups with iron deficiency: non-pregnant adults, pregnant individuals, and infants, children, and adolescents. Expert opinions supported the recommendations on 21 aspects of care for which there is insufficient evidence. This Review provides evidence-based recommendations and expert consensus on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of iron deficiency, detailing best practices for oral and intravenous iron repletion across diverse patient populations.

### Effect of low-dose ferrous sulfate vs iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in young children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia: a randomized clinical trial [^fa92b80f]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) affects millions of persons worldwide, and is associated with impaired neurodevelopment in infants and children. Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly prescribed oral iron despite iron polysaccharide complex possibly being better tolerated.

Objective

To compare the effect of ferrous sulfate with iron polysaccharide complex on hemoglobin concentration in infants and children with nutritional IDA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind, superiority randomized clinical trial of infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional IDA (assessed by history and laboratory criteria) that was conducted in an outpatient hematology clinic at a US tertiary care hospital from September 2013 through November 2015; 12-week follow-up ended in January 2016.

Interventions

Three mg/kg of elemental iron once daily as either ferrous sulfate drops or iron polysaccharide complex drops for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included complete resolution of IDA (defined as hemoglobin concentration > 11 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume > 70 fL, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent > 25 pg, serum ferritin level > 15 ng/mL, and total iron-binding capacity < 425 μg/dL at the 12-week visit), changes in serum ferritin level and total iron-binding capacity, adverse effects.

Results

Of 80 randomized infants and children (median age, 22 months; 55% male; 61% Hispanic white; 40 per group), 59 completed the trial (28 [70%] in ferrous sulfate group; 31 [78%] in iron polysaccharide complex group). From baseline to 12 weeks, mean hemoglobin increased from 7.9 to 11.9 g/dL (ferrous sulfate group) vs 7.7 to 11.1 g/dL (iron complex group), a greater difference of 1.0 g/dL (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.6 g/dL; P < .001) with ferrous sulfate (based on a linear mixed model). Proportion with a complete resolution of IDA was higher in the ferrous sulfate group (29% vs 6%; P = 0.04). Median serum ferritin level increased from 3.0 to 15.6 ng/mL (ferrous sulfate) vs 2.0 to 7.5 ng/mL (iron complex) over 12 weeks, a greater difference of 10.2 ng/mL (95% CI, 6.2 to 14.1 ng/mL; P < .001) with ferrous sulfate. Mean total iron-binding capacity decreased from 501 to 389 μg/dL (ferrous sulfate) vs 506 to 417 μg/dL (iron complex) (a greater difference of -50 μg/dL [95% CI, -86 to -14 μg/dL] with ferrous sulfate; P < .001). There were more reports of diarrhea in the iron complex group than in the ferrous sulfate group (58% vs 35%, respectively; P = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among infants and children aged 9 to 48 months with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia, ferrous sulfate compared with iron polysaccharide complex resulted in a greater increase in hemoglobin concentration at 12 weeks. Once daily, low-dose ferrous sulfate should be considered for children with nutritional iron-deficiency anemia.

### Use of a probiotic to enhance iron absorption in a randomized trial of pediatric patients presenting with iron deficiency [^224ea66d]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of low dose ferrous sulfate for the treatment of iron deficiency and if the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v) enhances treatment.

Study Design

This randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial of the treatment of iron deficiency in children compared the use of low-dose ferrous sulfate (1–3 mg/kg/day), with or without probiotic (LP299v).

Results

Serum ferritin level increased in all children from a baseline of 23.7 ng/mL to 45.4 ng/mL after 6–8 weeks of treatment. There was no significant difference in the increase in serum ferritin in children taking the probiotic LP299v compared with controls (23.2 vs 20.0 ng/mL, respectively). Additionally, an increase in ferritin level was not significantly associated with probiotic use when controlling for other factors, including child weight and dosing. Overall, the treatments were well-tolerated, with mild side effects.

Conclusions

Treatment with low-dose ferrous sulfate is well-tolerated and effective in correcting iron deficiency in children. However, the probiotic LP299v did not enhance treatment. Further attention should examine the dose-response effect in children, including an alternate day dosing schedule.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^12ab6b02]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) scope and evidence on early detection and treatment focus on young children ages 6 to 24 months and show limited direct evidence. No studies directly evaluated the effectiveness of screening for iron deficiency anemia in asymptomatic children ages 6 to 24 months with reported health outcomes. In addition, no new studies of oral iron treatment for iron deficiency anemia in this age group were found. The USPSTF previously concluded there was poor evidence of interventions improving health outcomes in asymptomatic children, and in the current review no studies applicable to the U.S. population demonstrated an association between change in iron status due to intervention and improvement in child health outcomes.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^3337928e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Studies of longer duration were more likely to have a lower prevalence of baseline anaemia (online supplemental appendix 5). As a result, the apparently diminishing impacts of iron with increased duration were entirely explained on control for baseline anaemia (online supplemental appendix 6). Some prior studies have shown that impacts of iron on haemoglobin persist for several months after the cessation of supplementation, though the period of durability likely depends on the availability of dietary iron, burden of infection and degree of blood loss experienced by the population. The findings of this study support the current WHO recommendation of a 3-month course of iron supplementation, though a longer duration may be considered in order to maintain haemoglobin levels.

For all ages, the lowest dose tertile of iron received less than the WHO recommended daily supplement (10–12.5 mg/day for ages 6–23 months, 30 mg/day for ages 24–59 months, 30–60 mg/day for ages 5–12 years). Moderate age-adjusted doses appeared to be more effective than lower doses at increasing haemoglobin, but all doses effectively improved outcomes, even doses below current WHO recommendations. Interestingly, more frequent supplementation, longer durations of supplementation and higher doses each were associated with greater increases in serum ferritin. These novel findings can inform the design of future supplementation programmes, suggesting that flexibility is possible depending on specific aims.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^953b40f8]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Treatment and prevention in young children — iron deficiency anemia is usually treated with oral iron; the usual dose in infants and young children is 3 to 6 mg/kg of elemental iron per day in 2 to 3 divided doses. According to the Institute of Medicine, the Recommended Dietary Allowance for iron in infants ages 7 to 12 months is 11 mg per day, and in children ages 1 to 3 years it is 7 mg per day; nonheme iron may be less well absorbed than heme iron such that the iron requirement may be almost twice as much in children who eat a purely vegetarian diet. Fortified breads and grain products (such as cereal) are also good sources of iron for young children eating solid foods, and iron-fortified formula is another source of iron for infants; federally regulated iron fortification of food products in the United States began in 1941, and more than 50% of the iron in the US food supply comes from iron-fortified cereal grain products.

### An assessment for diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for management of pediatric iron defficiency anemia in Saudi arabia: a crossectional study [^47d5dd13]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

In regard IDA treatment, elicited responses indicate that over half of our study participants base their therapeutic decision on their previous experience than on evidence. Almost all published literature recommends a dose of 3–6 mg/kg/day of iron as an efficient IDA treatment. However despite using 6 mg/kg/day being the overwhelming preference for pediatric hematology oncology specialists, there is no evidence base for such choice. Many studies have shown treatment success with low dosages. A randomized trial in Ghana compared patients to 40 mg of iron, or almost 3 mg/kg/day either as a single dosage or in three divided dosages, found similar success in both groups. Another study including 90 elderly patients compared three daily doses of iron (15 mg, 50 mg, and 150 mg). After 60 days, in all three groups, the increases in Hb concentration and SF were similar. This suggests that low oral dosage of iron treatment could be as effective as high dosage. Furthermore, in the lowest dose groups, the rates of dropout and adverse effects were lower. However, the optimal duration for oral iron supplementation has not been specified yet but previous studies recommend 3–6 months supplementation. Canadian Pediatric Surveillance Program recommends 6 mg/kg/day of oral iron dose for 3–4 months. It has been suggested that Iron stores are refilled after continuation of iron therapy for 2–3 months.

Responses of participants showed a marked variability regarding the duration of continued oral iron treatment when the patient's Hb, MCV and ferritin became normal. This is comparable to Powers et al. study. However, in this study, 50.3% of respondents recommended patient's daily dose should be based on weight and 49.7% based on number of tablets compared with 64 and 36% respectively in that study. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved many safe and effective parenteral iron preparations for adult patients and children who could not responded to oral iron therapy, only 14% of participants in the present study recommended this course of action. Approximately, of 170 iron therapies used to treat and prevent IDA, ferrous sulfate was most effective and least cost compared with other oral iron treatments. Currently, it is the most frequent treatment for IDA's patients.

### An assessment for diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for management of pediatric iron defficiency anemia in Saudi arabia: a crossectional study [^e290109d]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

In case scenario 2, majority of respondents recommended treatment with ferrous sulfate (76.2%) divided into two daily doses (62.6%). While 50.3% of respondents reported that patient's daily dose should be based on weight, 49.7% recommended that dose should be based on number of tablets. For participants who reported that the daily dose will be based on the number of tablets, approximately 42.5% reported that they will choose 1 iron tablet daily, 53.4% reported that they will choose 2–3 iron tablets daily, and 4.1% reported other numbers of tablets. In terms of those who recommended daily dose should be based on the weight, 32.4% recommended a 2–3 mg/kg dose, 58.1% recommended a 4–5 mg/kg dose and 6.7% indicated other doses; Table 3.

Table 3
Responses of participants to case 2

In continuation to the case scenario 2, respondents were asked regarding parenteral iron treatment they would recommend in case there is no response to oral iron. Most (42.9%) respondents indicated IV iron dextran. While 32.7% of prefer IV iron saccharate, 13.4% reported that they would continue oral iron therapy. Moreover, 10.9% of respondents specified some other treatments in the free text comment instead of listed options, including seeking the advice of dietitian, refer to hematologist, and admission for observation.

Correct responses on different questions related to diagnosis and management of IDA are represented in Table 4. Participants were less likely to consider no other laboratory test necessary beyond CBC 23(15.6%). However, SF had the highest proportion of the preferred lab tests; 71.2%.

Existing evidence

Two systematic reviews were recently commissioned by the USPSTF and the UK NSC to update their 2006 and 2012 recommendations respectively, based on the latest evidence available.

The USPSTF review included trials and control observational studies assessing screening in children between six and 24 months of age conducted in developed countries, as well as the effectiveness and harms of routine iron supplementation, and the association between a change in iron status and improvement in child health outcomes. Studies conducted in resource-poor populations were excluded. Of note, the focus was on 'studies that involved iron supplementation and treatment regimens commonly used in clinical practice in the US'. The literature search was conducted up to August 2014 with the aim to identify new studies to update the previous USPSTF systematic reviews. Review authors identified ten new studies addressing routine iron supplementation (which is beyond the scope of this summary), and no new study addressing any of the key questions established on screening for IDA. An update of the search was conducted in June 2018 and identified one study, but this study did not address the key questions on IDA screening. For each of the key question below, we therefore summarized the available evidence from studies that were identified from the previous USPSTF systematic reviews.

The UK NSC structured the review in four key questions to look at the evidence supporting IDA screening in children under five years of age. The review authors included different types of studies for each key question, but only included studies with children from the UK or other similar population. The literature search was conducted up to March 2017.

Limited high-quality evidence supports the management of iron deficiency anemia (IDA). To assess our institutional performance in this area, we retrospectively reviewed IDA treatment practices in 195 consecutive children referred to our center from 2006 to mid-2010. The majority of children were ≤ 4 years old (64%) and had nutritional IDA (74%). In 11- to 18-year-old patients (31%), the primary etiology was menorrhagia (42%). Many were referred directly to the emergency department and/or prescribed iron doses outside the recommended range. Poor medication adherence and being lost-to-follow-up were common. Substantial improvements are required in the management of IDA.

Deferasirox, the only oral iron chelator approved in the US and Canada, achieved a pediatric label indication down to 2 years of age. FDA-mandated post-marketing safety surveillance in children under age 6 is ongoing. We wish to raise a non-safety-related concern with deferasirox chelation in very young children (2–5 years old). Specifically, the circumstances required for reliable daily ingestion of deferasirox do not mesh well with the developmental characteristics common in young children, which may limit adherence and cause parental distress. We review developmental challenges associated with oral chelation in this age group and provide suggestions to improve adherence in this population.

### How I approach iron deficiency with and without anemia [^0690b0cf]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia remains a common referral to the pediatric hematology-oncology subspecialist. Improved understanding of iron homeostasis, including the effects of the regulatory hormone hepcidin, recent adult and pediatric clinical trial data, as well as the availability of safer formulations of intravenous iron, have resulted in additional considerations when making treatment recommendations in such patients. Young children and adolescent females remain the most commonly affected groups, but children with complex medical or chronic inflammatory conditions including comorbid gastrointestinal disorders also require special consideration.

### An assessment for diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for management of pediatric iron defficiency anemia in Saudi arabia: a crossectional study [^00156259]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a global public health issue that affect more than 2 billion individuals worldwide. However evidence for optimal management of IDA is lacking.

Methods

To assess the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic modalities for pediatric IDA employed by physicians in a major public healthcare facility in Riyadh, a validated questionnaire including demographic data and patient case-scenarios related to diagnosis and treatment of IDA was employed. Robust regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with overall score of participants.

Results

Of the 166 physicians surveyed 147(88.6%) were included in the study. Wide variability was observed in IDA diagnosis and therapy practises. For nutritional IDA, only 15.6% recommended no other laboratory tests in addition to CBC. The majority preferred treatment with ferrous sulfate (77.6%) divided into two doses (57.1%), but the total daily elemental iron doses varied widely from 2 to 6 mg/kg. For intravenous iron, 42.9% recommended iron dextran, 32.7% iron sucrose, and 13.4% would continue oral iron. Of all assessed factors, median score was significantly highest in pediatric hematologists compared with pediatricians, family medicine specialists and GPs; p = 0.007, and those work in tertiary care compared with those in primary care; p = 0.043. However, in multivariate robust regression analysis, overall score was only significantly associated with professional qualification [pediatric hematologist β = 13.71,95%CI 2.48–24.95, p = 0.017; pediatrician β = 1.77,95%C (− 6.05–9.59, p = 0.66; family medicine β = 2.66,95%CI-4.30–9.58, p = 0.45 compared with general practitioner].

Conclusion

Wide variations exist among physicians in diagnosis and treatment of pediatric IDA. Intervention programs and national guidelines are urgently needed.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults [^79dd9f29]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment of IDA

We recommend that IRT should not be deferred while awaiting investigations for IDA unless colonoscopy is imminent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that the initial treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of ferrous sulphate, fumarate or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
Limited transfusion of packed red cells may on occasion be required to treat symptomatic IDA, in which case IRT is still necessary post-transfusion (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that patients should be monitored in the first 4 weeks for an Hb response to oral iron, and treatment should be continued for a period of around 3 months after normalisation of the Hb level, to ensure adequate repletion of the marrow iron stores (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that parenteral iron should be considered when oral iron is contraindicated, ineffective or not tolerated. This consideration should be at any early stage if oral IRT is judged unlikely to be effective (see the Treatment section), and/or the correction of IDA is particularly urgent (evidence quality — high, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
There is insufficient evidence to support invasive investigation in non-anaemic iron deficiency unless there are additional indications (see the Definitions section), but periodic blood count monitoring is suggested (evidence quality — low, consensus — 92%, statement strength — weak).
After the restoration of Hb and iron stores with IRT, we recommend that the blood count should be monitored periodically (perhaps every 6 months initially) to detect recurrent IDA (evidence quality — very low, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

The treatment of iron deficiency aims to (i) restore normal circulating Hb levels, (ii) replenish body iron stores, (iii) improve quality of life and (iv) improve physiological function. Successful IRT should achieve all of these outcomes. An algorithm providing an overview of the treatment of IDA is shown in figure 3, and the elements of this are discussed in more detail below.

### Prevention of iron deficiency in infants and toddlers | AAFP… [^9bc69a19]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

12 Yet, exclusive breastfeeding after four to six months puts infants at risk for iron deficiency. Therefore, some form of dietary iron supplement that provides 1 mg elemental iron per kg per day is recommended for term infants starting at four 22, 23 to six 12, 20 months of age. Iron-fortified cereal can help meet this requirement 24; however, many cereal-fed infants still develop iron deficiency anemia.
25. To prevent iron deficiency, another option is a daily oral iron supplement, using ferrous sulfate drops 26 or infant vitamin drops with iron. Vitamin drops contain 10 mg of elemental iron per dropper, which is the RDA for children six months to six years of age. 26, 27 Iron supplementation via drops or iron-fortified cereal should be continued throughout the period of breastfeeding. Breastfed preterm and low-birth-weight infants require supplementation at a dosage of 2 mg of oral elemental iron per kg per day, starting at two to four weeks of age.

26 Infants weighing less than 1, 500 g need higher dosages. 12 All supplemental iron preparations, especially those for adults, should be stored out of the reach of children to prevent fatal poisonings. Low-iron formulas place infants at risk for iron deficiency anemia while offering no advantage over standard iron-fortified formulas with respect to gastrointestinal side effects. Other preventive measures for toddlers include encouraging a diversified diet rich in sources of iron and vitamin C, continuing use of cereals fortified with iron instead of more advertised cereals, avoiding excessive juice intake, and giving an iron-containing vitamin.
15. TREATMENT After a positive screening test for iron deficiency and a diagnosis confirmed by a therapeutic trial of iron, the infant or toddler should complete a course of iron therapy.

Elemental iron, at a dosage of 3 mg per kg, is given orally once daily before breakfast. 21, 26 Absorption is improved if it is ingested with a source of vitamin C, such as orange juice. Total length of treatment is three months, including the one-month therapeutic trial of iron. 26.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^73dba1e6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on management of iron deficiency anemia — best practice advice includes: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation. Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing. Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption. Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed. Intravenous iron formulations that can replace iron deficits with 1 or 2 infusions are preferred over those that require more than 2 infusions. All intravenous iron formulations have similar risks; true anaphylaxis is very rare. The vast majority of reactions to intravenous iron are complement activation–related pseudo-allergy (infusion reactions) and should be treated as such. Intravenous iron therapy should be used in individuals who have undergone bariatric procedures, particularly those that are likely to disrupt normal duodenal iron absorption, and have iron-deficiency anemia with no identifiable source of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^48f70d93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

Objective

To compare the effects of 2 treatment options on neurodevelopmental and laboratory outcomes in young children with nonanemic iron deficiency.

Study Design

A blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of children 1–3 years with nonanemic iron deficiency (hemoglobin ≥ 110 g/L, serum ferritin < 14 μg/L) was conducted in 8 primary care practices in Toronto, Canada. Interventions included ferrous sulfate or placebo for 4 months; all parents received diet advice. The primary outcome was the Early Learning Composite (ELC) using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (mean 100, SD 15). Secondary outcomes included serum ferritin. Measurements were obtained at baseline and 4 and 12 months. Sample size was calculated to detect a between-group difference of 6–7 points in ELC.

Results

At enrollment (n = 60), mean age was 24.2 (SD 7.4) months and mean serum ferritin was 10.0 (SD 2.4) μg/L. For ELC, the mean between-group difference at 4 months was 1.1 (95% CI -4.2 to 6.5) and at 12 months was 4.1 (95% CI -1.9 to 10.1). For serum ferritin, at 4 months, the mean between-group difference was 16.9 μg/L (95% CI 6.5 to 27.2), and no child randomized to ferrous sulfate had a serum ferritin < 14 μg/L (0% vs 31%, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

For young children with nonanemic iron deficiency, treatment options include oral iron and/or diet advice. We remain uncertain about which option is superior with respect to cognitive outcomes; however, adding ferrous sulfate to diet advice resulted in superior serum ferritin outcomes after 4 months. Shared decision-making between practitioners and parents may be considered when selecting either option.

### Are infants less than 6 months of age a neglected group for anemia prevention in low-income countries? [^24e57cd5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a major public health problem that affects over a third of the global population, causing 68 million disability-adjusted life years (nearly 9% of total). Anemia of any etiology increases the risk of child mortality and morbidity, and specifically iron deficiency (ID) anemia has been associated with harmful effects on cognitive and physical development and on the immune function of children. – Children less than 5 years of age, especially those living in low- and middle-income countries, have the highest frequency of anemia, and it is the only age group in which anemia prevalence increased from 1990 to 2010. In these countries, the etiology of anemia is often multifactorial, including a combination of nutritional deficiencies, genetic disorders, and infectious diseases, although ID remains the main cause of anemia globally. Prevention and treatment of ID are based on the administration of iron supplements and/or food fortification. However, for decades, iron supplementation in malaria-endemic areas has been controversial because of reports of increased risk of malaria episodes or severe morbidity in individuals receiving iron supplements. For this reason, previous World Health Organization (WHO) anemia prevention guidelines for children living in malaria-endemic areas recommended targeting only iron-deficient children; this implied screening children for ID, something logistically difficult in resource-limited settings. Moreover, available markers of ID have important limitations in the presence of infectious diseases and inflammation, both conditions highly prevalent in low-income settings.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^bde6cc85]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimal dosage and frequency of oral iron supplementation

The elemental iron content (actual amount of iron available for absorption) differs between commercial iron formulations (Table 1). Thus, the iron dosage needs to be adjusted. Oral supplementation typically starts with ferrous sulfate or other salts, each containing ~60–70 mg elemental iron. It has traditionally been recommended to take the supplement two or three times per day on an empty stomach, to reach a daily dose of ~200 mg elemental iron. Considering that only 10–20 mg of iron gets absorbed, this amount would be required to reach the target of increasing hemoglobin by 2 g/dL within 3–4 weeks. However, recent studies provided new insights on optimal dosing and frequency, challenging the need for multiple dosing per day. The studies were prompted by our understanding that iron intake triggers homeostatic responses aiming to prevent iron overload. These are orchestrated by hepcidin, which is induced in an iron-dependent manner to inhibit further iron absorption(Figure 2).

Thus, the effects of hepcidin on oral iron supplementation were first examined in an elegant pilot study with non-anemic iron-deficient young women. They were treated with various doses of ferrous sulfate in different schedules (twice per day, daily, or every second day). Ferrous sulfate was provided in three different iron isotopes, so that each participant served as her own control. The results showed that ingestion of ferrous sulfate at doses of 60 mg elemental iron or higher triggered induction of hepcidin for up to 24 h, which decreased fractional iron absorption from a subsequent dose the following day. Hepcidin levels returned to baseline after 48 h, restoring efficient iron absorption. These early data seem to disqualify the split dosing of ferrous sulfate two or three times per day, and even favor intermittent intake every second day versus daily dosing, to bypass the hepcidin blockade and increase fractional iron absorption.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^6d578d7e]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia and pre-anemic iron deficiency are the most frequent pathologies. The first line of treatment involves oral iron supplementation. The simplest, least expensive, and most commonly prescribed drug is ferrous sulfate, while other ferrous salts and ferric complexes with polysaccharides or succinylated milk proteins are also widely used. In recent years, novel iron formulations have been developed, such as the lipophilic iron donor ferric maltol, or nanoparticle encapsulated sucrosomial® iron. Oral iron supplementation is usually efficacious in correcting iron-deficiency anemia and replenishing iron stores but causes gastrointestinal side effects that reduce compliance. When oral iron supplementation is contraindicated, intravenous iron therapy can rapidly achieve therapeutic targets without gastrointestinal complications. Herein, we critically review literature on relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available oral iron supplements, and summarize recent data on optimal dosage and frequency.

### Interventions to treat pediatric iron deficiency anemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fc27513f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To perform comparative effectiveness and safety of interventions used to treat pediatric iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and to examine risk of bias and study sources of heterogeneity across the studies.

Study Design

We searched major medical databases from inception to June 26, 2023. Eligibility criteria were children 6 months to 18 years with IDA receiving one of three interventions (oral iron, intravenous [IV] iron, red blood cell [RBC] transfusion). Hemoglobin change-from-baseline and incidence of adverse events were our primary outcomes. Data were synthesized quantitatively and narratively. When possible, random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates. We used an indirect method to compare pooled estimates. Heterogeneity was examined using forest plots and the I² statistic.

Results

Of 2811 non-duplicate articles retrieved, 47 observational studies (4010 patients) were included. The pooled mean hemoglobin change-from-baseline favored IV iron compared with oral iron (26.66 g/L vs 22.08 g/L, difference = 4.58 g/L, 95% CI: -2.77, 11.93). There were limited data on RBC transfusion. The pooled incidence of adverse events was 7.30% (IV iron), 8.41% (oral iron), 12.02% (RBC transfusion). Risk of bias was low or moderate for most studies. Sources of heterogeneity identified included severity of IDA, age, adherence to WHO definition of IDA and follow-up time.

Conclusions

Both oral and IV iron are effective in treating IDA. Our findings suggest that IV iron may be more effective in increasing hemoglobin, within a shorter period of time, with a favorable safety profile and could be considered more often in pediatric practice. Further research comparing these two treatments directly is warranted.

### Intravenous iron therapy in pediatrics: who should get it and when is the right time? [^ecfa2708]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency anemia occurs most commonly in young children due to a low-iron diet and adolescent girls due to menstrual blood loss. However, children with gastrointestinal conditions such as intestinal failure, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and/or other chronic conditions, including chronic kidney disease and heart failure, also commonly have iron deficiency. Many patients with classic iron-deficiency anemia will improve with oral iron therapy. However, in children who have an incomplete response to oral iron, intravenous iron therapy is increasingly being used. Benefits of intravenous iron therapy include a rapid repletion of iron stores in addition to resolution of anemia, less gastrointestinal side effects, and relief for patients and families struggling with long-term iron supplementation. Indications for first-line therapy with intravenous iron in children with chronic conditions have also increased. Four intravenous iron formulations have approved indications in pediatrics, and many are increasingly used off-label in children as well. Here we discuss the indications and appropriate timing of intravenous iron therapy in children with a wide range of underlying etiologies.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^1d3a5465]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Tolerability and adverse effects of oral iron supplements

In general, the proper use of oral iron supplements is considered safe and does not cause severe adverse effects. However, it frequently triggers gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and mucosal injury, which may reduce compliance.

Ferrous salts

While efficacious in repletion of iron stores, ferrous sulfate and other ferrous salts often exhibit limited tolerability due to gastrointestinal side effects. Ferrous salts may also cause teeth staining and a metallic taste in the mouth, particularly with prolonged use in liquid form or when not properly diluted before ingestion. A systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the tolerability and adverse effects of ferrous sulfate versus placebo or versus intravenous iron in 43 RCT involving 6,831 adults. The use of ferrous sulfate significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal side effects versus placebo with an odds ratio of 2.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.74–3.08; P < 0.0001), and versus intravenous iron with an odds ratio of 3.05 (95% confidence interval: 2.07–4.48; P < 0.0001). There was no significant association between odds ratio and ferrous sulfate dose. Additionally, there was no evidence that slow-release ferrous sulfate formulations were tolerated better.

Ferric complexes

Although ferric iron supplements are generally thought to be better tolerated compared to ferrous ones, there are not many directly comparative studies. In the BESTIRON RCTand the trial with infants and children aged 9–48 months, there were more reported cases of diarrhea in patients receiving ferric polysaccharide than in those receiving ferrous sulfate, but there were no significant differences in combined post hoc gastrointestinal adverse effect profiles. Likewise, there were no differences in adverse effects between women with IDA treated with ferrous glycine sulfate or iron protein succinylate. In a recent crossover, double-blind RCT in healthy women of reproductive age, microencapsulated ferric saccharate showed a better tolerability profile compared to that of ferrous sulfate regarding the incidences of symptoms, numbers of complaints/symptoms, overall intensity, and total days with symptoms.

Regarding the use of ferrous sulfate PO in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. Maternal anemia increases the risk of low birth weight, premature delivery, and impaired cognitive and behavioral development. The ACOG recommends screening all pregnant women for anemia with a CBC in the first trimester and again at 24–28 weeks of gestation. The ACOG recommends low-dose iron supplementation starting in the first trimester to reduce the prevalence of maternal anemia at delivery. Oral iron preparations are the preferred first-line treatment for iron deficiency in pregancy.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^8271d660]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
Flowchart of expert opinion‐based treatment guidance for IRIDA patients. This figure outlines treatment strategies for IRIDA in children and adults, based on expert opinion. Children: For mild to moderate anaemia without previous oral iron therapy, start once‐daily oral elemental iron (3 mg/kg/day, compared to the 1 mg/kg/day usually used for iron deficiency anaemia), titrating up to a maximum of 10 mg/kg/day based on evidence from case series suggesting better responses with higher doses. Minimize concurrent intake with specific foods (e.g. dairy products and fibres) and medications (e.g. calcium supplements, antacids, proton pump inhibitors) to prevent insoluble complexes that reduce iron availability. Continue oral therapy for at least 3 months before considering IV iron therapy, as prolonged oral therapy may still be effective (Table S1). In iron deficiency anaemia, a 2‐g/dL Hb increase is expected within 4 weeks. If oral iron therapy proves ineffective (including previous attempts) or severe anaemia is present, initiate IV iron therapy at 15–20 mg/kg per dose, up to a maximum of 500 mg per dose. Monitoring recommendations are consistent with adult guidelines. Adults: In adults, IRIDA often presents with a mild(er) phenotype, causing diagnostic delays with subsequent prolonged oral iron therapy before the final diagnosis of IRIDA is established. Therefore, IV iron therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment. Avoid targeting Hb normalization to prevent excessively high ferritin levels. Regularly monitor phosphate levels (at least after two administrations) during FCM therapy due to the risk of hypophosphataemia. Assessing the total iron deficit is not applicable for IRIDA patients, as it is an iron distribution disorder. *Reference intervals and definitions are age‐dependent; severe anaemia is defined according to the WHO guidelines. **Dosages are not applicable for neonates. **Despite a recent trial found no benefit from adding ascorbic acid to oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia, it may still be considered to improve iron absorption in IRIDA. Alternate‐day dosing can reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which reduces iron absorption for approximately 24 h after iron intake.FCM, ferric carboxymaltose; Hb, haemoglobin; IV, intravenous; QoL, quality of life; TSAT, transferrin saturation.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: expert review [^2bcd92de]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Oral iron supplementation — product selection, adverse effects, and absorption strategies: Many formulations are available without substantial evidence that any one product is better than another, and ferrous salts (ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, and ferrous gluconate) are a reasonable low-cost starting choice. Side effects are common, with a meta-analysis reporting constipation in 12%, diarrhea in 8%, and nausea in 11%. Serum hepcidin rises after oral dosing and remains increased for up to 48 hours; early data suggest every-other-day dosing appears to improve tolerance but needs better study before implementation. Absorption can be enhanced by taking iron with 80 mg ascorbic acid on an empty stomach, though evidence supporting vitamin C to improve absorption is mixed and needs further clarification. Tea and coffee are powerful inhibitors and should not be consumed within an hour after taking iron. Although absorption is better on an empty stomach, some patients will better tolerate iron with meals; if feasible, taking iron with meat protein will improve absorption, and using 500 mg vitamin C will allow absorption even if calcium or fiber is present in the meal.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^a06e018d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Iron deficiency anemia: evaluation and management [^8b511868]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in children with iron deficiency anemia [^115ba76b]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

A substantial proportion of the pediatric literature on the treatment of severe anemia is derived from studies in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). For this reason, there is insufficient data on the safety and efficacy of IV iron preparations when used to treat a broader range of anemias, including nutritional iron deficiency, in children and adolescents, which limits treatment options for this population. For example, in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older, iron sucrose is only approved for use to treat IDA in patients with CKD and has not been studied in patients younger than 2 years of age.

The most commonly used IV iron preparation in pediatric patients, iron sucrose, has a recommended maximum single dose for iron maintenance treatment that should not exceed 100 mg and should be infused over 5 to 60 min in pediatric patients with CKD who are receiving hemodialysis or erythropoietin therapy, with no established dosing for iron replacement treatment. In real-world experience, iron sucrose has been used to treat IDA of multiple etiologies in pediatric patients, but often requiring multiple doses and with total dose infusion not possible. Thus, multiple clinic visits or one prolonged hospital stay may be required to restore iron levels in a child with, for example, nutritional anemia. The availability of IV iron formulations that allow for more rapid administration of higher doses would be more convenient and efficient for the patient and the healthcare system.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in children with iron deficiency anemia [^9559829f]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

According to World Health Organization criteria, anemia is defined as a hemoglobin concentration < 11.0 mg/dL in children aged 6–59 months, < 11.5 mg/dL in children aged 5–11 years, and < 12.0 mg/dL in children aged 12–14 years. The hemoglobin levels at baseline (9.2 g/dL and 9.5 g/dL in the FCM 7.5 mg/kg and FCM 15 mg/kg groups, respectively) observed in the present trial correspond to moderate anemia in all three of these age groups. After a single IV dose of FCM, the mean maximum increases in hemoglobin concentration were observed 35 days post-dose and were 1.9 g/dL and 2.8 g/dL in patients treated with FCM 7.5 mg/kg and FCM 15 mg/kg, respectively. These increases would have been sufficient to normalize the mean hemoglobin level in all age groups in patients receiving FCM 15 mg/kg.

The PD results reported here are generally consistent with previous reports from retrospective cohort studies of pediatric patients treated with FCM. Among pediatric patients with IDA and poor response to oral therapy (N = 35–82 with pre- and post-infusion data), a single dose of FCM (maximum 20 mg/kg or 1000 mg total) resulted in mean increases from baseline at 6–12 weeks post-treatment in hemoglobin (22.5 g/L), serum ferritin (69.1 ng/mL), and TSAT (13.1%). Likewise, pediatric patients with IDA refractory to oral iron therapy treated with one or two doses of FCM (15 mg/kg; maximum 750 mg per dose) and having follow-up testing at 4–12 weeks post-treatment (N = 53) showed increases in hemoglobin concentration (from a median of 9.1 g/dL to 12.3 g/dL) and serum ferritin levels (from a median of 3.4 ng/mL to 114.7 ng/mL).

Iron formulations available in the United States — standard dosing and example formulations are summarized as follows: For oral/enteral iron, ferrous sulfate has a standard dosing of 3–6 mg/kg/day with formulations including 75 mg/mL (15 mg elemental iron), 220 mg/5 mL (44 mg elemental iron), 300 mg/5 mL (60 mg elemental iron), and 325 mg tablet (65 mg elemental iron). Iron polysaccharide complex is dosed at 3–6 mg/kg/day with formulations of 100 mg elemental iron/5 mL and 150 mg elemental iron capsules. For parenteral options, ferric carboxymaltose is 15 mg/kg/dose with 50 mg elemental iron/mL, iron sucrose is 5–7 mg/kg/dose with 20 mg elemental iron/mL, sodium ferric gluconate complex is 1.5 mg/kg/dose with 12.5 mg elemental iron/mL, and iron dextran is 10–100 mg/dose with 50 mg elemental iron/mL.

CASE DESCRIPTIONS

Existing literature predominantly addresses treatment outcomes in children with IRIDA, while adults have distinct clinical needs and presentations, as illustrated in cases from our iron expertise centre (Figure 2). These cases provide insights into the pathophysiology underlying treatment variability, highlighting the need for individualized approaches in both adults and children.

FIGURE 2
Course of haemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT levels in three female IRIDA patients. The left panels display Hb levels (with CRP for case 3); the right panels show ferritin and TSAT levels. Case 1: Hb and iron metrics over 6 years. This patient initially received IV iron therapy at irregular intervals due to being lost to follow up. At age 26 (6 years post‐diagnosis, time point t = 0), regular IV iron therapy was initiated. Over the subsequent years, she received a cumulative dose of 2500 mg of FCM via five 500 mg infusions, causing a sharp rise in ferritin (> 900 μg/L) and TSAT (up to 25%). Despite persistently high ferritin (> 700 μg/L), Hb only briefly peaked and remained within the lower normal range. Case 2: Hb and iron metrics over 4 years, including two pregnancies (shown by horizontal bars). At diagnosis (t = 0), this 32‐year‐old patient began monthly IV iron therapy. After a cumulative dose of 1700 mg FCM, the patient became pregnant (unaware at last administration). Particularly during the first pregnancy, TSAT remained stable and the Hb decrease was less pronounced than during non‐pregnancy periods. Case 3: Hb, CRP and iron metrics over 20 years. IV iron (totalling 5800 mg FS at 200 mg/dose) was administered every 2 months, maintaining ferritin > 500 μg/L for nearly a decade, with Hb within the reference range. Diagnosis of IRIDA was made at t = 5 when she was 41 years old. Ferritin and TSAT varied widely, likely due to chronic inflammation (CRP ~25 mg/L). In the final years (following t = 15), heavy menstrual bleeding led to a Hb decline, requiring additional IV iron therapy (totalling 1700 mg FCM).

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^66ca1a28]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Although a recent clinical trial in adults with iron deficiency anaemia showed no added benefit from ascorbic acid, this may not exclude its potential benefit in IRIDA. Moreover, reported cases showed varying outcomes with this combination therapy. Iron should be taken apart from certain foods (e.g. dairy products, fibres) and medications (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, calcium supplements, antacids), which can reduce iron availability by forming insoluble complexes. Alternate‐day dosing may reduce hepcidin‐mediated inhibition of iron uptake, which for iron‐deficient adult women has been described to last for approximately 24 h after iron intake.

In absolute iron deficiency anaemia, a weekly haemoglobin increase of approximately 0.8 g/dL is expected; however, in IRIDA, this haemoglobin increase in time is likely lower due to reduced iron availability. We define IRIDA non‐responders as those with less than a 1 g/dL haemoglobin increase after 4 weeks of oral therapy. As extended use appears more effective, oral supplementation should be continued for at least 3 months before considering switching to IV therapy. However, in practice, most patients diagnosed with IRIDA have already completed multiple unsuccessful attempts at oral iron supplementation. For these children, if they have been compliant with the prescribed therapy, reinitiating or extending oral therapy for 3 months is unnecessary. Instead, we recommend initiating IV iron therapy as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^7f3af913]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

WHO guidelines on iron supplementation among children call for further research to identify the optimal schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation regimen.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials providing ≥ 30 days of oral iron supplementation versus placebo or control to children and adolescents aged < 20 years were eligible. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to summarise the potential benefits and harms of iron supplementation. Meta-regression was used to estimate iron effect heterogeneity.

Results

129 trials with 201 intervention arms randomised 34 564 children. Frequent (3–7/week) and intermittent (1–2/week) iron regimens were similarly effective at decreasing anaemia, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia (p heterogeneity > 0.05), although serum ferritin levels and (after adjustment for baseline anaemia) haemoglobin levels increased more with frequent supplementation. Shorter (1–3 months) versus longer (7+ months) durations of supplementation generally showed similar benefits after controlling for baseline anaemia status, except for ferritin which increased more with longer duration of supplementation (p = 0.04). Moderate-dose and high-dose supplements were more effective than low-dose supplements at improving haemoglobin (p = 0.004), ferritin (p = 0.008) and iron deficiency anaemia (p = 0.02), but had similar effects to low-dose supplements for overall anaemia. Iron supplementation provided similar benefits when administered alone or in combination with zinc or vitamin A, except for an attenuated effect on overall anaemia when iron was cosupplemented with zinc (p = 0.048).

Conclusions

Weekly and shorter duration iron supplementation at moderate or high doses might be optimal approaches for children and adolescents at risk of deficiency.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^ffdb46f2]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron is essential for oxygen transport, respiration and several biochemical functions by virtue of its ability to form coordination complexes and shuttle between its ferrous (Fe²⁺) and ferric (Fe³⁺) forms. However, redox reactivity renders iron potentially toxic and excess, unshielded iron promotes oxidative tissue damage. Thus, a balanced iron supply is important, as both iron deficiency and overload cause morbidity.

While iron is abundant, its bioavailability is low. This poses a risk of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) or non-anemic iron deficiency (ID), which are managed by oral (and in specific cases intravenous) iron replacement therapy. During the last years, new oral iron formulations have been added to many already available, while several studies raised questions on optimal dosing and frequency. Recent advances and knowledge gaps in this emerging field are discussed herein.

Background

WHO guidelines recommend concurrent iron and antimalarial treatment in children with malaria and iron deficiency, but iron may not be well absorbed or utilized during a malaria episode.

Objectives

We aimed to determine whether starting iron 28 d after antimalarial treatment in children with severe malaria and iron deficiency would improve iron status and lower malaria risk.

Methods

We conducted a randomized clinical trial on the effect of immediate compared with delayed iron treatment in Ugandan children 18 mo-5 y of age with 2 forms of severe malaria: cerebral malaria (CM; n = 79) or severe malarial anemia (SMA; n = 77). Asymptomatic community children (CC; n = 83) were enrolled as a comparison group. Children with iron deficiency, defined as zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) ≥ 80 µmol/mol heme, were randomly assigned to receive a 3-mo course of daily oral ferrous sulfate (2 mg · kg⁻¹ · d⁻¹) either concurrently with antimalarial treatment (immediate arm) or 28 d after receiving antimalarial treatment (delayed arm). Children were followed for 12 mo.

Results

All children with CM or SMA, and 35 (42.2%) CC, were iron-deficient and were randomly assigned to immediate or delayed iron treatment. Immediate compared with delayed iron had no effect in any of the 3 study groups on the primary study outcomes (hemoglobin concentration and prevalence of ZPP ≥ 80 µmol/mol heme at 6 mo, malaria incidence over 12 mo). However, after 12 mo, children with SMA in the delayed compared with the immediate arm had a lower prevalence of iron deficiency defined by ZPP (29.4% compared with 65.6%, P = 0.006), a lower mean concentration of soluble transferrin receptor (6.1 compared with 7.8 mg/L, P = 0.03), and showed a trend toward fewer episodes of severe malaria (incidence rate ratio: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.14, 1.12).

Conclusions

In children with SMA, delayed iron treatment did not increase hemoglobin concentration, but did improve long-term iron status over 12 mo without affecting malaria incidence. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01093989.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^daad4201]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

In two prospective, open-label RCT with non-anemic, iron-deficient, premenopausal women, the participants received ferrous sulfate containing three different iron isotopes. The first study examined the differences between intake of 60 mg elemental iron on consecutive versus alternate days, while the second study assessed the impact of split dosing of 120 mg elemental iron (in two doses of 60 mg each per day) versus single daily dosing. In line with the pilot data, split dosing twice per day, as well as single daily dosing of 120 mg iron induced hepcidin, which diminished iron absorption the next day. Using the same methodology, a cross-over study involving premenopausal women with IDA compared iron absorption from ferrous sulfate at doses of 100 mg and 200 mg elemental iron administered either on two consecutive days or on alternate days. Total iron absorption from a single dose of 200 mg given on alternate days was almost twice that from 100 mg given on consecutive days. In a RCT with IDA patients, the primary endpoint of a 2 g/ dL rise in hemoglobin at 3 and 6 weeks was reached by significantly more patients taking 60 mg elemental iron twice daily versus 120 mg on alternate days. However, the median hemoglobin rise in the "alternate day" arm at 6 weeks was not significantly different from that in the "twice daily" arm at 3 weeks, while the treatment was better tolerated in the "alternate day" group. Similar results were obtained by other studies involving IDA patients. Current evidence supports the concept that intermittent iron supplementation every other day may be as effective as daily supplementation in controlling IDA, but with fewer adverse effects, at least in women of reproductive age. Nevertheless, this view is based on a small number of studies, some of them with methodological limitations. Thus, validation in more robust and adequately powered RCT with IDA patients of various etiologies is warranted. In any case, the new findings are reflected in the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, which recommend an initial treatment of IDA with " one tablet per day of ferrous sulfate, fumarate, or gluconate. If not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be considered ". It should be noted that all data favoring oral iron supplementation every other day were obtained using ferrous sulfate. Therefore, the recommendation for intermittent iron intake is restricted to ferrous salts. Whether this also applies to other iron supplements remains to be examined. There is evidence that ferric maltol induces hepcidin similarly to ferrous sulfate in IBD patients, while ferric citrate promoted a stronger increase in hepcidin compared to ferrous sulfate in non-dialysis CKD patients. On the other hand, administration of iron protein succinylateor sucrosomial ® irondid not affect hepcidin in rats and mice, respectively. Interestingly, ferric citrateor sucrosomial ® ironeffectively increased hemoglobinization in mouse models of hepcidin overexpression. These findings may be relevant to anemic patients who respond poorly to conventional oral iron supplements and require intravenous iron. This occurs in a subset of IBD or CKD patients who exhibit restricted iron availability for erythropoiesis due to inflammatory hepcidin induction (and impaired renal clearance of hepcidin in CKD), combined with IDA or not. The same considerations apply to patients with iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA), a genetic disorder caused by inactivation of the hepcidin suppressor TMPRSS6.

### Opportunistic screening for iron-deficiency in 6–36 month old children presenting to the paediatric emergency department [^9e8e7c76]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children can have serious adverse effects on their development including irreversible cognitive impairment and behaviour problems. The negative sequelae can be prevented with simple treatment with iron-fortified infant formula or oral iron supplementation. High risk groups include children from low socioeconomic status families, Chinese children, aboriginal children, infants of low birth weight, children whose mothers were iron-deficient during pregnancy, and children who consume cow's milk. Despite an overall decline in the incidence over the past 20 to 30 years there is still a significant proportion of children at risk. The prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia among a random group of Canadian 9 month olds was 7%, and 24% had low iron stores, despite the introduction of iron-fortified cereals by six months of age. Among African-American children aged 9 to 36 months the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was 8%.

The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care provides a grade B recommendation (fair evidence to support) for routine hemoglobin measurement for infants at high risk. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that screening should be offered once to all infants, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least one measurement of hemoglobin or hematocrit in infancy, and at least during the ages of 1 to 4 years and again in adolescence.

Basic screening for iron-deficiency anemia consists of a complete blood count (CBC) looking for hemoglobin less than the age-adjusted normal range, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 97%. The diagnosis is supported by a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and increased red cell distribution width (RDW). Confirmation of the diagnosis is commonly obtained with a trial of iron supplementation and measurement of the response. More complex measures of iron stores including serum ferritin, transferring saturation and erythrocyte protoporphyrin activity are used to more accurately determine iron status.

### Effect of daily iron supplementation on health in children aged 4–23 months: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^cb3af4c3]. The Lancet: Global Health (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

About 47% of preschool children worldwide are anaemic. Daily oral iron supplementation is a commonly recommended intervention for treatment and prevention of anaemia, but the efficacy and safety of iron supplementation programmes is debated. Thus, we systematically reviewed the evidence for benefit and safety of daily iron supplementation in children aged 4–23 months.

Methods

We searched Scopus and Medline, from inception to Feb 5, 2013, WHO databases, theses repositories, grey literature, and references. Randomised controlled trials that assigned children 4–23 months of age to daily oral iron supplementation versus control were eligible. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standard MD (SMD) for continuous variables, risk ratios for dichotomous data, and rate ratios for rates. We quantified heterogeneity with the I² test and synthesised all data with a random-effects model. This review is registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, number CRD42011001208.

Findings

Of 9533 citations identified by the search strategy, 49 articles from 35 studies were eligible; these trials included 42,306 children. Only nine studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. In children receiving iron supplements, the risk ratio for anaemia was 0.61 (95% CI 0.50–0.74; 17 studies, n = 4825), for iron deficiency was 0.30 (0.15–0.60; nine studies, n = 2464), and for iron deficiency anaemia was 0.14 (0.10–0.22; six studies, n = 2145). We identified no evidence of difference in mental (MD 1.65, 95% CI -0.63 to 3.94; six studies, n = 1093) or psychomotor development (1.05, -1.36 to 3.46; six studies, n = 1086). We noted no significant differences in final length or length-for-age, or final weight or weight-for-age. Children randomised to iron had slightly lesser length (SMD -0.83, -1.53 to -0.12; eight studies, n = 868) and weight gain (-1.12, -1.19 to -0.33) over the course of the studies. Vomiting (risk ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.10–1.73) and fever (1.16, 1.02–1.31) were more prevalent in children receiving iron.

Interpretation

In children aged 4–23 months, daily iron supplementation effectively reduces anaemia. However, the adverse effect profile of iron supplements and effects on development and growth are uncertain. Adequately powered trials are needed to establish the non-haematological benefits and risks from iron supplementation in this group.

### Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in children with iron deficiency anemia [^1b68a1e4]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients

Boys and girls eligible for enrollment at study sites in Poland were 1–17 years of age and those in Russia were 6–17 years of age. At screening, eligible patients had a hemoglobin concentration < 11 g/dL and a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. Therapy with an erythropoietin-stimulating agent was permitted, provided that the dose had been stable for more than 8 weeks prior to screening and that no changes in the dose or product were anticipated for the duration of the trial.

Patients were excluded with a ferritin level > 300 ng/mL at screening, with a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 5th percentile for age, or, for individuals who were enrolled while 1 year of age, with body weight < 12 kg. Other exclusion criteria included active infection; anemia for reasons other than iron deficiency; receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, other than steroid therapy, that could exacerbate anemia; receipt of IV iron and/or a blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to screening; history of acquired iron overload, hemochromatosis, or other iron accumulation disorder; severe diseases of the liver or the hematopoietic or cardiovascular system; CKD treated with hemodialysis; and/or evidence of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, or hepatitis B or C viruses with evidence of active hepatitis.

Study design and treatment

Patients who met the selection criteria entered a ≤ 14-day screening period to assess eligibility. Eligible patients were enrolled sequentially in one of two dose groups in which they received a single IV dose of FCM (Vifor Pharma Ltd. St. Gallen, Switzerland) (either 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg, with a maximum total dose of 750 mg). Enrollment in the group to receive the higher dose of FCM (15 mg/kg) began after all patients in the lower dose group (FCM 7.5 mg/kg) had received study drug and been observed for 4 weeks post-dose with no safety concerns as determined by the DSMB on the basis of an interim analysis of the FCM 7.5 mg/kg cohort.

FCM was administered as an undiluted solution at a rate of 100 mg/min. Doses less than 100 mg were administered as a slow undiluted IV push injection within 1 min. All patients were followed for 35 days. After infusion of FCM on Day 0, patients returned to the clinic at 24, 48, and 72 h post-dose, and subsequently on study Days 14, 28, and 35 for safety, PK, and PD assessments.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^991f6e85]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous iron

IV iron therapy generally showed more consistent efficacy than oral iron in increasing haemoglobin levels, although individual responses varied (Table S1). This advantage is likely due to IV iron's higher elemental iron content and favourable pharmacokinetic profile. While a single dose of oral iron generally provides about 20 mg of elemental iron daily (containing up to 30% elemental iron, with 10%–35% absorption), IV formulations like ferric carboxymaltose can deliver 500–1000 mg per dose, bypassing the intestinal hepcidin–ferroportin block by entering macrophages directly. Macrophages, with higher overall ferroportin expression than enterocytes, require significantly more hepcidin for comparable suppression of cellular iron release. Furthermore, IV iron, by directly loading iron into macrophages, upregulates ferroportin via the cellular iron regulatory IRP/IRE (iron regulatory protein/iron responsive element) pathway, preventing intracellular iron toxicity. Repeated IV iron administrations that elevate intracellular iron levels beyond a certain threshold facilitate effective, but not complete, iron mobilization from macrophages for erythropoiesis (Figure 1).

Despite the general effectiveness of IV iron therapy, case studies showed differences in administered doses, duration of effect and haemoglobin responses, even among patients with similar genotypes. Higher doses or shorter intervals between administrations generally tended to further improve haemoglobin levels (Table S1). Of note, published cases predominantly involved children with IRIDA, whose responses may differ from adults due to age‐related physiological differences.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^7c88fe78]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, no studies define the optimal frequency for IV iron therapy in IRIDA. Elevated hepcidin levels in IRIDA reduce ferroportin activity and cellular iron release, suggesting that higher hepcidin levels have a more significant impact. While large studies are lacking, one report showed that hepcidin levels increased within 6 h after a 200‐mg IV iron sucrose dose in an IRIDA case, returning to baseline after 1 week. Research in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients may also provide insights. For instance, a randomized trial found that hepcidin levels increased significantly at the start of a 4‐weekly IV iron regimen, particularly with higher doses (e.g. 1000 mg versus 200 mg of ferric carboxymaltose). These elevated hepcidin levels persisted for 52 weeks, but the impact of subsequent doses on hepcidin diminished over time. Based on these findings, we recommend administering frequent, smaller doses of IV iron (maximum dose: 500 mg elemental iron) at intervals of at least 2 weeks (Figure 3). Higher and more frequent dosing may further elevate hepcidin levels, potentially reducing the effectiveness of subsequent administrations. Moreover, lower dosing better allows personalized treatment in time.

### A comparison of the bioavailability of ferrous fumarate and ferrous sulfate in non-anemic Mexican women and children consuming a sweetened maize and milk drink [^7e800681]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Ferrous fumarate is recommended for the fortification of complementary foods based on similar iron absorption to ferrous sulfate in adults. Two recent studies in young children have reported that it is only 30% as well absorbed as ferrous sulfate. The objective of this study was to compare iron absorption from ferrous fumarate and ferrous sulfate in infants, young children and mothers.

Subjects/Methods

Non-anemic Mexican infants (6–24 months), young children (2–5 years) and adult women were randomly assigned to receive either 4 mg Fe (women) or 2.5 mg Fe (infants and young children) as either [(57)Fe]-ferrous fumarate or [(58)Fe]-ferrous sulfate added to a sweetened drink based on degermed maize flour and milk powder. Iron absorption was calculated based on incorporation of isotopes into erythrocytes after 14 days.

Results

Within each population group, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in iron absorption were found between ferrous fumarate and ferrous sulfate. Mean iron absorption from ferrous fumarate vs ferrous sulfate was 17.5 vs 20.5% in women (relative bioavailability (RBV) = 86), 7.0 vs 7.2% in infants (RBV = 97) and 6.3 vs 5.9% in young children (RBV = 106).

Conclusions

Ferrous fumarate is as well absorbed as ferrous sulfate in non-anemic, iron sufficient infants and young children, and can be recommended as a useful fortification compound for complementary foods designed to prevent iron deficiency. Further studies are needed to clarify its usefulness in foods designed to treat iron deficiency.

### Screening and management of bleeding disorders in adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding: ACOG COMMITTEE OPINION, number 785 [^ebfe442e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding — iron deficiency anemia screening and treatment: The World Health Organization defines anemia in females 12 years and older as a hemoglobin threshold of 12 g/dL, and iron deficiency is generally identified by a serum ferritin concentration below 15 micrograms/L. Adolescents with heavy menstrual bleeding may lose 0.4–0.5 mg of iron with every 1 mL of blood; the incidence of iron deficiency is 9%, increasing to 15–20% when iron deficiency without anemia is included. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend annual screening for adolescents at high risk; the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends obtaining a complete blood count and iron studies, when possible. First-line therapy includes oral iron with dietary counseling, and the CDC recommends an oral dose of 60–120 mg per day of iron for adolescent girls and women who have anemia. Emerging data indicate once-a-day to every-other-day dosing is more efficient than multiple daily doses, and if menstrual-flow–reducing interventions are successful, a 3- to 6-month course of iron is sufficient with a ferritin level obtained to confirm complete resolution of iron deficiency.

### How I treat iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia-an expert opinion-based treatment guidance for children and adults [^de68e35f]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia (IRIDA) is a rare hereditary microcytic anaemia characterized by partial or complete resistance to oral iron supplementation, caused by elevated plasma hepcidin levels resulting from pathogenic variants in the TMPRSS6 gene. Although intravenous iron supplementation is often effective, patient responses can vary significantly due to various factors, and potential side effects of this treatment remain unclear. Additionally, evidence-based international guidelines for diagnosing and managing IRIDA are lacking. This review aims to provide patient-tailored treatment strategies, informed by case studies and expert opinion, to address the specific therapeutic needs of both children and adults with IRIDA.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^6778ff88]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — pediatric RLS treatment gaps and iron supplementation: There is still a significant gap in the treatment of RLS in children, many medications used to treat RLS in adults have not been studied in children or may not be suitable due to potential side effects and lack of safety data, and the task force (TF) emphasizes the need for rigorous, high-level evidence studies that address treatment options for RLS in children. The inclusion in this CPG of oral iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate for children is a step forward from prior guidelines and a move in the right direction to provide treatment options for pediatric RLS, the TF did not identify studies assessing the benefits of lifestyle modifications and behavioral interventions for children with RLS, and nevertheless the TF recognizes the well-established importance of healthy sleep routines for the overall health in children, with areas for future research including longer-term treatment efficacy and safety of IV iron infusion and other pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.

### Advances in pediatric intravenous iron therapy [^522300a9]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) continues to be very common worldwide. Intravenous (IV) iron is an infrequently used therapeutic option in children with IDA despite numerous studies in adults and several small but notable pediatric studies showing efficacy and safety. Presently, the availability of newer IV iron products allows for replacement of the total iron deficit at a single setting. These products appear safer compared to the high molecular weight iron dextrans of the past. Herein, we review the medical literature and suggest that front line use of IV iron should be strongly considered in diseases associated with IDA in children.

### Oral iron supplementation and anaemia in children according to schedule, duration, dose and cosupplementation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised trials [^2b6ee0ab]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 129 randomised controlled trials, including 201 trial arms of oral iron supplementation in children, demonstrates significant benefits on haematologic outcomes including haemoglobin (+6.3 g/L; 95% CI 5.5, 7.1), ferritin (+18.5 ng/mL; 16.1, 20.9) and prevalence of anaemia (39% reduction; 33%, 45%), ID (70% reduction; 63%, 76%) and IDA (80% reduction; 69%, 87%). Children under age 5 years were most frequently studied (63% of trial arms), including trials throughout this age range, but with meaningful numbers of trials among children aged 5–11 years (25%) and adolescents aged 12–19 years (12%). In sum, these findings provide strong evidence for the benefits of iron supplementation among children.

Importantly, the number and diversity of identified trials allowed us to assess factors that might modify these benefits. Our results suggest that frequent (3–7 times/week) and intermittent (1–2 times/week) iron supplementation may be equally effective at increasing haemoglobin and decreasing anaemia, ID and IDA. While WHO recommends daily oral iron supplementation for all children in regions with an anaemia prevalence of 40% or more, the success of such programmes may be threatened by low adherence from adverse gastrointestinal reactions or high caregiver burden to provide daily supplements. Weekly iron supplementation has been promoted as an alternative to reduce these barriers. Furthermore, since mammalian gastrointestinal epithelial cells turn over every 2–6 days, weekly supplementation may not be at a great disadvantage relative to daily supplementation with respect to the total amount of absorbed iron. Some evidence points to changes in gastrointestinal epithelial cells following a large bolus of iron that results in reduced transport of iron into portal blood. A prior meta-analysis of 21 trials concluded that, compared with daily iron supplements, intermittent supplementation had similar effects on haemoglobin levels but was less effective in reducing anaemia. Our findings, based on a much larger number of trials, suggest that frequent and intermittent supplementation are similarly effective in reducing anaemia.
