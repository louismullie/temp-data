## Question

Differentiate esophageal vs oropharyngeal dysohagia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to differentiate esophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core symptom pattern and timing of difficulty. Then, I should analyze textures and progression to separate mechanical from motility etiologies. Next, I will consider risk factors and red flags. After that, I will map the physical exam to likely phases. Then, I should select initial diagnostics tailored to the suspected phase. Next, I will interpret results while accounting for overlap. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and key takeaways while verifying points against guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core symptom pattern because this often cleanly separates phases. If the problem is initiating a swallow, with immediate coughing, choking, nasal regurgitation, or a wet voice during the attempt, I should favor oropharyngeal dysphagia; if the swallow can be initiated normally but there is a sensation of food sticking seconds later in the chest or neck, that points to esophageal dysphagia, although perceived location can be misleading and distal disease may be felt in the throat, so I need to be cautious not to over-interpret localization without objective testing.

> Now, I need to check the timing and the impact of bolus consistency because this refines the differential. Oropharyngeal dysphagia typically shows immediate symptoms and liquids are often more problematic due to airway protection deficits, whereas esophageal mechanical obstruction usually begins with solids and can progress to liquids as the lumen narrows; wait, I almost labeled all mechanical disease as progressive, but I should correct that because webs and rings can produce intermittent solid-food dysphagia while malignant or peptic strictures tend to be progressively worse, and motility disorders like achalasia often cause difficulty with both solids and liquids from the outset with symptoms occurring seconds after the swallow and sometimes needing liquids to wash food down [^notfound].

> Next, I should review risk factors and comorbidities that predispose to each type to avoid tunnel vision. For oropharyngeal dysphagia, I will look for stroke, Parkinson's disease, dementia, ALS, older age, and head and neck cancer treatment, and I should remember that subtle or early PD-related swallow changes may be apparent on manometry even when VFSS appears normal, so I need to keep a low threshold for instrumental evaluation in neurodegenerative disease contexts [^111tppaZ]. For esophageal dysphagia, I should think GERD, eosinophilic esophagitis, connective tissue disease, prior radiation or caustic injury, and, per recent guidance, immune and infectious etiologies, including secondary achalasia phenotypes, so I must ask about atopy, food allergens, recent infections including COVID-19, Chagas risk, and immunocompromise [^112Jv4bF] [^111JgPvG].

> Hold on, I should verify alarm features because these govern urgency of evaluation. Shared red flags include recurrent aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration, and significant weight loss, while for esophageal disease rapid progression of dysphagia over months, odynophagia, GI bleeding, and new-onset symptoms after age 50 mandate urgent endoscopy to exclude malignancy, and in oropharyngeal disease frequent choking, wet voice after swallowing, and inability to handle secretions demand expedited instrumental assessment to mitigate aspiration risk [^notfound].

> I will now examine how the physical evaluation can support the phase hypothesis, but I need to acknowledge its limitations. Cranial nerve testing, cough strength, observation of repetitive saliva swallow performance, wet voice, and pooling of secretions support oropharyngeal involvement, whereas patients with esophageal dysphagia often have a normal oropharyngeal exam and may instead show systemic clues such as anemia or weight loss; if the history is mixed or unclear, I should not stop at a pharyngeal-only fluoroscopic view and should extend VFSS to include esophageal visualization because esophageal pathology is frequently missed otherwise [^112RvPht].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach when I suspect oropharyngeal dysphagia, and I should be precise about test performance. Bedside screens can triage but have limited accuracy, so instrumental testing is required; I initially thought VFSS is the gold standard, but I should correct and nuance that because a meta-analysis shows FEES has higher sensitivity than VFSS for aspiration, penetration, and residue, yet VFSS offers comprehensive dynamic imaging of oral, pharyngeal, and cervical esophageal phases and remains indispensable, and expert consensus underscores the complementary roles of swallowing fluoroscopy and FEES to answer different clinical questions [^11165WLq] [^115ZPxmF] [^113E5Qu8]. I also need to remember that some radiology texts still recommend a targeted pharyngeal barium study to define structural lesions like Zenker's, but I should weigh that source's lower credibility against the broader evidence base and multidisciplinary standards [^115aA56H].

> Next, I should confirm the first-line testing when esophageal dysphagia is suspected, especially with red flags. Multiple gastroenterology guidelines prefer upper endoscopy with biopsies as the initial test for esophageal dysphagia, both to identify structural and mucosal disease and to obtain tissue for eosinophilic esophagitis, whereas barium esophagram is useful when endoscopy is unavailable or to delineate complex strictures; I should reconcile that the radiology appropriateness criteria often place a biphasic esophagram early for retrosternal dysphagia, but in practice I will prioritize EGD if promptly available and reserve barium to augment or when resources dictate, and I must not forget the EoE biopsy strategy including sampling proximally and distally after adequate PPI exposure to avoid misclassification [^114KTZQx] [^117PtdyN] [^112wYcnK] [^111QLig3] [^113ZwPEH]. But wait, primary care guidance sometimes suggests a short PPI trial in low-risk patients with esophageal symptoms; I should clarify that in patients with true dysphagia, especially with any alarm feature, expedited EGD is preferred rather than empiric delay.

> I should double-check the next steps when endoscopy does not reveal the cause but symptoms persist because this is where motility testing is key. A barium esophagram can detect subtle rings and webs better than endoscopy and a timed barium swallow offers objective assessment of esophageal emptying in achalasia and helps with post-therapy follow-up, but definitive diagnosis of motor disorders requires manometry; high-resolution manometry is recommended over conventional manometry and is the gold standard for classifying motility by Chicago criteria, improving the detection of achalasia, and should be pursued after structural and inflammatory causes have been excluded [^111qABDy] [^114jrk6Q] [^1124EueE] [^116vivc6]. Let me verify achalasia specifics: guidelines recommend manometry for suspected achalasia without mechanical obstruction and support HRM over CM, with randomized data showing improved diagnostic yield for achalasia using HRM, and I should add that timed barium swallow complements HRM when findings are equivocal or to track response [^112DbcVP] [^117R9QWb] [^115ovKH6] [^111eLYKV].

> Hold on, I should consider overlap and sphincter coupling so I do not miss dual pathology. A meaningful proportion of patients undergoing VFSS with added esophageal visualization have both oropharyngeal and esophageal abnormalities, and upper and lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction can coexist, with evidence suggesting LES abnormalities correlate with altered UES relaxation dynamics; intriguingly, effortful swallow, an oropharyngeal therapy, can augment distal esophageal amplitude and improve bolus clearance, so I need to think bidirectionally when tailoring therapy and not assume a single-phase problem [^112RvPht] [^111BkxXF] [^116eDmQo].

> Let me now synthesize a practical pathway while I check for internal consistency. If history and exam point to oropharyngeal dysphagia, I will proceed from bedside screening to FEES or VFSS to characterize safety and efficiency and to guide therapy; if those are negative but symptoms persist, I should extend evaluation to the esophagus, ideally during VFSS or with EGD, to avoid missing esophageal contributions, and conversely if history points to esophageal dysphagia, I will prioritize urgent EGD when alarm features are present and follow with barium esophagram and then HRM if EGD is unrevealing; if the history is unclear, I will favor VFSS with esophageal visualization or parallel pathways to efficiently capture dual-phase disease, and I will remember that apparent throat symptoms can reflect distal disease so I should not anchor prematurely [^112RvPht] [^114KTZQx] [^117PtdyN] [^117EBUvH].

> The key takeaway, after verifying each step against the evidence, is that oropharyngeal dysphagia is a transfer problem with immediate airway protection issues, while esophageal dysphagia is a transport problem with delayed bolus hang-up, yet overlap is common and mislocalization occurs, so a careful history of timing and texture, targeted exam, and phase-appropriate testing with a low threshold for cross-phase assessment is the safest and most efficient way to differentiate and manage these patients [^112RvPht].

Oropharyngeal dysphagia is **difficulty initiating the swallow** — often with coughing, choking, nasal regurgitation, or aspiration — and usually results from neurologic or structural oropharyngeal disease; evaluation is best with VFSS or FEES [^113E5Qu8] [^115ZPxmF]. Esophageal dysphagia is **difficulty after the swallow**, with food sticking, retrosternal discomfort, or regurgitation, and typically results from structural or motility esophageal disease; it is best assessed with endoscopy [^114KTZQx], barium esophagram [^112wYcnK], and high-resolution manometry [^111mQvQ5]. Key distinctions include the **phase of swallowing** affected, **symptom triggers**, and the **diagnostic approach**.

### Dysphagia: Evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis is triggered by food allergens and is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.

### Accuracy of endoscopic and videofluoroscopic evaluations of swallowing for oropharyngeal dysphagia [^115ZPxmF]. The Laryngoscope (2017). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was conducted to compare the accuracy with which flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) assessed oropharyngeal dysphagia in adults.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) database.

- **Methods**: A review of published studies was conducted in parallel by two groups of researchers. We evaluated the methodological quality, homogeneity, threshold effect, and publication bias. The results are presented as originally published, then with each test compared against the other as a reference and both compared against a composite reference standard, and then pooled using a random effects model. Software use consisted of Meta-DiSc and SPSS.

- **Results**: The search yielded 5,697 articles. Fifty-two articles were reviewed in full text, and six articles were included in the meta-analysis. FEES showed greater sensitivity than VFSS for aspiration (0.88 vs. 0.77; p = 0.03), penetration (0.97 vs. 0.83; p = 0.0002), and laryngopharyngeal residues (0.97 vs. 0.80; P < .0001). Sensitivity to detect pharyngeal premature spillage was similar for both tests (VFSS: 0.80; FEES: 0.69; p = 0.28). The specificities of both tests were similar (range, 0.93–0.98). In the sensitivity analysis, there were statistically significant differences between the tests regarding residues but only marginally significant differences regarding aspiration and penetration.

- **Conclusions**: FEES had a slight advantage over VFSS to detect aspiration.

### Dysphagia: Current reality and scope of the problem [^1157n5Mc]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a symptom of swallowing dysfunction that occurs between the mouth and the stomach. Although oropharyngeal dysphagia is a highly prevalent condition, occurring in up to 50% of elderly people and 50% of patients with neurological conditions, it is associated with aspiration, severe nutritional and respiratory complications, and even death. Most patients are not diagnosed and do not receive any treatment. By contrast, oesophageal dysphagia is less prevalent and less severe, but its symptoms are better recognized as they are caused by diseases affecting the enteric nervous system and/or oesophageal muscular layers.

Recognition of the clinical relevance and complications of oesophageal and oropharyngeal dysphagia is growing among health-care professionals in many fields. In addition, the emergence of new methods to screen and assess swallow function at both the oropharynx and oesophagus, along with marked advances in understanding the pathophysiology of these conditions, is paving the way for a new era of intensive research and active therapeutic strategies for affected patients. Indeed, a unified field of deglutology is developing, with new professional profiles to cover the needs of all patients with dysphagia in a nonfragmented way.

### An oropharyngeal pH monitoring device to evaluate patients with chronic laryngitis [^117Ns17E]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnostics for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are suboptimal because of limited sensitivity. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to systematically assess the performance characteristics of an oropharyngeal pH probe.

- **Methods**: In vitro studies compared the oropharyngeal probe with a standard pH catheter in liquid and aerosolized solutions, pH 1–7. The accuracy of measurements, deviation from target pH, and time to equilibrium pH were determined. Simultaneous distal esophageal pH measurements were obtained in 11 patients with GERD. Oropharyngeal and distal esophageal reflux parameters were measured for controls (n = 20), patients with GERD (n = 17), and patients with chronic laryngitis (n = 10).

- **Key results**: In the liquid phase, at pH 4–5, the oropharyngeal probe had less deviation from the target value than the standard catheter; deviation in the vapor phase was similar (0.4 pH units). Median (interquartile) time to reach equilibrium pH was significantly (P < 0.001) faster with the oropharyngeal than the standard probe. In comparing simultaneous distal esophageal pH characteristics, 96% of recordings with the new and standard probes were in agreement to within ± 1.0 pH unit; 71% of recordings were in agreement within ± 0.5 pH units. Patients with chronic laryngitis had significantly higher levels of oropharyngeal acid exposure at pH < 4, < 5, and < 6, in the upright position than patients with GERD or controls (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Oropharyngeal pH monitoring appears to be more sensitive than traditional pH monitoring in evaluation.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: A stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, with incidence varying depending on the specific definition used. A thorough medical history is crucial for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is considered a red flag alarm symptom, necessitating oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. However, even after comprehensive investigations, including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy), barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be identified. This review suggests an algorithm for history-taking and investigation to identify causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. The review further discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### Pharyngeal dysphagia: What the radiologist needs to know [^115aA56H]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is specifically the difficulty in moving the bolus from the mouth to the esophagus. The best initial evaluation for suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia is a barium study, which can assess the motility of the oropharynx and hypopharynx, and provide double-contrast views that may identify structural or mucosal abnormalities.

Pharyngeal diverticula, including Zenker's and Killian-Jamieson diverticula, as well as pharyngeal pouches, are readily identified on these studies. Zenker's diverticula are the most common diverticulum implicated in pharyngeal dysphagia and typically occur in the setting of cricopharyngeal dysfunction. The radiologist must not only diagnose these diverticula but also understand the normal postoperative appearance after diverticulotomy, which can often be confusing for the uninitiated imager.

Cervical webs are a common finding in pharyngeal dysphagia and should not be mistaken for a normal postcricoid defect. Other diagnostic challenges include the correct identification of lingual hyperplasia, which mimics lymphoma, and the detection of squamous carcinoma, which is more mass-like but sometimes difficult to see among the complex anatomical lines of the pharynx. All of the above abnormalities are easily differentiated from the retention cyst, which is the most common "mass" in the pharynx. Pathologies extrinsic to the pharynx, such as tumors and cervical osteophytes, can result in secondary symptoms from mass effect.

This article discusses the various radiographic findings in both normal and abnormal states of the pharynx.

### Pharyngo-esophageal modulatory swallow responses to bolus volume and viscosity across time [^113Cw7zC]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal swallowing is a highly complex process requiring adequate neuro-regulation and modulation to safely transfer the bolus from the mouth to the esophagus. Afferent sensory information from the mouth and oropharynx is important for the accommodation of the swallow motor response to a specific bolus. Bolus properties like volume, viscosity, taste, and temperature serve as peripheral sensory input to the brainstem. This information is integrated with input from cortical areas and may influence the central pattern generator neurons within the brainstem, resulting in motor output of the swallow response adjusted for sensory feedback.

- **Modification of bolus textures and volumes**: The effect is commonly used in dysphagia management and is an established compensatory technique. Thickened liquids increase the safety of swallowing by reducing the prevalence of penetration and aspiration, although the prevalence of post-swallow residue may increase. Additionally, it has been shown that sensory stimulating liquids (i.e. sour, cold, and carbonated liquids, and capsaicinoids) induce biomechanical changes of the swallow and increase swallow safety in patients with dysphagia. Sensory stimulation may therefore also be of importance as a dysphagia intervention.

Some studies show that patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia or aspiration have an altered response to changes in bolus volume and viscosity. For instance, a decreased pharyngeal delay with increasing bolus volumes was found in stroke patients, with most of them exhibiting mild swallow abnormalities, but not in healthy individuals.

### Prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cDNqT]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

This study aims to determine the prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) in children, as diagnosed through instrumental evaluation, and to identify associated risk factors.

- **Methods**: A systematic search was conducted across six databases (Embase, LILACS, LIVIVO, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science), as well as gray literature sources (ASHA, Google Scholar, and ProQuest). Studies involving children (under 12 years of age), diagnosed using instrumental methods such as videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), were included. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence, with heterogeneity assessed through meta-regression. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist.

- **Results**: A total of 31 studies were included, yielding a pooled prevalence estimate of 69% (95% CI: 61%-77%; I² = 94%). Most studies involved children with predisposing conditions, potentially contributing to an overestimation of OD prevalence in the general pediatric population. Four studies were assessed as having a moderate risk of bias, while 27 were rated as having a low risk of bias.

- **Conclusion**: The findings suggest a high prevalence of OD, especially in children with underlying health conditions. These results underscore the importance of early diagnosis and tailored interventions to mitigate the health risks associated with deglutition disorders in pediatric populations.

### The relationship between upper esophageal sphincter manometry function and esophageal motility disorders [^111BkxXF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

For a bolus to pass from the pharynx into the esophagus, the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) must open. This opening requires coordinated relaxation among other events during the transition from the oropharyngeal to esophageal phases of deglutition. This study demonstrates that higher lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure is correlated with increased UES relaxation time and relaxation duration, suggesting that aberrant LES pressure is closely related to prolonged UES relaxation, and thus an altered ability to open the UES.

This suggested relationship is supported by the finding that among patients with disorders of the LES, like achalasia, many have impaired UES relaxation as well. Altered UES relaxation may be clinically significant, given that UES relaxation permits UES opening, which allows for a bolus to enter the esophagus. It follows that impaired UES relaxation can impair hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal bolus clearance by diminishing the ability of the UES to open, leading to failed swallows.

As mentioned, the directionality of the relationship between LES and UES dysfunction is unclear. However, it is possible that UES dysfunction occurs as a response to LES pathology, as evidenced by studies which found that treatment of LES pathology results in improved UES function. As it pertains to the results of this study, UES relaxation (or opening) may be prolonged in individuals with LES dysfunction as a product of a maladaptive response to an already dysfunctional esophagus. Ultimately, further studies are needed to determine how the function of the LES impacts the function of the UES, and vice versa.

### Effects of effortful swallow on esophageal function in healthy adults [^116eDmQo]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment for esophageal dysmotility is currently limited to primarily pharmacologic intervention, which has questionable utility and frequently associated negative side effects. A potential behavioral intervention for esophageal dysmotility is the effortful oropharyngeal swallow. A previous pilot study using water perfusion manometry found an increase in distal esophageal amplitudes during effortful vs. non-effortful swallowing. The study sought to duplicate the previous study with improvements in methodology.

- **Methods**: The effects of swallow condition (effortful vs. non-effortful), sensor site, and gender on esophageal amplitude, duration, velocity, and bolus clearance were examined for 18 adults (nine males and nine females, mean age = 29.9 years) via combined solid-state manometry and intraluminal impedance.

- **Key results**: The effortful swallow condition yielded significantly higher esophageal amplitudes across all sensor locations (P < 0.05). Furthermore, effortful swallowing decreased the risk of incomplete bolus clearance compared to non-effortful swallowing (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30–0.86).

- **Conclusions and inferences**: With improved manometric instrumentation, larger participant numbers, and methodology that controlled for potential confounding factors, this study confirms and advances the results of the previous pilot study. Volitional manipulation of the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing using the effortful swallow indeed affects esophageal physiology. Thus, the effortful swallow offers a behavioral manipulation of the esophageal phase of swallowing.

### Effect of thickened fluids on swallowing function in oropharyngeal dysphagia: Impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype [^116nBbqh]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

The formulation of thickened drinks is an essential therapeutic strategy for many patients presenting with dysphagia symptoms. Fluid thickeners reduce airway penetration‐aspiration, an effect shown to be viscosity‐dependent. Thickened fluids, however, require optimization on a case‐by‐case basis, as the improvements in safety may be counteracted by reduced palatability.

Fluid rheology influences how swallowed boluses behave during transit through the pharyngo‐esophageal segment during deglutition. The different components of the swallow motor response impose different shear forces on the bolus. A thickened fluid bolus, when subjected to these shear forces, exhibits non‐Newtonian shear‐thinning flow behavior; thus, viscosity decreases during the swallowing process. The magnitude of these effects can be estimated through laboratory rheological testing at different shear rates, such as 50 s⁻¹ and 300 s⁻¹, representing the forces being notionally applied to the bolus domain during the oral and hypopharyngeal phases of bolus transport.

Swallowing disorders, known as dysphagia, have been recognized by the WHO as a medical disability associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs of care. With increasing survival rates and the aging population, swallowing disorders and their role in causing pulmonary and nutritional pathologies are becoming exceedingly important. Over the past two decades, the study of oropharyngeal dysphagia has been approached from various disciplines, resulting in considerable progress in understanding its pathophysiology.

This review describes the most frequent manifestations of oropharyngeal dysphagia and the clinical, as well as instrumental techniques, available to diagnose patients with dysphagia. However, the clinical value of these diagnostic tests and their sensitivity to predict outcomes is limited. Despite considerable clinical research efforts, conventional diagnostic methods for oropharyngeal dysphagia have limited proven accuracy in predicting aspiration and respiratory disease. We contend that the incorporation of measurable objective assessments into clinical diagnosis is needed and might be key in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

### Diagnostic approach to patients with suspected motility disorders: One size does not fit all [^112j9zS4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Most epidemiological studies in the field include only patients with typical esophageal symptoms, such as dysphagia and/or chest pain, even though, according to guidelines, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is required for diagnosing different entities such as globus or among patients with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who do not respond to treatment. However, data about the epidemiology of motility disorders (mEMD) among patients with non-typical symptoms are lacking.

HRM is the gold standard for mEMD diagnosis, although the initial diagnostic approach in patients with either typical or atypical symptoms includes upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Studies indicate that the existence of compatible endoscopic findings among patients finally diagnosed with mEMD varies. Additionally, a valuable tool in the diagnostic armory used for patients with esophageal motility disorders (EMD) is the barium swallow esophagogram. Since the introduction of timed-barium swallow (TBE), its diagnostic accuracy has increased, particularly in the setting of achalasia. Given that TBE is easier to perform than HRM, and less expensive, its use is expected to continue. Nevertheless, there is insufficient data about the findings from endoscopic and barium studies among patients with non-typical esophageal symptoms referred for HRM.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of mEMD among patients with typical versus non-typical symptoms referred for HRM in the era of the Chicago IV classification. A secondary aim was to identify possible differences among findings in endoscopy and TBE between these groups.

### The American Broncho-Esophagological Association position statement on swallowing fluoroscopy [^113E5Qu8]. The Laryngoscope (2023). High credibility.

The objectives of this statement are to develop an expert consensus on the clinical use of swallowing fluoroscopy in adults, aiming to reduce practice variation and identify opportunities for quality improvement in the care of patients suffering from swallowing impairment.

Methodology included a search strategist reviewing data sources such as PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus. This evidence was used by an expert development group to compose statements focusing on areas of controversy regarding swallowing fluoroscopy. Candidate statements underwent two iterations of a modified Delphi protocol to reach consensus.

Results revealed that a total of 2,184 publications were identified for title and abstract review, with 211 publications meeting the criteria for full text review. Of these, 148 articles were included for review, and an additional 116 publications were included after reviewing the references of the full text publications from the initial search. These 264 references guided the authors in developing 41 candidate statements in various categories. Eventually, 40 statements encompassing patient selection, fluoroscopic study choice, radiation safety, clinical team dynamics, training requirements, videofluoroscopic swallow study and esophagram techniques, and interpretation of swallowing fluoroscopy met criteria for consensus. One statement on esophagram technique reached near-consensus.

Conclusions indicate that these 40 statements regarding the comprehensive use of swallowing fluoroscopy in adults can guide the development of best practices, improve quality and safety of care, and influence policy in both outpatient and inpatient settings.

### Dysphagia profiles among inpatients with dementia referred for swallow evaluation [^114V41Bf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia, or swallowing dysfunction, affects more than 16 million individuals in the United States and results in serious health consequences, including pneumonia, malnutrition, and death. Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) commonly lead to oropharyngeal dysphagia. In fact, pneumonia due to dysphagia-related aspiration is the most commonly cited complication leading to death in older individuals with ADRD. Hospitalized patients with ADRD are particularly vulnerable to developing comorbid dysphagia as a result of their diagnosis. One study observed that patients with comorbid ADRD and dysphagia are at increased risk for malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, mechanical ventilation, and an increased length of hospital stay compared to those without dysphagia.

Despite the serious consequences of dysphagia, prevalence estimates for its occurrence in individuals with ADRD range widely across studies from 7 to 87%. These differences are due to variations in the method of dysphagia measurement (e.g. patient-reported outcome measures (PROs), screening tools, bedside clinical evaluations, instrumental assessments), definition of dysphagia, dementia subtype (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia), stage of dementia progression, and study setting (home, hospital, institution). Despite the serious consequences of dysphagia in hospitalized patients, these variations in prevalence estimates limit understanding of dysphagia and development of optimal treatment for patients with ADRD compared to other populations.

### How to effectively use and interpret the barium swallow: Current role in esophageal dysphagia [^111qABDy]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

The barium swallow is a commonly performed investigation, though recent decades have seen major advances in other esophageal diagnostic modalities.

The purpose of this review is to clarify the rationale for components of the barium swallow protocol, provide guidance on interpretation of findings, and describe the role of the barium swallow in the diagnostic paradigm for esophageal dysphagia in relation to other esophageal investigations. The barium swallow protocol, interpretation, and reporting terminology are subjective and non-standardized.

- **Common reporting terminology and approach**: Common reporting terminology and an approach to their interpretation are provided. A timed barium swallow (TBS) protocol provides a more standardized assessment of esophageal emptying but does not evaluate peristalsis.

- **Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy**: The barium swallow may have higher sensitivity than endoscopy for detecting subtle strictures. However, it has lower overall accuracy than high-resolution manometry for diagnosing achalasia but can help secure the diagnosis in cases of equivocal manometry. TBS has an established role in the objective assessment of therapeutic response in achalasia and helps identify the cause of symptom relapse.

- **Role in surgical assessments**: The barium swallow has a role in evaluating manometric esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction, in some cases helping to identify where it represents an achalasia-like syndrome. It should be performed in dysphagia following bariatric or anti-reflux surgery to assess for both structural and functional postsurgical abnormalities.

The barium swallow remains a useful investigation in esophageal dysphagia.

### Do children with dysphagia and normal esophageal motility according to Chicago classification always have "normal" esophageal motility [^116uPknU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Internationally adopted Chicago classification (CC) criteria based on adult normative data have been used to diagnose children with esophageal motility disorders undergoing high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM). The aim of this study was to compare HREM parameters of children without dysphagia and children with dysphagia and normal findings according to CC.

- **Methods**: HREM metrics of 41 children (13.2 (9–18) years; 20 female) without dysphagia and 41 children (13.7 (8–18) years; 30 female) with dysphagia and normal diagnosis according to CC were compared. Analyzed data included resting and integrated relaxation pressures (IRP) of upper (UES) and lower (LES) esophageal sphincters, esophageal peristaltic contractile integrals, transition zone (TZ) gaps, distal latency (DL), and manometric esophageal length to height ratio (MELH). The 95th percentile normative cutoffs were calculated from the cohort without dysphagia.

- **Key results**: Proximal contractile integral (PCI), UES and LES mean resting, and IRP were not significantly different between the cohorts (p > 0.3). On the contrary, distal contractile integral (DCI), TZ gap, and MELH were notably different with p = 0.0002, p = 0.027, and p = 0.033 respectively. According to the 95th percentile normative cutoffs of DCI, TZ gap, and MELH, in the cohort with dysphagia 27%, 15%, and 22% of patients respectively were not normal.

- **Conclusion and inferences**: This is the first study ever to compare HREM parameters of children without dysphagia to children with dysphagia. A considerable proportion of children with dysphagia may be underdiagnosed according to the adult criteria.

### Subjective assessment of videofluoroscopic swallow studies [^11165WLq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) is the gold-standard diagnostic tool to evaluate oropharyngeal dysphagia. Although objective measurements on VFSS have been described, there is no universal method of analysis, and the majority of clinicians use subjective interpretation alone. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of subjective VFSS analysis.

- **Study design**: Double-blinded experiment.
- **Setting**: Tertiary care laryngology center.
- **Subjects and methods**: Seventy-six de-identified videos from VFSS evaluations of patients with dysphagia were presented to blinded, experienced speech-language pathologists and laryngologists individually. Evaluators rated each video as normal or abnormal for hyoid elevation (HE), pharyngeal area (PA), pharyngeal constriction ratio (PCR), and pharyngoesophageal segment opening (PESo). A blinded investigator assessed evaluators' inter- and intrarater agreement and compared their responses to objectively measured results for these parameters to examine accuracy.

Results showed evaluators correctly classified only 61.5% of VFSS videos as normal or abnormal, with moderate interrater agreement (κ = 0.48, P < .0001). Intrarater agreement was highly variable (κ = 0.43–0.83). Accuracy was greatest for PCR (71.6%), with poorer performance for HE (61.3%), PESo (59.2%), and PA (45.3%). Interrater agreement was moderate for all parameters, with greater concordance for PCR (κ = 0.59) and PESo (κ = 0.54), and less for HE (κ = 0.40) and PA (κ = 0.44). Evaluators unanimously agreed on a correct interpretation of a VFSS only 28% of the time.

### Airway closure delay: The predominant pathophysiology in reflux-associated dysphagia [^111RTqc5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The study investigates the impact of reflux on oropharyngeal swallowing physiology, which is commonly observed in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Objective measures of swallowing function from modified barium swallow studies were used to evaluate the pathophysiology of dysphagia in patients with reflux as their sole associated condition.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Setting**: Tertiary care voice and swallowing clinic.

- **Subjects and methods**: The Swallowing Database at the University of Utah was queried for patients diagnosed with reflux without other conditions affecting swallowing function. Key measures assessed included pharyngeal transit time (TPT), the distance of hyoid elevation (H max), maximum opening size of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES max), the area of the pharynx at maximum constriction (PA max), airway closure timing relative to the arrival of the bolus at the UES, and the penetration/aspiration (Pen/Asp) score.

- **Results**: Of the 122 patients meeting the inclusion criteria, 42% had normal pharyngeal swallowing function, while 57% had at least one abnormality in swallowing measures. A delay in airway closure relative to bolus arrival at the UES was observed in 47.5% on at least one swallow. The rates of prolonged TPT, diminished H max, poor UES max, and enlarged PA max were 2.5%, 8%, 4%, and 11.5%, respectively. Notably, 60% with a delay in airway closure had a normal Pen/Asp score.

- **Conclusion**: A delay in airway closure relative to the arrival of the bolus at the UES is the most common abnormality of swallowing function found in this study.

### A multinational consensus on dysphagia in Parkinson's disease: Screening, diagnosis and prognostic value [^111tppaZ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Oro-Pharyngo-Esophageal Scintigraphy (OPES) is a useful tool for the early detection of dysphagia, but its diagnostic role in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains to be ascertained, as only a single study has been carried out in this patient population. Although only preliminary evidence is available, swallowing evaluation with high-resolution manometry (HRM) represents another interesting diagnostic tool. It can show subtle swallowing changes in the early stages of PD, even in the absence of swallowing changes on videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS).

The Electro-Kinesiologic Swallowing Study (EKSS) is an additional useful diagnostic tool to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of oropharyngeal dysphagia and provide clues for treatment selection. For example, electromyography of the cricopharyngeal muscle (i.e. the main component of the upper esophageal sphincter, UES) helps clarify whether failure in UES opening during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing is due to persistent sphincter hyperactivity or to reduced elevation of the pharyngeal-laryngeal structures. In the former case, botulinum toxin injection into the cricopharyngeal muscle may be beneficial. However, very few centers use UES electromyography routinely, so this examination cannot currently be considered a standard test for dysphagia.

- **Gastroenterological investigations**: These include esophageal manometry, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, acid- and reflux-related tests, and/or radiological investigations such as barium swallow. They should always be carried out in the presence of esophageal symptoms, such as dysphagia for solid foods and regurgitation.

### Approach to the patient with dysphagia [^114VKEvY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a fascinating symptom. It is ostensibly simple when defined by trouble swallowing, yet its subtleties in deciphering and its variations in pathophysiology almost mandate a thorough knowledge of medicine itself. With patience and careful questioning, a multitude of various disorders may be suggested before an objective test is performed. Indeed, the ability to diligently and comprehensively explore the symptom of dysphagia is not only rewarding but also a real test for a physician who prides themselves on good history taking.

### Expert consensus statement: Management of dysphagia in head and neck cancer patients [^116GhMF3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

To develop an expert consensus statement (ECS) on the management of dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, the study aimed to address controversies and offer opportunities for quality improvement. Dysphagia in HNC was defined as swallowing impairment in patients with cancers of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx.

Development group members with expertise in dysphagia followed established guidelines for developing ECS. A professional search strategist systematically reviewed the literature, and the best available evidence was used to compose consensus statements targeted at providers managing dysphagia in adult HNC populations. The development group prioritized topics where there was significant practice variation and topics that would improve the quality of HNC patient care if consensus were possible.

The development group identified 60 candidate consensus statements, based on 75 initial proposed topics and questions, that focused on addressing the following high-yield topics: risk factors, screening, evaluation, prevention, interventions, and surveillance. After two iterations of the Delphi survey and the removal of duplicative statements, 48 statements met the standardized definition for consensus; 12 statements were designated as no consensus.

Expert consensus was achieved for 48 statements pertaining to risk factors, screening, evaluation, prevention, intervention, and surveillance for dysphagia in HNC patients. Clinicians can use these statements to improve patient care.

### Esophageal motility disorders: Current approach to diagnostics and therapeutics [^113BuZFS]. Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom with a significant impact on quality of life. Previously, our diagnostic capabilities were primarily limited to endoscopy and barium esophagram, until the advent of manometric techniques in the 1970s provided the first reliable tool for assessing esophageal motor function. Since then, significant advances have been made over the last three decades in understanding various esophageal motility disorders due to improvements in diagnostics with high-resolution esophageal manometry. This technology has enhanced sensitivity for detecting achalasia and has improved our understanding of spastic and hypomotility disorders of the esophageal body. In this review, we discuss the approach to diagnosing and treating various esophageal motility disorders.

### AGA clinical practice update on esophageal dysfunction due to disordered immunity and infection: Expert review [^112cXFHa]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of esophageal dysphagia, particularly in terms of differential diagnosis, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining an evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis who experience symptoms of esophageal dysfunction despite histologic and endoscopic disease remission, as some patients may develop motility disorders.

### Effect of thickened fluids on swallowing function in oropharyngeal dysphagia: Impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype [^116tmGWg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, measures derived from P‐HRM‐I swallowing assessments align with bolus rheology at shear rates relevant to the pharyngeal phase and are modified by swallowing dysfunctions that impair normal pharyngo‐esophageal bolus transport. We believe these observations to be clinically relevant. Understanding rheology‐based effects on swallowing parameters in appropriately subtyped patients may help to guide the development of therapeutic interventions for dysphagia management. This study opens the door to undertake further investigations to establish whether P‐HRM‐I assessment may have a complementary role for optimizing fluid thickener interventions.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^117PtdyN]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with dysphagia should preferably have an endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies to rule out and treat mucosal and structural disorders prior to manometry. A barium swallow should be considered where endoscopy is not possible and/or where structural disorders require further scrutiny.

- **GRADE evidence**: Moderate
- **Strength recommendation**: Strong

Oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD) is the preferred investigation in patients with oesophageal dysphagia, as it not only allows direct visual inspection of the oesophagus but also facilitates histological sampling. Fifty-four percent of a sample of 1,649 patients presenting with dysphagia had a major abnormality at OGD, with yields being higher in men older than 40 years, especially when heartburn, odynophagia, and weight loss occur in association with dysphagia. Patients with dysphagia should undergo OGD and biopsy at two levels in the oesophagus to exclude eosinophilic oesophagitis in the absence of a mucosal or structural cause for their symptoms.

Contrast radiology is a useful adjunct to endoscopic examination when diagnosing a patient with dysphagia. In countries with limited healthcare resources, or in situations where a patient is unable or unwilling to undergo endoscopic examination, a contrast study can outline irregularities in the oesophageal lumen and diagnose the majority of stricturing lesions within the oesophagus.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: manifestations and diagnosis [^113w9xGR]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). High credibility.

Oesophageal dysphagia is a common symptom often related to severe oesophageal diseases such as carcinomas. Therefore, it is crucial to rule out an organic process initially through endoscopy in all patients presenting with dysphagia symptoms. The most prevalent obstructive aetiologies include oesophageal cancer, peptic strictures, and eosinophilic oesophagitis. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is notably one of the most common causes of dysphagia in both adults and children, which underscores the importance of obtaining oesophageal biopsy samples from all patients with unexplained dysphagia.

With the advent of standardized high-resolution manometry and specific metrics for characterizing oesophageal motility, the Chicago classification has become the gold-standard algorithm for the manometric diagnosis of oesophageal motor disorders. Moreover, advanced investigation and analysis methods that combine pressure and impedance measurement are currently in development. In the future, these techniques may detect subtle pressure abnormalities during bolus transport, potentially providing further insights into pathophysiology and symptoms. However, the extent to which these novel approaches will aid in distinguishing dysphagia caused by motor abnormalities from functional dysphagia remains to be determined.

### Oropharyngeal dysphagia and nutritional management [^112XieM6]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The management of oropharyngeal dysphagia has received growing attention recently. Specialists from many disciplines are involved, and the results of developments in dysphagia management are published in a range of journals. This review reports on recent developments in the diagnosis and clinical management of dysphagia.

- **Recent findings**: New instruments have been developed recently for diagnosis. Clinical observations have been made that promise to provide a better understanding of the various deficits involved. Deficiencies in both recognizing and managing dysphagia have been highlighted, and recent reviews published.

- **Summary**: New techniques for quantifying the type and degree of dysphagia in patients are described. Prospective studies have emphasized that dysphagia frequently remains imperfectly diagnosed; some of these newer, less expensive techniques may improve diagnosis. The benefits of using multidisciplinary teams for the effective management of dysphagia have been emphasized by a number of investigators. Quality of life issues in dysphagia are becoming more widely recognized, and recommendations designed to improve patients' quality of life have been made, including improvements in nutrition and the use of psychological counseling. Cochrane reviewers have identified shortcomings in the dysphagia knowledge base and have stressed the need for more properly controlled and randomized clinical trials.

### Effect of thickened fluids on swallowing function in oropharyngeal dysphagia: Impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype [^1119rgpx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). High credibility.

This study investigates the effect of different thickened fluids on swallowing function in individuals with oropharyngeal dysphagia. The research considers the impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype on swallowing success.

- **Methodology**: Participants diagnosed with oropharyngeal dysphagia were given thickened fluids with varying shear properties. Swallowing function was assessed using videofluoroscopic swallow studies.

- **Findings**: The study found that the rheological properties of thickened fluids significantly influenced swallowing safety and efficiency. Participants with certain disorder subtypes responded differently to the viscosity levels of the fluids.

- **Conclusion**: The findings underscore the importance of tailored interventions in dysphagia management, highlighting the need for personalized thickening agents based on individual swallowing characteristics.

### Esophageal visualization as an adjunct to the videofluoroscopic study of swallowing [^112RvPht]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Complaints of dysphagia for solids often lead to referrals for speech-language pathology (SLP). However, many patients are later diagnosed with esophageal rather than oropharyngeal dysphagia. Fluoroscopic screening that focuses solely on the oropharynx fails to identify these cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of esophageal abnormalities in an SLP-led videofluoroscopic study of swallowing (VFSS) clinic.

A prospective, observational study was conducted in a radiology suite at a public hospital. The study recruited 111 consecutive mixed-etiology patients referred by otorhinolaryngology (ORL) (59 patients) or by a speech-language pathologist (52 patients). The VFSS was performed according to protocol, and esophageal visualization (in the anterior-posterior plane) was conducted using a large liquid barium bolus and a barium capsule. All VFSS recordings were analyzed using objective digital measures of timing and displacement.

The results showed that 68% of patients had an abnormal esophageal transit. One-third of those referred presented exclusively with esophageal abnormalities, while another third had both oropharyngeal and esophageal abnormalities. Oral abnormalities, reduced pharyngoesophageal segment maximum opening (PESmax), and increasing age were significantly associated with esophageal abnormalities.

In conclusion, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pharynx alone, without esophageal review, risks incomplete diagnosis of patients with esophageal disorders. Using esophageal visualization allows timely recognition of these conditions.

### Relationship between esophageal contraction patterns and clearance of swallowed liquid and solid boluses in healthy controls and patients with dysphagia [^116PoHPx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2012). Low credibility.

Non-obstructive dysphagia patients prove to be a difficult category for clinical management. Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) is a novel method used to analyze dysphagia. However, it is not yet clear how findings on HRM relate to bolus transport through the esophagus.

- **Methods**: Twenty healthy volunteers and 20 patients with dysphagia underwent HRM and videofluoroscopy in a supine position. Each subject swallowed five liquid and five solid barium boluses. Esophageal contraction parameters and bolus transport were evaluated with HRM and videofluoroscopy.

- **Key results**: Stasis of liquid and solid barium boluses occurred in patients and in healthy volunteers in 64% and 41%, and in 84% and 82% of the swallows, respectively. Overall, 70% of the liquid and 72% of the solid bolus swallows were followed by a peristaltic contraction, the difference not being statistically significant. Statistically significant associations were found for transition zone length of liquid and solid boluses, and for DCI and distal contraction amplitudes for liquid stasis. No correlation was found between the degree of stasis and other manometric parameters.

- **Conclusions and inferences**: Stasis of both liquid and solid boluses occurs frequently in patients and in controls and can be regarded as physiological. Motility patterns can predict the effectiveness of bolus transit and level of stasis to some degree, but the relationship between esophageal motility and transit is complex and far from perfect. Esophageal manometry is therefore currently deemed unfit to be used for the purpose outlined.

### Can the repetitive saliva swallow test predict airway invasion in all cause dysphagia [^113QUopf]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a prevalent condition affecting up to 50% of individuals in rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. Despite its high prevalence, OD is often underdiagnosed and underreported. Early detection is crucial due to the troublesome symptoms and severe complications associated with this condition. Notably, Hinchey et al. demonstrated that formal screening for OD can significantly reduce the incidence of pneumonia.

The gold standard for the diagnosis of OD involves instrumental assessment, such as video fluoroscopy (VFS) and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Instrumental swallowing assessments focus on evaluating and quantifying the safety of the swallow (i.e. airway invasion) and the efficiency of the swallow (i.e. pharyngeal residue). The penetration–aspiration scale (PAS) is an ordinal scale with eight distinct levels that score airway invasion during instrumental swallowing evaluations. Its score ranges from no penetration of material into the airway (PAS = 1) to material passing through the vocal cords with no attempt to eject it (PAS = 8). Typically, in the literature, scores are categorized between PAS 1 and 2 versus PAS 3 and 8. A PAS score of 3 indicates the invasion of material into the airway without ejection. While instrumental testing provides reliable diagnoses for OD, it is relatively expensive and requires a high level of expertise to execute and interpret.

### Effect of a gum-based thickener on the safety of swallowing in patients with poststroke oropharyngeal dysphagia [^1132hE1L]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a motility disorder characterized by difficulty forming or moving the alimentary bolus from the mouth to the esophagus, which can include aspiration. Poststroke OD (PSOD) is classified in the ICD under the code 438.82 (ICD‐9) and I69.391 (ICD‐10). OD is a prevalent complaint following stroke, with a high incidence (45%) upon hospital admission. It is associated with poor short‐ and long‐term prognosis and several complications, such as malnutrition, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia, which increase the risk of mortality compared to poststroke patients without OD. It is an independent risk factor for prolonged hospital stay and institutionalization after discharge, as well as for poorer functional capacity and increased mortality three months after stroke. While some patients recover spontaneously, 50% assessed six months poststroke were found to have chronic OD.

The pathophysiology of PSOD is characterized by several motor impairments in the kinematics of the swallow response, including delayed laryngeal vestibule closure (LVC) and decreased bolus propulsion forces. Additionally, patients affected by unilateral stroke showed a disrupted pattern of sensory cortical activation after pharyngeal stimulation, serving as a distinctive marker of abnormal sensory integration of swallowing pathways in PSOD.

Thickening agents increase the viscosity of fluids and thin liquids, enhancing the safety of swallowing by avoiding aspirations and their associated complications. As stated in a review by the European Society for Swallowing Disorders, thickening agents play a crucial role in managing swallowing safety.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^112McHs8]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Summary of all recommendations:

- **Technical aspects of oesophageal manometry**: In patients undergoing evaluation for dysphagia, high-resolution manometry (HRM) is superior to standard manometry in terms of reproducibility, speed of performance, and ease of interpretation. GRADE evidence: High. Strength recommendation: Strong.

	- The addition of impedance to HRM can be a helpful adjunct to visualize bolus movement and peristalsis effectiveness; however, its utility in clinical practice and impact on therapeutic decision-making is not yet clear. GRADE evidence: Moderate. Strength recommendation: Conditional/weak.

	- Normal values for HRM are manufacturer and catheter specific. GRADE evidence: High. Strength recommendation: Strong.

	- Adjunctive testing (e.g. larger volumes of water, solid/viscous swallows, or a test meal) can provide additional information and unmask pathology not seen with standard water swallows, as they are more representative of normal swallowing behavior and more likely to induce symptoms, thereby improving diagnostic yield. GRADE evidence: High. Strength recommendation: Strong.

- **Patients with dysphagia**: Patients with dysphagia should preferably have an endoscopy with oesophageal biopsies to rule out and treat mucosal and structural disorders prior to manometry. A barium swallow should be considered where endoscopy is not possible and/or where structural disorders require further scrutiny. GRADE evidence: Moderate. Strength recommendation: Strong.

### The anatomy and physiology of normal and abnormal swallowing in oropharyngeal dysphagia [^112CoX6h]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Eating and drinking are enjoyable activities that positively impact an individual's quality of life. The ability to swallow food and fluid is integral to the process of eating. Swallowing occupies a dual role, being both part of the enjoyment of eating and a critically important utilitarian activity to enable adequate nutrition and hydration. Any impairment to the process of swallowing can negatively affect a person's perception of their quality of life.

The process of swallowing is highly complex and involves muscles in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. The oropharynx is the anatomical region encompassing the oral cavity and the pharynx. Food must be masticated, formed into a bolus, and transported to the pharynx by the tongue, whereas fluids are usually held within the mouth before being transported ab-orally. The bolus must then be transported through the pharynx to the esophagus without any matter entering the larynx. The muscles needed for all these steps are coordinated by swallowing centers within the brainstem, which are supplied with sensory information by afferent nerve fibers from several cranial nerves. The swallowing centers also receive modulatory input from higher centers within the brain. Hence, a swallow has both voluntary and involuntary physiologic components. The term dysphagia is given to difficult swallowing while oropharyngeal dysphagia refers to difficult swallowing due to pathology within the oropharynx.

Problems affecting any point along the complex swallowing pathway can result in dysphagia. This review focuses on…

### Esophageal contractions and oropharyngeal and esophageal transits in patients with iron deficiency anemia [^115ti6nA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with iron deficiency may have reduced power of the pharyngeal muscle for bolus propulsion into the esophagus. We hypothesized that the esophageal muscle is similarly impaired.

- **Methods**: We studied the oropharyngeal and esophageal transits and esophageal motility of 12 patients (11 women) aged 31–50 years (median 36 years) with iron deficiency anemia (serum iron less than 40 µg/dL) and 17 normal volunteers (16 women) aged 26–52 years (median 37 years) with serum iron greater than 60 µg/dL. The esophageal motility was studied by the manometric method, with continuous perfusion and 10 swallows of a 2-ml bolus of water alternated with 10 swallows of a 7-ml bolus; and the oropharyngeal and esophageal transits were studied by scintigraphy, with swallows of a 10-ml bolus for the study of oropharyngeal transit and of a 10-ml bolus for the study of esophageal transit. Motility and transit were studied in the supine position.

- **Results**: The amplitude, duration, and area under the curve of contractions were lower in patients than in volunteers. There were no differences in peristaltic contraction velocity, lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation duration. There was no difference in oropharyngeal transit. In the esophagus, the transit was slower in patients than in volunteers. The time needed by the scintigraphic activity to reach a peak in the proximal esophagus was longer in patients than in volunteers.

- **Conclusions**: Iron deficiency may decrease esophageal contractions and impair esophageal transit.

### The dysphagia stress test for rapid assessment of swallowing difficulties in esophageal conditions [^115XqLpL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia is a common symptom in gastroenterology practice. Rapid assessment tools are typically limited to oropharyngeal dysphagia and do not translate well to esophageal conditions. This study aims to create a novel tool, the dysphagia stress test (DST), to evaluate swallowing in patients with esophageal disease characterized by dysphagia.

- **Methods**:
	- Adults with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), achalasia, and dysphagia not otherwise specified (NOS) participated. Patient controls with non-esophageal diagnoses and healthy controls were also recruited. Participants completed the DST with five bolus challenges: water, applesauce, rice, bread, and barium tablet, and they rated their swallowing difficulty and pain. A study clinician observed and documented water use and any refusal of challenges. Participants also completed measures of esophageal symptoms, hypersensitivity, and symptom anxiety to evaluate the DST's validity. Collinearity of bolus challenges guided item reduction.

- **Key results**:
	- A total of 132 subjects participated. Both control groups and GERD patients exhibited the best swallowing ability, while achalasia, EOE, and dysphagia NOS scored poorer. About 90% of patients were able to attempt or pass each of the bolus challenges, suggesting high acceptability. Construct validity of the DST is evidenced by modest negative correlations with symptom severity, hypersensitivity, and anxiety. The DST does not seem to be influenced by brain-gut processes. Applesauce, rice, and bread demonstrated collinearity; thus, the DST was reduced to fewer components without compromising its validity.

### Can the repetitive saliva swallow test predict airway invasion in all cause dysphagia [^112rJDgc]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Low credibility.

However, no studies at the time of writing have specifically examined the RSST's diagnostic properties across an all‐cause dysphagia population, leaving a critical knowledge gap. This is important because, in clinical practice, the etiology of OD is often unclear at the time of screening. The pathophysiology, severity, and symptoms of OD can differ widely depending on the underlying cause, which may influence the performance of screening tools like the RSST. Therefore, evaluating the RSST in a broader population that includes a variety of dysphagia etiologies will provide valuable insights into its generalizability and utility across different patient groups.

When considering the utility of the RSST as a screening tool for OD, the normative values and how much they are affected by non‐dysphagia–related factors also need to be considered. In a previous study, we investigated the normal values of RSST in the healthy population across various age groups. The mean RSST score was 7. The study demonstrated an inverse relationship between age and RSST scores. Additionally, a lower RSST score was associated with higher BMI (body mass index), female gender, and a greater number of prescribed medications.

Our study aim was to determine the diagnostic properties of the RSST in predicting airway invasion in patients with all‐cause OD using FEES as a gold standard test. We hypothesized that the RSST would be a valid tool to predict airway invasion; however, it would be slightly less accurate in the all‐cause dysphagia population compared to the neurogenic dysphagia population.

### Diagnosis and management of pediatric dysphagia: A review [^114YaS5T]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Awareness of swallowing dysfunction in the pediatric population is growing as many as 50% of parents report that their otherwise healthy children have a feeding problem. Dysphagia is increasingly common in the pediatric population, especially as advances in health care improve the survival of extremely premature infants and children with complex congenital anomalies. Symptoms of dysphagia and aspiration prompt referral to otolaryngologists.

- **Observations**: Dysfunction can exist at any of the four phases of the physiologic swallow. Dysphagia manifests differently in children at each age in their development. Dysphagia can present in otherwise healthy children but is more common in patients with a history of prematurity, neuromuscular disorders, cardiopulmonary disorders, anatomic anomalies of the upper aerodigestive tract, and gastrointestinal tract disorders. The workup involves clinical feeding evaluations, imaging studies, and endoscopic evaluations. Appropriate management depends on the cause of dysphagia.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: The causes of dysphagia in children are varied and often multifactorial. Evaluation by a multidisciplinary team can facilitate accurate diagnosis and guide management.

### The incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in infants with GERD-like symptoms [^1179NJKJ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Symptoms of infantile gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may overlap with oropharyngeal dysphagia, but the evaluation and treatment of these conditions vary greatly. In this investigation, the incidence of oropharyngeal dysphagia in infants with GERD-like symptoms is determined. A retrospective chart review was performed on infants referred to a pediatric gastroenterology clinic for GERD-like symptoms. A feeding screen was performed in all infants. Standardized bedside swallow evaluation and modified barium swallow (MBS) studies were then performed when clinically indicated. A similarly aged cohort of normal participants also underwent a standard bedside swallow evaluation for group comparison.

The study population included 67 infants. A swallow evaluation was recommended in 39 of 67 infants, with abnormalities noted in all. Swallowing abnormalities were more frequent and clustered in infants with GERD-like symptoms compared to controls. MBS was abnormal in 16 of 17 qualifying infants. Characteristics of at-risk infants included extreme prematurity, developmental delay, or symptoms refractory to antireflux medications.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia is prominent in infants with GERD-like symptoms.

### Screening of dysphagia in geriatrics [^114qA2gh]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The accumulation of food can be interpreted by Turley and Cohen, who stated that oropharyngeal dysphagia in older people is related to impaired swallow efficacy and/or safety due to weak tongue propulsion and a prolonged and delayed oropharyngeal swallow response (OSR). Impaired swallow efficacy is associated with reduced bolus propulsion due to weak muscular tongue force related to sarcopenia, leading to an accumulation of different consistencies in the oral cavity and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia.

Voice changes in aging people can be interpreted as structural and physiological changes that occur in old age across all systems, including those responsible for voice production — the respiratory and vocal tract systems.

- **Observation from bedside evaluation**: The results in Table 4 showed that voice changes occurred in the context of the bedside evaluation, meaning voice changes happened directly after oral intake of food and fluids. In this context, voice changes are a symptom of laryngeal penetration and therefore a major symptom of severe dysphagia.

- **Impact on voice production**: Changes in calcification and ossification of cartilages, muscle and vocal fold atrophy, vocal fold bowing, reduced mucosal wave, and pulmonary lung pressures, volumes, and elasticity have an impact on voice production and quality.

- **Confirmation with EAT10 and FEES**: To confirm the presence of dysphagic symptoms and signs in this study, the EAT10 — a valid self-perceived questionnaire — was carried out for all subjects under study, and FEES was performed for suspected cases only.

The results obtained for the EAT10, as seen in Table 5, revealed that 12.5% to 17.5% of subjects under study had difficulty.

### Pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter manometry in the evaluation of dysphagia [^115RF55X]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Use of esophageal manometry seems to be increasing, but the utility of pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) manometry is not widely recognized. This article is intended to clarify this subject. Initially, we review the anatomy and physiology of this area. Most studies indicate that the manometry of the UES and pharynx provides useful information primarily in patients that have symptoms of oropharyngeal dysfunction. Oropharyngeal dysphagia has high morbidity, mortality, and cost. It occurs in one-third of all stroke patients and is common in the chronic care setting; up to 60% of nursing home occupants have feeding difficulties, of whom a substantial portion have dysphagia. For patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, as for those with esophageal dysphagia, barium swallow study and manometry are complementary. Their combined use permits us to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiologic process that causes the patient's symptoms. Abnormalities have been noted in a variety of diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, achalasia, and scleroderma. Thus, it is possible to determine the primary pathology that is causing the patient's dysphagia by analyzing the manometry results. Pharyngeal and UES manometry also has value in evaluating patients who are candidates for myotomy or dilatation, as it can help identify patients with a prospective good outcome.

### Esophageal stricture: incidence, treatment patterns, and recurrence rate [^113UBCxZ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on esophageal stricture:

- **Definition**: Esophageal stricture is a chronic condition characterized by dysphagia due to esophageal inflammation, collagen deposition, and scar tissue.

- **Pathophysiology**: Esophageal stricture is caused mainly by GERD, esophagitis, tumors (adenocarcinoma, SCC), corrosive injury to the esophagus, intrinsic/extrinsic compressions, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, postsurgical complications, and congenital defects.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of an esophageal stricture include dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, vomiting, chest pain, cough, hoarseness, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and weight loss. There is an increased risk of recurrence after initial dilatation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In-hospital mortality in benign and malignant esophageal strictures is 1.4% and 3.1%, respectively.

### Management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease: A comprehensive review of clinical presentation, workup, and treatment [^112KUEK4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is among the most common GI symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies of dysphagia prevalence in this population have largely focused on oropharyngeal dysphagia, the management of which has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. The etiology of esophageal dysphagia is not yet well-understood but has long been thought to involve defective coordination of the esophageal musculature due to the involvement of the dorsal nuclear vagus of the brainstem. However, like other GI symptoms, dysphagia has been known to occur before motor manifestations of PD, and patients with PD demonstrate marked histopathologic abnormalities of the esophageal enteric nervous system (ENS). Postmortem studies of patients with PD have revealed increased Lewy bodies in the mid- and especially distal esophagus at the level of the myenteric plexus, but the correlation of esophageal Lewy pathology with dysphagia symptom severity or with esophageal manometric pattern has not been established.

Regardless, esophageal dysphagia remains an important entity to address both in terms of the nutritional and symptomatic needs of patients, but also to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, a common cause of death in PD. Dysphagia is also associated with an increased risk of malnutrition among patients with PD and accounts for about 50% of referrals for percutaneous gastrostomy tube placements in this population. In addition, dysphagia is associated with higher levels of depression and lower quality of life.

Esophageal motility disorders per Chicago classification criteria are present in about one-third of patients with PD, although

### Effect of thickened fluids on swallowing function in oropharyngeal dysphagia: Impact of shear rheology and disorder subtype [^112Dts9g]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

Fluid thickeners used in the management of oropharyngeal dysphagia exhibit non‐Newtonian shear‐thinning rheology, impacting their viscosity during deglutition. This study investigated how the rheological properties of thickened fluids affect pharyngeal swallowing parameters in patients with oropharyngeal motor disorders diagnosed by pharyngeal high‐resolution manometry impedance (P-HRM-I).

Seventy‐two patients (18–89 years) referred for P-HRM-I were diagnostically assessed with a 10 mL thin bolus. In 57 of the patients, 10 mL swallows of two moderately thick formulations — xanthan gum (XG) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose gum (CMC) — were also tested. The XG and CMC fluids had equivalent empirical thickness but different viscosity at pharyngeal phase shear rates: XG 87 mPa.s (83–91) versus CMC mean 157 mPa.s (148–164) at 300 s−1. Standard metrics of pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function were derived from P-HRM-I recordings and analyzed to characterize patients into one of four disorder subtypes: (i) No Disorder, (ii) UES Disorder, (iii) Pharyngeal Disorder, and (iv) Combination UES/Pharyngeal Disorder. Impedance recordings also assessed pharyngeal bolus transit.

Patients with a Combination UES/Pharyngeal Disorder were most likely to have abnormal bolus transit (82%, p < 0.001). Increasing bolus viscosity significantly influenced UES residual pressure, UES opening area, and post-swallow residue. Patients with UES Disorder exhibited pronounced increases in UES residual pressure with CMC compared to XG.

### High-resolution manometry improves the diagnosis of esophageal motility disorders in patients with dysphagia: A randomized multicenter study [^115ovKH6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) might be superior to conventional manometry (CM) to diagnose esophageal motility disorders. We aimed to compare the diagnoses performed with HRM and CM and confirmed at 6 months in a multicenter randomized trial.

- **Methods**: Patients with unexplained dysphagia were randomized to undergo either CM or HRM. Motility disorders were diagnosed using the Castell and Spechler classification for CM and the Chicago classification for HRM. Diagnosis confirmation was based on clinical outcome and response to treatment following a 6-month follow-up. The initial diagnosis and percentage of confirmed diagnoses were compared between the two arms (CM and HRM).

- **Results**: In total, 247 patients were randomized and 245 analyzed: 122 in the CM arm and 123 in the HRM arm. A manometric diagnosis was more frequently initially achieved with HRM than with CM (97% vs. 84%; P < 0.01). Achalasia was more frequent in the HRM arm (26% vs. 12% in the CM arm; P < 0.01) while normal examinations were more frequent in the CM arm (52% vs. 28% in the HRM arm; P < 0.05). After follow-up, the initial diagnosis was confirmed in 89% of patients in the HRM arm vs. 81% in the CM arm (P = 0.07). Finally, overall procedure tolerance was better with CM than with HRM (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: This randomized trial demonstrated an improved diagnostic yield for achalasia with HRM compared with CM. Diagnoses tended to be more frequently confirmed in patients who underwent HRM, suggesting that esophageal motility disorders could be identified earlier with HRM than with CM.
