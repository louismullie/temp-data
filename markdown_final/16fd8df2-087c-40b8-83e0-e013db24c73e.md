## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about next steps, treatment, and referral for a 56-year-old man with abnormal liver chemistries, including total bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 271 U/L, ALT 35 U/L, and AST 61 U/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and characterizing the pattern of injury. Then, I should verify immediate red flags and whether urgent hepatology referral is needed. Next, I will review the differential diagnosis for a cholestatic pattern with mild transaminase elevation, followed by a prioritized diagnostic workup including fractionated bilirubin, GGT, viral serologies, autoimmune markers, and imaging. After that, I will consider when to pursue MRCP or liver biopsy. Finally, I will outline initial management, monitoring, and referral thresholds, while double-checking for pitfalls like Wilson disease and drug-induced liver injury that could alter the plan [^1155asMt] [^113s1NHW].

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and pattern before jumping to conclusions; I should repeat the liver panel to ensure persistence and calculate the R ratio to classify the injury as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed, because misclassification can misdirect testing and delay diagnosis [^115PkWRv] [^116MrpTo]. Wait, let me verify the math: ALT 35 U/L divided by an ALT ULN of roughly 40 gives about 0.875, and ALP 271 U/L divided by an ALP ULN of roughly 100 gives about 2.71, so R ≈ 0.875/2.71 ≈ 0.32, which is less than 2 and indicates a cholestatic pattern rather than hepatocellular injury, aligning with the disproportionate ALP and bilirubin elevations relative to transaminases [^116MrpTo] [^1155asMt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about severity; I need to check for acute liver failure features and synthetic dysfunction because bilirubin at 4.0 mg/dL with coagulopathy or encephalopathy mandates urgent hepatology and transplant center referral, but in the absence of INR > 1.5 or encephalopathy, this does not meet ALF criteria, though the cholestatic jaundice still warrants expedited evaluation [^114Kk3U6]. I should confirm that INR, albumin, and mental status are normal before proceeding with outpatient workup, and if any red flags are present, escalate immediately [^114Kk3U6].

> Next, I should review the differential for a cholestatic pattern in a 56-year-old man; let me think about biliary obstruction first because stones, strictures, and malignancy are common and actionable, followed by intrahepatic cholestatic diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, drug-induced cholestasis, and infiltrative or granulomatous diseases, while keeping in mind that an AST:ALT ratio around 1.7 can be seen in cirrhosis even when transaminases are not markedly elevated [^114k6r3r] [^112SSEsM] [^113s1NHW] [^116MUPTF]. I should double-check for red flags of obstruction like pruritus, dark urine, and pale stools, and for systemic clues such as IBD or recent medications that could shift the pretest probabilities [^112SSEsM] [^113s1NHW].

> I will now examine the immediate confirmatory tests; I need to ensure bilirubin is fractionated to distinguish conjugated from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, because a predominantly direct fraction supports cholestasis or obstruction, whereas an indirect fraction would push me toward hemolysis or Gilbert syndrome, and I should add GGT to confirm the hepatic origin of ALP before chasing biliary imaging [^113LJvTk] [^113iG5vj]. Let me verify that I include a complete blood count, INR, and albumin to assess synthetic function and screen for hemolysis, since these influence both urgency and the diagnostic pathway [^113LJvTk].

> For imaging, I should start with a right upper quadrant ultrasound because it is first-line to detect ductal dilatation from extrahepatic obstruction and can identify stones, masses, and liver parenchymal abnormalities; if ultrasound shows ductal dilatation, I should proceed to MRCP or ERCP depending on the clinical context and local expertise, whereas if ultrasound is normal, I should pivot to evaluating intrahepatic causes [^114k6r3r] [^116VCtcF]. Wait, I should confirm that ultrasound is indeed the initial test of choice in cholestatic jaundice and that MRCP is preferred for noninvasive delineation of the biliary tree when obstruction is suspected but not clearly visualized on ultrasound [^114k6r3r] [^112SbFyr].

> Now, I need to check autoimmune and cholestatic serologies; anti-mitochondrial antibody is highly specific for primary biliary cholangitis and should be sent with ANA and SMA, and I should consider IgG and IgM because elevated IgM supports PBC, while remembering that PSC lacks a specific serologic marker but may have pANCA positivity that is nonspecific [^115fZ5hX] [^112SSEsM]. Hold on, I should verify that AMA is indeed the serologic hallmark for PBC and that a negative AMA does not exclude PBC in a minority of cases, which is why liver biopsy may still be needed if suspicion remains high [^115fZ5hX].

> I should confirm viral hepatitis screening is not overlooked; hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C antibody with reflex RNA are part of the standard aetiology screen in adults with abnormal liver chemistries and should be obtained even when the pattern is cholestatic, because coexisting viral hepatitis can modify management and prognosis [^113z2Ems] [^1155asMt]. Let me reconsider whether acute viral hepatitis could present with a cholestatic pattern; while less common, mixed patterns do occur, so testing remains appropriate to exclude treatable infections [^1155asMt].

> But wait, what if this is drug-induced cholestasis; I need to obtain a meticulous medication and supplement history, including over-the-counter and herbal products, because DILI is a diagnosis of exclusion and can mimic obstructive or autoimmune cholestasis, and I should apply DILI severity thresholds to guide monitoring and discontinuation decisions while I continue the workup [^113s1NHW]. I should double-check for agents with known cholestatic hepatotoxicity and time course correlations to exposure, as this can avert unnecessary invasive testing if the story is compelling [^113s1NHW].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to MRCP or liver biopsy; if ultrasound is normal but cholestasis persists with elevated ALP and bilirubin, MRCP is appropriate to evaluate for PSC, dominant strictures, or intrahepatic biliary disease, and if serologies and imaging are unrevealing, liver biopsy becomes important to distinguish PBC, small-duct PSC, sarcoidosis, drug injury, or infiltrative processes, with biopsy also serving to stage fibrosis when it will change management [^114k6r3r] [^112SSEsM] [^1156xFwp]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent ALP elevation beyond 6 months with negative evaluation warrants biopsy even if symptoms are minimal, given the risk of occult cholestatic liver disease [^114k6r3r].

> I need to ensure I do not miss Wilson disease in the wrong clinical context; the Wilson ALP:TBil and AST:ALT ratios cited for acute liver failure do not fit this non-ALF, cholestatic presentation, so applying those ratios here would be a mistake, but if the patient were younger or had hemolysis or neuropsychiatric features, I should check ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper and proceed accordingly [^113NEGxq]. Let me verify that these ratios were derived in ALF cohorts and should not be extrapolated to stable cholestatic disease without compatible features [^113NEGxq].

> For initial management while the workup proceeds, I should advise alcohol abstinence, avoid new hepatotoxic or cholestatic medications when possible, and monitor pruritus and fat-soluble vitamin status if cholestasis persists; if PBC is diagnosed, ursodeoxycholic acid at 13–15 mg/kg/day is first-line therapy, and I should plan to reassess biochemical response at 6–12 months using validated criteria such as Paris I/II, GLOBE, or UK-PBC to guide second-line therapy decisions [^1161mNeW] [^117MPwoL]. I should confirm that early biochemical improvement in ALP and bilirubin correlates with improved long-term outcomes in PBC, reinforcing the need for timely treatment and structured monitoring [^1161mNeW].

> Regarding referral, I should double-check thresholds; any evidence of acute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or obstructive imaging findings should trigger urgent hepatology and transplant center referral, whereas persistent cholestasis without diagnosis after initial noninvasive evaluation merits routine hepatology referral for consideration of MRCP, ERCP, and liver biopsy, and this patient's bilirubin of 4.0 mg/dL with cholestatic enzymes places him in a category where expedited specialty input is reasonable even if not emergent [^114Kk3U6] [^114k6r3r]. Let me verify that local pathways often recommend referral when ALP remains > 1.5–2× ULN with an unclear etiology after initial testing, which fits this scenario [^113XoUqa].

> In summary, I should confirm the cholestatic pattern with repeat testing and GGT, fractionate bilirubin, obtain CBC, INR, and albumin, perform right upper quadrant ultrasound promptly, and if ultrasound is unrevealing, send autoimmune serologies and viral hepatitis tests, consider MRCP for suspected PSC or unexplained cholestasis, and proceed to liver biopsy if the diagnosis remains unclear or staging is needed, all while maintaining vigilance for drug-induced cholestasis and referring to hepatology for ongoing management and treatment initiation if PBC or PSC is diagnosed [^114k6r3r] [^112SSEsM] [^113s1NHW] [^1161mNeW]. Hold on, I should verify that each step aligns with guideline-based care and adjust the pace of escalation to the severity of biochemical injury and clinical context to avoid both under- and over-treatment [^1155asMt] [^112SbFyr].

This 56-year-old man with **cholestatic liver injury** (ALP 271 U/L, bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL, AST 61 U/L, ALT 35 U/L) needs a **structured workup** to distinguish obstruction from intrahepatic cholestasis. The next steps are to **fractionate bilirubin**, **confirm hepatic ALP with GGT**, and obtain a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** to assess for biliary obstruction or mass lesions [^114k6r3r] [^113LJvTk]. If ultrasound is inconclusive, proceed to MRCP or CT [^112SbFyr]. Concurrently, order **AMA, ANA, ASMA, IgM, hepatitis B/C serologies, and liver function tests** (INR, albumin) to evaluate for PBC, PSC, autoimmune hepatitis, and viral hepatitis [^113z2Ems] [^112SSEsM]. Management is cause-specific: ursodeoxycholic acid for PBC, ERCP for obstruction, and urgent hepatology referral if ALP > 2× ULN with elevated bilirubin or if malignancy is suspected [^1161mNeW] [^114k6r3r] [^113XoUqa].

## Interpretation of laboratory results

| **Laboratory test** | **Patient result** | **Reference range** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Total bilirubin | 4.0 mg/dL | 0.1–1.2 mg/dL | Elevated |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) | 271 U/L | 44–147 U/L | Elevated |
| Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) | 35 U/L | 7–56 U/L | Normal |
| Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) | 61 U/L | 10–40 U/L | Mildly elevated |

---

The pattern shows **cholestatic injury** with a mixed component, as ALP and bilirubin are disproportionately elevated relative to AST/ALT [^116MrpTo].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for cholestatic liver injury includes:

- **Extrahepatic biliary obstruction**: Choledocholithiasis, biliary strictures, malignancy (cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer).
- **Intrahepatic cholestasis**: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), drug-induced liver injury (DILI), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV), infiltrative liver disease (sarcoidosis, lymphoma), ischemic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease [^112XLmib].

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Step 1: confirm and characterize the abnormality

- **Fractionate bilirubin**: Direct (conjugated) vs indirect (unconjugated) to distinguish hepatocellular/cholestatic from hemolytic or Gilbert's syndrome [^113iG5vj].
- **Confirm hepatic origin of ALP**: Measure gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT); elevation supports hepatobiliary source [^114k6r3r].
- **Repeat liver panel**: Confirm persistence and exclude lab error [^115PkWRv].

---

### Step 2: imaging studies

Obtain a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** as the first-line test to assess for biliary obstruction, gallstones, masses, or liver parenchymal abnormalities [^114k6r3r] [^116VCtcF]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or suggests obstruction, proceed to **MRCP or CT** to further delineate biliary anatomy and detect strictures or subtle masses [^114k6r3r] [^113BpbEZ] [^115Txxj6].

---

### Step 3: serological evaluation

- **Autoimmune markers**: AMA (for PBC), ANA, ASMA, IgM, IgG (for AIH, PBC, PSC) [^113z2Ems].
- **Viral hepatitis serologies**: HBV surface antigen, HCV antibody with reflex RNA [^113z2Ems].
- **Additional tests**: Ceruloplasmin, iron studies, alpha-1 antitrypsin levels as indicated [^113z2Ems].

---

### Step 4: consider liver biopsy

Indications include **unexplained cholestasis** after noninvasive evaluation, suspected autoimmune or infiltrative disease, or diagnostic uncertainty [^1156xFwp].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying etiology**:

| **Etiology** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Extrahepatic obstruction (stones, strictures, malignancy) | - ERCP with stone extraction or stenting <br/> - Surgical consultation for malignancy [^notfound] |
| Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) | Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 13–15 mg/kg/day; obeticholic acid for inadequate responders [^117GDdhd] |
| Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) | - No definitive medical therapy <br/> - ERCP for dominant strictures <br/> - Liver transplant evaluation if advanced [^notfound] |
| Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) | Discontinue offending agent; supportive care [^notfound] |
| Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) | Immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone ± azathioprine) [^notfound] |
| Viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) | Antiviral therapy (tenofovir/entecavir for HBV; direct-acting antivirals for HCV) [^112p3wzj] |

---

## Indications for urgent hepatology referral

Urgent hepatology referral is indicated for **ALP > 2× ULN with elevated bilirubin**, suspicion of malignancy, or evidence of acute liver failure (INR > 1.5, encephalopathy) [^113XoUqa] [^114Kk3U6].

---

## Prognostic implications

Persistent cholestasis with elevated ALP and bilirubin suggests **significant hepatobiliary disease** and is associated with worse outcomes, including progression to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and liver failure [^117GDdhd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Fractionate bilirubin and confirm hepatic ALP with GGT** [^113iG5vj] [^114k6r3r].
- **Obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound**; if inconclusive, proceed to MRCP or CT [^113BpbEZ] [^115Txxj6].
- **Order autoimmune markers, viral hepatitis serologies, and liver function tests (INR, albumin)** [^113z2Ems].
- **Consider liver biopsy if diagnosis remains unclear** [^1156xFwp].
- **Initiate cause-specific therapy and refer urgently to hepatology if indicated** [^114Kk3U6].

---

The patient's cholestatic pattern warrants a **structured workup** to distinguish obstruction from intrahepatic cholestasis, with imaging and serologies guiding targeted therapy and urgent hepatology referral if red flags are present.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^111LWiQR]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis — workup and evaluation outlines monitoring and diagnostic steps: "Monitor pattern of abnormal liver blood tests: AST, ALT, and bilirubin before each infusion and/or consider weekly if grade 1 LFT elevations. No treatment is recommended for grade 1 LFT abnormality". Medication review and metastasis assessment are advised, and "Liver biopsy should be considered if the patient is steroid-refractory or if concern for other differential diagnoses that would alter medical management". For higher grades, "Workup for other causes of elevated liver enzymes… by doing blood work and imaging (ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging). If suspicion for primary autoimmune hepatitis is high, can consider ANA/ASMA/ANCA. If patients with elevated ALKP alone, GGT should be tested. For isolated elevation of transaminases, consider checking CK for other etiologies".

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^116MUPTF]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The analysis from the BALLETS study was predicated on the identification of adults with established causes of liver disease such as autoimmune liver disease, viral hepatitis or metal storage disorders, which were found in just 5% of those with abnormal liver blood tests. Thus, these data would support a strategy of a streamlined panel with high sensitivity without generating large numbers of false positives, which have the potential to lead to greater patient anxiety, overinvestigation and considerably increased costs.

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, ALT, ALP and GGT, together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)

If there is clear indication of a specific clinical risk — for example, in high-risk groups such as injecting drug users, migrants from high prevalence areas or prisoners, then some aspects of second-line testing can be undertaken simultaneously. In many patients with liver damage an assessment of liver fibrosis is critical in making decisions about referral and management. In adults, clues to the level of liver fibrosis can be gleaned from the use of non-invasive algorithms such as the AST to ALT ratio. An AST:ALT ratio of > 1 indicates advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, hence the inclusion of this ratio in algorithms has the potential to assess the risk of significant fibrosis in adults with abnormal liver blood tests. However, non-invasive markers have not been sufficiently validated in children to be routinely applied in clinical practice.

An important consideration when evaluating the risk of hepatic fibrosis is that both AST and ALT can be normal even in the setting of cirrhosis, and the utility of the AST:ALT ratio in adults persists even if both values are within the normal reference interval. While it is hard to justify the routine analysis of both AST and ALT together on every liver blood test request, a strategy not supported by the data from the BALLETS study, subsequent testing of AST (or ALT depending which one is undertaken first) to calculate the AST:ALT ratio is clearly desirable. From a patient and cost perspective this is likely to be more cost-effective if performed by 'reflex' on the same sera following the detection of an abnormal ALT or GGT. To date there is no firm evidence that this is a cost-effective approach, although the results of a pilot study of such 'reflex' testing and additional up-front aetiology screen testing from Wales and Scotland are awaited.

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF NEW DATA ON THE MANAGEMENT OF PBC

Since the previous document was published, new data have emerged on approved therapies and treatment strategies with approved therapies that may improve disease management. This section will review these new data, analyze their clinical implications, and conclude with a practical treatment algorithm that incorporates these advances.

Definition of an inadequate biochemical response to UDCA

Response to UDCA has historically been assessed after 12 months of treatment according to various binary response criteria and quantitative prognostic scores. Lack of biochemical response is reported in 25%–50% of treated patients and has been associated with a > 5-fold increase in risk of progression to cirrhosis and a 3-fold increase in age-adjusted mortality. At this time, clinicians are encouraged to use 2 liver biochemistries as the anchor for clinical judgment when determining candidates for second-line therapy in PBC: ALP and bilirubin levels. If elevated above the ULN, bilirubin is more important than ALP for prognosis and in identifying advanced stage of PBC in the absence of Gilbert syndrome or another explanation. However, most patients will have elevated ALP levels rather than elevated bilirubin levels. For example, in a patient with a normal ALP, advanced fibrosis stage, and bilirubin > ULN, adding a second-line therapy can be considered. Additional factors to consider include the patient's age and acceptance of additional medications.

5.7	Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury, without findings of viral hepatitis, has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies approved for the treatment of MS, including OCREVUS. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes with elevated total bilirubin, have occurred from weeks to months after administration.

Patients treated with OCREVUS found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) with serum total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN are potentially at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with OCREVUS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], and monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment. Measure serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. If liver injury is present and an alternative etiology is not identified, discontinue OCREVUS.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

INTRODUCTION

Case scenario

A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension was seen for complaints of mild fatigue and pruritus for several months. The physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed alanine transaminase (ALT) = 44 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 45 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) = 650 U/L, total bilirubin = 0.8 mg/dL, serum albumin = 4 g/dL, and international normalized ratio = 1.0. Her symptoms and laboratory test results indicated primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) as a possibility.

PBC is a chronic, inflammatory, progressive autoimmune disease that, without treatment, can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure, resulting in liver-related death. A recent study sought to identify temporal trends in patients with PBC and disease characteristics over a 44-year period across a large international cohort of 4,805 patients with PBC. Patients were divided into 5 cohorts according to the year of diagnosis (1970–1979 [n = 143], 1980–1989 [n = 858], 1990–1999 [n = 1,754], 2000–2009 [n = 1,815], and 2010 and later [n = 235]). In recent decades, significantly more patients have presented with mild disease, according to both biochemical and histological definitions. In addition, decompensation rates significantly decreased, and 10-year transplant-free survival rates significantly increased over the 4 investigated decades. The authors postulated that these trends may, in part, be attributed to the increased routine use of serum liver biochemical tests. It would be expected that the availability of effective therapies may further accelerate these positive trends.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^113Fmaxq]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations

S1. The CFF recommends that annual labs [total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), platelet count] should be performed at a time of clinical stability for identification of hepatobiliary involvement in all PwCF starting at CF diagnosis.

CFHBI can manifest in childhood, adolescence, and/or adulthood. Liver test abnormalities may precede imaging abnormalitiesand correlate with fibrosis. Early identification of CFHBI affects care through staging, regular monitoring, and treatment. Common liver test abnormalities in CF may include elevations in serum AST, ALT, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase. Elevated conjugated bilirubin may occur in aCFLD or with biliary obstruction. Portal hypertension may also cause an absolute or relative thrombocytopenia if baseline thrombocytosis is present. Prior guidelines recommended further action at 1.5–2x upper limit of normal values for increased specificity. However, this, coupled with the use of high thresholds, can contribute to delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to use age and sex-normative values, and we recommend further evaluation if any abnormalities are persistent (> 3–6 mo). Few studies have evaluated the optimal timing and frequency of lab testing; however, the CFF recommends that these tests be performed on an annual basis beginning at CF diagnosis. Many PwCF have transient elevation of liver enzymes during systemic inflammation or antibiotic treatment; however, CFHBI is characterized by persistent liver test abnormalities, and annual screening should be performed during a time of relative clinical stability (eg, no active treatment for acute pulmonary exacerbation or infection). Calculation of liver fibrosis indices based on routine laboratory tests, including AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), fibrosis-4, and GGT-to-Platelet Ratio (GPR) can detect advanced fibrosis and portal hypertension and may be more specific than liver tests alone since they include platelet count. APRI is the most studied in CF and may be useful to identify aCFLD.– GPR may be particularly useful in detecting early biliary disease prior to significant hepatocyte injury. Optimal thresholds have not been broadly accepted in CF for any of the fibrosis indices, and therefore, the utility of these indices in screening PwCF for possible CFHBI or aCFLD is uncertain.

### Application of the latest advances in evidence-based medicine in primary biliary cholangitis [^117MPwoL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is becoming increasingly clear that our goal in treating PBC is evolving to target greater reductions in ALP and bilirubin than what was recommended in the past. It is our opinion that the goal after adding a second-line therapy for PBC is to achieve the lowest ALP level possible. We recommend that ALP response to UDCA be assessed 6–12 months after UDCA initiation and that the second-line therapy be considered (see the following section, Up-to-date PBC algorithm). It is also important to apply proper medical judgment and consider other factors when adding a second-line therapy. For instance, exposing an older patient with stage I disease and an ALP of 150 U/L to a second or third drug knowing that it will not alter their clinical course but will lower their ALP would not be the best approach. Given the recent restriction established on the use of OCA in patients with advanced cirrhosis, it is also important to restage the liver disease and carefully evaluate for signs of portal hypertension before starting OCA. Finally, it seems likely that our treatment goals in PBC will evolve over time to achieve complete biochemical remission (normal or near-normal ALP and bilirubin levels).

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### A cholestatic diagnostic dilemma [^113mH35x]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 28-year-old man with hereditary spherocytosis presented with abdominal pain and jaundice. He had severe, mainly conjugated (642 μmol/l), hyperbilirubinaemia (1033 μmol/l), with elevated liver enzymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (163 IU/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (gGT) (277 IU/l) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (358 IU/l). Abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed gallstones in the gallbladder but an absence of biliary duct dilation. Liver biopsy was consistent with cholestasis but showed no large duct obstruction. The cause of the cholestasis was unclear, was it a primary intrahepatic pathology or secondary to a posthepatic cause? He presented with similar symptoms days later with gallstones in the bile duct (choledocholithiasis) and underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and cholecystectomy. This report guides one through the assessment of jaundice and serves as an example whereby the diagnosis of a common cause of illness is blurred by an atypical clinical presentation and relevant comorbidities. A diagnosis of benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is also considered.

How is PSC diagnosed?

Consensus diagnostic criteria for PSC have been published as a workshop summary on behalf of the American College of Gastroenterology. Consensus guidelines relating to IgG4-SC, the biliary manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and on PSC/AIH variant syndrome, have also been published. A summary is outlined in figure 1.

Figure 1
Algorithm for the management of suspected primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Modes of presentation

Symptoms are rare in early disease. In more established cases, symptoms such as right upper quadrant pain, pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, fever and weight loss are present in 47–56% of patients. Patients usually present in one of several ways: (i) no symptoms or signs but with an incidental finding of abnormal liver biochemistry, (ii) biochemical screening of patients with newly diagnosed or pre-existing IBD, (iii) jaundice and pruritus secondary to cholestasis, (iv) cholangitis, (v) jaundice secondary to liver failure, (vi) variceal bleeding and/or ascites from portal hypertension or (vii) cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).

Blood tests

Serum liver biochemistry tests are abnormal in approximately 75% of patients with PSC. The most common pattern is of a cholestatic picture with raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. An elevated serum bilirubin is reported to be present in 28–40% and is a marker of poor prognosis, but this is likely to be an overestimate with more advanced cases reported by published series. An elevated ALP is a sensitive marker for diagnosis but is not specific. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are often mildly raised and do not necessarily suggest additional features of autoimmune hepatitis. As with other causes of liver disease, a raised AST > ALT may be an indicator of cirrhosis and poor prognosis. Other indicators of cirrhosis or portal hypertension include an elevated prothrombin time or international normalised ratio, low albumin and low platelets. There are no autoantibodies diagnostic of PSC. Serum perinuclear antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody is positive in 33–88% of those with PSC but is not specific and is not related to disease activity or prognosis.

### Abnormal liver tests in COVID-19: a retrospective observational cohort study of 1, 827 patients in a major U.S. hospital network [^112NwVNx]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality attributable to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Liver injury has been reported as a nonpulmonary manifestation of COVID-19, but characterization of liver test abnormalities and their association with clinical outcomes is incomplete.

Approach and Results

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the Yale-New Haven Health System between March 14, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics, liver tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total bilirubin [TBIL], and albumin) at three time points (preinfection baseline, admission, and peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, and death) were analyzed. Abnormal liver tests were commonly observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, both at admission (AST 66.9%, ALT 41.6%, ALP 13.5%, and TBIL 4.3%) and peak hospitalization (AST 83.4%, ALT 61.6%, ALP 22.7%, and TBIL 16.1%). Most patients with abnormal liver tests at admission had minimal elevations 1–2× the upper limit of normal (ULN; AST 63.7%, ALT 63.5%, ALP 80.0%, and TBIL 75.7%). A significant proportion of these patients had abnormal liver tests prehospitalization (AST 25.9%, ALT 38.0%, ALP 56.8%, and TBIL 44.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between abnormal liver tests and severe COVID-19, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death; associations with age, male sex, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus were also observed. Medications used in COVID-19 treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were associated with peak hospitalization liver transaminase elevations > 5× ULN.

Conclusions

Abnormal liver tests occur in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.

Case report

A 73-year-old man, who had been in good health, received a diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping mutation on 18 April 2023. Figure 1 A displays a mass measuring 68 × 56 mm located in the lower lobe of the right lung. He refuted having any previous medical conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, liver ailments, or contagious illnesses like tuberculosis. The patient did not have any previous cases of cancer or other illnesses in their family, nor did they have any past drug or food allergies. The patient has experienced intermittent cough, dry cough without phlegm, chest tightness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, low-grade fever, night sweats, hoarseness, palpitations, and other forms of discomfort since the beginning of the illness. On April 27 2023 (Day 0), his liver function was within the normal range (Fig. 2 A), the laboratory results showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 35 U/L (normal range, 7–40 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 27 U/L (normal range, 13–35 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at 73 U/L (normal range, 50–135 U/L), total bilirubin (TBil) at 10.1 µmol/L (normal value, 3.4–20.4 µmol/L), and direct bilirubin (DBil) at 4.6 µmol/L (normal value, 0–6.8 µmol/L). The following day (Day 1), he was administered savolitinib (400 mg per day, oral) for targeted therapy, based on his weight of 48 Kg (less than 50 Kg). The patient experienced back pain and discomfort in the legs as a result of taking oral medication. Consequently, the patient independently decided to decrease the dosage (300 mg per day, oral) starting from May 17 2023 (Day 20).

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^114SbPka]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".

Hepatotoxicity can occur with COTELLIC.

The incidences of Grade 3 or 4 liver laboratory abnormalities in Trial 1 among patients receiving COTELLIC with vemurafenib compared to patients receiving vemurafenib were: 11% vs. 5% for alanine aminotransferase, 8% vs. 2.1% for aspartate aminotransferase, 1.6% vs. 1.2% for total bilirubin, and 7% vs. 3.3% for alkaline phosphatase [see Adverse Drug Reactions (6.1)]. Concurrent elevation in ALT > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin > 2 × ULN in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase > 2 × ULN occurred in one patient (0.4%) receiving COTELLIC with vemurafenib and no patients receiving single-agent vemurafenib.

In Trial 2, in patients with histiocytic neoplasms, 9% of the patients receiving COTELLIC experienced grade 3 or 4 aspartate aminotransferase increased and 5% of the patients experienced grade 3 or 4 alanine aminotransferase increased.

Monitor liver laboratory tests before initiation of COTELLIC and monthly during treatment, or more frequently as clinically indicated. Manage Grade 3 and 4 liver laboratory abnormalities with dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of COTELLIC [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone controlled clinical trial database to date [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed. Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride therapy. In patients with abnormal liver tests, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be initiated with caution.

Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations (serum ALT greater than three times the ULN) and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause.

MASLD and AIH can co-exist. Steatosis (usually mild) is present in 13–35%% of patients with AIH on diagnostic biopsy. This probably reflects the high population prevalence of MASLD. Its prognostic implications are unclear. Twelve patients with AIH plus steatohepatitis on diagnostic biopsy had higher adverse outcome rates, than did 61 patients with AIH and simple steatosis. However, based on larger cohorts, the influence of steatosis on disease progression and mortality remains unresolved.

For differentiation of AIH from primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), see Section N.

In liver congestion (from cardiac disease or hepatic vein obstruction) presentation is usually indolent, with serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin increasing more than transaminases. In acute congestion serum transaminases might be markedly raised; often serum ALT more than AST and often also with raised serum lactate dehydrogenase. If the cause is cardiac, the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins are enlarged. If the hepatic vein is obstructed, its flow is reduced or absent.

Ischaemic liver injury is suggested first, by the presence of cardiac or respiratory disease, and second, by an acute precipitant (hypotension, sepsis). If acute, serum transaminases can be over 1000, but then usually fall rapidly.

Wilson's disease needs consideration in suspected AIH, especially in young people. As with AIH, clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic abnormalities to liver failure. Serum caeruloplasmin, 24-hour urinary copper excretion and, if abnormal, slit-lamp eye examination and genetic screening, should be performed but do not always exclude Wilson's disease.

Liver histology in Wilson's disease includes many abnormalities, none of them specific. Occasionally, the appearances even suggest AIH. If there is any suspicion, we suggest measuring copper level in liver biopsy tissue, sometimes urgently. This is the most reliable test for Wilson's disease. Histochemical staining for copper or copper-associated proteins is insufficiently specific and can be seen in cholestatic disorders. A Wilson's disease scoring systemcan also be used in cases of doubt.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

Introduction

While the number of deaths from other common conditions is falling in the UK, those due to liver disease have been increasing dramatically, with a 400% increase in the standardised mortality rate over the period 1970–2010. Notably, for those patients younger than 65, the rise in standardised mortality rate for liver disease is > 500%, such that it now constitutes the fifth biggest cause of premature mortalitywith 64 000 years of working life lost every year. For morbidity, in England and Wales, 57 682 hospital admissions and 10 948 deaths were due to liver disease in 20 12. This rising burden of liver disease is mainly a reflection of the three the most common causes: alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis, although autoimmune liver disease is also a significant contributor. The burden of liver disease in children differs from that in adults, as although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in all ages, reflecting the rise in childhood obesity, disease associated with injecting drug use and alcohol are rarely encountered. However, viral hepatitis is seen as a consequence of perinatal transmission, and its chronicity contributes to the disease burden seen in adults. Other causes of liver disease, such as biliary atresia or metabolic disorders, present almost exclusively in infancy or childhood, but progressive liver disease continues to evolve throughout childhood and into adulthood. There are concerted efforts to deal with this rising tide of liver disease such as the Lancet Commission on Liver Disease, the Alcohol Health Alliance and the Obesity Health Alliance.

Liver disease develops silently; there may be no signs or symptoms until the complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. At this late, often pre-terminal stage, the tests of liver function — bilirubin, albumin, international normalised ratio (INR) and platelet count — may be abnormal. In necro-inflammatory hepatitic diseases liver enzymes are frequently elevated, whereas in apoptotic diseases including fatty liver disease (alcohol and non-alcohol related), liver enzymes may be normal or elevated, but the degree of abnormality is not related to the stage of progression from simple fatty liver, through progressive fibrosis to cirrhosis. Since the current liver blood tests were developed in the 1950s, they have been the mainstay of liver disease identification, with the result that many patients with liver disease are not identified until they have developed significant liver fibrosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^112kzRmb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis" for alcohol-related liver disease.

The diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with this specific form of liver disease. The target patient population includes individuals with a history of heavy alcohol use and presenting symptoms consistent with liver disease.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include five key elements. The first is the rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications. The second component is a serum total bilirubin level greater than 51 mcmol/L or 3 mg/dL. The third element involves elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), specifically, these should be more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but less than 400 U/L, with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1.5. The fourth component requires documentation of heavy alcohol use until 8 weeks before the onset of symptoms. The final element is the exclusion of other liver diseases.

The diagnostic criteria are met if all five components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are not met. This tool aids clinicians in accurately diagnosing alcoholic hepatitis, thereby facilitating appropriate treatment and management of the condition.

The purpose of this tool is to determine whether the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are met, based on specific clinical indicators and patient history. It involves selecting relevant criteria from a list that focuses on liver function and alcohol consumption history. Here are the criteria used for the assessment:

- Rapid development or worsening of jaundice and liver-related complications.
- Serum total bilirubin greater than 51 micromoles per liter (mcmol/L) or 3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).
- Elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal but less than 400 units per liter (U/L), with an AST/ALT ratio greater than 1.5.
- Documentation of heavy alcohol use up to 8 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
- Exclusion of other liver diseases.

The tool checks each selected option against these criteria. If all five conditions are met, the result is that the diagnostic criteria for alcoholic hepatitis are confirmed. If any one or more of these criteria are not satisfied, the tool concludes that the criteria are not fully met. This method allows for a systematic and comprehensive assessment based on user inputs regarding each specified criterion.

### Clinical approach to patients with obstructive jaundice [^111XyaWC]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### Abiraterone acetate [^111TpKrc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 X ULN is unknown.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Workup and management of immune-mediated hepatobiliary pancreatic toxicities that develop during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment [^113CVhyC]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma. Workup and management of immune-mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis that develops during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment can be challenging. Immune-mediated hepatitis can be particularly challenging if patients have underlying viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with positive hepatitis B virus DNA should be referred to a hepatologist for antiviral therapy prior to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. With untreated hepatitis C virus (HCV) and elevated liver enzymes, a liver biopsy should be obtained to differentiate between HCV infection and immune-mediated hepatitis due to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. If autoimmune serologies are negative, then this supports a case of immune-mediated hepatitis secondary to anti-PD-1 therapy, rather than autoimmune hepatitis. In this case, an empiric steroid therapy is reasonable; however, if the patient does not respond to steroid therapy in 3–5days, then liver biopsy should be pursued. The incidence of immune checkpoint-induced pancreatitis is low, but when it does occur, diagnosis is not straightforward. Although routine monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is not generally recommended, when pancreatitis is suspected, serum levels of amylase and lipase should be checked. Once confirmed, a steroid or other immunosuppressant (if steroids are contraindicated) should be administered along with close monitoring, and a slow tapering dosage once the pancreatitis is under control. Patients should then be monitored for recurrent pancreatitis. Finally, immune therapy-related cholangitis involves elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase and, once diagnosed, is managed in the same way as immune-mediated hepatitis. KEY POINTS: Immune-mediated hepatitis, pancreatitis, and cholangitis are found in patients receiving or who have previously received immune checkpoint inhibitors. To work up immune-mediated hepatitis, viral, and autoimmune serologies, liver imaging will help to differentiate immune-mediated hepatitis from hepatitis of other etiology. Hepatology consult may be considered in patients with a history of chronic liver disease who developed hepatitis during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Liver biopsy should be considered to clarify the diagnosis for case in which the hepatitis is refractory to steroid or immunosuppressant treatment. Immune-mediated pancreatitis is treated with steroid or other immunosuppressant with a slow tapering and should be monitored for recurrence.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: the child with an incidental finding of elevated aminotransferases [^113gzBjz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

It is not unusual to encounter abnormal liver enzyme levels on routine blood tests. When the abnormal elevation in aminotransferases persist, they require prompt and appropriate investigations as liver diseases in children are often insidious in onset and clinically silent. This article aims to provide (1) an explanation to the aetiologies of elevated aminotransferases; (2) an investigational approach to these children and (3) an insight into further investigations performed at a liver centre.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^1171BpVY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

MANAGEMENT OF LIVER INVOLVEMENT IN COVID-19

The majority of patients with COVID-19 have no or mild liver function abnormalities during the illness. In mild COVID-19, hepatic damage may be transient and generally returns to normal without any special measures. Thus, management is generally supportive with monitoring of LFTs. A summary of the liver management and recommendations are given in Table 4. –

Table 4
Management of liver disease in COVID-19

Diagnostic aspects.

Liver function tests and abdominal imaging are the primary investigations done in relation to liver involvement in COVID-19 patients. Liver biochemistry including the liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum bilirubin, albumin, and PT should be monitored for diagnosing liver damage. However, the reasons for derangement of these blood tests are multifactorial and systemic inflammatory response because of COVID-19 may play a greater role than liver injury. Nevertheless, the liver tests should be performed during admission to establish a baseline and also to identify patients with suspected or known underlying liver disease. Further biochemical investigations may be needed in patients with known liver disease for example, known hepatitis B, C, and so on. The optimal interval for undertaking LFTs is uncertain. It has been suggested that LFTs be monitored at least twice weekly in COVID-19 patients receiving potential liver-toxic medications, whereas those with abnormal LFT results or with preexisting liver disease should be monitored more frequently. Increased serum AST and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with normal ALT levels should raise the suspicion of alternative diagnoses such as skeletal muscle or myocardial injury. Abnormal LFTs are frequently noted at admission before antiviral treatment of COVID-19 is commenced. Abnormal LFTs at the onset of a COVID-19 infection may indicate underlying chronic liver disease (CLD)and the treating physicians should take this into account. The imaging modalities include abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scans. The imaging findings are nonspecific and are usually indicated when there is suspicion of portal venous thrombosis or biliary obstruction.

### Abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) [^11578QKq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate–associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3–4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10X ULN is unknown.

### Evaluating elevated liver chemistry test results… [^112LzhZW]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Because normal values for serum biochemical tests are defined by the mean of the distribution plus or minus two standard deviations among a healthy population, 2. 5 percent of healthy persons will have abnormal test elevations. In addition, because a normal value does not exclude the possibility of hepatic disease, test results must be interpreted in the context of the individual patient, and a detailed history, physical examination, and medication review are required. Important factors in this evaluation include risk factors for liver disease, medications associated with liver chemistry abnormalities, comorbid conditions, alcohol consumption, and other evidence of liver disease. This information base may appropriately direct the examination toward establishing specific diagnoses. When no clues exist or a diagnosis cannot be confirmed, an algorithm for evaluation of liver test abnormalities can be useful.

Elevated serum aminotransferase levels indicate the need to test for common hepatic diseases with noninvasive testing. If these results are negative, further testing should be based on the clinical situation. Clinical follow-up and serial serum liver chemistry testing is important. If aminotransferase elevations are persistent or marked, or if there is evidence of liver disease, a more complete diagnostic effort is required, which may include radiologic testing and liver biopsy. Hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by hepatocellular, cholestatic, or metabolic diseases and requires further evaluation. Initial evaluation should identify whether hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia in an asymptomatic patient may indicate Gilbert's syndrome, hemolysis, or a medication adverse effect.

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the presence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level warrants evaluation for biliary obstruction with ultrasonography. An elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level in the presence of normal aminotransferase levels warrants testing of γ-glutamyl-transferase or 5-nucleotidase testing. If these results are negative, some other etiology should be sought for the elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level outside of the hepatobiliary tract. If these results are positive, further testing is necessary to look for biliary obstruction, medication adverse effects, or primary biliary cirrhosis. The authors conclude that mild liver abnormalities found in patients who appear to be healthy can be followed up closely if initial testing for common liver disease is negative. Further evaluation is essential in patients who have significant symptoms, chronic or serious liver disease, and marked laboratory abnormalities.
