## Question

Up titration of opioids

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about opioid up-titration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that govern opioid titration. Then, I should verify the initial assessment and baseline documentation requirements. Next, I will review when to consider up-titration versus tapering or rotation. After that, I need to check dose-escalation thresholds and monitoring cadence. Then, I will examine titration specifics by formulation and special populations. Finally, I should confirm risk mitigation, documentation, and follow-up plans, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't jump to conclusions: opioid therapy should start at the lowest effective dose, be individualized to patient-specific risks and benefits, and be embedded in a comprehensive pain plan emphasizing function and nonopioid modalities. I need to ensure I'm not implying rigid MME thresholds, because guidelines frame thresholds as guideposts rather than absolutes and warn against inflexible application that can cause harm [^112U4wgZ] [^112dgYFH] [^115ZPDJx].

> I should double-check the initial assessment and baseline documentation before any titration: establish measurable pain and functional goals, screen for mental health and substance use disorders, review PDMP and urine drug testing, and document comorbidities and concomitant sedatives. I need to ensure I capture renal and hepatic function because these alter opioid clearance and safety margins, and I should confirm that patients receive overdose education and naloxone when indicated [^112U4wgZ] [^115ZPDJx] [^113sLZsH] [^111G6MHr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about increasing the dose. I should verify whether up-titration is appropriate by reassessing benefits versus risks, including whether pain and function improved meaningfully with the current dose, whether adverse effects are manageable, and whether there are red flags such as aberrant behaviors or high-risk combinations like benzodiazepines. If benefits do not outweigh risks, I need to consider tapering or opioid rotation rather than escalation [^112U4wgZ] [^115rdtcY] [^116E4edc].

> Next, I should review dose-escalation thresholds and monitoring cadence. I need to ensure I'm precise here: before exceeding 50 MME/day, I should pause and carefully reassess benefits and risks, and I should generally avoid exceeding 90 MME/day unless there is a compelling, individualized justification and close monitoring. Wait, I almost said "never exceed 90 MME", but the guideline language is "avoid" and "carefully justify", not an absolute prohibition, so I should correct that and emphasize shared decision-making and documentation of rationale. For follow-up, I should re-evaluate within 1–4 weeks after initiation or escalation, with shorter intervals when ER/LA agents are started or increased or when total daily dose is ≥ 50 MME/day, and for methadone I should consider follow-up every 2–3 days initially due to accumulation risk [^112U4wgZ] [^112dgYFH].

> I will now examine titration specifics by formulation. For immediate-release opioids, I should confirm that titration is conservative and symptom-driven, often in 25–50% increments based on response and tolerability, whereas for extended-release formulations I need to ensure steady state is reached before changing dose, for example oxycodone ER reaches steady state in 24–36 hours and oxymorphone ER in about 3 days. Methadone requires special caution due to long, variable half-life and delayed accumulation, so I should titrate no more often than every 5–7 days and monitor closely for sedation and QT effects. Buprenorphine titration should be incremental and mindful of precipitated withdrawal if converting from full agonists, with cross-titration strategies when appropriate [^115Geyfk] [^112nGnPM] [^113S4ncv] [^112HGFt4].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a special population? I need to ensure dose adjustments reflect organ function and vulnerability: in older adults or those with renal or hepatic impairment, I should start low and go slow, often reducing initial doses by 25–50% and extending intervals. For example, oxymorphone exposure increases substantially in renal impairment, and morphine active metabolites can accumulate in renal failure, so I should avoid or markedly reduce doses of certain agents and consider alternatives like methadone in renal impairment when appropriate. In pregnancy, I should titrate to the lowest effective dose recognizing physiologic changes and coordinate prenatal care [^112uCNbo] [^112kFuNT] [^111EfdGe] [^113CD3gn].

> I should confirm risk mitigation steps during up-titration: co-prescribed benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants increase overdose risk, so I need to deprescribe or minimize them when possible. I should provide naloxone and overdose education, consider abuse-deterrent formulations when available, and use PDMP checks and urine drug testing to detect high-risk combinations or diversion. If I find aberrant behaviors or OUD features, I should pivot to tapering or medication for opioid use disorder rather than escalating the dose [^113sLZsH] [^1133c3WL] [^115ZPDJx] [^115z74DU].

> Next, I should review documentation and follow-up. I need to ensure the rationale for dose escalation, the MME calculation, and the risk–benefit discussion are recorded, and I should schedule reassessment within 1–4 weeks, with closer follow-up after ER/LA starts or when dose reaches or exceeds 50 MME/day. I should verify that functional goals are tracked and that nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies are optimized in parallel, adjusting the plan based on patient response and preferences [^112U4wgZ] [^115ZPDJx].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency: up-titration is appropriate when there is documented improvement in pain and function with acceptable tolerability, when risks are mitigated, and when shared decision-making supports escalation. I should titrate by the smallest practical increment, respect diminishing returns above 50 MME/day, and avoid routine escalation beyond 90 MME/day without strong justification. If benefits plateau or risks rise, I should pivot to tapering or opioid rotation rather than continued escalation, aligning with guideline-based, patient-centered care [^112U4wgZ] [^115rdtcY] [^116E4edc].

Up-titration of opioids should be **slow and individualized**, with **reassessment at 1–4 weeks** [^112U4wgZ] after initiation or dose change, and more frequent follow-up (every 2–3 days) if methadone is used or total dose is ≥ 50 MME/day [^112U4wgZ]. Use the **lowest effective dose** [^115PSmeW], avoid exceeding 90 MME/day [^113sLZsH] without strong justification, and increase by the smallest practical amount (typically 25–50%) [^11729RfA] while monitoring for benefit, function, and harms [^112U4wgZ]. If benefits plateau or harms outweigh benefits, taper or rotate opioids [^116E4edc]; for high-risk patients, consider buprenorphine [^115ZRwVG] or naloxone co-prescribing [^115z74DU].

---

## Indications for up-titration

Up-titration is appropriate when:

- **Inadequate analgesia**: Persistent pain despite current dose [^113X3gKr].
- **Functional improvement**: Potential for improved function or quality of life with higher dose [^notfound].
- **Tolerance**: Development of tolerance requiring higher doses for same effect [^111MaKGH].

---

## Recommended titration strategies

### General principles

- **Lowest effective dose**: Start low and titrate slowly [^115PSmeW] [^115ZPDJx].
- **Incremental increases**: Adjust by the smallest practical amount (typically 25–50%) [^11729RfA].
- **Reassessment**: Re-evaluate benefits and harms within 1–4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation [^112U4wgZ] [^115p9pKa].

---

### Specific guidelines by opioid formulation

| **Opioid formulation** | **Titration guidance** |
|-|-|
| Immediate-release (IR) opioids | - Reassess every 1–4 weeks [^112U4wgZ] <br/> - Increase by 25–50% as needed [^11729RfA] |
| Extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids | - Reassess every 1–4 weeks [^112U4wgZ] <br/> - Increase by 25–50% as needed [^115Geyfk] |
| Methadone | - Reassess every 2–3 days initially [^112U4wgZ] <br/> - Increase by 2.5–5 mg every 5–7 days [^notfound] |
| Buprenorphine | - Titrate by 150 mcg every 4 days as needed [^1164sMH6] |

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure **safe and effective titration**:

- **Pain and function**: Assess pain severity, functional status, and quality of life at each visit [^112U4wgZ] [^113AkaFm].
- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, and cognitive impairment [^notfound].
- **Misuse and dependence**: Screen for opioid use disorder (OUD) and aberrant behaviors [^112U4wgZ] [^1133c3WL].
- **Drug interactions**: Review concomitant medications, especially CNS depressants [^115ZRwVG].

---

## Dose escalation thresholds

While no absolute maximum dose applies universally, **guidelines recommend caution** at higher doses:

- **≥ 50 MME/day**: Overdose risk doubles; reassess benefits and risks carefully [^112U4wgZ] [^116QA6sk].
- **≥ 90 MME/day**: Generally avoid unless justified; document rationale [^112YGCqe] [^113sLZsH].
- **Diminishing returns**: Higher doses often yield diminishing benefits relative to risks [^115PSmeW] [^112dgYFH].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal/hepatic impairment**: Adjust doses and titrate slowly due to altered metabolism [^112uCNbo].
- **Elderly patients**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity [^1126CHor] [^115bZfD2].
- **Pregnancy**: Titrate to the lowest effective dose, balancing maternal pain control and fetal safety [^113CD3gn].

---

## Alternative strategies

If up-titration fails or causes adverse effects, consider **opioid rotation** [^116E4edc] to another opioid at a lower equianalgesic dose [^112dgYFH] or tapering to a lower dose or discontinuation [^1131a63e]. Buprenorphine may be used as a **bridge** during tapering or for patients at high risk of overdose [^1144VtjG] [^115ZRwVG].

---

## Documentation and patient education

Clinicians should **document the rationale** for dose changes, including benefits, risks, and patient preferences [^112U4wgZ]. Provide education on overdose risk, safe storage, and disposal of unused medications [^115z74DU].

---

Up-titration of opioids should be **individualized and evidence-based**, with careful monitoring of benefits and harms. Use the lowest effective dose, titrate slowly, and reassess regularly to optimize pain control while minimizing risks [^115ZPDJx].

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

Methadone — initiation, dosing principles, and monitoring: Methadone should be initiated and adjusted by, or in consultation with, a practitioner who has the relevant knowledge and expertise; if a provider with clinical experience is not available, then another long-acting opioid may be used until such consultation is obtained. Dose titration should occur after at least 5–7 days on a designated dose (in the large majority of cases), and careful consideration must be given to potential drug interactions and to the potential for QT prolongation. Methadone is considered to be safe in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment but should be used with caution in end-stage disease cases of these conditions. There are a number of methods available that use conversion ratios to initiate or titrate methadone; no single method is considered superior to others, and titration should be based on patient response and not solely based on equianalgesic dosing tables. Monitoring ECG for QTc interval prolongation is recommended based upon certain clinical scenarios.

Methadone initial dosing and titration strategies — gradual titration for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) and situations necessitating less frequent monitoring uses an initial methadone dose of 2.5 mg every 12 hr or 8 hr with increments of 2.5 mg every 12 hr or 8 hr, no more often than every 5 to 7 d, with the comment, As a general rule, start low and go slow. Faster titration for cancer pain and situations where frequent monitoring is possible uses an initial methadone dose of 2.5–5 mg every 8 hr with increments of 2.5 to 5 mg every 8 hr as often as every third day. All doses refer to oral administration; abbreviations: CNCP: chronic non-cancer pain; d: day(s); hr: hour(s); mg: milligram(s).

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^113MAQxw]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine's guidelines have been updated to develop more detailed guidance for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain with opioids.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane Review, and Google Scholar without publication date limits. Of 264,617 articles' titles screened and abstracts reviewed, 263 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, a total of 157 were of high and moderate quality addressing pain treatment. Comprehensive literature reviews were accomplished with article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel to develop evidence-based guidance.

Recommendations

No quality evidence directly supports histories, physical examinations, and opioid treatment agreements, although they are thought to be important. No quality trials were identified showing superiority of opioids, compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and other medications for treatment of chronic, noncancer pain. The use of opioid-sparing treatments associated with lower doses of postoperative opioids is also associated with better long-term functional outcomes. Selective use of opioids is recommended for patients with acute and postoperative pain. Consensus recommendations also include consideration of carefully conducted trials of chronic opioid treatment for highly select patients with subacute and chronic pain and to maintenance opioid prescriptions only if documented objective functional gain(s) results. A strong and reproducible dose-response relationship identifies a recommended morphine equivalent dose limit of no more than 50 mg/day. Higher doses should be prescribed only with documented commensurately greater functional benefit(s), comprehensive monitoring for adverse effects, informed consent, and careful consideration of risk versus benefit of such treatment. Chronic opioid use should be accompanied by informed consent, a treatment agreement, tracking of functional benefits, drug screening, and attempts at tapering.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1126CHor]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP opioid prescribing guidelines — older adults on chronic opioid therapy: Chronic opioid therapy in older adults may be associated with multiple adverse effects related to reduced hepatic and renal function, increased susceptibility to accumulation of opioids within a small therapeutic window, exacerbation of cognitive impairment, increased risk of medication errors, risk of falls, and finally, multiple comorbidities related to medical conditions and other drug therapies. While opioid therapy can improve the QOL in this population, it is essential to exercise additional caution in older adults when providing chronic opioid therapy, and pharmacological titration must be carefully adjusted due to declining organ function, presence of concurrent diseases, and polypharmacy.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^115jevsq]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the safe and effective use of opioids have been proposed by several professional organizations (eg, American Pain Society, American Academy of Pain Medicine) and expert panels.–However, the clinical practice of opioid rotation is predominantly guided by arbitrary routine, clinician preference, or formulary limitations. Expert opinion and consensus statements concur that there is generally a lack of high-quality evidence to support the practice of opioid rotation or to guide the selection of a new opioid when dose adjustments with the present opioid regimen cannot resolve increasing adverse effects or waning efficacy.–

The objectives of this review are to provide steps toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation with which clinicians can choose the new opioid based on a thoughtful assessment of the likely causes of the adverse effects or poor efficacy with the present therapy. This discussion is limited to opioids appropriate for long-term therapy for chronic pain.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^113X3gKr]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP chronic non-cancer pain opioid prescribing — initiation and dose titration: Opioid medications should be started at low doses and titrated gradually to higher levels if necessary, with efforts to maintain patients on the lowest clinically effective dose; doses of other CNS depressants should be adjusted if possible, and combinations of short- and long-acting opioids or higher doses of long-acting opioids should be prescribed with caution. Once medical necessity is established, opioid therapy may be initiated using low doses and short-acting drugs, with appropriate monitoring to provide effective relief and avoid side effects. Evidence Level: Moderate; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate to Strong. Long-acting opioids should not be utilized for the initiation of opioid therapy. Evidence Level: Strong; Strength of Recommendation: Strong.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^117DDhiY]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ACOEM opioids — tapering and adverse effects note variable taper schedules, limited evidence for safe long‑term prescribing without dose escalation, and high rates of adverse effects and trial discontinuation: rates of tapering opioids mostly range from 10% per week to 50% per day; there is no quality literature to identify which patients can be safely prescribed opioids without escalation of dose or other adverse risks; this has caused a downgrading of the level of evidence from "C" to "I"; approximately 80% of patients experience some adverse effects from opioids and approximately 33% to 80% do not finish a clinical trial due primarily to adverse effects.

---

### Guideline for opioid therapy and chronic noncancer pain [^116cPYSD]. CMAJ (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to tapering and discontinuation, CMA 2017 guidelines recommend to consider tapering opioids to the lowest effective dose, potentially including discontinuation, in patients with chronic non-cancer pain currently using ≥ 90 mg/day morphine equivalents.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^117WLQbz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Module B: initiation of treatment with opioids — candidates for opioids with consent "begin a trial in conjunction with comprehensive pain care plan". Clinicians are directed to "Initiate opioids using the following approach:" including "Use short duration (e.g., 1-week initial prescription)", "Plan to reevaluate at 30 days or fewer", "Use lowest effective dose, recognizing that no dose is completely safe", "A strategy of escalating dose to achieve benefit increases risk… and has not been shown to improve function", "Long-acting opioids should not be prescribed for opioid-naive individuals", "Consider alternatives to methadone and transdermal fentanyl", "Assess improvement in pain and functional status and adverse effects", "Complete risk mitigation strategies (see Sidebar E)", and "Provide medication and overdose education, offer naloxone prescription". Early follow-up is specified: "Reevaluate as needed clinically and based on patient risk factors (e.g., 1–4 weeks after initiation of opioids, not later than 30 days)", and clinicians should "Review and optimize comprehensive pain care plan (e.g., non-opioid treatments, self-management strategies)".

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112kFuNT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Short-acting opioids — morphine: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 10 to 30 mg every 4 hr. There is no optimal or maximum dose of morphine; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 30, Peak (min): 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 5, and t½ (hr): 2 to 4 in adults. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated give with extreme caution and use a lower dose; for hepatic dysfunction use carefully in patients with cirrhosis and consider reducing dose or extending dosing interval by 1.5 to 2 times, noting half-life may be doubled (3 to 4 hr) and bioavailability is increased; and for renal dysfunction reduce dose or, if severe renal impairment exists, avoid use. Other considerations include that M6G, an active metabolite, may accumulate in renal impairment, and M3G, a metabolite without analgesic activity, may accumulate in renal impairment and has been implicated in morphine-induced neurotoxicity, hyperalgesia, and allodynia.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^111EfdGe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to patients with renal/hepatic impairment, ASCO 2022 guidelines recommend to consider switching to methadone, if not contraindicated, in patients with renal impairment currently treated with an opioid. Titrate opioids primarily eliminated in the urine, such as fentanyl, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, and obtain frequent monitoring for risk or accumulation of the parent drug or active metabolites. Avoid using morphine, meperidine, codeine, and tramadol in these patients, unless there are no alternatives.

### Nurse-led telephone follow-up intervention for titrating and tapering opioids in chronic pain patients – A feasibility study [^115ijWdW]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) often have complex pain conditions, and some patients spend years searching for effective treatment. Over the past 20 years, the use of opioids for CNCP has increased worldwide. With the opioid epidemic, governments and health-care personnel call for safer and better ways of treating pain with opioids. Although opioids may be effective in reducing acute pain and pain intensity, this type of drug is debated in chronic pain management due to long-term side effects, as well as the risk of misuse, addiction, and overdose death. Therefore, treatment with opioids for chronic pain must have a holistic and longitudinal approach considering treatment effects, side effects, and biopsychosocial aspects affecting the pain condition.

Treatment with opioids requires a comprehensive treatment plan including functional goals, titration or tapering schedules, regularly scheduled follow-ups (according to the patients' needs), and interventions for expected side effects or abstinences. An interdisciplinary approach can ensure safety, firm frames, and control over opioid consumption and side effects. The Norwegian Directorate of Health defines the nurse's role as a part of the interdisciplinary team in outpatient pain clinics, and specifies that nurses have knowledge and skills to contribute to the treatment of patients with CNCP. However, following up the treatment plan for titrating or tapering opioids requires that nurses have comprehensive medical knowledge and a biopsychosocial understanding of the effects and problems related to opioids. Communication skills are essential, as nurses need to address the patients' expectations, goals of treatment, possible risk factors, and alternative medication, as well as individually assess and discuss if the positive outcomes overweigh negative side effects.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^111nnAgE]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASIPP guidelines — Continuation and maintenance phase: After initiation of opioid therapy and stable maintenance for 8 to 12 weeks with appropriate outcomes, it is important to arrive at a conclusion to either continue or to discontinue the opioids. If persistent or new pain is present, a comprehensive evaluation can be repeated or a specialist referral made; if there is any indication of abuse, misuse, lack of analgesia or activity, adverse effects, or aberrant behavior, the physician may consider tapering or discontinuing therapy after careful assessment. Per prior CDC recommendations, physicians should evaluate for a 30% benefit in pain and function with opioid treatment and ensure there is no misuse/abuse or major adverse effects. If treatment is successful, intermittent dose reduction may be considered to test a lower dose, and if continuing therapy is necessary, close patient monitoring is imperative.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115EkWDS]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to opioids, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to prescribe the lowest effective dosage when initiating opioids for acute pain in opioid-naïve patients. Assess individual benefits and risks carefully when considering increasing dosage, and avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to the patient.

### High-dose opioids for chronic non-cancer pain: an overview of cochrane reviews [^117V74k2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pain is typically described as pain on most days for at least three months. Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is any chronic pain that is not due to a malignancy. Chronic non-cancer pain in adults is a common and complex clinical issue where opioids are routinely used for pain management. There are concerns that the use of high doses of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain lacks evidence of effectiveness and may increase the risk of adverse events.

Objectives

To describe the evidence from Cochrane Reviews and Overviews regarding the efficacy and safety of high-dose opioids (here defined as 200 mg morphine equivalent or more per day) for chronic non-cancer pain.

Methods

We identified Cochrane Reviews and Overviews through a search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library). The date of the last search was 18 April 2017. Two review authors independently assessed the search results. We planned to analyse data on any opioid agent used at high dose for two weeks or more for the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain in adults.

Main Results

We did not identify any reviews or overviews meeting the inclusion criteria. The excluded reviews largely reflected low doses or titrated doses where all doses were analysed as a single group; no data for high dose only could be extracted.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a critical lack of high-quality evidence regarding how well high-dose opioids work for the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults, and regarding the presence and severity of adverse events. No evidence-based argument can be made on the use of high-dose opioids, i.e. 200 mg morphine equivalent or more daily, in clinical practice. Trials typically used doses below our cut-off; we need to know the efficacy and harm of higher doses, which are often used in clinical practice.

### Comparison between two methods of intravenous titration of morphine: optimizing BI mode of patient-controlled analgesia versus conventional method… [^116YwqR1]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract 204 Background: The titration of opioids to the optimal dose without side effects is an important and essential gateway in cancer pain management. However, sufficient pain control may not be achievable until the titration is complete because the change in the dose of opioids is calculated based on the opioid demand over the previous 24 hours. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study. After randomization, the previously administered opioids were switched to intravenous morphine and dose titration was initiated. In the conventional group, the dosage of continuous infusion morphine over the next day was adjusted based on the total amount of morphine administered during the previous 24 hours. In the PCA group, morphine titration was performed by increasing or decreasing the background infusion rate immediately in accordance with the frequency and interval of pressing the bolus button.

The patients received pain management in this manner for at least three days and we compared the two groups by collecting their pain-related outcomes via medical records and questionnaires. Results: A total of 39 patients were enrolled, of whom 20 were assigned to the conventional group and 19 to the PCA group. The number of breakthrough pain complaints by patients to the medical staff decreased in the PCA group, showing a difference from the conventional group within 24 hours. The total daily dose of morphine was increased significantly at 0–24 hours in the PCA group and then slightly increased until 72 hours. The patient-reported pain reduction rate increased at 24–48 hours and was maintained until 72 hours in the PCA group. There was no statistically significant change in the conventional group during the study period for the above items.

The conversion rate to oral or transdermal opioids after 72 hours was higher in the PCA group. There were no uncontrolled side effects due to morphine titration in either group. Conclusions: Patients using the PCA with optimizing B. I. mode showed faster intravenous morphine titration and higher morphine consumption than the conventional method and achieved tolerable and rapid pain relief. This study revealed that early active opioid titration is necessary for patients admitted for pain control. It also suggested that the patient's actual opioid demands for pain control may be greater than the amount of opioid used through conventional titration methods. Clinical trial information: KCT0004008.

Tapentadol extended-release (ER) tablets — formulations, initiation, titration, and precautions include the following: Available as tablets containing 50, 100, 150, 200, or 250 mg tapentadol for twice daily dosing. In opioid-naïve and non-tolerant patients: Initiate therapy with 50 mg twice daily; use of higher starting doses in patients who are not opioid tolerant may cause fatal respiratory depression. There are no established conversion ratios for conversion from other opioid to tapentadol ER; convert current opioid to an estimated equianalgesic daily dose of tapentadol; reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for initial daily start dose. Dose change increments: May increase dose by no more than 50 mg twice daily every 3 days. Maximum daily dose: 500 mg daily. Tapentadol ER tablets must be taken whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving tablets will result in uncontrolled delivery of tapentadol and can lead to overdose. Steady state is attained after the third dose (24 hr after the first twice daily multiple dose administration). Special populations: Elderly — No dosing adjustment needed, consider starting at lowest recommended dosage; patients with renal dysfunction — No dosage adjustment for mild or moderate renal impairment; not recommended in severe renal impairment; patients with hepatic dysfunction — Use not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Other considerations: Must NOT be taken concomitantly with alcohol which can increase serum tapentadol concentration and cause fatal overdose, and use with or within 14 days of MAOIs is contraindicated.

### Risk factors for indicators of opioid-related harms amongst people living with chronic non-cancer pain: findings from a 5-year prospective cohort study [^115dJhAA]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Additionally, our data suggest that implementing dosage thresholds as in the 2016 United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines will not in effect address opioid-related risk. It is possible that this emphasis on dose comes from the ability to easily measure and respond to dose thresholds, compared with the relative complexity and time considerations of assessing other clinical factors that substantially contribute to opioid-related risk. There have been unintended consequences from inflexibly applying dose thresholds in those guidelines, including the abrupt and forced tapering and cessation of opioids in people on long-term therapy, a practice that the authors of the guidelines have recently challenged.

It follows that our findings do not support 'deprescribing' of opioid medication based solely on opioid doses as an action to address problematic opioid behaviours. The current study found patient characteristics such as younger age, male, previous substance use history and mental health history are also important factors related to problematic behaviours. Given the added harms that may occur after abrupt opioid taper, including increased mortality, our study highlights the need for clinical decisions to be more nuanced and based on a holistic assessment of the needs, risks and benefits of each individual patient. Although there are valid concerns about the safety and limited evidence of efficacy for the use of opioids for CNCP, long-term opioid use may be of benefit in carefully selected and monitored patients.

The current study is to our knowledge one of the largest, longest and most comprehensive to date. There was a high rate of follow-up, with validated scales to assess both confounders and opioid outcomes, and we measured actual opioid consumption, rather than relying on administrative data from prescriptions. Our sensitivity analyses found similar results to the primary analyses, suggesting that these findings are robust to missing data.

Although data were self-reported, this method of data collection has been shown to be valid, particularly when there are no disincentives for being honest, as was the case in our study. All participants were assured of confidentiality and that the data would be de-identified.

There are some limitations. One may be the representativeness of the sample. To examine this potential bias, at baseline we collected data from a random sample of 71 pharmacies on the characteristics of all customers obtaining opioids during their six-week recruitment window. We found very strong similarities between our participants and all opioid customers, which we have previously reported. Additionally, our cohort's long history of pain and opioid treatment may mean that our findings do not generalise to patients newly initiated on opioids.

Evidence synthesis and recommendation framing — opioid initiation and dose escalation: The evidence suggests that both the initiation of opioids in the opioid naïve patient and opioid dose escalation in patients on chronic opioids are associated with risks including opioid misuse, development of opioid use disorder (OUD), and overdose, and these risks were observed in both cancer and non-cancer pain patients on opioids. The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence related to Recommendation 7 and considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2017 VA/DoD Opioids CPG, and therefore this is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low, but the adverse outcomes related to this recommendation are potentially catastrophic, and the potential benefits of opioid reduction or tapering to discontinuation outweighed the potential harms related to opioid misuse, the development of treated OUD, and the risk for overdose death. The Work Group noted that patients that have been on high dose opioids for some time may be hesitant to reduce their dose, and the tapering process also presents some inherent challenges to both patients and some providers.

### Nurse-led telephone follow-up intervention for titrating and tapering opioids in chronic pain patients – A feasibility study [^114ypWMX]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Sample Size Calculation

An a-priory sample size calculation was based on information from the literature and results from the pilot study (ie, changes in pain intensity and MME). We used the MedCalc Software Ltd sample size calculator for paired t -test and proportions.

For pain intensity, previous research suggests that a minimum clinically significant reduction in patient with chronic pain is 1–2 units or 30% on a 0–10 NRS. Being conservative but within clinical relevance, we set the minimum detected difference to 1.25 units. In the present feasibility study, an SD of 2.5 was found for pain intensity reduction at rest, thus chosen as basis for our sample size calculation. A difference of 1.25 and a SD of 2.5 gives a Cohen's D of 0.5 which corresponds to a moderate effect size. With a power of 0.80, an alpha value of 0.05, we need a sample size of 34 patients. To compensate for potential dropouts and incomplete registrations, we add 10% to the estimated sample size. Thus, a total of 38 patients titrating opioids are needed.

There is no previous research estimating a minimal important clinical reduction of MME or other measures in patients with chronic pain. However, we consider a 30% reduction of MME as clinically relevant. In the present pilot study, 61% of patients achieved at least a 30% reduction of MME. For a one-sample proportion test assuming that the intervention reduces the proportion of patients achieving 30% MME reduction by an absolute difference of 30%, with a power of 0.08 and an alpha value of 0.05, we need a sample size of 14 patients. To compensate for potential dropouts and incomplete registrations, we add 10% to the estimated sample size. Thus, a total of 16 patients tapering opioids are needed.

Ethical Considerations

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and inclusion of patient data in the OPR was approved by the Data Protection Officer at OUS (file number 20/08986). All participants provided electronically informed consent. Data were available for the pilot study after further approval by the Data Protection Officer at OUS (file number 19/15083), and access to the data was granted by the Head of Department of Pain Management and Research at OUS.

### Module 6: dosing and titration of opioids: how much, how long, and how and when to stop? [^112Bn9Ta]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Reevaluate benefits and harms with patients within 1 to 4 weeks of starting opioid therapy or of starting dose escalation. Avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day. If patients do not experience improvement in pain and function at ≥ 90 MME/day, or if there are escalating dosage requirements, providers should discuss other approaches to pain management with the patient. Ok. That isn't really a big change from your assessment last week. Are you having any side effects. I am having some constipation and drowsiness but they haven't really given me too much trouble. The correct answer is b, c, and d. Any increase should be the smallest practical amount and should be done in coordination with other pain therapies. Benefits and risks associated with the increase should be continually monitored. Patients should also be aware of the indications that suggest or require tapering.

Based on our discussion, you are gaining benefit with few, if any negative side effects. Let's make a small increase and see if pain relief and increased function are the result. Should I continue to take it in the same way. Now that each pill is stronger, you should start by only taking one when the pain is severe. You might find the higher dose might be all you need for an extended period of time. Don't assume you will continue to take all four every day. More rapid tapers might be needed for patient safety under certain circumstances. Providers should discuss with patients the increased risk of overdose on an abrupt return to previously prescribed higher dosages. If attempts to taper are unsuccessful, assess your patient for OUD. Diagnosing OUD requires a thorough evaluation over multiple visits with a patient.

Additional information, including the results of urine drug testing and PDMP reports, should be considered when OUD is suspected. When starting opioid therapy, providers should prescribe IR opioids instead of ER/LA opioids. When opioids are started, providers should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. Providers should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage; should carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when increasing dosage to ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents /day; and should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^115ZRwVG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Box 7 The RIOSORD

Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risk, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid analgesic medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions to manage pain. As emphasized in the 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain (11):

When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage, and should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients.

The CGC recommends that clinicians use the lowest effective dose of BZDs and follow the CDC guidelines for minimizing risks related to opioid prescribing. This includes minimizing opioid doses where possible and optimizing non-opioid interventions for managing pain, such as nonpharmacological treatments for pain management, including exercise, mindfulness-based interventions, and CBT. The CDC guideline, and the joint US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and US Department of Defense (DoD) Guideline on Chronic Pain Prescribing also recommend that clinicians consider using buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist with reduced risk of overdose, to manage pain in patients at risk of withdrawal or overdose, including those who are co-prescribed BZDs. Patients at risk of opioid overdose should be provided with or prescribed opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone; see "Harm Reduction").

### Evaluating the stability of opioid efficacy over 12 months in patients with chronic noncancer pain who initially demonstrate benefit from extended release oxycodone or hydrocodone: harmonization of food and drug administration patient-level drug safety study data [^114Pxw9g]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

In the harmonized patient-level data of people with predominately musculoskeletal non–cancer-related chronic pain, we identified a group of patients (44.5% of those successfully titrated and 35.9% of those who entered titration) who maintained or reduced their pain score on a stable or smaller dose of ER opioid for up to 12 months. Also important is that 55.4% and 64.1% of the patients, respectively, did not meet this criterion. In a less conservative approach, if we consider only patient's report of pain (without considering dose), 67.6% of those with successful titration remained stable or improved, which drops to 54.3% if we include those dropping out during titration. In those for whom physical function (PF-10) was also measured (n = 985), the group who exhibited improvement or stability in all 3 measures was 34.3% and 27.0%, respectively. In those for whom pain interference (BPI-I) was also measured (n = 2042), improvement or stability in all 3 measures was 38.6% and 31.2%, respectively.

The existence of a sizeable group of patients with predominately CLBP and OA meeting our criteria for stable or improved status demonstrates that at least some patients, who demonstrate a clinically important efficacy from abuse deterrent ER opioid analgesics during a titration period, maintain stable efficacy demonstrated for pain relief, improved function, and reduced pain interference for up to 12 months in the treatment of chronic pain. The existence of a successful group demonstrates the potential benefit of chronic opioid therapy and supports the consideration of such therapy in a carefully selected and monitored chronic pain population who do not achieve adequate pain control with other approaches. It is also clear that even in a carefully selected group of patients, a sizeable number of patients do not remain on a stable dose or maintain a stable level of symptoms over the same period indicating the importance of careful monitoring during treatment.

Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Study design

The study comprised three phases: screening, titration, and maintenance (Figure 1). Screening consisted of a single visit (Visit 1) during which standard medical screening to determine eligibility took place. During this visit, consenting patients completed a baseline Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)and a confidential Self-Reported Misuse, Abuse, and Diversion (SR-MAD) questionnaire. (Data from SR-MAD are published separately in this volume.) During the titration stage, lasting up to 6 weeks, all patients were converted to MSN. Conversion to MSN was standardized for all investigators using the MSN conversion guide provided with the protocol (Supplementary materials). However, the conversion guide instructions indicated that the actual dose should be based on clinical judgment and adjusted on an individual basis. The selection of the initial dose of MSN for each patient was based upon the following considerations and information: 1) the total daily dose, potency, and type of opioid the patient had been taking previously; 2) the reliability of the relative potency estimate used to calculate the equivalent dose of morphine needed (potency estimates may vary with the route of administration) to replace the patient's opioid; 3) the type and severity of the patient's pain; 4) the patient's degree of opioid experience and tolerance; 5) the general condition and medical status of the patient; and 6) the patient's concomitant medications. A stable dose was defined by all of the following criteria: 1) a dose that has been taken for at least 48 hours; 2) a dose that the investigator deemed had achieved the balance between an acceptable level of analgesia and/or function, and tolerance of side effects; and 3) a dose that allows for rescue medication use of no more than two doses per day. At the discretion of the investigator, rescue medication was allowed so as to provide supplemental analgesia for breakthrough pain during titration; rescue medications included IR morphine (< 20% of the total daily dose of MSN per IR dose), ibuprofen (up to 400 mg/dose, not to exceed 1,200 mg/day), and acetaminophen (up to 1,000 mg/dose, not to exceed 4,000 mg/day). Subsequent visits (Visits 2b–e) were optional if the patient required additional dose adjustments, and occurred every 5 days (± 2 days) following the previous visit to a maximum of 6 weeks. If a patient did not achieve a stable dose by 6 weeks, he or she was discontinued from the study. Patients who achieved a stable MSN dose returned to the clinic for Visit 3 and completed a BPI. At this visit, the investigator completed a conversion assessment survey, a brief questionnaire using multiple choice options and an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) with specified anchored responses, ranging on a scale from 0 (not useful) to 10 (very useful). During the maintenance stage, lasting 8 weeks, patients completed a BPI (Visits 4 and 5) and women underwent a urine pregnancy test (Visit 5 only).

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^116QA6sk]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Experts from OWG noted that although little evidence exists for specific follow-up time frames, the recommendation was reasonable and reflects common practice and therefore supported the recommendation. Experts further noted that social determinants of health affecting ability to return frequently for care (e.g. role as unpaid caregiver or work at a job with minimal paid time off) or payer issues (e.g. copays) could have consequences when recommending frequent visits and should be considered.

Clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation. Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day, because the overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day (see Recommendation 4). Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage. An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.

### Impact of opioid dose reduction on individuals with chronic pain: results of an online survey [^112rtccJ]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

There is inadequate evidence or justification to arbitrarily limit doses in patients adequately assessed and monitored with risk management tools to minimize the risk of opioid misuse/abuse (eg, ongoing monitoring for aberrant drug-taking behaviors, use of abuse-deterrent opioid formulations). A study of voluntary opioid tapering in patients at a community clinic who were taking high-dose opioids (median MME: 288 mg tapered to 150 mg in 4 months) for chronic noncancer pain showed that although there was no worsening of pain among completers, there was a high dropout rate (37.8%). In addition, despite the reduction in high-dose opioid prescriptions in the United States (46.5% reduction from 2010 to 2016), opioid overdose-related mortality has not declined during this period. Therefore, astute clinicians can incorporate the dose thresholds suggested by the guidelines into their regular opioid prescribing protocols but use them as opportunities to reevaluate benefits and harms of ongoing therapy in individual patients.

The results of this study must be interpreted carefully, considering its limitations, including recruitment from the membership of a patient advocacy organization that may not be representative of the general chronic pain population. Lack of available demographic information complicates generalization to a broader population. Potential variability in changes in prescribing practices by region cannot be ruled out, as geographic information was not collected in this survey. Motivation for opioid dose changes was not sought; thus, reported opioid dose changes may have been driven by patient-specific factors independent of the CDC guideline. Additionally, as patient reports of the magnitude of opioid dose changes are not reliable, this information was not collected. All information was provided by survey respondents and not verified by health care providers. The assessment of changes in pain severity, level of function, and mental health was based on self-reporting by the patient instead of the use of a validated tool.

### Cancer pain management: safe and effective use of opioids… [^115yit3c]. ASCO (2015). Low credibility.

Choice of Opioid and Initial Opioid Titration In patients who have never been exposed to opioids before, titration is quite simple. The starting dose is well established for all major opioid analgesics and it is the equivalent to 30 mg of morphine per day orally. The starting dose of an opioid is not driven by the intensity of the patient's pain expression but rather by safety considerations, and therefore, the initiation of opioids is simple and generally very safe. 10Therefore, it is important to either follow up or phone the patient less than 1 week after the initial management to further titrate the opioid dose and to consider adjuvant drugs or drugs for the management of side effects. The minimal clinically important increase or decrease in dose will be approximately 30% of the daily dose. Opioid titration is always conducted as a percentage rather than an absolute number because of the large dose range.

For example, a patient coming for follow-up in poor pain control receiving 100 mg of equivalent morphine daily dose will require an increase of at least 30 mg per day. A patient coming with a similar degree of poor pain control but receiving a dose of 300 mg of equivalent morphine per day will require an increase of approximately 100 mg per day. The patient is receiving four immediate release doses per day. Total morphine equivalent dose for this patient is regular daily dose 30 plus breakthrough pain 30, making a total daily dose of 60 mg. An appropriate increase for this patient would be approximately 30% to 50% of the daily dose. Therefore, the new regular opioid dose should be approximately 90 mg/day. The new extra dose will need to be approximately 9 to 10 mg every 4 hours as needed since the ideal extra dose is approximately 10% of the daily dose.

12Methylphenidate can be used intermittently for the first few days after each dose change, and it can also be used as needed so patients can self-titrate during daytime. Respiratory depression is rare but life threatening. It may result from excessive dose, patient chemical coping, drug or active metabolite accumulation from renal or liver failure, pharmacokinetic changes from drug interaction, or pharmacodynamic effects when combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives.

The guideline states, "Low dose therapy can be effective, with a reduction in the rate of complications, side effects, and adverse effects", particularly when combined with other modalities; dose escalation is individualized and "requires careful reassessment of pain and the risk of overdose and continued monitoring with evidence of improved patient care". It also notes, "Abuse-deterrent opioid formulations have been developed in order to decrease abuse, overuse, and overdose fatalities".

Additional buprenorphine guidance — Providers may consider an alternative initiation approach for patients with concern for/history of intolerable opioid withdrawal during buprenorphine initiation or otherwise unable to taper to 30 mg MEDD, and it is recommended to either convert directly to an equivalent dose or cross-titrate for a short period of time with provision of a medication disposal bag for any remaining full agonist opioids. For patients taking ≥ 80 mg MEDD, convert directly to an equivalent dose of buprenorphine buccal film: 80–160 mg MEDD: initiate 300 mcg 8–12 hours after last dose of full agonist opioids, q12 hr; 161–220 mg MEDD: initiate 450 mcg 8–12 hours after last dose of full agonist opioids, q12 hr. Alternatively, continue current full agonist opioids for 4–8 days while gradually up-titrating buprenorphine buccal film to the lowest effective dose; once the buprenorphine dose is roughly an equianalgesic full agonist dose, stop the full agonist opioid (usually around day 4–8), and if patients stabilize before the proposed end dose, it is not necessary to proceed with further buprenorphine dose escalations.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113LMk8q]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Although findings regarding risks for new long-term opioid use after use for acute pain relate specifically to patients who were previously opioid naïve, risks also might be associated with dosage escalation (see Recommendation 4) if patients already treated with long-term opioids are prescribed additional opioid medication for new acute pain superimposed on chronic pain. Therefore, strategies that minimize opioid use should be implemented for both opioid-naïve and opioid-tolerant patients with acute pain when possible. If patients receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible. If additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including an appropriate taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).

Short-acting opioids — hydromorphone: Initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 2 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and an initial dose of 4 to 8 mg may be given for severe pain. There is no optimal or maximum dose of hydromorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing parameters are Analgesic Onset (min): 15 to 30, Peak (min): 30 to 60, Duration (hr): 3 to 4, and t½ (hr): 2 to 3. In special populations, for the elderly or debilitated use with caution and start at 25% to 50% of usual dose at the low end of the dosing range, and for hepatic or renal dysfunction reduce initial dose by 25% to 50% of usual dose depending on degree of impairment. Other considerations note women appear to have a 25% higher Cmax than men, and hepatic metabolism via glucuronidation to active metabolites (mainly hydro-morphone 3-glucuronide) can accumulate in renal impairment.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^116E4edc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — opioid rotation (Recommendation 7) states that opioid rotation should be offered to patients with pain that is refractory to dose titration, poorly managed side effects, logistical or cost concerns, or trouble with the route of opioid administration or absorption (Type: Evidence based; benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Evidence review reports a 2018 systematic review in adults with chronic, cancer-related pain using oral or transdermal opioids that included three systematic reviews, four RCTs, and five prospective observational studies, concluded that opioid rotation can improve pain relief and patient satisfaction, and found that dose escalation after rotation was necessary in a majority of studies with the exception of rotation to methadone. Clinical interpretation adds that opioid rotation is common in cancer pain with a frequency of close to one third of patients requiring a change, the goal is to safely switch to an alternate agent, clinicians and teams should select one method to calculate a safe dose and use this consistently, opioid rotation should be personalized with more conservative dosing for significant adverse effects (particularly sedation or a history of falls), caution is warranted when rotating to a parenteral route if enteral absorption is uncertain, doses may be more liberal in severe pain, and close monitoring and frequent follow-up with necessary dose titration are warranted.

### Evaluating the stability of opioid efficacy over 12 months in patients with chronic noncancer pain who initially demonstrate benefit from extended release oxycodone or hydrocodone: harmonization of food and drug administration patient-level drug safety study data [^116NFnQv]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

2.2. Harmonization

The primary issues in harmonizing and analyzing the different studies were as follows: (1) variable initial opioid titration periods and methods; (2) variable scheduled times for the collection of data (pain scores, opioid use, etc.); (3) identifying a method for combining the change in pain, physical function, and BPI interference (BPI-I) with the change in opioid dose over time; and (4) variable rules about the use of rescue medication. These issues were dealt with as follows:
(1) The maximum time allowed for formal titration of patients onto a stable dose ranged from no separate titration up to 45 days. To normalize the data across all studies, we designated the first 45 days from initial dose of study medication as the titration period. Patients unable to achieve a stable dose, adequate pain control, or who chose to discontinue were reported as titration failures.
(2) Variable timing and frequency in data collection: to use all available pain data, conservatively deal with occasional missing data, and compensate for the normal variations over time, we calculated a linear fit of all the pain scores between baseline (end of titration period) and the end of the long-term study. We used the slope of the line to categorize patients as worse, stable, or better. Pain and BPI-I scores were categorized by designating changes in pain over 12 months on the 0–10 NRS of > +1/10 as worse, +1/10 to −1/10 as stable, and < −1/10 as better. PF-10 slope was calculated using the normalized standard SF-36 scale. For opioid dose, we examined the change from baseline (end of titration) to the final 30-day period. A substantial number of patients had zero dose change, so zero was designated as stable, increase as worse, and decrease as better.
(3) Because the primary outcome considers both pain and opioid use, we used a combined analgesic outcome adapted from a 3 by 3 matrix analysis published by Burris et al. Patients with stable or lower pain and stable or reduced opioid use were considered to have met our criteria for success, and all the other patients did not. The same method was used to combine physical function (PF-10) and BPI-I with dose. A stable or improved PF-10 and stable or improved BPI-I were each combined separately with the pain and dose combination for a more stringent analysis.
(4) Rules about the type and use of rescue medication varied broadly among studies with only 2 hydrocodone studies prespecifying and providing hydrocodone 5 mg/325 APAP as rescue. Two oxycodone and 1 hydrocodone study allowed use of the investigator designated prestudy rescue and did not record the amounts used. The 3 remaining oxycodone studies allowed only acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), again without recording amounts. Therefore, we could not include rescue in our calculation of chronic opioid use for our primary analysis. In the 2 studies that recorded rescue, we examined change in rescue use over the course of the study. Per protocol, if the patients consistently used more rescue, they were encouraged to titrate to a higher study drug dose, which was measured as part of our primary outcome.

### Opioids for chronic noncancer pain: to prescribe or not to prescribe-what is the question? [^115TemZU]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The recent American Academy of Neurology position paper by Franklin, "Opioids for chronic noncancer pain", suggests that the benefits of opioid treatment are very likely to be substantially outweighed by the risks and recommends avoidance of doses above 80–120 mg/day morphine equivalent. However, close reading of the primary literature supports a different conclusion: opioids have been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be highly effective in the treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain; long-term follow-up studies have shown that this effectiveness can be maintained; and effectiveness has been limited in many clinical trials by failure to take into account high variability in dose requirements, failure to adequately treat depression, and use of suboptimal outcome measures. Frequency of side effects in many RCTs has been inflated by overly rapid dose titration and failure to appreciate the high interindividual variability in side effect profiles. The recent marked increase in incidence of opioid overdose is of grave concern, but there is good reason to believe that it has been somewhat exaggerated. Potential causes of overdose include inadequately treated depression; inadequately treated pain, particularly when compounded by hopelessness; inadvertent overdose; concurrent use of alcohol; and insufficient practitioner expertise. Effective treatment of pain can enable large numbers of patients to lead productive lives and improve quality of life. Effective alleviation of suffering associated with pain falls squarely within the physician's professional obligation. Existing scientific studies provide the basis for many improvements in pain management that can increase effectiveness and reduce risk. Many potentially useful areas of further research can be identified.

### Opioids for chronic pain: new evidence, new strategies, safe prescribing [^112DUJoY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In the United States, the prevalence and burden of chronic pain is large and still growing. Older adults (aged ≥ 65 years) make up a large portion of the population with chronic pain, and their presentation, diagnosis, and treatment tends to be more complicated because of age-related physiological changes and comorbidities. Guidelines on treating patients with severe back pain recommend opioids as an option for those who do not find adequate pain relief from acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For older adult patients at higher risk for NSAID-related adverse effects, such as those who have gastrointestinal or cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or who are taking low-dose aspirin, opioids are recommended instead. Opioids may also be an appropriate option for patients with neuropathic pain who have not achieved adequate analgesia from maximum doses of first- and second-line antineuropathic agents. Still, opioids are not appropriate for all patients; rather, a differential diagnosis, consideration of other comorbidities, and the potential for opioid-related adverse effects and substance abuse are required to confirm the value of opioid treatment for each individual. For nonresponders to opioid therapy, opioid rotation should be considered before discontinuation is pursued.

Short-acting opioids — tramadol dosing and precautions include: initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) is 25 mg every morning; titration may increase by 25 mg per day every 3 days to 100 mg tramadol/d (25 mg every 6 hr), with subsequent increments of 50 mg/d every 3 days to 200 mg/d (50 mg every 6 hr), after which 50 to 100 mg may be given every 4 to 6 hr; maximum daily dose of tramadol is 400 mg/d, and for the combination product the maximum is 4000 mg/d APAP with 2000 mg/d APAP in chronic alcoholics or in hepatic impairment. Analgesic timing is stated as Analgesic Onset (min): < 60, Peak (min): ~120 to 180, Duration (hr): 6, and t½ (hr): 6.3 ± 1.4. In special populations, in elderly patients > 75 years give < 300 mg/d in divided doses and use caution in debilitated patients; in hepatic dysfunction decrease dosage to 50 mg once every 12 hr in patients with cirrhosis; in renal dysfunction CrCl > 30 ml/min requires no change in dose or frequency, whereas CrCl < 30 ml/min requires increasing the dosing interval to 12 hr and decreasing maximum daily dose to 200 mg; dialysis patients can receive their regular dose on the day of dialysis (< 7% of a dose is removed by hemodialysis). Other considerations note that tramadol inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine and concomitant use with MAOIS SSRIs may increase risk of seizures, serotonin syndrome; dose carefully or use another agent in patients on serotonergic agents; seizures are reported within the recommended dosage range, with increased risk above the recommended dosage range and in patient with seizure disorder, history of seizures, in conditions with increased risk of seizures, or with other drugs that increase seizure risk; observe maximum dose limits.

Methadone — For long-acting opioid therapy, methadone is available as 5 and 10 mg tablets and an oral solution, 5 or 10 mg/ 5 ml, for every 8 to 12 hr administration. Initial dosing should start low and go slow and should not be used for as-needed supplemental OT; an initial dose of 2.5 to 5 mg orally every 8 to 12 hr may be used, with more frequent administration (every 6 hr) during initiation if needed to maintain analgesia. Dose change increments of 2.5 mg every 8 hr may be made every 5 to 7 days; delayed analgesia or toxicity may occur due to accumulation after repeated doses (e.g., days 2 to 5), and if excessive sedation occurs, temporarily hold doses, lower the dose, and/or slow titration; once a stable analgesic dose is reached, the dosing interval may be extended to every 8 to 12 hr or longer. In special populations, consider reduced dosing in elderly or debilitated patients; in hepatic dysfunction, no dosage adjustments are required in stable chronic liver disease or mild-to-moderate hepatic dysfunction and avoid in severe liver disease; in renal dysfunction, dosage reduction by up to 50–75% is recommended in patients with CrCl < 10 mL/ min. Other considerations include that prescribers of methadone should be thoroughly familiar with its complex pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties or consult an experienced clinician; the plasma half-life is 22 to 128 hr short- term and 24 to 48 hr at steady-state and may be longer than the analgesic duration; methadone has little cross-tolerance with other opioids and even patients with a high degree of opioid tolerance may be at risk for overdose when switched; methadone is the only long-acting opioid available as an oral solution.

### Opioid prescribing: a systematic review and critical appraisal of guidelines for chronic pain [^1133c3WL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Deaths due to prescription opioid overdoses have increased dramatically. High-quality guidelines could help clinicians mitigate risks associated with opioid therapy.

Purpose

To evaluate the quality and content of guidelines on the use of opioids for chronic pain.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, National Guideline Clearinghouse, specialty society Web sites, and international guideline clearinghouses (searched in July 2013).

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2007 and July 2013 addressing the use of opioids for chronic pain in adults were selected. Guidelines on specific settings, populations, and conditions were excluded.

Data Extraction

Guidelines and associated systematic reviews were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), respectively, and recommendations for mitigating opioid-related risks were compared.

Data Synthesis

Thirteen guidelines met selection criteria. Overall AGREE II scores were 3.00 to 6.20 (on a scale of 1 to 7). The AMSTAR ratings were poor to fair for 10 guidelines. Two received high AGREE II and AMSTAR scores. Most guidelines recommend that clinicians avoid doses greater than 90 to 200 mg of morphine equivalents per day, have additional knowledge to prescribe methadone, recognize risks of fentanyl patches, titrate cautiously, and reduce doses by at least 25% to 50% when switching opioids. Guidelines also agree that opioid risk assessment tools, written treatment agreements, and urine drug testing can mitigate risks. Most recommendations are supported by observational data or expert consensus.

Limitation

Exclusion of non-English-language guidelines and reliance on published information.

Conclusion

Despite limited evidence and variable development methods, recent guidelines on chronic pain agree on several opioid risk mitigation strategies, including upper dosing thresholds; cautions with certain medications; attention to drug-drug and drug-disease interactions; and use of risk assessment tools, treatment agreements, and urine drug testing. Future research should directly examine the effectiveness of opioid risk mitigation strategies.

### Nurse-led telephone follow-up intervention for titrating and tapering opioids in chronic pain patients – A feasibility study [^113Jy9xH]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present study evaluates the feasibility and pilots the outcomes of a nurse-led follow-up intervention for titrating or tapering opioids in patients with CNCP. Analyses of the outcomes show that patients tapering opioids had a significant reduction of MME. Patients who titrated opioids had a significant increase in number of side effects and were significantly older. The feasibility assessment revealed a number of areas of impact such as lack of a sound theory basis, unclear allocation criteria, as well as inconsistent use of non-validated measurement tools. Mechanisms of change were identified as interprofessional collaboration, nurses' knowledge and competencies, as well as predictability and availability of the nurses. Sample size calculations indicated that 38 patients titrating opioids and 16 patients tapering opioids are needed to perform further efficacy studies. The intervention is also assumed cost-effective in terms of saving costs of salaries, travel, and time off work. In conclusion, challenges and strengths identified in the development, implementation and content of the nurse-led telephone follow-up intervention were manageable, and we believe that with the right adjustments and improvements this complex intervention is feasible for a larger efficacy study.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — buprenorphine buccal film dosing and precautions: Buprenorphine buccal film is available in strengths of 75, 150, 300, 450, 600, 750 and 900 mcg/film for twice daily administration. In opioid-naïve patients, initiate 75 mcg once or twice daily for at least 4 days, then increase dose to 150 mcg every 12 hr; because buprenorphine buccal film can precipitate withdrawal in patients already on opioids, other opioids should be tapered to ≤ 30 mg MEDD before initiation. After initial dosing, titrate in increments of 150 mcg every 12 hr, no more frequently than every 4 days; patients on prior opioids 30 to 89 mg MEDD may start 150 mcg every 12 hr, those on 90 to 160 mg MEDD may start 300 mcg every 12 hr, and if prior opioid is > 160 mg MEDD consider an alternative analgesic; time to steady state is ~3 days with every 12 hr dosing. In special populations, initiation at the low end of the dosing range is recommended for the elderly, no dose adjustment is recommended for renal dysfunction, and patients with severe hepatic impairment should have starting and titration doses reduced by half that of patients with normal liver function. QTc prolongation is reported with recommended doses; the maximum dose is 900 mcg every 12 hr and avoid in patients with long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome, or those taking Class IA or Class III antiarrhythmic drugs; buprenorphine buccal film is a potential treatment option for patients with significant renal impairment and those with gastrointestinal structural or functional abnormality that interferes with swallowing or absorption of orally administered medications.

Hydrocodone extended-release (ER) dosing — formulations, initial dosing, titration, special populations, interactions, and administration precautions — are as follows: ER tablets contain 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 or 120 mg hydrocodone for once daily administration, and ER capsules contain 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg hydrocodone for every 12 hr administration. Initial dosing in opioid-naive patients is 20 mg ER tablet once daily or 10 mg ER capsule every 12 hr. For opioid tolerant patients, convert the current opioid to the equianalgesic daily dose of hydromorphone ER and reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for the initial start dose; for opioid-experienced patients using either ER tablets or capsules, convert to an equianalgesic hydrocodone dose then reduce that dose by 33–50% and initiate at the nearest whole-tablet or capsule strength, rounding down as necessary. Dose titration for both tablets and capsules may use increments of 20 mg per day every 3 to 5 days, and steady state is achieved in ~3 days of dosing. In patients with renal impairment, hydrocodone plasma concentrations are increased in moderate or severe impairment; use a low initial dose and monitor closely for AEs such as excessive sedation and respiratory depression. In hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is required in mild or moderate hepatic impairment; start with the lowest dose, 10 mg, in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and monitor closely. CYP3A4 inhibitors may decrease clearance of hydrocodone, increase plasma concentrations, and increase risk of overdose, whereas CYP3A4 inducers may increase clearance and reduce opioid effect. Hydrocodone ER tablets or capsules must be swallowed intact and should not be cut, broken, chewed, crushed or dissolved due to risk of fatal overdose.

### Toward a systematic approach to opioid rotation [^112gR9G9]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Patients requiring chronic opioid therapy may not respond to or tolerate the first opioid prescribed to them, necessitating rotation to another opioid. They may also require dose increases for a number of reasons, including worsening disease and increased pain. Dose escalation to restore analgesia using the primary opioid may lead to increased adverse events. In these patients, rotation to a different opioid at a lower-than-equivalent dose may be sufficient to maintain adequate tolerability and analgesia. In published trials and case series, opioid rotation is performed either using a predetermined substitute opioid with fixed conversion methods, or in a manner that appears to be no more systematic than trial and error. In clinical practice, opioid rotation must be performed with consideration of individual patient characteristics, comorbidities (eg, concurrent psychiatric, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic illness), and concurrent medications, using flexible dosing protocols that take into account incomplete opioid cross-tolerance. References cited in this review were identified via a search of PubMed covering all English language publications up to May 21, 2013 pertaining to opioid rotation, excluding narrative reviews, letters, and expert opinion. The search yielded a total of 129 articles, 92 of which were judged to provide relevant information and subsequently included in this review. Through a review of this literature and from the authors' empiric experience, this review provides practical information on performing opioid rotation in clinical practice.

### A multicenter, primary-care-based, open-label study to assess the success of converting opioid-experienced patients with chronic moderate-to-severe pain to morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release capsules using a standardized conversion guide [^111MaKGH]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Opioids are an established therapeutic tool for the relief of moderate-to-severe pain. Over the last two decades, opioid use has expanded from the treatment of acute postoperative pain and terminal cancer pain to include the treatment of chronic, noncancer pain (CNCP). While the evidence for the long-term efficacy of opioid therapy in treatment of CNCP remains variable, an increasing number of patients are prescribed opioids for CNCP. In a recent meta-analysis of clinical trial evidence for long-term effectiveness and safety of opioid treatment in CNCP, Noble et alreported that 32.5% of patients did not continue long-term oral opioid treatment due to intolerable adverse effects, whereas 11.9% discontinued because of insufficient pain relief. Finding an appropriate balance between analgesic efficacy and tolerable side effects is a critically important and often complex task for physicians when managing patients on long-term opioid therapy. Opioid tolerance, characterized by the reduced efficacy of opioids following repeated dosing, may lead to upward titration of dose to achieve adequate pain relief, often resulting in an increase in deleterious side effects. When dose alterations no longer provide for adequate pain control or elicit intolerable side effects, opioid conversion is indicated–or discontinuation of opioid treatment.

Opioid conversion (often used interchangeably with "rotation" or "switching") has been defined as a change in opioid drug or route of administration with the goal of improving outcomes. The mechanisms by which opioid conversion is thought to promote changes in either pain control or side effects are hypothesized to be the incomplete cross- tolerance between opioids, reducing the opioid load (incomplete tolerance) and/or side effects, and individual variation in opioid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. The variable response of individuals to opioids presents challenges to physicians when converting from one opioid to another. Conversion requires knowledge of how to safely transfer patients between opioid formulations and careful consideration of a dose and titration plan for each individual patient, regardless of prior opioid. Equianalgesic tables have long been used to translate relative opioid potency data into a form useful for clinical decision making regarding opioid conversion. The limitations of equianalgesic tables are well known,–and stem from acknowledgment that the relative potency data from which they are derived are weak, often from single-dose studies involving acute pain in healthy opioid-naïve patients. Nevertheless, the equianalgesic table remains an important first resource to guide physicians in the design of a safe and effective opioid conversion regimen for an individual patient.

### Use of opioids for adults with pain from cancer or cancer treatment: ASCO guideline [^111jYKUD]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — initiation and titration of opioids for adult cancer pain recommends that "Opioids should be initiated at the lowest possible dose to achieve acceptable analgesia and patient goals" and "should be initiated as immediate release and PRN (as needed) to establish an effective dose, with early assessment and frequent titration", both with "Strength of recommendation: Strong". Concomitant analgesics "may continue… after opioid initiation if these agents provide additional analgesia and are not contraindicated" with "Strength of recommendation: Weak". For testing and titration, "Evidence remains insufficient to recommend for or against the use of genetic testing, such as for polymorphism of CYP2D6, to guide opioid dosing" and "Evidence remains insufficient to recommend any single set of ranges for dose escalation in opioid titration", though "the minimum dose increase is 25%–50%". For patients with a substance use disorder, "clinicians should collaborate with a palliative care, pain, and/or substance use disorder specialist to determine the optimal approach to pain management" with "Strength of recommendation: Strong".

ASIPP guidelines — assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy state that physicians should evaluate meaningful benefit produced by opioid treatment and should ensure that opioid therapy does not incur aberrant behaviors and/or adverse effects; clinicians must understand the effectiveness, viability, limitations, adverse consequences, and relative value of long-term opioid therapy; the evidence of effectiveness is similar for short-acting and long-acting opioids with increased incidence and prevalence of adverse consequences with long-acting opioids; high doses of long-acting opioids are recommended only in limited circumstances when severe intractable pain is not responsive to short-acting opioids or moderate doses of long-acting opioids; tapering or weaning processes must be initiated slowly and should entail slow tapering across a specified period, and reinstitution of opioid therapy can be considered when medically necessary if behavior and drug use are stable and if results of at least two consistent urine drug tests are negative.

### Ziconotide as an opioid rescue: economic, clinical, and subgroup considerations [letter] [^115r96Nu]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Beyond economic considerations, optimization of dose titration strategies also warrants further study. The authors' slow titration protocol (0.5 μg weekly increments) successfully minimized adverse events, consistent with expert recommendations to start at 0.5–1.2 μg/day and escalate by no more than 0.5 μg/day. However, comparative trials are necessary to evaluate faster versus slower titration schedules. For example, a randomized controlled trial by Rauck et al showed that gradual titration improved tolerability and allowed higher effective doses without psychiatric adverse effects. Such head-to-head assessments could refine titration protocols, ensuring an optimal balance of efficacy, safety, and adherence.

Equally important is the evaluation of ziconotide in specific patient subgroups. The current cohort (ages 53–75 years) excluded younger adults, who may derive greater benefit given their lower risk of opioid-induced hypogonadism and tolerance. In addition, consensus guidelines by Deer et al recommend cautious use in patients with psychiatric or cardiopulmonary comorbidities, highlighting the need for stratified analyses in both younger populations and those with cancer-related pain. Subgroup-specific trials would help identify likely responders, refine indications, and define contraindications.

In conclusion, this exploratory study positions ziconotide as a promising opioid-sparing therapy. To fully establish its clinical role, larger multicenter randomized trials are required, incorporating economic analyses, titration strategy evaluations, and subgroup-specific assessments. Addressing these dimensions will be essential to translate early promise into meaningful clinical practice.

VA/DoD chronic pain guideline — buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone dosing highlights that a low dose buprenorphine initiation (LDBI) strategy is designed to avoid precipitated withdrawal during conversion and introduces small incremental doses of buprenorphine while either slowly reducing the full opioid agonist over time or maintaining the full agonist dose and then stopping it once the buprenorphine dose is sufficient to mitigate withdrawal symptoms. Dosing may be titrated to 16 to 24 mg/day in divided doses if needed, and the document notes there is no consensus regarding a particular LDI approach.

Methadone titration — management of breakthrough pain: For breakthrough pain, a short-acting opioid preparation may be used until steady state is achieved (i.e., 5–7 days). As-needed methadone has also been used in a palliative care setting; however, it is generally discouraged to avoid drug accumulation. The use of breakthrough pain medications in patients with CNCP is noted as controversial, and if opioid medications for breakthrough pain are indicated following titration to a stable methadone dose in CNCP patients, they should be used sparingly.

The guideline also notes that no quality was identified showing superiority of opioids, compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and other medications for treatment of chronic, noncancer pain.

### Practical considerations and patient selection for intrathecal drug delivery in the management of chronic pain [^114qdNud]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Although IT trialing with morphine is common, the process can be complicated by route-conversion issues and by the potential need for the weaning of systemic opioids before trialing. Wide variances in current route-conversion ratios and the lack of a conversion standard create uncertainty about delivering equianalgesic doses and may increase safety concerns during conversion from systemic to IT morphine.–For patients in whom these cautions raise important safety issues, nonopioid IT therapy, such as ziconotide, should be considered.

Ziconotide is indicated for the management of severe chronic pain in adult patients for whom IT therapy is warranted, and who are intolerant of or refractory to other treatment, such as systemic analgesics, adjunctive therapies, or IT morphine. Ziconotide has shown efficacy across multiple types of pain etiologies. The efficacy and safety profiles of ziconotide monotherapy have been assessed in three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of 457 patients with severe chronic pain, and safety has been assessed in 1,254 patients overall, and the findings have been supported by published case series in which ziconotide was administered as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents, including opioids.–This experience documents clinically meaningful reductions in chronic pain, as well as improvements in functional capacity and reductions in systemic opioid usage in patients with refractory malignant or nonmalignant pain states. With respect to its safety profile, ziconotide has a narrow therapeutic window, which requires careful titration to determine the lowest possible dose for each patient that is therapeutic and sufficiently well tolerated. A high starting dose and/or rapid dose titration can result in adverse effects, including psychological/psychiatric abnormalities. Cognitive impairment involving mental slowing, confusion, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, and impaired verbal expression, as well as new-onset psychosis and changes in consciousness are also possible. However, these adverse effects were most pronounced with the use of excessively high starting doses and aggressive titration schedules in early clinical trials of ziconotide in the 1990s. New slow titration protocols have reduced the risk of these adverse effects.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113t7Bkw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This guideline provides recommendations for clinicians providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years. It updates the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain - United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1–49) and includes recommendations for managing acute (duration of < 1 month), subacute (duration of 1–3 months), and chronic (duration of > 3 months) pain. The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations. This clinical practice guideline is intended to improve communication between clinicians and patients about the benefits and risks of pain treatments, including opioid therapy; improve the effectiveness and safety of pain treatment; mitigate pain; improve function and quality of life for patients with pain; and reduce risks associated with opioid pain therapy, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death.

### Updated centers for disease control and prevention guidelines on opioid prescribing: what should surgeons know? [^116i5wmJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published a 2022 guideline on opioid prescribing for acute, subacute, and chronic pain. This information is relevant to surgeons because many patients receive their first opioid prescription after surgery. When prescribing opioids, surgeons walk the line between benefit and harm. Many of the CDC recommendations mirror the AAO-HNS Clinical Practice Guideline: Opioid Prescribing for Analgesia After Common Otolaryngology Operations. For example, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute pain from otolaryngology-head, and neck surgery procedures. New insights include safeguards and strategies to mitigate the risk of complications in patients with chronic pain undergoing surgical procedures. Consultation with a pain specialist should be considered for patients transitioning from acute to chronic pain, cognizant of the risks of abrupt discontinuation of opioids in patients with opioid use disorder. This article summarizes key considerations for providing individualized, evidence-based perioperative pain management.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^115bZfD2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple experts from OWG expressed concern that including specific dosage thresholds in a main recommendation statement would emphasize them as authoritative absolutes and would lead to noncollaborative tapers or other potentially harmful consequences. Experts also noted the lack of a single standard formula for calculating MMEs. However, experts agreed there is a need for thresholds as benchmarks and suggested including them in the supporting text after the main recommendation statement. Experts also agreed with separating recommendations on dosage into a recommendation applying to patients starting opioids and patients already receiving opioids.

When opioids are used for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should start opioids at the lowest possible effective dosage. For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed on the basis of the severity of pain and other clinical factors, such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8). The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). For example, a label for hydrocodone bitartrate (5 mg) and acetaminophen (300 mg) states that the usual adult dosage is one or two tablets every 4–6 hours as needed for pain, and the total daily dosage should not exceed eight tablets. Clinicians should use additional caution when initiating opioids for patients aged ≥ 65 years and patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency because of a potentially smaller therapeutic window between safe dosages and dosages associated with respiratory depression and overdose (see Recommendation 8). Formulations with lower opioid doses (e.g. hydrocodone bitartrate 2.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg) are available and can facilitate dosing when additional caution is needed. Product labeling regarding tolerance includes guidance for patients already taking opioids. In addition to opioids, clinicians should consider cumulative dosages of other medications, such as acetaminophen, that are combined with opioids in many formulations and for which decreased clearance of medications might result in accumulation of medications to toxic levels.

Opioid initiation and titration — ASCO recommendations: Opioids should be initiated at the lowest possible dose to achieve acceptable analgesia and patient goals, and should be initiated as immediate release and PRN (as needed) to establish an effective dose with early assessment and frequent titration; patients already taking other analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may continue these after opioid initiation if they provide additional analgesia and are not contraindicated; evidence remains insufficient to recommend for or against genetic testing such as polymorphisms of CYP2D6 to guide dosing; evidence remains insufficient to recommend any single set of ranges for dose escalation, with the note that in general the minimum dose increase is 25%-50%; and for patients with a substance use disorder, clinicians should collaborate with a palliative care, pain, and/or substance use disorder specialist to determine the optimal approach to pain management.

Oxycodone extended-release (ER) — formulations, initial dosing, titration, bioequivalence, special populations, and administration are specified as follows: Tablets are available in 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 mg strengths for every 12 hr administration and capsules in 9, 13.5, 18, 27 and 36 mg strengths for every 12 hr administration. Opioid-naïve patients start at 10 mg (tablets) or 9 mg (capsules) orally every 12 hr; opioid tolerant patients should convert to the equianalgesic daily dose of oxycodone ER and reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for the initial start dose. Dose change increments may increase to 20 mg (tablets) or 18 mg (capsules) every 12 hr after 1 or 2 days, and thereafter the total daily dose may be increased by 25–50% every 1 or 2 days. ER tablets are not bioequivalent to ER capsules; 10 mg oxycodone HCl (ER tablet) = 9 mg oxycodone base (ER capsule), and steady state is achieved in 24 to 36 hr with repeat dosing. In special populations, plasma concentrations are increased ~15% in the elderly, ~50% in patients with renal dysfunction with CrCl < 60 ml/min, and patients with hepatic dysfunction should reduce initial dose to 1/3 to 1/2 of the usual dose and monitor closely. Other considerations include that it is recommended for patients who experience intolerable, unmanageable adverse effects to long- acting morphine; both ER tablets and ER capsules have abuse deterrent labeling; ER tablets should be swallowed whole, not broken, chewed, or crushed; and ER capsules may be opened and sprinkled on soft food or administered via feeding tube.

### Impact of opioid dose reduction on individuals with chronic pain: results of an online survey [^117Xmq77]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The 2016 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline on opioid prescribing suggests that clinicians "should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess the evidence of individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to ≥ 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day, and should avoid increasing dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day or carefully justify a decision to titrate dosage to ≥ 90 MME/day". These recommendations are presented as "voluntary, rather than prescriptive standards", and the guideline asserts that "clinical decision-making should be based on a relationship between the clinician and patient and an understanding of the patient's clinical situation, functioning, and life context".

The American Medical Association (AMA) has expressed concerns about the CDC guideline, including the potential for insurers and other payers to consider guideline recommendations as inflexible rules, rather than points for prescribers to consider, and use the recommendations to deny coverage. The guideline recommendations also may be used by pharmacies to deny prescriptions that exceed the recommended thresholds. State medical board opioid guidelines (eg, guidelines from the Federation of State Medical Boards)discourage clinicians from prescribing opioid dosages higher than the CDC guideline thresholds, and some payer policieslink the guideline to supply limits for opioids in the treatment of chronic noncancer pain. As a result, the guideline may have unintended consequences of not only creating barriers to initial prescription but also disrupting care in otherwise stable patients, even though the guideline itself notes that the dosing recommendations are less applicable to established patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy. Furthermore, reports from patients and health care providers corroborate the concerns about CDC guidelines expressed by the AMA.

The objective of this study, which was conducted after the publication of the CDC guidelines, was to assess the incidence and impact of opioid dose reduction on patients with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^113JTKn1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should not treat acute pain with ER/LA opioids or initiate opioid treatment for subacute or chronic pain with ER/LA opioids, and clinicians should not prescribe ER/LA opioids for intermittent or as-needed use.
ER/LA opioids should be reserved for severe, continuous pain. FDA has noted that some ER/LA opioids should be considered only for patients who have received certain dosages of opioids of immediate-release opioids daily for at least 1 week.
When changing to an ER/LA opioid for a patient previously receiving a different immediate-release opioid, clinicians should consult product labeling and reduce total daily dosage to account for incomplete opioid cross-tolerance.
Clinicians should use additional caution with ER/LA opioids and consider a longer dosing interval when prescribing to patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction because decreased clearance of medications among these patients can lead to accumulation of drugs to toxic levels and persistence in the body for longer durations.
Methadone should not be the first choice for an ER/LA opioid. Only clinicians who are familiar with methadone's unique risk profile and who are prepared to educate and closely monitor their patients, including assessing risk for QT prolongation and considering electrocardiographic monitoring, should consider prescribing methadone for pain.
Only clinicians who are familiar with the dosing and absorption properties of the ER/LA opioid transdermal fentanyl and are prepared to educate their patients about its use should consider prescribing it.

Supporting Rationale

ER/LA opioids include methadone, transdermal fentanyl, and extended-release versions of opioids such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and morphine. Clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on short-term pain and function were generally consistent across duration of action (short- or long-acting) and opioid type (opioid agonist, partial agonist, or mixed mechanism [with mixed opioid and nonopioid mechanisms of action] agent), although five trials directly comparing different types of opioids found a mixed mechanism agent associated with greater pain relief versus a pure opioid agonist, with fewer nonserious adverse events. A fair-quality study demonstrated a higher risk for overdose among patients treated with ER/LA opioids than among those treated with immediate-release opioids, especially within the first 2 weeks of therapy, with relative risk decreasing with longer duration of exposure. Clinical evidence reviews did not find evidence that continuous, time-scheduled use of ER/LA opioids is more effective or safer than intermittent use of immediate-release opioids or that time-scheduled use of ER/ LA opioids reduces risk for opioid use disorder.

### Practical considerations and patient selection for intrathecal drug delivery in the management of chronic pain [^111uYXHz]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Clinical evidence supports the view that IT drug delivery has a defined role as an option for appropriate patients with refractory chronic pain. Health care providers considering IT drug delivery as a treatment for their patients should ensure that their practices are positioned to meet the challenges of IT drug delivery and can fully accommodate all aspects of IT drug delivery. Recognition and use of important patient selection criteria, including treatment history, diagnosis, pathology, and age, along with cognitive, psychological, or socioeconomic status, can help guide and improve the successful management of chronic pain with IT therapy.

IT morphine can be an appropriate choice for a patient whose pain is not responsive to non-narcotic analgesics. It provides documented efficacy, as a monotherapy or in combination, for improved functionality and the reduction of pain intensity, as well as for the need for systemic opioids. A patient's risk of potentially serious complications with IT morphine, such as respiratory depression, peripheral edema, granulomas, tolerance, and withdrawal, needs to be considered carefully. Notably, IT morphine should not be used in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, such as chronic asthma or upper airway obstruction, or any other chronic pulmonary disorder, without full consideration of the known risk of acute respiratory failure in these patients. Care should be used in patients with decreased respiratory reserve or those who are immunosuppressed.

IT ziconotide can be an appropriate choice for patients with severe chronic, refractory nociceptive, neuropathic, or mixed neuropathic/nociceptive pain. It provides documented efficacy as a monotherapy, it may be effective in combination with other medications to reduce pain intensity and improve functionality, and it may reduce the need for systemic opioids. Ziconotide also provides the pain specialist with an important alternative to morphine, to avoid opioid-related respiratory depression in patients with lung disease/compromised respiratory reserve or peripheral edema, and in patients with opioid resistance who require high doses or rapidly escalating doses, or who develop opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Unlike morphine and other opioids, ziconotide is not associated with issues of tolerance, withdrawal, or granulomas, which can have major deleterious effects.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^112dgYFH]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making. Risks of opioid use, including risk for overdose and overdose death, increase continuously with dosage, and there is no single dosage threshold below which risks are eliminated. Therefore, the recommendation language emphasizes that clinicians should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients rather than emphasizing a single specific numeric threshold. Further, these recommendations apply specifically to starting opioids or to increasing opioid dosages, and a different set of benefits and risks applies to reducing opioid dosages (see Recommendation 5).
When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage.
For patients not already taking opioids, the lowest effective dose can be determined using product labeling as a starting point with calibration as needed based on the severity of pain and other clinical factors such as renal or hepatic insufficiency (see Recommendation 8).
The lowest starting dose for opioid-naïve patients is often equivalent to a single dose of approximately 5–10 MME or a daily dosage of 20–30 MME/day. A listing of common opioid medications and their doses in MME equivalents is provided (Table). TABLE Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management Sources: Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7. Abbreviations: mcg/hr = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent. * Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr. 2) Equianalgesic dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics. 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting opioids, the new opioid is typically dosed at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variability in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use particular caution with methadone dose conversions because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than peak analgesic effect. 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and its absorption is affected by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in the table because of their partial µ -receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full µ -receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosage decisions related to the management of opioid use disorder. † Tapentadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists. § Tramadol is a µ -receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of µ -receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tramadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely µ -receptor agonists.
If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage and should generally avoid dosage increases when possible.
Many patients do not experience benefit in pain or function from increasing opioid dosages to ≥ 50 MME/day but are exposed to progressive increases in risk as dosage increases. Therefore, before increasing total opioid dosage to ≥ 50 MME/day, clinicians should pause and carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks. If a decision is made to increase dosage, clinicians should use caution and increase dosage by the smallest practical amount. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.
Additional dosage increases beyond 50 MME/day are progressively more likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits for pain and function relative to risks to patients as dosage increases further. Clinicians should carefully evaluate a decision to further increase dosage on the basis of individualized assessment of benefits and risks and weighing factors such as diagnosis, incremental benefits for pain and function relative to risks with previous dosage increases, other treatments and effectiveness, and patient values and preferences. The recommendations related to opioid dosages are not intended to be used as an inflexible, rigid standard of care; rather, they are intended to be guideposts to help inform clinician-patient decision-making.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, SOGC 2023 guidelines recommend to counsel pregnant patients about the risks and benefits of prescribed opioids for chronic pain to weigh the likelihood of increased pain when reducing or withdrawing medication against potential adverse effects on the pregnancy from continuing therapeutic doses of pain medication. Titrate opioids for chronic, non-cancer pain management to the lowest effective dose, with the understanding that the dose may need to be increased because of the metabolic changes caused by pregnancy.

### CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain – United States, 2016 [^113sLZsH]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Primary care clinicians find managing chronic pain challenging. Evidence of long-term efficacy of opioids for chronic pain is limited. Opioid use is associated with serious risks, including opioid use disorder and overdose.

Objective

To provide recommendations about opioid prescribing for primary care clinicians treating adult patients with chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.

Process

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated a 2014 systematic review on effectiveness and risks of opioids and conducted a supplemental review on benefits and harms, values and preferences, and costs. CDC used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to assess evidence type and determine the recommendation category.

Evidence Synthesis

Evidence consisted of observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations, characterized as low quality using GRADE methodology. Meta-analysis was not attempted due to the limited number of studies, variability in study designs and clinical heterogeneity, and methodological shortcomings of studies. No study evaluated long-term (≥ 1 year) benefit of opioids for chronic pain. Opioids were associated with increased risks, including opioid use disorder, overdose, and death, with dose-dependent effects.

Recommendations

There are 12 recommendations. Of primary importance, nonopioid therapy is preferred for treatment of chronic pain. Opioids should be used only when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks. Before starting opioids, clinicians should establish treatment goals with patients and consider how opioids will be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. When opioids are used, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage, carefully reassess benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents or more per day, and avoid concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines whenever possible. Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued opioid therapy with patients every 3 months or more frequently and review prescription drug monitoring program data, when available, for high-risk combinations or dosages. For patients with opioid use disorder, clinicians should offer or arrange evidence-based treatment, such as medication-assisted treatment with buprenorphine or methadone.

Conclusions and Relevance

The guideline is intended to improve communication about benefits and risks of opioids for chronic pain, improve safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce risks associated with long-term opioid therapy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1131a63e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should carefully weigh both the benefits and risks of continuing opioid medications and the benefits and risks of tapering opioids.
If benefits outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should work closely with patients to optimize nonopioid therapies while continuing opioid therapy.
When benefits (including avoiding risks of tapering) do not outweigh risks of continued opioid therapy, clinicians should optimize other therapies and work closely with patients to gradually taper to a reduced opioid dosage or, if warranted based on the individual clinical circumstances of the patient, appropriately taper and discontinue opioid therapy.
In situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important.
At times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether or not tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment.
Patient agreement and interest in tapering is likely to be a key component of successful tapers.
For patients agreeing to taper to lower opioid dosages and for those remaining on higher opioid dosages, clinicians should establish goals with the patient for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendations 2 and 7) and maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should collaborate with the patient on the tapering plan, including patients in decisions such as how quickly tapering will occur and when pauses in the taper might be warranted.
Clinicians should follow up frequently (at least monthly) with patients engaging in opioid tapering. Team members (e.g. nurses, pharmacists, and behavioral health professionals) can support the clinician and patient during the ongoing taper process through telephone contact, telehealth visits, or face-to-face visits.
When opioids are reduced or discontinued, a taper slow enough to minimize symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal (e.g. anxiety, insomnia, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, mydriasis, tremor, tachycardia, or piloerection) should be used.
Longer duration of previous opioid therapy might require a longer taper. For patients who have taken opioids long-term (e.g. for ≥ 1 year), tapers can be completed over several months to years depending on the opioid dosage and should be individualized based on patient goals and concerns.
When patients have been taking opioids for longer durations (e.g. for ≥ 1 year), tapers of 10% per month or slower are likely to be better tolerated than more rapid tapers.
For patients struggling to tolerate a taper, clinicians should maximize nonopioid treatments for pain and should address behavioral distress.
Clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptoms can signal the need to further slow the taper rate.
At times, tapers might have to be paused and restarted again when the patient is ready and might have to be slowed as patients reach low dosages.
Before reversing a taper, clinicians should carefully assess and discuss with the patient the benefits and risks of increasing opioid dosage.
Goals of the taper might vary (e.g. some patients might achieve discontinuation whereas others might attain a reduced dosage at which functional benefits outweigh risks). If the clinician has determined with the patient that the ultimate goal of tapering is discontinuing opioids, after the smallest available dose is reached the interval between doses can be extended and opioids can be stopped when taken less frequently than once a day.
Clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal.
Clinicians should advise patients of an increased risk for overdose on abrupt return to a previously prescribed higher dose because of loss of opioid tolerance, provide opioid overdose education, and offer naloxone.
Clinicians should remain alert to signs of and screen for anxiety, depression, and opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (see Recommendations 8 and 12) that might be revealed by an opioid taper and provide treatment or arrange for management of these comorbidities.
Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dose or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g. opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g. by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes and functional goals.
Clinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients' pain and opioid-related problems, including opioid use disorder.
Payers, health systems, and state medical boards should not use this clinical practice guideline to set rigid standards or performance incentives related to dose or duration of opioid therapy; should ensure that policies based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of opioids; and should ensure that policies do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are using prescribed opioids for chronic pain, including those receiving high dosages of opioids, or for refraining from rapidly tapering patients prescribed long-term opioid medications.
Although Recommendation 5 specifically refers to patients using long-term opioid therapy for subacute or chronic pain, many of the principles in these implementation considerations and supporting rationale, including communication with patients, pain management, behavioral support, and slower taper rates, also are relevant when discontinuing opioids in patients who have received them for shorter durations (see Recommendations 6 and 7).

The target audience for these guidelines was primary care providers treating chronic pain patients. The guidelines provided recommendations to limit morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and, more specifically, to avoid increasing > 90 mg/day without careful justification or guidance as to how to taper patients to these doses. Statements regarding MME are concerning as they were made without acknowledging the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability among different opioids. The guidelines also failed to note the variability among MME calculations/calculators which limits standardized conversion from one opioid to another. Subsequent data has indicated that providers, payers and policy makers have misapplied these recommendations. For this reason we have included questions pertaining to comfort level tapering at various MME in the survey.

Prior to and in response to these guidelines several states passed laws establishing maximum daily doses for opioids and many third-party payers have followed suit by limiting coverage based on maximum MMEs. Individual providers have often erred by applying the guidelines inflexibly and without regard for patient specific factors. Others have misapplied the recommendations to populations beyond the scope of the guideline such as those with cancer, those receiving medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction or post-surgical patients. In a commentary published approximately three years after the writing of the guidelines two of the authors commented that better evidence is needed to guide clinical decisions regarding when and how to reduce high dose opioids for patients receiving long term therapy. These laws and plan limitations pose multiple problems in our health care system including limiting patient access to necessary medications, potentially putting patients in danger of opioid withdrawal if their therapy is abruptly discontinued, and increased suicidality.

### The use of opioids in the management of chronic pain: synopsis of the 2022 updated U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^112nGnPM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Long-acting/ER opioids — Oxymorphone ER tablets have the following dosing, titration, and safety guidance: they are "Available as 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg tablets for every 12 hr administration"; for opioid-naive patients, "Initiate at 5 mg every 12 hr", and for opioid tolerant patients, "Convert current opioid to equianalgesic daily dose of oxycodone; reduce the calculated amount by 33–50% for initial daily start dose". Titration guidance states "Dose change increments: May increase by 5 to 10 mg every 12 hr every 3 to 7 days", and "Steady-state plasma levels are achieved after 3 days of multiple dose administration", with administration instructions that "Oxymorphone ER tablets must be taken whole, one tablet at a time, with enough water to ensure complete swallowing immediately after placing in the mouth". In special populations, "Elderly: Plasma drug levels are about 40% higher in elderly versus younger subjects; use caution, starting at the low end of dosing range and titrating slowly". Other considerations include food and alcohol restrictions: "Must be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal; food has been shown to increase peak levels of oxymorphone ER by 50%", and "Must NOT be taken concomitantly with alcohol, which can cause highly variable effects on peak drug levels, ranging from a decrease of 50% to an increase of 270%".

Implementation Considerations

In addition to evaluating benefits and risks of opioids before starting opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2), clinicians should evaluate patients to assess benefits and risks of opioids within 1–4 weeks of starting long-term opioid therapy or of dosage escalation.
Clinicians should consider follow-up intervals within the lower end of this range when ER/LA opioids are started or increased, because of the increased risk for overdose within the first 2 weeks of treatment, or when total daily opioid dosage is ≥ 50 MME/day. (Overdose risk is doubled across multiple studies for dosages of 50 to < 100 MME/day relative to < 20 MME/day.) (See Recommendation 4.)
Shorter follow-up intervals (every 2–3 days for the first week) should be strongly considered when starting or increasing the dosage of methadone, because of the variable half-life of this drug (see Recommendation 3) and the potential for drug accumulation during initiation and during upward titration of dosage.
An initial follow-up interval closer to 4 weeks can be considered when starting immediate-release opioids at a dosage of < 50 MME/day.
Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days to reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and prevent unintentional initiation of long-term opioid therapy. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently for most patients.
Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2).
Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at higher risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8).
Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation.
In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted.
At follow-up, clinicians should review patient perspectives and goals, determine whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including sustained improvement in pain and function, and determine whether the patient has experienced common or serious adverse events or early warning signs of serious adverse events or has signs of opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression, anxiety, or other psychological comorbidities is optimized.
Clinicians should ask patients about their preferences for continuing opioids, considering their effects on pain and function relative to any adverse effects experienced. If risks outweigh benefits of continued opioid therapy (e.g. if patients do not experience meaningful, sustained improvements in pain and function compared with before initiation of opioid therapy; if patients are taking higher-risk regimens [e.g. dosages of ≥ 50 MME/day or opioids combined with benzodiazepines] without evidence of benefit; if patients believe benefits no longer outweigh risks; if patients request dosage reduction or discontinuation; or if patients experience overdose or other serious adverse events), clinicians should work with patients to taper and reduce opioid dosage or taper and discontinue opioids when possible (see from Recommendation 5).
Clinicians should maximize pain treatment with nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments as appropriate (see Recommendation 2).

### Opioid management: initiating, monitoring, and tapering [^113KXguR]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Numerous guidelines targeting safe use of opioids for chronic pain have been published but substantial challenges persist in clinical application of best practice recommendations. This article describes a pragmatic approach to clinical care of adults with chronic pain receiving long-term opioid therapy. Three components of care are emphasized: (1) medical and mental health assessment before initiating opioid therapy, (2) clinical surveillance during the course of long-term opioid therapy, and (3) clinical considerations and strategies governing opioid tapering. A pressing need exists for ongoing research to further clarify the optimal role that long-term opioid therapy has in treatment of chronic pain.

### Practical considerations for the use of tapentadol prolonged release for the management of severe chronic pain [^111gFRFU]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic pain is often challenging to address appropriately. Although patients with severe chronic pain may respond to treatment with an opioid analgesic, opioids are often associated with adverse effects that may lead patients to disrupt or discontinue therapy. In addition, opioid analgesics alone may not be effective for all types of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain. Tapentadol prolonged release (PR), a centrally acting analgesic with 2 mechanisms of action (μ-opioid receptor agonism and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition), provides strong and reliable analgesia across a range of indications, including nociceptive, neuropathic, and mixed types of chronic pain, and is associated with an improved tolerability profile relative to classic opioid analgesics. The purpose of this article was to review the recent literature on different aspects related to the clinical use of tapentadol PR.

Methods

A review was conducted of the current literature and relevant unpublished data on initiation and titration of tapentadol PR, switching from classic strong opioids, risk of withdrawal after discontinuation, long-term treatment, coadministration with other medications, and risk of abuse and diversion.

Findings

Tapentadol PR may provide clinically meaningful benefits over classic opioid analgesics, including ease of initiating and titrating tapentadol PR treatment in opioid-naive and opioid-experienced patients, low risk of withdrawal after cessation of tapentadol PR therapy, a favorable pharmacokinetic profile (allowing for coadministration with other medications) of tapentadol PR, and low potential for tapentadol PR abuse.

Implications

The broad analgesic efficacy of tapentadol PR may simplify chronic pain management by allowing for the treatment of different types of pain with a single analgesic. In addition, tapentadol is associated with a low risk of pharmacokinetic interactions, which permits its use in patients taking multiple medications. Furthermore, the favorable tolerability profile of tapentadol PR may result in improved patient compliance and allow for easy titration and rotation from previous strong opioids.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — GRADE evidence to recommendation framework outlines decision domains, questions, and judgments as follows: Confidence in the quality of the evidence asks "Among the designated critical outcomes, what is the lowest quality of relevant evidence?" and "How likely is further research to change the confidence in the estimate of effect?" with judgments "High", "Moderate", "Low", and "Very low". Balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes asks about the magnitudes of desirable and undesirable outcomes and whether "benefits outweigh harms/burdens or vice versa", with judgments "Benefits outweigh harms/burdens", "Benefits slightly outweigh harm/burden", "Benefits and harms/burdens are balanced", "Harms/burdens slightly outweigh benefits", and "Harms/burdens outweigh benefits". Patient values and preferences asks what patients' values are, whether they are similar across the target population, and confidence in typical values and preferences, with judgments "Similar values", "Some variation", and "Large variation". Other implications (resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations) pose questions on costs, availability, resource variability, net benefit worth, and opportunity costs, with the judgment "Various considerations".

### Principles of opioid use in cancer pain [^115unKcA]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The management of pain is an essential aspect of comprehensive cancer care. Positive outcomes can be achieved in most patients with widely available therapies. There is a broad consensus that opioid-based pharmacotherapy is the first-line strategy for the treatment of moderate or severe chronic pain in populations with active disease, and treatment guidelines have been developed from the known pharmacology of these drugs, extant data, and extensive clinical experience. This article describes the major opioid analgesics available for the treatment of cancer-related pain and reviews the key elements for safe and effective prescribing, including selection of the best drug and route, approaches to titration and long-term administration of baseline and supplemental doses, rotation from one drug to another in poorly responsive patients, and management of opioid risks.

Continuing High-Dosage Opioids

Clinicians should closely monitor patients who are unable to taper and who continue on high-dosage or otherwise high-risk opioid regimens (e.g. opioids prescribed concurrently with benzodiazepines) and should work with patients to mitigate overdose risk (e.g. by providing overdose education and naloxone) (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians can use periodic and strategic motivational questions and statements to encourage movement toward appropriate therapeutic changes.

Management of chronic pain with opioids can be challenging, as can management of opioid discontinuation. However, clinicians have a responsibility to provide or arrange for coordinated management of patients' pain and opioid-related challenges. Payers and health systems should not use this clinical practice guideline to set rigid standards related to dosage or duration of opioid therapy and should ensure that policies based on cautionary dosage thresholds do not result in rapid tapers or abrupt discontinuation of opioids, do not penalize clinicians for accepting new patients who are receiving opioids for chronic pain, and do not provide incentives to clinicians to implement rapid tapering. Patients prescribed opioids but unable to access ongoing care might be at risk for abrupt opioid discontinuation and might miss opportunities to receive life-saving interventions, including monitoring for and management of mental health and substance use comorbidities.

Deciding Duration of Initial Opioid Prescription and Conducting Follow-Up

Recommendation 6

When opioids are needed for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

Short-acting oxymorphone — available as 5 or 10 mg tablets and 1mg/ml solution for injection — has initial oral dosage (in opioid-naïve) of 5 to 10 mg every 4 to 6 hr, and there is no optimal or maximum dose of oxymorphone; patients on LOT are likely to become tolerant and require doses higher than the usual dosage range to maintain the desired effect. Timing includes Analgesic Onset (min): 30 to 45 and Duration (hr): 4. In special populations, Elderly or debilitated: Use with caution and start at low end of dosing range; levels are increased 40% in patients ≥ 65 years. Food effects note: when taken orally with a high-fat meal, peak levels of oxymorphone immediate-release are 38 to 50% greater; it must be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.
