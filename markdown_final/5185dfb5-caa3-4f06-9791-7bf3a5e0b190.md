pulmonary hypertension

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pulmonary hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the modern hemodynamic definition and classification framework. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and why current therapies are limited. Next, I will review diagnostic algorithms and risk stratification. After that, I need to examine treatment strategies by WHO group, including PAH-specific therapy, CTEPH, and group 2/3 disease. Finally, I should consider special populations, emerging therapies, and knowledge gaps, and close with a concise clinical takeaway that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the contemporary definition and classification, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. The 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines endorse a mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mmHg as the hemodynamic threshold for pulmonary hypertension, with pre-capillary PH defined by pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 2 Wood units and a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and they maintain the five-group clinical classification that distinguishes PAH (group 1), PH due to left heart disease (group 2), PH due to lung disease/hypoxia (group 3), CTEPH (group 4), and PH with unclear/multifactorial mechanisms (group 5) [^1114ERM9] [^115ot1j3].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump into treatment implications. PAH is driven by endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and proliferative vascular remodeling with plexiform lesions, leading to increased right ventricular afterload and maladaptive RV remodeling; current therapies predominantly target vasodilatory pathways (endothelin, nitric oxide–sGC, prostacyclin), but these address the vasoconstrictive phenotype seen in only a minority, explaining limited disease-modifying effects and persistent mortality despite modern therapy [^115fKVGu] [^11463qu8] [^113eGnkX].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach and not overstate any single test. The 2022 ESC/ERS algorithm emphasizes two parallel tasks: early suspicion and fast-track referral to PH centers when PAH or CTEPH is likely, and systematic identification of underlying diseases, especially left heart and lung disease, to correctly classify PH; echocardiography provides a probability estimate, but definitive diagnosis of PAH requires right heart catheterization with vasoreactivity testing in appropriate phenotypes, and V/Q scanning remains the screening test of choice for CTEPH [^113C37y2] [^116KTTLd] [^11694fq2] [^116iUMbz].

> I need to check risk stratification because it drives therapy intensity. The 2022 guidelines refine risk assessment into a three-strata model at diagnosis and a four-strata model at follow-up, integrating clinical, imaging, and biomarker data; high-risk patients have 3-year survival around 28–55%, which justifies aggressive upfront combination therapy including parenteral prostacyclin, whereas low-risk patients may start with oral monotherapy in select contexts [^113k4A9P] [^113eGnkX] [^114ESnRy].

> Let me consider general measures and supportive care, since these apply across groups. Supervised exercise rehabilitation improves functional capacity and quality of life, oxygen is indicated for hypoxemia, diuretics and digoxin are used judiciously for RV failure, and palliative care integration is recommended to address symptoms and goals of care. I should confirm that these are guideline-endorsed, which they are in ESC/ERS and CHEST documents [^115RZ7wc] [^114TffxU] [^11315gMd].

> Now, for PAH-specific therapy, I should double-check the strength of evidence for initial combination therapy. The AMBITION program demonstrated that initial ambrisentan plus tadalafil delays clinical failure versus monotherapy, supporting upfront dual oral therapy in treatment-naïve, non-vasoreactive patients; for high-risk patients, guidelines recommend initial triple therapy including IV/SC prostacyclin, given epoprostenol's survival signal in severe disease [^117Xhm43] [^115vbW4g] [^116KTTLd].

> But wait, what if the patient is vasoreactive at catheterization. I should confirm that a small subset, roughly 10–12% of idiopathic/heritable PAH, demonstrate acute vasoreactivity and may benefit from high-dose calcium channel blockers, with response reassessed at 3–4 months; nonresponders or inadequate responders should transition to standard PAH therapy per risk strata [^116KTTLd] [^117XquFG].

> Next, I will examine combination therapy principles and sequencing, and I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. Sequential or upfront combinations targeting different pathways are rational given pathobiologic redundancy; meta-analyses show reductions in clinical worsening and improved 6MWD with combination therapy, though mortality effects are less certain, and guidelines endorse escalation based on risk and response, with triple therapy considered in high-risk or refractory cases [^113ps8PJ] [^1145D71Z] [^114tztrQ].

> I should review the four canonical drug classes and their roles. Endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan), PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil), the sGC stimulator riociguat, and prostacyclin pathway agents (epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, selexipag) each modulate distinct axes. Selexipag reduced morbidity/mortality events in a large event-driven trial, reinforcing prostacyclin pathway importance in modern algorithms [^112qS915] [^113Sx93j] [^116PHtoE].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to group 2 PH due to left heart disease, because misapplication of PAH drugs here is common. Guidelines do not recommend PAH-specific vasodilators in PH-LHD due to neutral or harmful signals in trials; management should focus on optimizing left heart disease therapy, with ongoing research into mechanisms and careful selection of subgroups that might benefit from targeted agents [^114GoHhX] [^1166f3Xw].

> For group 3 PH due to lung disease or hypoxia, I need to ensure I emphasize disease-specific therapy first. The cornerstone is optimal treatment of the underlying lung disease, correction of hypoxemia with long-term oxygen, and pulmonary rehabilitation; a recent positive RCT in interstitial lung disease with severe PH supports cautious, individualized use of PAH therapy in selected patients, but broad application remains discouraged pending more data [^111SfUgw] [^115KKg3d] [^111aLHa5].

> Let me reconsider CTEPH, because it is a distinct, potentially curable form. Surgical pulmonary endarterectomy is first-line for operable patients, while inoperable or residual cases benefit from riociguat. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty is an emerging option in expert centers, and I should confirm that guidelines prioritize these interventions before considering PAH drugs off-label [^114GoHhX] [^117XquFG].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pediatrics, and I should double-check that recommendations are evidence-based. Many pediatric therapies remain off-label, but recent ATS guidance addresses progressive PH despite optimal therapy and supports referral to specialized centers; adult algorithms are often extrapolated with attention to growth, development, and pharmacokinetics, underscoring the need for pediatric expertise [^112TpYqe] [^115XyCh6].

> Next, I should review pregnancy, and I need to be cautious. PAH confers high maternal-fetal risk; pregnancy is generally discouraged in severe disease, and if pregnancy occurs, management requires coordinated care at experienced centers, with avoidance of teratogenic agents and careful hemodynamic monitoring, though high-quality trial data are limited and decisions remain individualized [^11315gMd].

> Let me think about emerging therapies and the concept of disease modification, and I should verify the most promising signals. Sotatercept, an activin receptor ligand trap, has shown unprecedented reductions in pulmonary vascular resistance and improved 6MWD in phase 3, suggesting antiproliferative remodeling effects; regulatory and guideline positioning is evolving, and ongoing studies will clarify where it fits relative to existing pathways [^111YVpE5] [^111ZSDjH].

> I should confirm the research gaps and trial design shifts, because they shape future care. Key uncertainties include the initiating events in PAH, the absence of right ventricle–directed therapies, and the need for biomarkers and machine learning to enable earlier detection and personalized therapy; endpoints are moving from 6MWD to event-driven composites and RV-focused measures, but feasibility in a rare disease demands innovative designs and enriched cohorts [^112QoeeC] [^114s83YU] [^117J7RER].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that modern therapy has normalized survival — let me correct that. Despite 14 approved drugs and robust combination strategies, PAH remains progressive and lethal, with 3-year survival in high-risk patients still poor; this persistent mortality drives the urgency for antiproliferative agents, RV-targeted therapies, and earlier, phenotype-guided intervention [^113eGnkX] [^112toUFR].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is actionable and aligned with guidelines. PH is common and heterogeneous. Accurate classification via guideline-directed algorithms, risk-stratified PAH therapy with initial combination treatment in appropriate patients, avoidance of PAH drugs in group 2 and broad group 3 populations, and timely referral to expert centers for advanced therapies and CTEPH evaluation are the pillars of contemporary care, with emerging therapies like sotatercept poised to expand the armamentarium if durability and outcomes are confirmed [^114GoHhX] [^111SfUgw] [^115vbW4g] [^111YVpE5].

Pulmonary hypertension is defined by a **mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20 mmHg** [^1114ERM9] and is classified into five groups by cause [^1114ERM9]. Diagnosis relies on **echocardiography for screening** and **right heart catheterization** for confirmation and classification [^116iUMbz]. Management is cause-specific: PAH (group 1) is treated with vasodilators and combination therapy [^113k4A9P]; CTEPH (group 4) may require pulmonary endarterectomy or balloon angioplasty [^114GoHhX]; groups 2–3 are managed by treating the underlying cardiac or lung disease, with oxygen and supportive care [^111SfUgw]. Prognosis varies by group and treatment response, and **early referral to specialized centers** is essential for optimal outcomes [^115GQt7v].

---

## Classification

The **WHO classifies PH into five groups** based on etiology [^116wqY75]:

| **Group** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [^1114ERM9] |
| 2 | PH due to left heart disease [^1114ERM9] |
| 3 | PH due to lung disease and/or hypoxia [^116wqY75] |
| 4 | Chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH) [^1114ERM9] |
| 5 | PH with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms [^1114ERM9] |

---

## Pathophysiology

PH involves **vasoconstriction, vascular remodeling, and thrombosis**, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, and ultimately RV failure [^115fKVGu].

---

## Clinical presentation

Symptoms are nonspecific and include:

- Dyspnea
- Fatigue
- Chest pain
- Syncope
- Palpitations
- Edema
- Cyanosis

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Echocardiography**: Initial noninvasive screening tool [^116iUMbz].
- **Right heart catheterization**: Gold standard for diagnosis and hemodynamic assessment [^1114ERM9].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, LFTs, renal function, autoimmune panel, HIV testing [^11694fq2].
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray, CT angiography, ventilation-perfusion scan [^11694fq2].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause and severity**:

- **PAH (Group 1)**: Vasodilators (prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators), combination therapy, and lung transplantation in advanced cases [^113k4A9P] [^114GoHhX].
- **CTEPH (Group 4)**: Pulmonary endarterectomy, balloon pulmonary angioplasty, and medical therapy (riociguat) [^114GoHhX].
- **Groups 2–3**: Treat underlying cardiac or lung disease, oxygen therapy, and supportive care [^111SfUgw].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by group and treatment response. PAH has a **5-year survival rate of approximately 60%** with modern therapy, whereas CTEPH prognosis depends on operability and intervention success [^113eGnkX] [^114GoHhX].

---

## Recent advances

Recent advances include **novel therapies targeting the prostacyclin, endothelin, and nitric oxide pathways** [^112toUFR], and the development of **risk-stratified treatment algorithms** [^113k4A9P]. Emerging therapies such as sotatercept show promise in reversing vascular remodeling [^notfound].

---

Pulmonary hypertension is a complex, heterogeneous disease requiring **early diagnosis, accurate classification, and targeted therapy**. Multidisciplinary care at specialized centers improves outcomes and quality of life [^1132snfo].

The way forward

The true issues PAH patients and physicians face in the clinical practice is the insufficient efficacy of the present therapeutic resources, despite clear progress and the escape from 'the kingdom of the near-dead'. The current treatment strategy, optimized in recent guidelines, remains inadequate because the mortality rate continues to be high and the functional and haemodynamic impairments are still extensive in many patients. The specific drugs approved for PAH are able to slow the progression of the disease but cannot be considered a cure for the majority of patients.

Current and future plans devoted to increasing our ability to treat PAH are facing new challenges which require scientific creativity and new research strategies. Possible working hypotheses include the drug combination approach and new candidate classes of drugs.

Pulmonary Hypertension What is pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension happens when the pressure in the blood vessels leading from the heart to the lungs is too high. With pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels to the lungs develop an increased amount of muscle in the wall of the blood vessels. The heart pumps blood from the right ventricle to the lungs to get oxygen. Because the blood does not have to travel very far, the pressure in this side of the heart and in the artery taking blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is normally low — usually much lower than systolic or diastolic blood pressure. When the pressure in this artery gets too high, the arteries in the lungs can narrow and then the blood does not flow as well as it should, resulting in less oxygen in the blood.
1. What causes pulmonary hypertension.

Some common underlying causes of pulmonary hypertension include high blood pressure in the lungs' arteries due to some types of congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, liver disease, blood clots to the lungs, and chronic lung diseases like emphysema. Genetics also play a role. Pulmonary hypertension can happen in association with many other diseases, such as lung disease and heart disease. Heart failure is common in pulmonary hypertension. What are the risk factors for pulmonary hypertension.
- Pulmonary hypertension happens at all ages, including children, and its incidence increases with age.
- Pulmonary hypertension is more common among women, non-Hispanic black people, and people age 75 or older. What are the signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension during the initial stage of the disease are common to many other medical conditions. This often results in a delayed diagnosis until more severe symptoms arise, such as dizziness, chest pain, ankle swelling, or feeling the heart race or pound. 2, 3. How is pulmonary hypertension treated. There is no cure for pulmonary hypertension. However, there are many different types of treatments, including
- Inhaled medicine
- Medicine given through the veins under the skin
- Medicine to reduce swelling in the feet
- Oxygen therapy How can I prevent pulmonary hypertension. While not all pulmonary hypertension can be prevented, you can take steps to prevent it by making healthy lifestyle changes and managing high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic lung disease from tobacco use.

Future Directions

PH in LHD is the most common form of PH and brings a poor prognosis by increasing the morbidity and mortality risk of this patient population. Despite apparent similarities with PAH, the current guidelines do not recommend PAH‐targeted drugs for PH‐LHD. This is because of the failure of previous clinical trials in proving their safety and/or efficacy in the setting of PH‐LHD. It is imperative to further improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms of PH‐LHD to develop specific therapies for this disease and by doing so, establish an evidence‐based approach for the management of patients with HF developing PH. To understand these mechanisms, it is necessary to identify biological pathways or genetic factors associated with PH‐LHD. After establishing newer approaches, clinical trials focusing on outcomes such as mortality, hospitalizations, and quality of life would be necessary to correlate physiological recovery with clinical improvement.

Group 3 pulmonary hypertension — general therapy: The therapeutic approach to group 3 PH starts with optimizing the treatment of the underlying lung disease, including supplementary oxygen and non-invasive ventilation, where indicated, as well as enrolment into pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. There is limited and conflicting evidence for the use of medication approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with group 3 PH, and these drugs may have variable and sometimes detrimental effects on haemodynamics, exercise capacity, gas exchange, and outcomes in this patient population.

Key points
- Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal.
- The increased blood pressure in the lungs can make the heart work harder than normal to pump blood into the lungs. This can damage the heart and cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. What it is With pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels to the lungs develop an increased amount of muscle in the wall of the blood vessels. The heart pumps blood from the right ventricle to the lungs to get oxygen. Because the blood does not have to travel very far, the pressure in this side of the heart and in the artery taking blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is normally low — usually much lower than systolic or diastolic blood pressure.

When the pressure in this artery gets too high, the arteries in the lungs can narrow and then the blood does not flow as well as it should, resulting in less oxygen in the blood. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension during the initial stage of the disease are common to many other medical conditions.

### Contemporary treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: a U.S. perspective [^111ZSDjH]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a complex fatal condition that requires aggressive treatment with close monitoring. Significant progress has been made over the last three decades in the treatment of PAH, but, despite this progress, survival has remained unacceptably low. In the quest to improve survival, therapeutic interventions play a central role. In the last few years, there have been remarkable attempts to identify novel treatments. Finally, we have had a breakthrough with the discovery of the fourth treatment pathway in PAH. Activin signaling inhibition distinguishes itself as a potential antiproliferative intervention as opposed to the traditional therapies, which mediate their effect primarily by vasodilatation. With this novel treatment pathway, we stand at an important milestone with an exciting future ahead and the natural question of when to use an activin signaling inhibitor for the treatment of PAH. In this state-of-the-art review, we focus on the placement of this novel agent in the PAH treatment paradigm, based on the available evidence, with special focus on the U.S. patient population. This review also provides an expert opinion of the current treatment algorithm in important subgroups of patients with comorbidities from the U.S. perspective.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension combination therapy decision considerations — The guideline notes that "the addition of therapies to existing treatments or the use of multiple therapies as initial treatment remains a complicated issue", and that adding new therapies "requires that the clinician assess whether the patient has received an adequate trial of the initial therapy to assess efficacy and clinical status". This assessment "includes evaluation of the duration of therapy, the expected response to the therapy, the observed response to the therapy, and the patient's severity of illness and pace of decline", and "symptomatic limitation of desired physical activities usually guides these decisions".

Inhaled iloprost for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) has been studied in one RCT using daily repetitive inhalations 6–9 times at 2.5–5 μg/inhalation (median 30 μg daily) versus placebo, showing increased exercise capacity and improvements in symptoms, pulmonary vascular resistance, and clinical events; a second RCT on 60 patients on background bosentan increased exercise capacity (P < 0.01). Common adverse effects include cough, headache, flushing, and jaw pain; continuous i.v. iloprost appears to be as effective as epoprostenol in a small series, and the effects of oral iloprost have not been assessed in PAH.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension: challenges in translational research and a vision for change [^114n1MSc]. Science Translational Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a vascular remodeling disease with a relentless course toward heart failure and early death. Existing PAH therapies, all of which were developed originally to treat systemic vascular diseases, cannot reverse the disease or markedly improve survival and are expensive. Although there has been a recent increase in the number of potential new therapies emerging from animal studies, less than 3% of the active PAH clinical trials are examining such therapies. There are many potential explanations for the translational gap in this complex multifactorial disease. We discuss these challenges and propose solutions that range from including clinical endpoints in animal studies and improving the rigor of human trials to conducting mechanistic early-phase trials and randomized trials with innovative designs based on personalized medicine principles. Global, independent patient and tissue registries and enhanced communication among academics, industry, and regulatory authorities are needed. The diversity of the mechanisms and pathology of PAH calls for broad comprehensive theories that encompass emerging evidence for contributions of metabolism and inflammation to PAH to support more effective therapeutic target identification.

Combination therapy in PAH — evidence, sequencing, and goals — A meta-analysis on six RCTs including 858 patients found combination therapy reduced the risk of clinical worsening [relative risk (RR) 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26, 0.91), P = 0.023], increased the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) by 22 m, and did not increase serious adverse events [RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.40, 3.42), P = 0.77], while the reduction in all-cause mortality was not statistically significant; combination therapy may be applied sequentially or initially (upfront), with sequential combination being most widely utilized and goal-oriented therapy using targets including WHO-FC I or II and near-normalization of resting cardiac index (CI) and/or NT-proBNP plasma levels allowing additional therapy if treatment goals are not met.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease characterized by an elevation in pulmonary artery pressure that can lead to right ventricular failure and death. Although there is no cure for PAH, newer medical therapies have been shown to improve a variety of clinically relevant end-points including survival, exercise tolerance, functional class, haemodynamics, echocardiographic parameters and quality of life measures. Since the introduction of continuous intravenous prostacyclin, the treatment armamentarium of approved drugs for PAH has expanded to include prostacyclin analogues with differing routes of administration, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. Selective endothelin-A receptor antagonists have shown promise in clinical trials and are likely to be added to the list of options. As the number of medications available for PAH continues to increase, treatment decisions regarding first-line therapy, combination treatments, and add-on strategies are becoming more complex. This article reviews the current treatments strategies for PAH and provides guidelines for its management.

### New progress in diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116Ly4cU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

PAH is a complex disease with high mortality and disability. Over the past several decades, there has been significant progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis and treatment of PAH. However, there is no effective treatment for PAH. Therefore, the severity and risk of PAH patients should be evaluated to develop effective treatment strategies. In addition, patients also need regular structured follow-up, accurate assessment of the patient's condition, and timely detection of disease changes to adjust the treatment strategy.

### Future treatment paradigms in pulmonary arterial hypertension: a personal view from physicians, health authorities, and patients [^114pp8N8]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Novel treatments in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with significant pathophysiological and clinical responses have generated renewed interest in changing the course of the disease and achieving long-term disease control. Historically, the term disease modification was coined in rheumatological conditions with therapies that managed to treat the underlying condition as opposed to just alleviating symptoms. With the advent of novel therapies, the term disease modification was introduced in our discussions. Last year, a group of experts discussed this concept in PAH and proposed clinical trial designs to show disease modification in PAH. Taking a step further we convened a group of international experts at the 20th Global CardioVascular Clinical Trialists Forum, patients' representatives, and members of global regulatory agencies to discuss future treatment objectives and trial designs in PAH. The deliberations revealed the difficulty with securely defining disease modification, in that there are no pathophysiological biomarkers that reflect disease activity and studies are not designed or performed in a way that would support such designation. Regulatory agencies indicated they are going away from making this designation a priority in PAH. They declared interest in encouraging trials that advance interventions with significant pathophysiological effect, in particular showing reverse pulmonary vascular remodelling, which is likely to bring about more potent clinical response, partial or complete remission, and perhaps cure. In this Personal View, we provide a review of our understanding of defining disease modification in PAH along with providing definitions of what might constitute a partial or full remission in PAH.

### Evaluation and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^114uje5t]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a devastating progressive disease mediated by different pathophysiologic pathways that result in progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance along with right ventricular failure and eventually premature death. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and development of a number of targeted therapies, pulmonary arterial hypertension remains a challenging condition with high morbidity and mortality. New therapies are being actively sought, and early recognition remains of paramount importance. In an effort to improve the detection and management of pulmonary hypertension, the 6th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension came up with most recent statements in 2018. The goal of this review is to summarize some key updates from the proceedings of the Symposium pertaining to different aspects of evaluation and management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^1155FzNA]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Over the past two decades, substantial progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis and clinical characteristics of pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. Pathophysiologically relevant and clinically targetable changes exist in the areas of inflammation and immune dysregulation, angiogenesis, metabolism, epigenetics and genetics, as well as sex hormone signalling. Major progress has also been made in identifying mediators of right ventricular adaptation and maladaptation in pulmonary hypertension. New treatment strategies focusing on these areas are promising and could change how we think about treatment in the near future.

Questions for future research

What molecular mechanisms initiate pulmonary arterial hypertension and which cell types are critical targets?
Can we establish curative treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension and other types of pulmonary hypertension?
Is there a role for personalised treatment approaches in pulmonary arterial hypertension and other types of pulmonary hypertension?
Is there a role for pulmonary vasodilators for patients that do not meet enrolment criteria for previous trials?

Questions for future research

Despite improvements in our understanding of pulmonary arterial hypertension, several questions remain. The development of curative treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension and for other types of pulmonary hypertension is needed. Furthermore, the key initiating events in pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension and in what combination they occur are still unclear. Also unclear is whether pulmonary arterial hypertension is a systemic rather than a cardiopulmonary disease, and whether pre-existing metabolic, inflammatory, and genetic and epigenetic abnormalities can predispose some individuals to develop pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary hypertension. Regardless, the critical point at which a patientdevelops or does not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension or pulmonary hypertension is not defined. Molecularly, which cell types are the most critically injured is still debated, and the exact mechanisms are speculative because most work on the cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension has been in preclinical animal models (which do not replicate human disease completely), and patient tissues from early stages of the disease are not available.

Finally, despite its importance for patient survival and mortality, no treatments directed at the right ventricle currently exist. Research is only beginning to molecularly define right ventricular failure and how it progresses. The development of powerful new omics based approaches and improved access and affordability of database repositories increases the likelihood that we will identify new cell populations in the pulmonary circulation that are critical for the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension, define new signalling networks, and more accurately determine intercellular and intersystem communication in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. These advances will ultimately lead to the development of new molecular targets and prognostic biomarkers. Algorithms based on machine learning will also help identify prognostic factors for pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. This approach will allow investigators to rapidly process large amounts of data, and despite the heterogeneity of the disease, use an unbiased approach to identify new patterns and indicators of the prognosis, progression, and outcomes of pulmonary hypertension. Clinically, more research is needed to clarify whether treating people according to new definitions means better outcomes. Also, the role and place of new treatments needs to be defined. Table 2 summaries the current gaps in our knowledge.

### The molecular targets of approved treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^116PHtoE]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Until recently, three classes of medical therapy were available for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. With the approval of the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat, an additional drug class has become available targeting a distinct molecular target in the same pathway as PDE5 inhibitors. Treatment recommendations currently include the use of all four drug classes to treat PAH, but there is a lack of comparative data for these therapies. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanistic differences between these agents is critical when making treatment decisions. Combination therapy is often used to treat PAH and it is therefore important that physicians understand how the modes of action of these drugs may interact to work as complementary partners, or potentially with unwanted consequences. Furthermore, different patient phenotypes mean that patients respond differently to treatment; while a certain monotherapy may be adequate for some patients, for others it will be important to consider alternating or combining compounds with different molecular targets. This review describes how the four currently approved drug classes target the complex pathobiology of PAH and will consider the distinct target molecules of each drug class, their modes of action, and review the pivotal clinical trial data supporting their use. It will also discuss the rationale for combining drugs (or not) from the different classes, and review the clinical data from studies on combination therapy.

### Pulmonary hypertension in parenchymal lung diseases: any future for new therapies? [^116hpQWp]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to chronic lung disease is associated with a poor prognosis, regardless of the underlying respiratory condition. Updated PH guidelines recommend optimal treatment of the underlying lung disease, including long-term oxygen therapy, in patients with chronic hypoxemia despite the lack of randomized controlled clinical trials supporting this statement. So far, randomized controlled trials of drugs approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension have yielded discouraging results in both interstitial lung diseases and COPD with PH. In some cases, the trials were terminated because of an increase in death and other major adverse events in the active treatment arm vs placebo. In cases of PH due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, new therapies under investigation use a combination of novel antifibrotic treatments and other treatments approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The choice of robust end points as well as a target group of patients with specific hemodynamic criteria may help in the selection of innovative therapeutic strategies. The aim of this review is to discuss recent studies and clinical trials for the treatment of PH due to the main chronic respiratory diseases and to discuss possible future scenarios for the evaluation of new therapeutic strategies.

### Evidence for the use of combination targeted therapeutic approaches for the management of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113inYpj]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The last decade has witnessed a remarkable increase in the number of effective treatment options available for the management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In this regard, agents belonging to the therapeutic classes that specifically target the prostacyclin, endothelin and nitric oxide pathways have shown the greatest efficacy in clinical studies to date. These various drug treatments have individually been shown to confer improvements in symptoms, exercise capacity, pulmonary haemodynamics and possibly survival in different patient subgroups. However, pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterised by dysregulation of a variety of pathways. In addition, disease worsening is inevitable for the majority of patients receiving monotherapy. As a consequence, there is increasing interest in the use of treatment combinations in order to target multiple targets with the aim of restoring normal pulmonary vascular function in order to improve clinical status. Indeed, use of multiple specific-treatment regimens is now part of routine clinical practice and is emphasized in recently published therapeutic guidelines. This review details the rationale for the different combination strategies and examines the clinical evidence in favour of some of the approaches that have been evaluated.

### Endpoints in pulmonary arterial hypertension: the role of clinical worsening [^117J7RER]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Design and selection of endpoints used in clinical trials is a complex and compelling topic; the diverse needs of clinicians, patients and regulatory authorities represent a challenge in devising the most relevant, meaningful yet practical measures. In trials of therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a variety of endpoints have been used, including assessments of exercise capacity (6-min walk distance [6MWD]), functional class, hemodynamics, and time to clinical worsening. Most have relied upon 6MWD as the primary endpoint.

Recent Findings

Accumulating experience and expertise suggests that the relevance of the 6-min walk test as a stand-alone measure of efficacy is now a topic for consideration. Furthermore, 6MWD tends to correlate poorly with other endpoints and, most importantly, there is no linear relationship between 6MWD and morbidity/mortality. Although no linear relationship has been identified with other endpoints, time to clinical worsening may be considered a better endpoint for assessing the effectiveness of PAH therapies, in particular the impact of treatment on disease progression, because it is very relevant to the clinical outcome of patients. Treatment of mildly symptomatic patients, for example, has demonstrated a clear delay in time to clinical worsening and the endpoint might be better suited than others to demonstrate the efficacy of combination therapy.

Summary

As the field of PAH develops and progresses, time to clinical worsening may be the best way currently of distinguishing between the increasing number of treatment options available. A clear definition must, therefore, be established, with adjudication by an expert panel; the needs of clinicians, patients, and regulators should be balanced when selecting the most appropriate endpoints.

### Management of pulmonary arterial hypertension with a focus on combination therapies [^116STXEp]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but frequently fatal condition marked by vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling within small pulmonary arteries. The pathobiology of PAH involves imbalances in a multitude of endogenous mediators, which promote aberrant cellular growth, vasoconstriction and hemostasis within the pulmonary vascular tree. The mechanisms promoting these pathologic effects are complex. This complexity is highlighted by the many overlapping secondary messenger systems through which these mediators work. In light of this natural redundancy, it is not surprising that many of the drugs used to treat PAH, which have shown short-term efficacy, fall "short of the mark" in reversing or halting the progression of this disease in the long run. This very redundancy in pathways makes the case for the use of combination of drugs with differing mechanisms of action to treat PAH. Similar to what is now accepted as the standard of care for the treatment of cancer and left ventricular dysfunction, combination therapy has the greatest promise for inducing the most complete vascular remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature by "shutting down" as many of these pathologic pathways as possible. Combination therapies involving existing therapies or new agents with improved pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties represent an emerging clinical paradigm for patients with sub-optimally managed disease. As emerging data in this field of therapy comes to fruition, further reductions in the morbidity and mortality associated with PAH will manifest. The goal of this report is to review the philosophy of combination therapy and present the available data in this area of study.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^115fKVGu]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and often fatal cardiopulmonary condition characterised by increased pulmonary arterial pressure, structural changes in the pulmonary circulation, and the formation of vaso-occlusive lesions. These changes lead to increased right ventricular afterload, which often progresses to maladaptive right ventricular remodelling and eventually death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension represents one of the most severe and best studied types of pulmonary hypertension and is consistently targeted by drug treatments. The underlying molecular pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension is a complex and multifactorial process, but can be characterised by several hallmarks: inflammation, impaired angiogenesis, metabolic alterations, genetic or epigenetic abnormalities, influence of sex and sex hormones, and abnormalities in the right ventricle. Current treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension and some other types of pulmonary hypertension target pathways involved in the control of pulmonary vascular tone and proliferation; however, these treatments have limited efficacy on patient outcomes. This review describes key features of pulmonary hypertension, discusses current and emerging therapeutic interventions, and points to future directions for research and patient care. Because most progress in the specialty has been made in pulmonary arterial hypertension, this review focuses on this type of pulmonary hypertension. The review highlights key pathophysiological concepts and emerging therapeutic directions, targeting inflammation, cellular metabolism, genetics and epigenetics, sex hormone signalling, bone morphogenetic protein signalling, and inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptors.

### The current treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: time to redefine success [^112ZdLx4]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

In the past decade, three classes of medications have been approved for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. A review of the clinical trial data for the prostanoids, endothelin antagonists, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors has shown that all agents have similar efficacy on the 6-min walk distance over 12 to 16 weeks, which was the primary end point in the randomized clinical trials. However, little is known about their long-term efficacy or about how these drugs affect the underlying disease, if at all. Successful therapy is currently defined as an improvement in exercise tolerance over a 4-month period. Future trials need to better characterize how therapies affect the pulmonary vasculature pathologically, biologically, and hemodynamically, and whether survival is actually improved.

### Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: recent progress and a look to the future [^112toUFR]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe but treatable form of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary vascular remodelling. As a result of basic science discoveries, randomised controlled trials, studies of real-world data, and the development of clinical practice guidelines, considerable progress has been made in the treatment options and outcomes for patients with PAH, underscoring the importance of seamless translation of information from bench to bedside and, ultimately, to patients. However, PAH still carries a high mortality rate, which emphasises the urgent need for transformative innovations in the field. In this Series paper, written by a group of clinicians, researchers, and a patient with PAH, we review therapeutic approaches and treatment options for PAH. We summarise current knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of PAH, with an emphasis on emerging treatable pathways and optimisation of current management strategies. In considering future directions for the field, our ambition is to identify therapies with the potential to stall or reverse pulmonary vascular remodelling. We highlight novel therapeutic approaches, the important role of patients as partners in research, and innovative approaches to PAH clinical trials.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating disease that leads to right heart failure and premature death. Historically, we are restricted by limited options for drug treatment. Over the past decade, with advances in our understanding of pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms, many new therapeutic strategies (synthetic prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists and sildenafil) have been developed for the treatment of PAH, and the clinical efficacy has been tested in many randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). In this overview, we review the evidence for the use of historical and new treatments that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews and from recent RCTs.

### Therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension in adults: update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115GQt7v]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) carries a poor prognosis if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. The development and approval of 14 medications over the last several decades have led to a rapidly evolving approach to therapy, and have necessitated periodic updating of evidence-based treatment guidelines. This guideline statement, which now includes a visual algorithm to enhance its clinical utility, represents the fourth iteration of the American College of Chest Physicians Guideline and Expert Panel Report on Pharmacotherapy for PAH.

Methods

The guideline panel conducted an updated systematic review to identify studies published after those included in the 2014 guideline. A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE via PubMed and the Cochrane Library. The quality of the body of evidence was assessed for each critical or important outcome of interest using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were developed and voted on using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus.

Results

Two new recommendations on combination therapy and two ungraded consensus-based statements on palliative care were developed. An evidence-based and consensus-driven treatment algorithm was created to guide the clinician through an organized approach to management, and to direct readers to the appropriate area of the document for more detailed information.

Conclusions

Therapeutic options for the patient with PAH continue to expand through basic discovery, translational science, and clinical trials. Optimal use of new treatment options requires prompt evaluation at an expert center, utilization of current evidence-based guidelines, and collaborative care using sound clinical judgment.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension [^116wqY75]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a group of complex and heterogenous conditions, characterised by elevated pulmonary artery pressure, and which left untreated leads to right-heart failure and death. PH includes World Health Organisation (WHO) Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Group 2 consists of PH due to left-heart disease (PH-LHD); Group 3 comprises PH as a result of lung diseases or hypoxia, or both; Group 4 includes PH due to chronic thromboembolic occlusion of pulmonary vasculature (CTEPH), and Group 5 consists of cases of PH due to unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms including haematological, systemic, or metabolic disorders. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors increase vasodilation and inhibit proliferation.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension in adults and children.

Search Methods

We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 26 September 2018. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared any PDE5 inhibitor versus placebo, or any other PAH disease-specific therapies, for at least 12 weeks. We include separate analyses for each PH group.

We imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full-text versions of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. Primary outcomes were: change in WHO functional class, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), and mortality. Secondary outcomes were haemodynamic parameters, quality of life/health status, dyspnoea, clinical worsening (hospitalisation/intervention), and adverse events. When appropriate, we performed meta-analyses and subgroup analyses by severity of lung function, connective tissue disease diagnosis, and radiological pattern of fibrosis. We assessed the evidence using the GRADE approach and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 36 studies with 2999 participants (with pulmonary hypertension from all causes) in the final review. Trials were conducted for 14 weeks on average, with some as long as 12 months. Two trials specifically included children. Nineteen trials included group 1 PAH participants. PAH participants treated with PDE5 inhibitors were more likely to improve their WHO functional class (odds ratio (OR) 8.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.95 to 18.72; 4 trials, 282 participants), to walk 48 metres further in 6MWD (95% CI 40 to 56; 8 trials, 880 participants), and were 22% less likely to die over a mean duration of 14 weeks (95% CI 0.07 to 0.68; 8 trials, 1119 participants) compared to placebo (high-certainty evidence). The number needed to treat to prevent one additional death was 32 participants. There was an increased risk of adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, especially headache (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.92; 5 trials, 848 participants), gastrointestinal upset (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.48; 5 trials, 848 participants), flushing (OR 4.12, 95% CI 1.83 to 9.26; 3 trials, 748 participants), and muscle aches and joint pains (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.99; 4 trials, 792 participants). Data comparing PDE5 inhibitors to placebo whilst on other PAH-specific therapy were limited by the small number of included trials. Those PAH participants on PDE5 inhibitors plus combination therapy walked 19.66 metres further in six minutes (95% CI 9 to 30; 4 trials, 509 participants) compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence). There were limited trials comparing PDE5 inhibitors directly with other PAH-specific therapy (endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs)). Those on PDE5 inhibitors walked 49 metres further than on ERAs (95% CI 4 to 95; 2 trials, 36 participants) (low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in WHO functional class or mortality across both treatments. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to left-heart disease (PH-LHD). The quality of data were low due to imprecision and inconsistency across trials. In those with PH-LHD there were reduced odds of an improvement in WHO functional class using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.87; 3 trials, 285 participants), and those using PDE5 inhibitors walked 34 metres further compared to placebo (95% CI 23 to 46; 3 trials, 284 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality. Five trials compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo in PH secondary to lung disease/hypoxia, mostly in COPD. Data were of low quality due to imprecision of effect and inconsistency across trials. There was a small improvement of 27 metres in 6MWD using PDE5 inhibitors compared to placebo in those with PH due to lung disease. There was no evidence of worsening hypoxia using PDE5 inhibitors, although data were limited. Three studies compared PDE5 inhibitors to placebo or other PAH-specific therapy in chronic thromboembolic disease. There was no significant difference in any outcomes. Data quality was low due to imprecision of effect and heterogeneity across trials.

Authors' Conclusions

PDE5 inhibitors appear to have clear beneficial effects in group 1 PAH. Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil are all efficacious in this clinical setting, and clinicians should consider the side-effect profile for each individual when choosing which PDE5 inhibitor to prescribe. While there appears to be some benefit for the use of PDE5 inhibitors in PH-left-heart disease, it is not clear based on the mostly small, short-term studies, which type of left-heart disease stands to benefit. These data suggest possible harm in valvular heart disease. There is no clear benefit for PDE5 inhibitors in pulmonary hypertension secondary to lung disease or chronic thromboembolic disease. Further research is required into the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension secondary to left-heart disease, and cautious consideration of which subset of these patients may benefit from PDE5 inhibitors. Future trials in PH-LHD should be sufficiently powered, with long-term follow-up, and should include invasive haemodynamic data, WHO functional class, six-minute walk distance, and clinical worsening.

### Pathophysiology and new advances in pulmonary hypertension [^113eGnkX]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The first medical treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension was the synthetic prostacyclin, epoprostenol, in 1995. Progress was made in the following decades in identifying more causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension and establishing new diverse treatments. Currently, 14 drugs have been approved by the FDA. These drugs target vasodilatory pathways, including the endothelin, nitric oxide, and prostacyclin pathways. These treatments improve the symptoms and survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, but mortality remains high; the three year survival rate for patients with a high risk diagnosis is 28–55%. In patients who have unsatisfactory responses to treatment despite vasodilator treatment, lung transplantation might be necessary but is associated with its own inherent high risks of morbidity and mortality. Survival for patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic lung disease has been reported to be even worse than for pulmonary arterial hypertension.

This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension as it affects the lung and right ventricle. Most data on the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension come from models of pulmonary arterial hypertension and from biospecimens of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, and many concepts established in the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension are also found in other types of pulmonary hypertension. Hence, in this review, we will focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension, but will discuss the intricacies of other types of pulmonary hypertension where relevant. We will then discuss the strengths and limitations of current therapeutic interventions, followed by emerging and promising new therapeutic strategies targeting new pathways. Finally, we will highlight current knowledge gaps in pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension research.

### Uncertainties in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115B57Zq]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

The availability of new treatments for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased awareness and interest in the medical community for pulmonary vascular diseases in general. Many uncertainties exist, however, regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension that are particularly pertinent for the management of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with underlying diseases. This review highlights controversial issues around the definition and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, the interpretation of hemodynamic variables, and the interpretation of clinical responsiveness to chronic therapies. In addition, we propose guidelines applicable to the conduct of new therapeutic trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which aim to provide greater confidence in the efficacy and safety of new treatments currently under development.

Treprostinil (prostacyclin analogue) can be administered by the i.v. and s.c. routes using a microinfusion pump and small subcutaneous catheter; in PAH, the largest worldwide randomized controlled trial showed improvements in exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and symptoms, with the greatest exercise improvement in patients tolerating an upper quartile dose > 13.8 ng/kg/min. Infusion site pain was the most common adverse effect, causing discontinuation in 8% of active cases; among the 15% who continued to receive s.c. treprostinil alone, survival appears improved, and an open-label study reported sustained improvement with a mean follow-up of 26 months. Subcutaneous treprostinil is initiated at 1–2 ng/kg/min with dose increases limited by side effects, and the optimal dose for most patients ranges between 20 and 80 ng/kg/min.

### Treatment… [^11694fq2]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with signs, symptoms or electrocardiographic or radiographic findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension should undergo two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler flow studies. Echocardiography is the most useful imaging modality for detecting pulmonary hypertension 13 and excluding underlying cardiac disease. Confirmation of pulmonary hypertension is based on identification of tricuspid regurgitation. The addition of mean right atrial pressure to the peak tricuspid jet velocity gives an accurate noninvasive estimate of peak pulmonary pressure. Right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy are late findings. All patients with documented pulmonary hypertension should undergo a comprehensive laboratory evaluation to clarify the etiology. The goal is to identify or exclude treatable causes.

Initial tests include complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, hepatic profile and autoimmune panel. HIV testing should be considered in all patients, especially those with a compatible history or risk factors. If the cause of the pulmonary hypertension remains unexplained, chronic thromboembolism should be excluded before the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension is accepted. Fortunately, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning is a reliable method for differentiating chronic thromboembolism from primary pulmonary hypertension. The finding of one or more segmental or larger perfusion defects is a sensitive marker of embolic obstruction. In primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventilation-perfusion scan is normal or demonstrates patchy subsegmental abnormalities.

Epoprostenol, or prostacyclin, is the single most important advance in the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. This potent, short-acting vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation is produced by vascular endothelium. In one study, 19 continuous intravenous infusion of epoprostenol improved exercise capacity, quality of life, hemodynamics and long-term survival in patients with class III or IV function. Although the delivery system for continuous infusion is complex, most patients are able to learn how to prepare and infuse the drug. Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended to prevent thrombosis and has been shown to prolong life in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. 1 Patients with this condition are prone to thromboembolism because of sluggish pulmonary blood flow, dilated right heart chambers, venous insufficiency and relative physical inactivity. Maintaining an International Normalized Ratio of 1. 5 to
2.

0 is recommended. Other anticoagulants are also being studied.

European Heart Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treatment algorithm — initial steps and therapy selection are described as follows: After confirmation of the diagnosis of the treatment-naive PAH patient in an expert centre, the suggested initial approach is the adoption of general measures and the initiation of supportive therapy as needed. Acute vasoreactivity testing should be performed in patients with IPAH, HPAH and PAH associated with drugs or toxins use; vasoreactive patients should be treated with high doses (progressively titrated) calcium channel blockers (CCB) and adequate response should be confirmed after 3–4 months of treatment. Patient responders without an adequate clinical response to CCB treatment should be treated with approved PAH medications according to the non-vasoreactive patient's treatment strategy. Non-responders who are at low or intermediate risk can be treated with either initial monotherapy or initial combination therapy. If initial monotherapy is chosen, since head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line monotherapy can be proposed and the choice of the drug may depend on approved status, labelling, route of administration, side-effect profile, potential interaction with background therapies, patient preferences, co-morbidities, physician experience and cost. Since head-to-head comparison between initial combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil has proven to be superior to initial monotherapy with ambrisentan or tadalafil in delaying clinical failure, a higher grade of recommendation has been given to this initial combination. In non-vasoreactive and treatment-naive patients at high risk, initial combination therapy including i.v. prostacyclin analogues should be considered; i.v. epoprostenol should be prioritised since it has reduced the 3-month rate of mortality in high-risk PAH patients also as monotherapy, and alternative types of initial combination therapy may be considered.

### Repurposing medications for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension: what's old is new again [^11463qu8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Although there have been significant gains in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PAH in recent years, advances in PAH therapeutics have not kept pace, and many promising basic science discoveries have not been tested in patients. Approved PAH medications are predominately pulmonary vasodilators that modulate the endothelin, nitric oxide, and prostacyclin pathways. 34 These therapies primarily address the vasoconstrictive phenotype of PAH, which is the predominant feature in only 5% to 10% of patients 35 or those patients deemed vasoresponders. 36 Although current medications provide benefits to nearly all PAH patients even if they are not vasoresponders, they were approved because they significantly increase exercise capacity (6‐minute walk distance [6MWD]), improve quality of life, and/or reduce morbidity 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45; however, only epoprostenol confers a clear survival benefit. 46 Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop novel, effective therapies that target additional molecular pathways that drive the pathogenesis of PAH in order to supplement our current treatment options with the hopes of accelerating progress toward a cure.

### The evolving landscape of pulmonary arterial hypertension clinical trials [^114s83YU]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Although it is a rare disease, the number of available therapeutic options for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased since the late 1990s, with multiple drugs developed that are shown to be effective in phase 3 randomised controlled trials. Despite considerable advancements in pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment, prognosis remains poor. Existing therapies target pulmonary endothelial dysfunction with vasodilation and anti-proliferative effects. Novel therapies that target proliferative vascular remodelling and affect important outcomes are urgently needed. There is need for additional innovations in clinical trial design so that all emerging candidate therapies can be rigorously studied. Pulmonary arterial hypertension trial design has shifted from short-term submaximal exercise capacity as a primary endpoint, to larger clinical event-driven trial outcomes. Event-driven pulmonary arterial hypertension trials could face feasibility and efficiency issues in the future because increasing sample sizes and longer follow-up durations are needed, which would be problematic in such a rare disease. Enrichment strategies, innovative and alternative trial designs, and novel trial endpoints are potential solutions that could improve the efficiency of future pulmonary arterial hypertension trials while maintaining robustness and clinically meaningful evidence.

### Pulmonary hypertension [^1114ERM9]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension encompasses a range of conditions directly or indirectly leading to elevated pressures within the pulmonary arteries. Five main groups of pulmonary hypertension are recognized, all defined by a mean pulmonary artery pressure of > 20mmHg: pulmonary arterial hypertension (rare), pulmonary hypertension associated with left-sided heart disease (very common), pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease (common), pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary artery obstructions, usually related to thromboembolic disease (rare), and pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (rare). At least 1% of the world's population is affected, with a greater burden more likely in low-income and middle-income countries. Across all its forms, pulmonary hypertension is associated with adverse vascular remodelling with obstruction, stiffening and vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature. Without proactive management this leads to hypertrophy and ultimately failure of the right ventricle, the main cause of death. In older individuals, dyspnoea is the most common symptom. Stepwise investigation precedes definitive diagnosis with right heart catheterization. Medical and surgical treatments are approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. There are emerging treatments for other forms of pulmonary hypertension; but current therapy primarily targets the underlying cause. There are still major gaps in basic, clinical and translational knowledge; thus, further research, with a focus on vulnerable populations, is needed to better characterize, detect and effectively treat all forms of pulmonary hypertension.

### WHO group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension: current and investigative therapies [^112BPemL]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Major advances have been made in the treatment of World Health Organization Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Since the mid-1990s, nine medications have become available in the United States to target three key pathophysiologic derangements in PAH - the prostacyclin, endothelin, and nitric oxide pathways. As a group, these agents have led to improvements in functional capacity, symptoms, hemodynamics, and survival. Most patients with mild to moderate PAH are started on orally active agents such as endothelin receptor antagonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Patients with more severe disease, particularly those with evidence of right heart failure, should be treated with continuous prostacyclin infusion or a combination of a prostacyclin and oral therapy. Each medication has unique properties and clinical considerations, and the selection of an appropriate therapy must be tailored to the individual patient. None of the currently available WHO Group 1 PAH therapies are curative, however, and it is the hope that new therapies in development may halt or reverse disease progression. This review will discuss the major therapeutic classes of presently available medications and their role in managing the patient with PAH. We will also review data supporting the use of combination therapy, adjuvant background therapy, and new agents currently under investigation.

### Interventional strategies for children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112TpYqe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary hypertension in children is progressive with wide variability in prognosis. This document provides an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of children with progressive pulmonary hypertension despite optimal therapy.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel identified pertinent questions regarding the management of children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy, conducted systematic reviews of the relevant literature, and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to develop clinical recommendations.

Results

After reviewing the research evidence, the panel considered the balance of desirable (benefits) and undesirable (harms and burdens) effects of the interventions in each proposed question. Valuation of our main outcomes was also considered, together with resources required, equity, acceptability, and feasibility. Recommendations were developed for or against interventional strategies specific to children with pulmonary hypertension that has progressed despite optimal therapy.

Conclusions

Although there is a growing population of children with pulmonary hypertension, there is a striking lack of empirical evidence regarding management of those whose disease has progressed despite optimal pharmacotherapy. The panel formulated and provided the rationale for clinical recommendations for or against interventional strategies on the basis of this limited empirical evidence, coupled with expert opinion, to aid clinicians in the management of these complex pediatric patients. In addition, we identified important areas for future research.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pharmacotherapy in advanced disease — Non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing, or responders who remain in (or progress to) WHO-FC III should be considered candidates for treatment with either an ERA or a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid. As head-to-head comparisons among different compounds are not available, no evidence-based first-line treatment can be proposed, and some experts still use first-line i.v. epoprostenol in WHO-FC III patients because of its survival benefits. For WHO-FC IV, continuous i.v. epoprostenol is recommended as first-line therapy; although ambrisentan, bosentan, and sildenafil are approved in WHO-FC IV patients in the USA, most experts consider these treatments as a second line in severely ill patients. In WHO-FC IV patients, initial combination therapy should also be considered. In the case of inadequate clinical response, sequential combination therapy should be considered; combinations can include either an ERA plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, or a prostanoid plus an ERA, or a prostanoid plus a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, and in expert centres triple combination therapy is considered. For inadequate responders despite optimal therapy or where treatments are unavailable, BAS and/or lung transplantation are indicated and should be performed only in experienced centres.

### The molecular targets of approved treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^113Sx93j]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic, potentially fatal disease characterised haemodynamically by increased mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25 mm Hg, normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 3 Wood Units. PAH is caused by progressive remodelling of the pulmonary vasculature by cell proliferation and fibrosis, occluding the blood vessels and ultimately leading to right ventricular failure and death. The vascular pathology of PAH results at least in part from endothelial cell dysfunction, accompanied by impaired signalling in several pathways. Despite advances in current therapies for PAH, there is still a significant unmet medical need, as the mortality of patients with PAH remains high.

Until recently, three classes of medical therapy were available for the treatment of PAH targeting three dysfunctional pathways — prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. With the approval of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat, a new, fourth class of therapy has become available, targeting the same pathway as PDE5 inhibitors. The treatment algorithm discussed at the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)recommends the use of all four drug classes to treat PAH (table 1), as do the recently published CHEST guidelines on pharmacological therapy for PAH in adults (table 2). However, there is a lack of comparative data for these therapies; therefore, an understanding of the mechanistic differences between these agents and the clinical data sets supporting their use is critical when making treatment decisions.

Table 1
Treatment recommendations from the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension

Table 2
Summary of CHEST/American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for pharmacological treatment of PAH

Inter-individual differences mean that patients can respond differently to the same PAH treatment. Monotherapy may be adequate for some patients, while others may only improve when treated with a combination of two or three different classes of drugs. Although it is unclear whether these patients are benefiting from combination therapy, or whether the use of more than one drug is increasing the patient's chances of receiving the treatment to which they are most responsive, for patients who receive combination therapy, it is important to consider alternating or combining compounds with different molecular targets. Combination therapy is often used to treat PAH and it is important, therefore, that physicians understand how the modes of action of these drugs might result in additive, synergistic or antagonistic interactions which could lead to differences in safety and efficacy.

### Pulmonary hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a case for treatment [^114v9BPY]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

Current pharmacotherapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) relieves symptoms and reduces exacerbation through improving airflow limitation. Such drugs do not effectively improve exercise tolerance due in part to pulmonary hypertension associated with severe COPD, nor impact on its increased morbidity and mortality. Exercise intolerance is often improved (temporarily) by lung volume reduction surgery and pulmonary rehabilitation. Ambulatory oxygen is the most effective treatment of exercise limitation. Chronic cigarette smoking is the principal cause of COPD. An early change in smokers' lungs is pulmonary artery intimal thickening and vessel narrowing, which, as COPD develops, is correlated with both the severity of emphysema and bronchiolitis. This may be the consequence of combined smoking-induced apoptosis, inflammation, and imperfect repair. End-stage bronchiolitis and emphysema are likely to limit the effectiveness of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. There are effective treatments for idiopathic and scleroderma pulmonary arterial hypertension, which increase exercise tolerance and improve survival. Because idiopathic and COPD pulmonary hypertension share a common vascular intimal thickening, excess endothelin receptor expression, and plasma endothelin-1, an important therapeutic question to address is whether an oral endothelin-1 antagonist can improve exercise tolerance in severe COPD.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — physical activity and supervised rehabilitation: The 2009 PH guidelines suggested that PAH patients should be encouraged to be active within symptom limits, and it was recommended that patients should avoid excessive physical activity that leads to distressing symptoms, but when physically deconditioned, patients may undertake supervised exercise rehabilitation. This was based on a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) that demonstrated an improvement in exercise and functional capacity and in quality of life in patients with PH who took part in a training programme as compared with an untrained control group. Two additional RCTs have been published reporting that trained PAH patients reached higher levels of physical activity, had decreased fatigue severity and showed improved 6MWD, cardiopulmonary function and patient-reported quality of life as compared with untrained controls, but the sample sizes of all of these studies are quite small (ranging from 19 to 183 patients) and all or the initial training was highly supervised and in some instances conducted in an in-patient setting.

When combination therapy is considered, patients should be treated within clinical trials or registries whenever possible. Combination therapy of established PAH drugs is recommended for patients not responding adequately to monotherapy, but combination therapy should be instituted by expert centres only. Whether the response to monotherapy is sufficient or not can only be decided on an individual basis, including an individual patient who, despite monotherapy and optimized background treatment, has an inadequate clinical response. For novel targeted agents, the safety and efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in PAH must be further evaluated and, at present, the use of these drugs should be restricted to RCTs.

Palliative care and supportive therapies in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — Six studies were identified for palliative care and supportive therapies, but after full-text review no eligible studies on palliative care and PAH exist to provide direct recommendations; nevertheless, palliative medicine has documented benefits and the addition of palliative care interventions can often be beneficial to improving patient quality of life. Accordingly, Recommendation 72 states, "We suggest incorporating palliative care services in the management of PAH patients" (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Medical therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115XSa3n]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is often difficult to diagnose and challenging to treat. Untreated, it is characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right ventricular failure and death. The past decade has seen remarkable improvements in therapy, driven largely by the conduct of randomized controlled trials. Still, the selection of most appropriate therapy is complex, and requires familiarity with the disease process, evidence from treatment trials, complicated drug delivery systems, dosing regimens, side effects, and complications. This chapter will provide evidence-based treatment recommendations for physicians involved in the care of these complex patients. Due to the complexity of the diagnostic evaluation required, and the treatment options available, it is strongly recommended that consideration be given to referral of patients with PAH to a specialized center.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of drug therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1122fwX2]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been shown to improve dyspnea, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and pulmonary hemodynamics, but few studies were designed to compare treatment regimens or assess the impact of treatment on mortality.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of monotherapy or combination therapy for PAH using endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or prostanoids. We searched English-language publications of comparative studies that reported intermediate or long-term outcomes associated with drug therapy for PAH. Two investigators abstracted data and rated study quality and applicability.

Results

We identified 28 randomized controlled trials involving 3,613 patients. We found no studies that randomized treatment-naive patients to monotherapy vs combination therapy. There was insufficient statistical power to detect a mortality difference associated with treatment. All drug classes demonstrated increases in 6MWD when compared with placebo, and combination therapy showed improved 6MWD compared with monotherapy. For hospitalization, the OR was lower in patients taking endothelin receptor antagonists or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors compared with placebo (OR, 0.34 and 0.48, respectively).

Conclusions

Although no studies were powered to detect a mortality reduction, monotherapy was associated with improved 6MWD and reduced hospitalization rates. Our findings also suggest an improvement in 6MWD when a second drug is added to monotherapy.

Key points
- Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal.
- The increased blood pressure in the lungs can make the heart work harder than normal to pump blood into the lungs. This can damage the heart and cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and lightheadedness. What it is With pulmonary hypertension, the blood vessels to the lungs develop an increased amount of muscle in the wall of the blood vessels. The heart pumps blood from the right ventricle to the lungs to get oxygen. Because the blood does not have to travel very far, the pressure in this side of the heart and in the artery taking blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is normally low — usually much lower than systolic or diastolic blood pressure.

When the pressure in this artery gets too high, the arteries in the lungs can narrow and then the blood does not flow as well as it should, resulting in less oxygen in the blood. Signs and symptoms The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension during the initial stage of the disease are common to many other medical conditions. This often results in a delayed diagnosis until more severe symptoms arise, such as:

- Dizziness
- Chest pain
- Ankle swelling
- Feeling the heart race or pound. Risk factors Pulmonary hypertension happens at all ages, including among children, and its incidence increases with age. Pulmonary hypertension is more common among women, non-Hispanic Black people, and people aged 75 or older.

Causes Some common underlying causes of pulmonary hypertension include high blood pressure in the lungs' arteries due to some types of congenital heart disease, connective tissue disease, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, liver disease, blood clots to the lungs, and chronic lung diseases like emphysema. Genetics also play a role. Pulmonary hypertension can happen in association with many other diseases, such as lung disease and heart disease. Heart failure is common in pulmonary hypertension. Reducing risk While not all pulmonary hypertension can be prevented, you can take steps to prevent it by making healthy lifestyle changes and managing high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, chronic liver disease, and chronic lung disease from tobacco use.

### The molecular targets of approved treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension [^117FXrjd]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Until recently, three classes of medical therapy were available for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors. With the approval of the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator riociguat, an additional drug class has become available targeting a distinct molecular target in the same pathway as PDE5 inhibitors. Treatment recommendations currently include the use of all four drug classes to treat PAH, but there is a lack of comparative data for these therapies. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanistic differences between these agents is critical when making treatment decisions. Combination therapy is often used to treat PAH and it is therefore important that physicians understand how the modes of action of these drugs may interact to work as complementary partners, or potentially with unwanted consequences. Furthermore, different patient phenotypes mean that patients respond differently to treatment; while a certain monotherapy may be adequate for some patients, for others it will be important to consider alternating or combining compounds with different molecular targets. This review describes how the four currently approved drug classes target the complex pathobiology of PAH and will consider the distinct target molecules of each drug class, their modes of action, and review the pivotal clinical trial data supporting their use. It will also discuss the rationale for combining drugs (or not) from the different classes, and review the clinical data from studies on combination therapy.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — echocardiographic probability and suggested management (Table 12) delineates actions by probability category: For 'PH unlikely' without symptoms, no additional work-up is recommended; if 'PH unlikely' with symptoms plus associated conditions or risk factors for group 1 — PAH, echocardiographic follow-up is recommended; if symptomatic without associated conditions or risk factors, evaluation of other causes for the symptoms is recommended. For 'PH possible' without symptoms and without associated conditions or risk factors, echocardiographic follow-up is recommended; if symptomatic with associated conditions or risk factors, right heart catheterization (RHC) may be considered. For 'PH likely', when symptomatic regardless of associated conditions or risk factors, RHC is recommended; when without symptoms, RHC should be considered.

Combination therapy

Combining two or more classes of agent is a strategy that has been used successfully in the treatment of many other cardiovascular conditions such as systemic hypertension and heart failure. Combination therapy can be given as first-line treatment or by sequentially adding drugs to a patient's treatment regimen. The 2013 updated algorithm of PAH treatment from the 5th World Symposium on PH recommends sequential combination therapy, due to the high level of evidence of efficacy, in patients with PAH with an inadequate response to monotherapy, and possible first-line combination therapy in WHO FC III and IV patients with a lower recommendation. Several clinical trials have now assessed the effect of combination therapy in patients with PAH, with mixed results (see below). Several recent meta-analyses of the efficacy of combination therapy versus monotherapy, however, conclude that combination therapy can improve clinical outcomes, but has no proven effect on mortality. However, all acknowledge that more data are required from further studies.

### Treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^114GoHhX]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The most common forms of pulmonary hypertension are pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart and lung disease. The treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension has advanced substantially over the past 20 years. Five different classes of drugs are now available-ie, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, prostacyclin analogues, and prostacyclin receptor agonists. Long-term studies have provided evidence that various combinations of these compounds improve the progression-free survival of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. For patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, surgical pulmonary endarterectomy is the treatment of choice. For patients who are inoperable and have chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, riociguat, a stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase, has proven efficacious. Additionally, interventional approaches could become a treatment option for these patients. For patients with pulmonary hypertension due to left-sided heart disease or lung disease, the use of pulmonary vasodilator treatment has not been proven to be safe and effective.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) therapy — evidence for approved treatments and overall strategy: Regulatory approvals now include eight drugs with different routes of administration, and a meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials reported a 43% decrease in mortality and a 61% reduction in hospitalizations versus placebo, achieved after an average treatment period of 14.3 weeks. Despite these benefits, PAH remains a chronic disease without a cure, and management is a complex strategy rather than a single prescription of drugs.

### Future perspectives for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115DT9YL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, pulmonary arterial hypertension has evolved from a uniformly fatal condition to a chronic, manageable disease in many cases, the result of unparalleled development of new therapies and advances in early diagnosis. However, none of the currently available therapies is curative, so the search for new treatment strategies continues. With a deeper understanding of the genetics and the molecular mechanisms of pulmonary vascular disorders, we are now at the threshold of entering a new therapeutic era. Our working group addressed what can be expected in the near future. The topics span the understanding of genetic variations, novel antiproliferative treatments, the role of stem cells, the right ventricle as a therapeutic target, and strategies and challenges for the translation of novel experimental findings into clinical practice.
