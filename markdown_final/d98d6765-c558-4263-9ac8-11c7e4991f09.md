## Question

how do u see right heart strain and right ventricular hypertrophy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to identify and differentiate right heart strain and right ventricular hypertrophy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and why differentiating acute strain from chronic hypertrophy matters. Then, I should review initial non-invasive testing with ECG and its limitations. Next, I will examine echocardiography, including standard measures and advanced techniques like strain and 3D. After that, I need to confirm the role of cardiac MRI as the reference standard and when to escalate. Then, I will apply a multimodality approach to key clinical scenarios such as pulmonary embolism, ARVC, pulmonary hypertension, and athletes. Finally, I should integrate findings into a practical decision framework with disease-specific thresholds and follow-up strategies, while double-checking that every assertion aligns with the cited literature [^115WG2En] [^115zbbJ7].

> Let me first confirm core definitions to avoid conflating physiology with pathology: right heart strain reflects acute or subacute RV pressure/volume overload with functional impairment that may reverse, whereas RV hypertrophy is a structural increase in RV wall thickness, often defined as ≥ 5 mm in adults by echo or CMR, indicating chronic remodeling; I should double-check that ≥ 5 mm threshold, and yes, contemporary CMR studies in HCM and broader imaging reviews support this benchmark for defining RVH in adults [^115x5ikt] [^112SinoT].

> I will now examine ECG as the initial tool, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: ECG has modest specificity and variable sensitivity for anatomic RVH, and its greatest utility is often in detecting acute RV strain patterns, particularly in PE where S1Q3T3, RBBB, and anterior T-wave inversion correlate with worse outcomes; let me verify the prognostic signal — indeed, in elderly PE patients, at least one classic strain sign doubled adverse events after adjustment, while Sokolow-Lyon RVH voltage criteria are relatively common in athletes and poorly correlate with true RV wall thickening, underscoring the need for imaging confirmation and clinical context [^117HueX1] [^111A71uH].

> Next, I should review echocardiography as first-line imaging given availability and hemodynamic insights; standard measures include TAPSE, RV FAC, and tissue Doppler S', along with PASP estimation from TR velocity, but I need to ensure measurement conventions are correct — wait, I initially thought of assessing RV basal diameter in a parasternal view, but I should correct that: RV basal diameter is best measured in the apical four-chamber focused RV view, whereas parasternal views are leveraged for RVOT, reflecting the RV's complex geometry; these parameters offer diagnostic and prognostic value, yet 2D echo can miss pathology due to RV shape and anterior position, so integrating multiple indices is prudent [^113bNySx] [^115WG2En].

> Hold on, I should verify the added value of advanced echocardiography before proceeding: 3D echo improves volumetric accuracy without geometric assumptions, and speckle-tracking strain detects subtle dysfunction — particularly RV GLS and free-wall strain; in ARVC, disease-specific thresholds such as RV GLS > −17.9% or RV FWS > −21.2% capture phenotypes missed by conventional metrics, and RV FWS < 23% independently predicts mortality in CRT cohorts, validating strain's sensitivity and prognostic utility; in PE, combining RV GLS with RV/LV ratio enhances risk stratification over either alone, supporting a multiparametric approach [^112N2HGH] [^112D2CfX] [^115415iN] [^1144T8zW].

> Let me consider emerging load-adjusted indices because strain is load sensitive; noninvasive RV myocardial work using pressure–strain loops can provide more load-robust assessments, and I should confirm prognostic value — yes, RV global work index independently predicted CRT response and improved reclassification beyond standard metrics, suggesting a complementary role in selected patients, though availability and standardization remain evolving [^111aSTkf].

> I need to check the role of CMR when echo is inconclusive or tissue characterization is needed; CMR remains the reference standard for RV volumes, mass, and function with excellent reproducibility and adds late gadolinium enhancement, fat detection, and mapping for fibrosis/edema; feature-tracking CMR strain augments diagnosis and prognosis in entities like ARVC, and guidelines endorse CMR in suspected ARVC and even in genotype-positive, phenotype-negative relatives when early disease is suspected, which I should emphasize for family screening pathways [^112SinoT] [^115WG2En] [^114rabvo] [^114dRbRi].

> Now, for acute pulmonary embolism, let me first confirm the stepwise evaluation: ECG strain patterns such as S1Q3T3, RBBB, and anterior T-wave inversion flag higher risk, echo can show RV dilation and dysfunction, and RV GLS adds prognostic value, while CT pulmonary angiography provides RV/LV ratio that aids risk stratification; I should double-check that RV/LV ratio on CT is clinically used — this is well supported in multimodality reviews and aligns with a combined functional–anatomic risk approach, acknowledging that intermediate-risk patients benefit most from integrated echo–CT metrics [^117HueX1] [^1144T8zW] [^112N2HGH].

> For arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, I should confirm the multimodal criteria: ECG may show T-wave inversions in V1–V3 and epsilon waves, echo can document regional abnormalities and RVOT enlargement but often underestimates disease, strain thresholds (RV GLS > −17.9% and RV FWS > −21.2%) detect subclinical dysfunction and improve diagnostic yield beyond conventional echo, mechanical dispersion predicts malignant arrhythmias, and CMR is pivotal for regional motion abnormalities and fibrofatty replacement; wait, I nearly quoted fixed RVOT numeric cutoffs without a source — let me avoid that and instead emphasize reproducible RVOT measurements and their correlation with CMR used in TFC, with escalation to CMR and family screening when suspicion persists [^112D2CfX] [^117TRLpM] [^112Use3J] [^114rabvo] [^114dRbRi].

> In pulmonary hypertension, I should review coupling and prognosis: echo evaluates RV size and systolic function, PASP, and TAPSE/PASP as an RV–PA coupling surrogate, while RV longitudinal strain correlates with invasive hemodynamics; CMR adds RV mass, RVEF, stroke volume, and LGE at RV insertion points associated with outcomes; but wait, definitive hemodynamics still require right heart catheterization, so noninvasive markers should guide but not replace invasive confirmation and longitudinal risk assessment [^113bNySx] [^115WG2En] [^113ZTy6u].

> Athletes present a diagnostic gray zone, so I should double-check discrimination features: ECG-RVH by Sokolow-Lyon is more prevalent among athletes yet fails to track with true RV wall thickness or pathology, and physiological remodeling typically shows normal strain and absent LGE on CMR; in contrast, red flags for ARVC include syncope, pathologic Q waves, high PVC burden, and abnormal mechanical dispersion, warranting escalation beyond screening ECGs to targeted imaging and ambulatory monitoring when present [^111A71uH] [^113zy1cM] [^112SinoT].

> Integration requires me to ensure we do not overvalue any single parameter; comprehensive assessment combining chamber size, global and regional RV systolic function, TR severity, RA pressure indices, septal motion, and RV–PA coupling outperforms isolated metrics, and recently proposed multiparametric echo scores show superior prognostic performance, aligning with guideline recommendations for serial, holistic evaluation in cardiomyopathy clinics [^115zbbJ7] [^113dktry] [^113BMZzF].

> I should double-check disease-specific thresholds that refine prognosis and follow-up: in ARVC, more positive RV free-wall strain than −20% identifies patients at markedly higher risk of structural progression over five years, and in CRT, RV FWS < 23% portends greater mortality, while in intermediate-risk PE, abnormal RV GLS weighs more heavily than RV/LV ratio for short-term mortality; follow-up cadence should reflect disease biology, with ARVC risk stratification at 1–2 year intervals and earlier reassessment if clinical status changes, while PH programs typically reassess at regular intervals integrating imaging and hemodynamics [^112TQpEe] [^115415iN] [^1144T8zW] [^113YFC8L].

> When results are discordant or acoustic windows limit confidence, I need to escalate thoughtfully: CMR resolves volumetrics and tissue characterization ambiguities, CT can substitute when CMR is contraindicated and contributes RV/LV metrics in PE pathways, and when management hinges on pressures and resistances, right heart catheterization remains the gold standard to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy; I should verify each escalation against patient-specific contraindications and availability to maintain a practical workflow [^112N2HGH] [^115WG2En] [^113ZTy6u].

> To summarize the practical algorithm without losing nuance: start with clinical context and ECG, move promptly to comprehensive echo including strain and, when available, 3D, escalate to CMR for inconclusive cases or suspected myocardial disease like ARVC, consider CT when CMR is not feasible or when PE is suspected, integrate multimodal findings within disease-specific frameworks, and plan serial follow-up keyed to the underlying condition; the key takeaway is that strain imaging, especially RV GLS and free-wall strain, detects early dysfunction and improves risk stratification, while CMR remains the reference for structural and tissue characterization, so a multimodality, multiparametric approach is essential to avoid misclassification and to guide timely interventions [^115WG2En] [^112N2HGH] [^112D2CfX].

Right heart strain and right ventricular hypertrophy are detected by a combination of ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI [^115WG2En]. ECG shows **S1Q3T3**, **right axis deviation**, **RBBB**, and **T-wave inversions in V1–V4** for strain; RVH shows **tall R in V1**, **deep S in V5/V6**, and **right axis deviation**. Echocardiography reveals **RV dilation**, **reduced TAPSE**, and **McConnell's sign** for strain; RVH shows **RV free wall thickness ≥ 5 mm** and **increased RV mass**. Cardiac MRI provides precise **RV volumes**, **mass**, and **function**, confirming RVH with **RV mass index > 35 g/m²** and **RVEF < 45%**. These findings guide diagnosis, risk stratification, and management.

## Electrocardiographic findings

ECG is a **rapid, non-invasive tool** for initial assessment of RHS and RVH, but has limited sensitivity and specificity [^111A71uH].

---

### Right heart strain (RHS)

- **S1Q3T3 pattern**: Deep S in lead I, Q in lead III, and T inversion in lead III; classic for acute PE [^117HueX1].
- **Right axis deviation**: QRS axis > 90°.
- **Right bundle branch block (RBBB)**: Complete or incomplete.
- **T-wave inversions**: V1–V4, II, III, aVF [^111qnvW1].
- ✱✱ p pulmonale: Tall, peaked P in II (> 2.5 mm), indicating right atrial enlargement [^114Qk2pM].

---

### Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)

ECG findings of RVH include a **tall R wave in V1** (R > 7 mm or R/S > 1) with deep S waves in V5/V6 (S > 7 mm), accompanied by right axis deviation (QRS axis > 90°). Complete or incomplete RBBB may be present, and P pulmonale (tall, peaked P in II > 2.5 mm) reflects right atrial enlargement [^111A71uH].

---

## Echocardiographic findings

Echocardiography is the **primary imaging modality** for RHS and RVH and offers structural and functional assessment [^115WG2En].

---

### Right heart strain (RHS)

- **RV dilation**: RV basal diameter > 42 mm or RV/LV > 1.0 [^113bNySx].
- **Reduced TAPSE**: < 16 mm [^115WG2En].
- **Reduced RV fractional area change (FAC)**: < 35% [^112g3iQm].
- **McConnell's sign**: Akinesia of mid-free wall with preserved apex [^113bNySx].
- **Elevated RV systolic pressure**: > 35 mmHg [^115WG2En].

- **RV dilation**: RV basal diameter > 42 mm [^115WG2En].
- **Increased RV wall thickness**: ≥ 5 mm [^112N2HGH].
- **Elevated RV systolic pressure**: > 35 mmHg [^112g3iQm].

---

## Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)

CMR is the **gold standard** for RV assessment, providing accurate RV volumes, mass, and function [^115WG2En] [^112SinoT].

---

### Right heart strain (RHS)

On CMR, RHS presents with **RV dilation** — typically RVEDVI > 110 mL/m² in men and > 100 mL/m² in women — and reduced systolic function (RVEF < 45%) [^115WG2En]. RV free wall strain is impaired (> -20%), and late gadolinium enhancement indicates fibrosis or myocardial injury.

---

### Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)

On CMR, RVH is characterized by **increased RV mass** (> 35 g/m²) and free wall thickening (≥ 5 mm), often with chamber dilation (RVEDVI > 110 mL/m² in men, > 100 mL/m² in women). Systolic function may be reduced (RVEF < 45%).

---

## Clinical implications

RHS indicates acute RV pressure overload (e.g. PE or acute pulmonary hypertension) and requires **urgent management** [^117L2rJz], whereas RVH reflects chronic RV pressure overload (e.g. chronic pulmonary hypertension or congenital heart disease) and requires **long-term management** [^113ZTy6u].

### Prognostic value of electrocardiography in elderly patients with acute pulmonary embolism [^117HueX1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) signs of right ventricular strain could be used as a simple tool to risk-stratify patients with acute pulmonary embolism.

- **Methods**: We studied consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years with acute pulmonary embolism in a prospective multicenter cohort study. Two readers independently analyzed 12 predefined ECG signs of right ventricular strain in all patients. The outcome was the occurrence of an adverse clinical event, defined as death from any cause within 90 days or a complicated in-hospital course. We determined the interrater reliability for each ECG sign and examined the association between right ventricular strain signs and adverse events using logistic regression, adjusting for the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index and cardiac troponin.

- **Results**: Overall, 320 of 390 patients (82%) showed at least one ECG sign of right ventricular strain. The interrater reliability for individual ECG signs was highly variable (ᴋ 0.40–0.95). Patients with ≥ 1 of the 3 classic signs of right ventricular strain (S1Q3T3, right bundle branch block, or T wave inversions in V1-V4) had a higher incidence of adverse events than those without (13% vs 6%; p = 0.026). After adjustment, the presence of ≥ 1 of the 3 classic signs of right ventricular strain (odds ratio 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–4.46) and the number of right ventricular strain signs present were significantly associated with adverse events (odds ratio 1.35 per sign; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.69).

- **Conclusions**: ECG signs of right ventricular strain are common in elderly patients with acute pulmonary embolism.

### Right ventricular global strain in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with and without right ventricular hypertrophy [^115x5ikt]. European Journal of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regardless of whether there are morphological abnormalities of the right ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients, the exact contribution of right ventricular (RV) global strains remains unresolved. This study aimed to examine the prognostic value of RV global strains in HCM patients with and without RV hypertrophy (RVH).

A total of 358 HCM patients who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) examination and follow-up were included in this retrospective study. The endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD), and heart failure readmission. RV hypertrophy (RVH) was defined as maximal RV wall thickness (RVWT) ≥ 5 mm at end-diastole. RV global strains, including RV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and RV global circumferential strain (GCS), were measured using cardiac MRI feature tracking techniques. Intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility were evaluated. Analyses included receiver-operating characteristic curves, Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards regression, likelihood ratio test, and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate adjustment.

Over a median follow-up of 25 months (range 3–54 months), 49 patients reached the composite endpoints. HCM patients were divided into the RVH group and non-RVH groups. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, after adjusting for multiple clinical and imaging variables, RV GLS and RV GCS were independently associated with the composite endpoints in the RVH group (HR: 1.123; 95%).

### Clinical significance of electrocardiographic right ventricular hypertrophy in athletes: Comparison with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension [^111A71uH]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The aims of this study focus on the pre-participation cardiovascular screening of young athletes, which may prevent sports-related sudden cardiac deaths. Recognition of physiological electrocardiography (ECG) changes in healthy athletes has improved the specificity of screening while maintaining sensitivity for disease. The study objective was to determine the clinical significance of electrocardiographic right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) in athletes.

- **Methods and results**: Between 2010 and 2012, 868 subjects aged 14–35 years (68.8% male) were assessed using ECG and echocardiography (athletes; n = 627, sedentary controls; n = 241). Results were compared against patients with established right ventricular (RV) pathology, including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (n = 68) and pulmonary hypertension (n = 30). Sokolow-Lyon RVH (R[V1]+S[V5orV6] > 1.05 mV) was more prevalent in athletes than controls (11.8 vs. 6.2%, P = 0.017), although RV wall thickness (RVWT) was similar (4.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.9 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.18). Athletes exhibiting electrocardiographic RVH were predominantly male (95.9%) and demonstrated similar RV dimensions and function to athletes with normal electrocardiograms (RVWT; 4.0 ± 1.1 vs. 4.0 ± 0.9 mm, P = 0.95, RV basal dimension; 42.7 ± 5.2 vs. 42.1 ± 5.9 mm, P = 0.43, RV fractional area change; 40.6 ± 7.6 vs. 42.2 ± 8.1%, P = 0.14). The sensitivity and specificity of Sokolow-Lyon RVH for echocardiographic RVH (> 5 mm) were 14.3 and 88.2%, respectively. Further evaluation, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, did not diagnose right ventricular pathology in any athlete.

### Right ventricular cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging: normal anatomy and spectrum of pathological findings [^112SinoT]. Insights into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The right ventricle (RV) is involved in a wide variety of acquired and congenital heart diseases, even though the primary diagnostic focus is attributed to the left ventricle (LV) in most clinical conditions. The importance of RV pathology and dysfunction has been highlighted in several recent publications in terms of impact on a patient's prognosis and therapeutic management. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has emerged as the referenced standard technique for this purpose due to its unique capability in providing an accurate and reproducible assessment of function and tissue characterisation.

Although trans-thoracic echocardiography is recommended as an initial imaging instrument, it has limited diagnostic capabilities for the assessment of RV due to its thin wall, peculiar morphology, and anterior position in the chest. This pictorial review of the CMR features illustrates RV anatomy and its range of various pathological conditions, thus leading to more prompt recognition of disease.

### Echocardiographic evaluation of the right ventricle: Clinical implications [^113bNySx]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Interest in the evaluation of the right ventricle (RV) has increased recently. With the growth of new echocardiographic techniques and technology, there has been a corresponding increase in the ability to evaluate the RV both qualitatively and quantitatively. Older echocardiographic techniques, such as right ventricular fractional area of change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and tissue S', alongside newer echocardiographic techniques including 3-dimensional evaluation and global longitudinal strain, can improve our evaluation of RV function. These techniques provide both diagnostic and prognostic data on a large variety of clinical diseases, including pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure. With the continuing and exponential advances in technology, echocardiography is well poised to become the primary modality to evaluate the RV.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^115zbbJ7]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically in relation to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), ESC 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive evaluation of cardiac dimensions, left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic function (both global and regional), as well as LV diastolic function. This should be done for all patients with cardiomyopathy during the initial evaluation and throughout follow-up to monitor disease progression, aid in risk stratification, and manage treatment effectively.

### Incremental diagnostic value of right ventricular strain analysis in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^111yGNYP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Strain analysis is a sensitive method for assessing ventricular structural or functional alterations. The authors aimed to determine whether right ventricular (RV) strain parameters can discriminate patients with revised Task Force Criteria-diagnosed arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy (ARVC), incremental to the existing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) criteria, thus improving the diagnostic yield of CMR in ARVC.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 74 patients with revised Task Force Criteria-diagnosed ARVC (37 borderline and 37 definite) and 37 controls were retrospectively enrolled for analysis. Using CMR feature tracking, RV global longitudinal (GLS), circumferential, and radial strain of all participants were evaluated. Compared with controls, the study patients demonstrated significantly impaired global biventricular strain in all three directions (all P < 0.05), with over 50% presenting with impaired RV GLS. When both conventional criteria and RV GLS were considered together, this new diagnostic method demonstrated an overall diagnostic accuracy of 90%. The likelihood ratio test showed a significant incremental diagnostic value.

### Advanced imaging of right ventricular anatomy and function [^112N2HGH]. Heart (2020). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) size and function are important predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with various conditions. However, non-invasive assessment of the RV is a challenging task due to its complex anatomy and location in the chest. Although conventional echocardiography is widely used, its limitations in RV assessment are well recognized. New techniques such as three-dimensional and speckle-tracking echocardiography have overcome these limitations, allowing a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of RV geometry and function without geometric assumptions.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and CT provide accurate assessments of RV geometry and function as well. In addition, tissue characterization imaging for myocardial scar and fat using CMR and CT provides important information regarding the RV that has clinical applications for diagnosis and prognosis in a broad range of cardiac conditions. Limitations also exist for these two advanced modalities, including availability and patient suitability for CMR and the need for contrast and radiation exposure for CT.

Hybrid imaging, which integrates anatomical information (usually obtained by CT or CMR) with physiological and molecular data (usually obtained with positron emission tomography), can provide optimal in vivo evaluation of RV functional impairment.

This review summarizes the clinically useful applications of advanced echocardiography techniques, CMR, and CT for comprehensive assessment of RV size, function, and mechanics.

### Right ventricular strain predicts structural disease progression in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^112cZ5Vm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In this study, we evaluated two-dimensional echocardiographic RV strain as a predictor of structural disease progression in ARVC. This study has several notable findings. First, our results indicate that many patients exhibited progression in RVOT dimensions (60% for PSAX and 67% for PLAX) and less so for RV-FAC during the follow-up period. This finding is expected given that ARVC is a progressive disease and because similar findings have been seen in prior studies that have evaluated for progression on serial echocardiograms. Mast et al. reported progression of all three measures (PSAX RVOT, PLAX RVOT, and RV-FAC) in two-thirds of their study population over a mean follow-up time of 6.4 years, and this result was reproduced in our study.

Our results also indicate that worse RV free-wall peak longitudinal systolic strain and strain rate are associated with increases in RVOT size, as obtained from PSAX and PLAX views. Specifically, when baseline strain and strain rate were compared for patients who demonstrated structural progression and those who did not, worse strain and strain rate were observed among the progressors. Higher quartiles of 5-year RV structural progression (by both PSAX RVOT and PLAX RVOT) were associated with diminished RV free-wall strain and strain rate at baseline. Furthermore, patients with more abnormal RV strain (greater than −20%) had an 18-fold risk (P = 0.002) of progression in PSAX RVOT. Thus, RV free-wall strain and strain rate appear to be predictive of structural progression of disease in patients with ARVC.

### Contraction patterns of the right ventricle associated with different degrees of left ventricular systolic dysfunction [^114yck9k]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The functional adaptation of the right ventricle (RV) to different degrees of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction remains to be clarified. This study aimed to (1) assess the changes in RV contraction patterns associated with reduced LV ejection fraction (EF) and (2) analyze whether evaluating RV longitudinal, radial, and anteroposterior motion components of total right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) adds prognostic value.

Consecutive patients with left-sided heart disease who underwent clinically indicated transthoracic echocardiography were enrolled in a single-center prospective observational study. An adverse outcome was defined as heart failure hospitalization or cardiac death. A cross-sectional analysis using baseline 3-dimensional echocardiography was performed to quantify the relative contribution of longitudinal, radial, and anteroposterior motion components to total RVEF.

We studied 292 patients and followed them for 6.7 ± 2.2 years. In patients with mildly and moderately reduced LVEF, the longitudinal and anteroposterior components of RVEF decreased significantly, while the radial component increased, resulting in preserved total RVEF (RVEF: 50% [46%-54%] versus 47% [44%-52%] versus 46% [42%-49%] in patients with no, mild, or moderate LV dysfunction, respectively; data presented as median and interquartile range). In patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction (n = 34), a reduction in all three RV motion components led to a significant drop in RVEF (30% [25%-39%]).

### Utility of left and right ventricular strain in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: A prospective multicenter registry [^112D2CfX]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2023). High credibility.

Imaging evaluation of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) remains challenging. Myocardial strain assessment by echocardiography is an increasingly utilized technique for detecting subclinical left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of LV and RV strain in ARVC.

- **Methods**: Patients with suspected ARVC (n = 109) from a multicenter registry were clinically phenotyped using the 2010 ARVC Revised Task Force Criteria and underwent baseline strain echocardiography. Diagnostic performance of LV and RV strain was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis against the 2010 ARVC Revised Task Force Criteria, and the prognostic value was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis.

- **Results**: The mean age was 45.3 ± 14.7 years, and 48% of patients were female. Estimation of RV strain was feasible in 99/109 (91%), and LV strain was feasible in 85/109 (78%) patients. ARVC prevalence by 2010 ARVC Revised Task Force Criteria was 91/109 (83%) and 83/99 (84%) in those with RV strain measurements. RV global longitudinal strain and RV free wall strain had a diagnostic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 and 0.77, respectively (both P < 0.05). RV strain patterns classified as RV global longitudinal strain phenotype (RV global longitudinal strain > -17.9%) and RV free wall strain phenotype (RV free wall strain > -21.2%) were identified in 41/69 (59%) and 56/69 (81%) of subjects, respectively, who were not identified by conventional echocardiography.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^113dktry]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to TTE, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive evaluation of cardiac dimensions and left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic (global and regional) and LV diastolic function in all patients with cardiomyopathy. This should occur at initial evaluation and during follow-up to monitor disease progression, aid in risk stratification, and guide management.

### Electrocardiographic manifestations: right ventricular infarction [^1132dj58]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) is an essential tool when evaluating the Emergency Department (ED) patient with suspected cardiac ischemia. The standard EKG has limitations when evaluating remote areas of the heart, such as the left posterior wall or right ventricular wall. Diagnosis of right ventricular infarction (RVI) in the presence of acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) is made utilizing right-sided chest leads, providing high sensitivities and specificities. RVI is a serious ED problem because morbidity and mortality are higher in acute MIs associated with RVI.

### The electrocardiogram in right ventricular myocardial infarction [^115V1fTh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) myocardial infarction most often occurs in the setting of inferior wall myocardial infarction. It complicates approximately 25% (range, 20%-60%) of inferior acute myocardial infarction cases and is quite rare in anterior and lateral wall acute myocardial infarction. With an infarction of the RV, failure of the RV occurs. As such, left ventricular filling pressures are entirely dependent upon the patient's preload; significant reductions in preload likely result in hypotension, which may be worsened by nitroglycerin and morphine.

In the setting of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of the inferior wall, the clinical presentation involves hypotension and jugular venous distension, along with the following electrocardiographic findings: ST-segment elevation of greatest magnitude in lead III (compared with leads II and aVF), ST-segment elevation in lead V1, and/or ST-segment elevation in right chest leads (RV1 through RV6). Therapy, in addition to appropriate management for STEMI, relies largely on enhancing the preload with intravenous fluid and judicious use of vasodilator medications. Patients with inferior wall STEMI with RV infarction have a markedly worse prognosis, both in terms of acute cardiovascular complications and death, compared with patients with isolated inferior wall STEMI.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^115KYihq]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, specifically with respect to ICD indications, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend performing ICD placement to reduce the risk of sudden death and all-cause mortality. This recommendation applies to patients with ARVC who have a history of survived cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular arrhythmia causing hemodynamic instability.

### Clinical differentiation between physiological remodeling and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in athletes with marked electrocardiographic repolarization anomalies [^113zy1cM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). High credibility.

Physiological cardiac adaptation to regular exercise, including biventricular dilation and T-wave inversion (TWI), may create a diagnostic overlap with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).

- **Objectives**: The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of diagnostic criteria for ARVC when applied to athletes exhibiting electrocardiographic TWI and to identify discriminators between physiology and disease.

- **Methods**: The study population consisted of athletes with TWI (n = 45), athletes without TWI (n = 35), and ARVC patients (n = 35). Subjects underwent electrocardiography (ECG), signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG), echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), Holter monitoring, and exercise testing.

- **Results**: There were no electrical, structural, or functional cardiac differences between athletes exhibiting TWI and athletes without TWI. When athletes were compared with ARVC patients, markers of physiological remodeling included early repolarization, biphasic TWI, voltage criteria for right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular hypertrophy, and symmetrical cardiac enlargement. Indicators of RV pathology included the following: syncope; Q waves or precordial QRS amplitudes 1,000 ventricular extrasystoles (or > 500 non-RV outflow tract) per 24 h; and symptoms, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, or attenuated blood pressure response during exercise. Nonspecific parameters included the following: prol

### Imaging the right heart: The use of integrated multimodality imaging [^1117JZbg]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

In recent years, right ventricular (RV) structure and function have been identified as important determinants of outcomes in various cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Currently, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging are the two imaging modalities most commonly used to visualize the RV. While most structural abnormalities of the RV can be reliably described through echocardiography, assessing RV function is more challenging due to its complex geometric shape. Newer promising echocardiographic techniques are emerging. However, their routine clinical application is influenced by a lack of validation and limited normal reference data. CMR is generally considered the clinical reference technique due to its unlimited imaging planes, superior image resolution, and three-dimensional volumetric rendering. The accuracy and reliability of CMR measurements make it the ideal tool for serial examinations of RV function.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) plays an important role in diagnosing pulmonary emboli but can also be used for assessing RV ischemic disease or as an alternative for CMR if contraindicated. Radionuclide techniques have become more obsolete in the current era. The different imaging modalities should be considered complementary, as each plays a role for different indications.

### Right ventricular strain predicts structural disease progression in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^113wfPEb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited condition associated with ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunction; however, limited data exist on identifying patients at highest risk. The study aimed to determine whether measures of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on echocardiogram, including RV strain, were predictive of structural disease progression in ARVC.

- **Methods and results**: A retrospective analysis of serial echocardiograms from 40 patients fulfilling 2010 task force criteria for ARVC was performed to assess structural progression. This progression was defined by an increase in proximal RV outflow tract dimensions (parasternal short or long axis) or a decrease in RV fractional area change. Echocardiograms were analyzed for RV free-wall peak longitudinal systolic strain using 2-dimensional speckle tracking. Risk of structural progression and 5-year change in RV outflow tract measurements were compared with baseline RV strain. Of the 40 ARVC patients, 61% had structural progression with an increase in the mean parasternal short-axis RV outflow tract dimension from 36.2 to 38.5 mm (P = 0.022) and 68% by an increase in parasternal long-axis RV outflow tract dimension from 36.1 to 39.2 mm (P = 0.001). RV fractional area change remained stable over time. Baseline RV strain was significantly associated with risk of structural progression and 5-year rate of change. Patients with an RV strain more positive than -20% had a higher risk (odds ratio: 18.4; 95% CI, 2.7–125.8; P = 0.003) of structural progression.

### Noninvasive right ventricular myocardial work by pressure-strain loop: A new perspective on right ventricular function and cardiac resynchronization therapy [^111aSTkf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Myocardial work (MW) by noninvasive pressure-strain loop (PSL) is a novel echocardiographic tool that provides a more precise estimation of right ventricular (RV) performance by accounting for RV loading conditions. The study sought to investigate the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on RV function and explore the role of RV MW indices in predicting CRT response.

Ninety-one CRT candidates were prospectively enrolled. Left ventricular (LV) MW parameters, RV global longitudinal strain (RV GLS), and RV free wall strain (RV FWS) were obtained. RV MW indices, including RV global work index (RV GWI), RV global constructive work (RV GCW), RV global wasted work (RV GWW), and RV global work efficiency (RV GWE), were measured by PSL analysis.

Response to CRT was defined as a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume of ≥ 15% at follow-up. RV GWI significantly increased in responders. CRT caused significant improvements in RV GWI, RV GCW, and RV GWE (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, RV GWI (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.010; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003 to 1.017; p < 0.05), and LV GCW (adjusted OR: 1.002; 95% CI: 1.000 to 1.003; p < 0.05) were associated with CRT response.

Adding RV GWI to the basal model yielded a significant improvement in continuous net reclassification improvement at 0.284 (p = 0.032), while other function parameters failed to improve reclassification. RV MW indices provide a new reference for the quantitative evaluation of RV myocardial performance before and after CRT. Although both RV GWI and LV GCW have prognostic value, RV GWI may better predict the outcomes.

### Additive value of right ventricular global longitudinal strain to a conventional echocardiographic parameter to improve prognostic value in intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism [^1144T8zW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

We believe there are several reasons for the significant findings in our review. The combination of measurements we identified provides a readily attainable assessment of pathologic effects on both RV size and RV function. Many prior reviews have evaluated individual parameters that are valuable but fail to provide superior prognostic value in isolation. This is reflected in recommendations to evaluate and consider a broad mix of echocardiographic parameters in risk stratification of PE. By using two parameters in risk stratification, the process is streamlined, but overvaluing a single abnormal measurement is also prevented. Finally, our study identified threshold values that are distinct from traditional boundaries for defining upper or lower limits of normal. These disease-specific thresholds improve the prognostic value and should be validated in future research.

In additional groups, with one high-risk and one low-risk parameter, short-term mortality rates were intermediate, as might be expected. The Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrate that mortality risk is more significant in patients with abnormal RVGLS and normal RV/LV ratio than the opposite combination. This suggests that abnormal RV function portends a higher risk than chamber dilation relative to the left ventricle. Patients with abnormal RVGLS in isolation may have preexisting dysfunction, which predisposes them to high mortality risk despite a lack of relative RV dilation or de novo dysfunction from acute PE. Patients with only an abnormal RV/LV ratio are most likely earlier in the cascade of changes that are expected in.

### Is electrocardiography-left ventricular hypertrophy an obsolete marker for determining heart failure risk with hypertension [^111EbZ4P]? Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiography-left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) has traditionally been used as a marker for determining heart failure risk in patients with hypertension. However, recent studies suggest that its predictive value may be limited. Advanced imaging techniques, such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, are proving to be more accurate in assessing cardiac risk factors. This shift in diagnostic preference leads to questions regarding the continued utility of ECG-LVH in modern clinical practice. These queries underscore the need for revised guidelines that incorporate newer, more reliable diagnostic methods.

The study examines various factors influencing heart failure risk and compares the efficacy of ECG-LVH with other assessment tools. Findings indicate that while ECG-LVH remains a useful tool, its standalone use may not be sufficient for determining risk in all patient populations. Integrated approaches that leverage multiple diagnostic tools may offer improved risk stratification and management for hypertensive patients.

### Time to move to the right — the study of right ventricular systolic performance: too long neglected [^113ncVmS]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Although the evidence that right ventricular (RV) function has significant impact on cardiac hemodynamics and outcomes is indisputable, its evaluation has been hampered by problems with image quality, geometric variability, and the absence of a standard of reference. A resurgence of research activity has sought to discern the pathophysiology of RV dysfunction and to explore new methods for measuring performance. Noninvasive techniques such as tissue Doppler echocardiography, three-dimensional echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging provide new quantitative information and may improve prediction of outcomes. These advances in technology and the recognition that RV systolic function is essential in many conditions provide the impetus for future studies. This review highlights the past and present efforts to incorporate RV systolic function into the mainstream of cardiology practice.

### Multimodality evaluation of the right ventricle: An updated review [^112g3iQm]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

The assessment of the volumes, function, and mechanics of the right ventricle (RV) is very challenging due to its anatomical complexity. Because RV structure, function, and deformation are significant predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart disease, or arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, it is crucial to use an appropriate imaging modality that provides all necessary information.

In everyday clinical practice, 2-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) is the method of first choice in RV evaluation. However, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) remains the gold standard for RV assessment. The development of new imaging tools, such as 3-dimensional echocardiography (3DE), has provided reliable data comparable to CMR and opened a new era in RV imaging. So far, 3DE has shown good results in determining RV volumes and systolic function, with indications that it will also provide valuable data about 3-dimensional RV mechanics, similar to CMR.

Two-dimensional echocardiography-derived strain is currently widely used for the assessment of RV deformation, which has been proven to be a more significant predictor of functional capacity and survival than CMR-derived RV ejection fraction. The purpose of this review is to summarize currently available data about RV structure, function, and mechanics obtained by different imaging modalities, primarily 2DE and 3DE, and their comparison with CMR and cardiac computed tomography.

### Myocardial strain imaging: How useful is it in clinical decision making [^114UuX4C]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Prognosis in HCM is closely related to LV function and morphology. In contrast to LVEF, which is often normal in HCM, longitudinal strains are reduced in the early stages of the disease, whereas radial and circumferential strains may be preserved (Figure 7). Longitudinal strain is reduced at the site of hypertrophy, commonly in the interventricular septum. Clinical practice guidelines for management of HCM include strain echocardiography for evaluating longitudinal function in early disease. Longitudinal function can be abnormal even before the development of increased wall thickness in mutation-positive family members (Figure 7). The finding of reduced longitudinal strain, particularly in the presence of an abnormal ECG, increases the probability of disease.

- **Figure description**: Longitudinal strain by speckle-tracking echocardiography (two-chamber view) in a patient with acute myocardial infarction the day after percutaneous coronary intervention of an occluded left anterior descending coronary artery. Follow-up late enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (lower left) showed myocardial scarring represented by the white area in the apex and anterior wall. Strain curves display typical features of ischaemic dysfunction, ranging from lengthening throughout systole in a segment with transmural infarction and different degrees of dysfunction in other segments. The color of each trace corresponds to anatomical points on the 2-D color image and the white dotted line shows the average of the six strain curves. The yellow curve shows normal contraction in a non-infarcted segment.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically concerning cardiac catheterization, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering left and right heart catheterization. This procedure assesses the severity of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and measures left ventricular (LV) filling pressures in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) if noninvasive cardiac imaging is inconclusive.

### Prognostic value of right atrial strains in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^113YAAXx]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

All definite ARVC cases based on TFC diagnosis from different institutions were collected in a core laboratory. Two radiologists (W.L.M. with 12 years of experience and C.B.H. with 9 years), who were blinded to each other and clinical information, independently analyzed CMR images using dedicated commercial software Cvi42 version 5.11.3 (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc, Calgary, Canada). Ventricular function and volumes were quantified from short-axis cine images, and RA function and volumes were evaluated from two- and four-long-axis cine images. End-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were adjusted to the body surface area.

RA longitudinal strain analysis was conducted only on four-chamber long-axis views. RA endocardial and epicardial contours were manually identified in the end-diastolic phase (Fig. 1). The Cvi42 software automatically tracked the contours consecutively in all phases covering the whole cardiac cycle and calculated strain. The myocardial border was reviewed and manually readjusted when the contour recognized by Cvi42 was offset from the actual one to obtain high accuracy. RA strain, including reservoir strain, booster strain, conduit strain, and the corresponding strain rate, were the average of the results of blindly repeated tracking performed three times.

RV global strains (global longitudinal strain, GLS; global circumferential strain, GCS; global radial strain, GRS) were measured similarly on short and long-axis cine images. LGE was qualitatively assessed using complete short-axis coverage.

### Beyond the beaten path of right ventricular assessment: Using right ventricular fractional shortening in patients with heart transplants [^115zvp6n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Unlike the left ventricle, right ventricular (RV) assessment poses significant challenges due to its complex structure. Cardiac magnetic resonance is able to overcome these challenges and is considered the gold standard for RV assessment. Three‐dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is superior to two‐dimensional TTE in assessing the RV. However, the reliance of three‐dimensional TTE on good image quality, coupled with other technical considerations, limits the wider adoption of this imaging modality. Despite the well‐known limitations of two‐dimensional TTE, it remains an indispensable and widely available tool for RV evaluation. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, as a linear measurement of the annular motion, is frequently used to measure RV function, although its prognostic value in comparison to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-derived RV ejection fraction and other echocardiographic metrics remains a subject of debate.

Increasingly, strain imaging techniques are gaining widespread clinical adoption. Right ventricular fractional wall shortening (RVFWS) goes beyond traditional echocardiographic indices by providing insights into intrinsic myocardial deformational changes and early RV dysfunction. For example, in pulmonary hypertension, it correlates with invasive hemodynamics, thereby aiding in timely interventions and serving as a valuable metric for disease monitoring post-therapy. However, RVFWS requires high-quality imaging and precise endocardial border tracing. A novel parameter, right ventricular longitudinal shortening fraction (RVLSF), is measured using two‐dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. RVLSF combines two‐dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography with tricuspid annular displacement analysis.

### A dynamic and chamber-specific mitochondrial remodeling in right ventricular hypertrophy can be therapeutically targeted [^1141pXv4]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The right ventricle fails quickly after increases in its afterload (i.e. pulmonary hypertension) compared with the left ventricle (i.e. systemic hypertension), resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. It is hypothesized that the poor performance of the hypertrophied right ventricle is caused, at least in part, by suboptimal mitochondrial/metabolic remodeling.

- **Methods/results**: We studied mitochondrial membrane potential, a surrogate for mitochondrial function, in human (n = 11) and rat hearts with physiologic (neonatal) and pathologic (pulmonary hypertension) right ventricular hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Mitochondrial membrane potential is higher in the normal left ventricle compared with the right ventricle but is highest in the hypertrophied right ventricle, both in myocardium and in isolated cardiomyocytes (P < .01). Mitochondrial membrane potential correlated positively with the degree of right ventricular hypertrophy in vivo and was recapitulated in phenylephrine-treated neonatal cardiomyocytes, an in vitro model of hypertrophy. The phenylephrine-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization was reversed by VIVIT, an inhibitor of the nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes, a transcription factor regulating the expression of several mitochondrial enzymes during cardiac development and hypertrophy. The clinically used drug dichloroacetate, known to increase mitochondria-based glucose oxidation, reversed both the phenylephrine-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization and nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) activation.

### Right atrial enlargement on electrocardiogram in previously healthy young patients [^114Qk2pM]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

To assess whether right atrial enlargement (RAE) on electrocardiogram (ECG) correlates with true RAE on echocardiogram in previously healthy young patients and to understand which patients with RAE on ECG may warrant additional testing, a single-center, retrospective review was conducted. The study involved previously healthy young patients who had ECGs interpreted as RAE by a pediatric cardiologist and echocardiograms obtained within 90 days of the ECG. ECGs were reviewed to confirm RAE and determine which leads met criteria. The echocardiograms were then reviewed, and RA measurements with z scores were obtained. A z score greater than 2 was considered positive for RAE on echocardiogram.

In total, 162 patients with a median age of 10.8 years were included in the study. Among these, 23 patients had true RAE on echocardiogram, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 14%. For patients less than 1 year of age, the PPV increased to 35%. In patients older than 1 year, the PPV was low at 7%. Patients with true RAE were more likely to meet criteria for RAE in the anterior precordial leads (V1-V3) (48% vs 5%, P < .001) and meet criteria for right ventricular hypertrophy (22% vs 6%, P = 0.023).

Our findings show that RAE on ECG has a low PPV for RAE on echocardiogram in previously healthy young patients. The highest yield for RAE on echocardiogram was observed in patients who were less than 1 year of age, had RAE in the anterior precordial leads, or displayed right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG.

### Right ventricular strain predicts structural disease progression in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^112TQpEe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited condition associated with ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunction; however, limited data exist on identifying patients at highest risk. The purpose of the study was to determine whether measures of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on echocardiograms, including RV strain, were predictive of structural disease progression in ARVC.

- **Methods and results**: A retrospective analysis of serial echocardiograms from 40 patients fulfilling the 2010 task force criteria for ARVC was performed to assess structural progression, defined by an increase in proximal RV outflow tract dimensions (parasternal short or long axis) or a decrease in RV fractional area change. Echocardiograms were analyzed for RV free-wall peak longitudinal systolic strain using two-dimensional speckle tracking. Risk of structural progression and five-year change in RV outflow tract measurements were compared with baseline RV strain. Of the 40 ARVC patients, 61% had structural progression with an increase in the mean parasternal short-axis RV outflow tract dimension from 36.2 to 38.5 mm (P = 0.022) and 68% by an increase in parasternal long-axis RV outflow tract dimension from 36.1 to 39.2 mm (P = 0.001). RV fractional area change remained stable over time. Baseline RV strain was significantly associated with the risk of structural progression and five-year rate of change. Patients with an RV strain more positive than −20% had a higher risk (odds ratio: 18.4; 95% CI, 2.7–125.8; P = 0.003) of structural progression.

### Right ventricular fibrosis and conduction delay in a patient with clinical signs of Brugada syndrome: A combined electrophysiological, genetic, histopathologic, and computational study [^114Xo792]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The mechanism of ECG changes and arrhythmogenesis in Brugada syndrome (BS) patients is unknown.

- **Methods and results**: A BS patient without clinically detected cardiac structural abnormalities underwent cardiac transplantation due to intolerable numbers of implantable cardioverter/defibrillator discharges. The patient's explanted heart was studied electrophysiologically and histopathologically. Whole-cell currents were measured in HEK293 cells expressing wild-type or mutated sodium channels from the patient. The right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) endocardium showed activation slowing and was the origin of ventricular fibrillation without a transmural repolarization gradient. Conduction restitution was abnormal in the RVOT but normal in the left ventricle. Right ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis with epicardial fatty infiltration were present. HEK293 cells expressing a G1935S mutation in the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel exhibited enhanced slow inactivation compared with wild-type channels. Computer simulations demonstrated that conduction slowing in the RVOT might have been the cause of the ECG changes.

- **Conclusions**: In this patient with BS, conduction slowing based on interstitial fibrosis, but not transmural repolarization differences, caused the ECG signs and was the origin of ventricular fibrillation.

### Multimodality imaging of right heart function: JACC scientific statement [^115WG2En]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) size and function, assessed by multimodality imaging, are associated with outcomes in various cardiovascular diseases. Understanding RV anatomy and physiology is essential for appreciating the strengths and weaknesses of imaging methods, providing greater context to these measurements. The adaptation of the right ventricle to different types and severities of stress, particularly over time, is specific to the cardiovascular disease process. Multimodality imaging parameters, which determine outcomes, reflect the ability to image the initial and longitudinal RV response to stress. This paper reviews the standard and novel imaging methods for assessing RV function and the impact of these parameters on outcomes in specific disease states.

### Mechanism of right precordial ST-segment elevation in structural heart disease: Excitation failure by current-to-load mismatch [^113qydAb]. Heart Rhythm (2010). Low credibility.

The Brugada sign has been associated with mutations in SCN5A and with right ventricular structural abnormalities, although their role in the Brugada sign and the associated ventricular arrhythmias is unknown.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of structural abnormalities and sodium channel dysfunction in the Brugada sign.

- **Methods**: Activation and repolarization characteristics of the explanted heart of a patient with a loss-of-function mutation in SCN5A (G752R) and dilated cardiomyopathy were determined after induction of right-sided ST-segment elevation by ajmaline. In addition, right ventricular structural discontinuities and sodium channel dysfunction were simulated in a computer model encompassing the heart and thorax.

- **Results**: In the explanted heart, disappearance of local activation in unipolar electrograms at the basal right ventricular epicardium was followed by monophasic ST-segment elevation. The local origin of this phenomenon was confirmed by coaxial electrograms. Neither early repolarization nor late activation correlated with ST-segment elevation. At sites of local ST-segment elevation, the subepicardium was interspersed with adipose tissue and contained more fibrous tissue than either the left ventricle or control hearts. In computer simulations entailing right ventricular structural discontinuities, reduction of sodium channel conductance or size of the gaps between introduced barriers resulted in subepicardial excitation failure or delayed activation by current-to-load mismatch and in the Brugada sign on the ECG.

### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Characterization of left ventricular phenotype and differential diagnosis with dilated cardiomyopathy [^113DsSmc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

All patients underwent a standard 12‐lead ECG, which was analyzed by two observers, masked to clinical data and CMR findings. Standard measurements included P‐wave abnormalities and PR interval; QRS axis, voltage, and duration; and ST‐segment and T‐wave abnormalities. Specifically, first-degree atrioventricular block was defined as a PR interval > 200 ms. Low QRS voltages were identified if QRS amplitude was ≤ 0.5 mV in limb leads, including both negative and positive components. Left axis deviation was defined when the mean electrical axis of QRS in the frontal plane direction was between −30° and −90°. Left anterior hemiblock and left bundle branch block (LBBB) were characterized as previously recommended. Left ventricular hypertrophy was identified by standard Sokolow–Lyon voltage criteria (S V1 + R V5 or V6 ≥ 3.5 mV). Strain patterns were characterized as a downsloping convex ST segment with an inverted asymmetric T‐wave opposite to the QRS axis, in the absence of LBBB. Left atrial enlargement was defined when the length of the P wave in lead II was > 120 ms, and T‐wave inversion (TWI) was identified when ≥ 0.1 mV in depth in ≥ 2 contiguous leads, in the absence of LBBB.

CMR images were acquired using a 1.5 T scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) with ECG‐triggering and phased array coil system. The study protocol, techniques, and post‐processing analysis (software CMR, 42 Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc, Calgary, Canada) are described in detail in previous works of our group. LV dilatation and LV systolic dysfunction were defined with reference to those prior studies.

### Perioperative course of three-dimensional-derived right ventricular strain in coronary artery bypass surgery: A prospective, observational, pilot trial [^1165gnKv]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). High credibility.

Few data exist on perioperative three-dimensional-derived right ventricular strain, and the authors aimed to describe its course in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery patients. The study was a prospective, observational, pilot trial conducted in a single university hospital.

Forty patients with preserved left ventricular and right ventricular (RV) function undergoing isolated on-pump CABG surgery participated in the study. Three-dimensional strain analysis and standard echocardiographic evaluation of RV function were performed preoperatively (T1) and postoperatively (T4) with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and intraoperatively before sternotomy (T2) and after sternotomy (T3) with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). All measurements were conducted under stable hemodynamic conditions with predefined fluid management and no vasoactive support.

- **Measurements and main results**: The measurements of three-dimensional-derived RV free-wall strain (3D-RV FWS) and RV ejection fraction were performed using TomTec 4D RV-Function 2.0 software. Philips QLAB 10.8 was used to analyze the tissue velocity of the tricuspid annulus, tricuspid annular systolic excursion, and RV fractional area change. There were no significant differences in 3D-RV FWS between preoperative TTE and intraoperative TEE measurements (T1 vs T2: -22.35 [IQR -17.70 to -27.22] vs -24.35 [IQR -20.63 to -29.88]).

### Contemporary management of acute right ventricular failure: A statement from the Heart Failure Association and the Working Group on Pulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function of the European Society of Cardiology [^117L2rJz]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Acute right ventricular (RV) failure is a complex clinical syndrome that results from many causes. Research efforts have disproportionately focused on the failing left ventricle, but recently the need has been recognized to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of RV anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and management approaches. Right ventricular mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either pressure overload or volume overload.

Failure may also result from a primary reduction of myocardial contractility due to ischemia, cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmia. Dysfunction leads to impaired RV filling and increased right atrial pressures. As dysfunction progresses to overt RV failure, the RV chamber becomes more spherical and tricuspid regurgitation is aggravated, leading to increasing venous congestion. Ventricular interdependence results in impaired left ventricular filling, a decrease in left ventricular stroke volume, and ultimately low cardiac output and cardiogenic shock.

Identification and treatment of the underlying cause of RV failure, such as acute pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute decompensation of chronic pulmonary hypertension, RV infarction, or arrhythmia, is the primary management strategy. Judicious fluid management, the use of inotropes and vasopressors, assist devices, and a strategy focusing on RV protection for mechanical ventilation if required, all play roles in the clinical care of these patients. Future research should aim to address the remaining areas of uncertainty that result from the complex nature of RV failure.

### Right ventricular dysfunction impairs effort tolerance independent of left ventricular function among patients undergoing exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging [^117L8pRL]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) function are closely linked due to a variety of factors, including common coronary blood supply. Altered LV perfusion holds the potential to affect the RV, but links between LV ischemia and RV performance, and the independent impact of RV dysfunction on effort tolerance are unknown.

- **Methods and results**: The population comprised 2051 patients who underwent exercise stress myocardial perfusion imaging and echocardiogram (5.5 ± 7.9 days), among whom 6% had echo-evidenced RV dysfunction. Global summed stress scores were approximately three-fold higher among patients with RV dysfunction, attributable to increments in inducible and fixed LV perfusion defects (all P ≤ 0.001). Regional inferior and lateral wall ischemia was greater among patients with RV dysfunction (both P < 0.01), without difference in corresponding anterior defects (P = 0.13). In multivariable analysis, inducible inferior and lateral wall perfusion defects increased the likelihood of RV dysfunction (both P < 0.05) independent of LV function, fixed perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery pressure.

Patients with RV dysfunction demonstrated lesser effort tolerance whether measured by exercise duration (6.7 ± 2.8 versus 7.9 ± 2.9 minutes; P < 0.001) or peak treadmill stage (2.6 ± 0.9 versus 3.1 ± 1.0; P < 0.001), paralleling results among patients with LV dysfunction (7.0 ± 2.9 versus 8.0 ± 2.9; P < 0.001 and 2.7 ± 1.0 versus 3.1 ± 1.0; P < 0.001, respectively). Exercise time decreased stepwise in relation to both RV and LV dysfunction (P < 0.001) and was associated with each parameter independent of age or medication regimen.

### Prognostic implications of right ventricular free wall strain in recipients of cardiac resynchronization therapy [^115415iN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) function is an important prognostic marker in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) recipients. Measuring RV systolic function with echocardiography, however, remains challenging due to the complexity of right heart morphology. Evaluation of RV function with RV free wall strain (FWS) may improve risk stratification in recipients of CRT compared with conventional RV function parameters.

In 871 recipients of CRT (mean age 65 ± 11 years, 75% were men), RV function was assessed by RV fractional area change (FAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and RV FWS measured by speckle tracking echocardiography. RV dysfunction was defined as RV FWS < 23%, RV FAC < 35%, and TAPSE < 17 mm according to present guidelines. Patients were followed up for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality.

- **Sensitivity of RV FWS**: RV FWS identified a higher percentage of patients with RV systolic dysfunction (80.6%) in comparison with RV FAC (44.1%) and TAPSE (60.6%). During a median follow-up of 97 (53 to 145) months, 521 patients (59.8%) died.

- **Event rates and prognosis**: Recipients of CRT with RV FWS < 23% had higher event rates than those with RV FWS ≥ 23% (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, RV FWS < 23% was independently associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.618; 95% confidence interval 1.252 to 2.092; p < 0.001) and demonstrated incremental prognostic value over baseline clinical parameters as well as conventional RV function parameters.

In conclusion, RV FWS is more sensitive than conventional echocardiographic markers of RV function in detecting impaired RV function. RV FWS is independently associated with all-cause mortality in CRT recipients, offering superior risk stratification.

### Right ventricular mechanical dispersion is related to malignant arrhythmias: A study of patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and subclinical right ventricular dysfunction [^117TRLpM]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

We evaluated if right ventricular (RV) mechanical dispersion by strain was related to ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and if mechanical dispersion was increased in previously asymptomatic mutation carriers.

- **Methods and results**: We included 69 patients; 42 had symptomatic ARVC and 27 were mutation-positive asymptomatic family members. Forty healthy individuals served as controls. Myocardial strain was assessed in 6 RV and 16 left ventricular (LV) segments. Contraction duration (CD) in these segments was measured as the time from onset R on electrocardiogram to maximum myocardial shortening in each segment. The standard deviation of CD was defined as mechanical dispersion. Mechanical dispersion was more pronounced in ARVC patients with arrhythmias compared with asymptomatic mutation carriers and healthy individuals in RV [52(41,63) vs. 35(23,47) vs. 13(9,19)ms, P < 0.001]. Mechanical dispersion was more pronounced in asymptomatic mutation carriers compared with healthy individuals (P < 0.001). Right ventricular mechanical dispersion predicted VT/VF in multivariate logistic regression analysis [odds ratio (OR) 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–2.58), P < 0.03]. Right ventricular and LV function by strain were reduced in symptomatic ARVC patients and correlated significantly (R = 0.81, P < 0.001). Right ventricular and LV strain were reduced in asymptomatic mutation carriers compared with healthy individuals (P < 0.001).

### Right ventricular hypertrophy in systemic hypertension: an updated review of clinical studies [^116VN5ko]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Experimental and clinical evidence supports the view that right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) may parallel left ventricular hypertrophy in systemic hypertension; however, a comprehensive analysis of this issue is lacking. Thus, we analyzed the literature to provide updated information on the right ventricular structural changes associated with systemic hypertension.

- **Design**: A literature search using the keywords 'right ventricle', 'right ventricular hypertrophy', 'biventricular hypertrophy', 'right and left ventricular hypertrophy', 'hypertension', and 'echocardiography' was performed to identify relevant articles. Full articles published in English in the last three decades reporting studies in adult hypertensive individuals were considered.

- **Results**: A total of 13 studies, including 1,290 untreated (45%) and treated hypertensive patients and 259 normotensive controls, were considered. Overall, in hypertensive individuals, the right ventricular wall was thicker than in normotensive counterparts (standardized difference 1.3 mm, P < 0.001). RVH prevalence consistently varied among studies (17.0–80.0%) with an average of 28.6% in the pooled population. This was also the case for LVH prevalence rates (9.0–100%), with an average value of 30.6%.

- **Conclusion**: Clinical studies consistently indicate that RVH is a common cardiac phenotype in systemic hypertension. As this finding is based on a limited number of cross-sectional studies, including small population samples, further investigations are needed to determine the clinical utility and prognostic value of this observation.

### The prognostic value of right ventricular long axis strain in non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathies using standard cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [^112TGyUH]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of right ventricular long axis strain (RV-LAS), a parameter of longitudinal function, with outcomes in patients with non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM).

- **Methods**: In a retrospective analysis of 441 patients with NIDCM, RV-LAS was measured by assessing the length between the epicardial border of the left ventricular apex and the midpoint of a line connecting the origins of the tricuspid valve leaflets during end-diastole and end-systole on non-contrast standard cine sequences.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint of cardiac death or heart transplantation occurred in 41 patients, while 95 patients reached a combined endpoint, including cardiac decompensation and sustained ventricular arrhythmias, over a median follow-up period of 4.2 years. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a poor outcome for patients with RV-LAS values below -10% (log-rank test, p-value < 0.001). Additionally, in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 45% (n = 213), reduced RV-LAS was still associated with poor outcomes.

- **Conclusion**: Assessment of RV-LAS serves as an independent indicator of outcomes in patients with NIDCM and provides additional information beyond clinical and cardiac MR parameters.

Key points to note are that impaired right ventricular longitudinal function, as indicated by RV-LAS, is linked to poorer cardiac outcomes. Furthermore, a decreased RV-LAS is associated with poor outcomes even in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fractions.

### Risk stratification in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^115EkqgC]. Circulation (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy:

- **Definition**: ARVC is a genetically inherited cardiomyopathy characterized by the replacement of normal heart muscle with fibrofatty tissue, predominantly in the right ventricle.

- **Pathophysiology**: ARVC is caused by the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, predisposing the heart to electrical instability, leading to ventricular arrhythmias.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of ARVC worldwide is estimated at 20 per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, ARVC can present with a variety of symptoms. The most common presenting symptoms include palpitations, syncope, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Some patients may also develop signs of heart failure (HF).

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of ARVC is variable. It is associated with an increased risk of SCD, particularly in young individuals, and may be the first manifestation of the disease.

### Assessment of right ventricular function in the research setting: Knowledge gaps and pathways forward. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113ZTy6u]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Right ventricular (RV) adaptation to acute and chronic pulmonary hypertensive syndromes is a significant determinant of short- and long-term outcomes. Although remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of RV function and failure since the meeting of the NIH Working Group on Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Right Heart Failure in 2005, significant gaps remain at many levels in the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of RV responses to pressure and volume overload, in the validation of diagnostic modalities, and in the development of evidence-based therapies.

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary working group of 20 international experts from the American Thoracic Society Assemblies on Pulmonary Circulation and Critical Care, as well as external content experts, reviewed the literature, identified important knowledge gaps, and provided recommendations.

- **Results**: This document reviews the knowledge in the field of RV failure, identifies and prioritizes the most pertinent research gaps, and provides a prioritized pathway for addressing these preclinical and clinical questions. The group identified knowledge gaps and research opportunities in three major topic areas:
	1) Optimizing the methodology to assess RV function in acute and chronic conditions in preclinical models, human studies, and clinical trials.
	2) Analyzing advanced RV hemodynamic parameters at rest and in response to exercise.
	3) Deciphering the underlying molecular and pathogenic mechanisms of RV function and failure in diverse pulmonary hypertension syndromes.

### Right ventricular strain predicts structural disease progression in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^115z8jQ4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate echocardiographic free-wall longitudinal strain of the right ventricle (RV) as a predictor of the progression of structural disease in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) using data from patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins ARVC registry. These patients underwent serial echocardiograms. We hypothesized that worse peak RV strain and strain rate would be significantly associated with disease progression, as defined by increasing right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) dimensions and decreased right ventricular fractional area change (RV-FAC).

### Evaluation of pediatric electrocardiogram diagnosis of ventricular hypertrophy by computer program compared with cardiologists [^1158wUyb]. Pediatric Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnosis of pediatric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) by the Glasgow electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation program compared to interpretations provided by two pediatric cardiologists. ECGs had all identifying information removed and were sent to the cardiologists independently, accompanied by the patient's age, sex, and the clinical indication for the ECG if known.

A total of 984 ECGs were included in the study, of which 664 were reported "with clinical indication" and 320 were reported "blind". With respect to an averaged diagnosis of the two cardiologists, the sensitivity of the program for RVH was better when the cardiologists reported blind (73.3%) than with the clinical indication (53.5%), with the same trend for the program compared with individual cardiologists. The specificity of the program was at least 94.4% in all cases. For LVH, the program had high specificity (= 95.8%) for "reported blind" and "with clinical indication" cases but low sensitivities throughout (the highest was 44.4% with respect to an averaged diagnosis of the two cardiologists reporting with the clinical indication). Subsequent discussion revealed that if the cardiologists had disagreed with one another initially, their consensus opinion was twice as likely to be in agreement with the program.

### Prognostic value of electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy [^115XJ7sj]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Many electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) exist, but few studies have compared their relative prognostic value for predicting cardiovascular (CV) mortality.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the first ECG on 46,950 consecutive veterans. We targeted male outpatients with a body mass index > 20 to avoid confounding by complicating catabolic illnesses and further excluded those with conduction abnormalities. Using Cox regression models adjusted for age, heart rate, and body mass index, we compared the hazard ratios (HRs) for CV mortality obtained from seventeen commonly used ECG criteria for LVH.

- **Results**: During a mean follow-up of 7 ± 4 years, in a total population of 19,434 patients (mean age 54 ± 14 years), 1,254 (6%) patients died of CV causes. The adjusted HR for CV mortality ranged from 1.4 (95% CI 1.2–1.6) to 3.7 (95% CI 2.7–5.0) among the various criteria. Left ventricular hypertrophy defined by composite criteria was generally associated with higher adjusted HRs compared with voltage-only criteria. Among patients with ECG-LVH, the presence of a left ventricular strain pattern or increased negative P-terminal force were most predictive of CV mortality (HR 3.9 and 3.5, 95% CI 3.3–4.6 and 2.8–4.2).

- **Conclusions**: Compared with voltage-only criteria for detecting LVH, composite ECG criteria are more strongly predictive of CV mortality. By applying these ECG criteria into routine clinical practice, individuals with LVH who are at higher risk for CV mortality can be identified and appropriately treated.

### Right ventricular hypertrophy with early dysfunction: A proteomics study in a neonatal model [^111x5mSX]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Right ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent dysfunction are common in patients with congenital heart defects, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the change from adaptive hypertrophy to dysfunction remain elusive. We used the novel technique of proteomics to characterize protein changes in right ventricular myocardium in a neonatal model of right ventricular hypertrophy and early dysfunction.

- **Methods**: Twelve neonatal piglets were equally randomized to pulmonary artery banding (PAB group) or sham operation (thoracotomy without banding). After 4 weeks, right ventricular morphology and function were assessed in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging. Animals were humanely killed. Proteomics of right ventricular myocardium was performed. Purified right ventricular proteins were separated by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis using fluorescent cyanine dyes. After gel imaging, software analysis revealed protein spots differentially expressed between the two groups; these spots were excised and identified by mass spectrometry.

- **Results**: On magnetic resonance imaging, animals with pulmonary artery banding demonstrated significant right ventricular hypertrophy, cavity dilatation, and mild systolic impairment (right ventricular ejection fraction 39.8% ± 15% vs. 56.7% ± 10% controls; P < .05). Right ventricular free wall mass on harvest confirmed right ventricular hypertrophy. Proteomic analysis revealed 18 proteins that were significantly differentially expressed: 5 structural proteins, 6 metabolic enzymes, 2 stress proteins, and 5 miscellaneous proteins.

### Right ventricular strain predicts structural disease progression in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy [^112Use3J]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Regarding measurement of RVOT, prior studies have shown that RVOT measures by echo are reproducible and correlate with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging measures. One study reported high reproducibility, with interclass correlation values > 0.91 for inter‐ and intraobserver correlation of 2‐dimensional RVOT measurements on echo. In addition, RVOT dimension on transthoracic echocardiogram exhibited good correlation with the same measure on cardiac magnetic resonance (r = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93; P < 0.0001) and good absolute agreement with a mean difference of 0.2 mm between the 2 imaging modalities. This metric was used in our study and was utilized by the Heart Rhythm Society 2010 TFC in the diagnosis of ARVC. Another study reported a 2-mm increase in RVOT dimension over time in a population of ARVC patients and was found to be significant, similar to our findings. Based on the reproducibility of RVOT measurements and findings in prior studies, changes in RVOT size in this study of 2.3 and 3.2 mm on PSAX and PLAX views, respectively, are appropriately significant, and they correspond to relative changes of ≈6.3% and 8.6% from baseline to follow‐up.

It should be noted that patients who progressed by RVOT PSAX had lower baseline RV‐FAC, larger RV basal diameters, and greater fulfillment of major structural criteria by echocardiography at baseline compared with patients who did not progress by RVOT PSAX. These findings are consistent with the notion that ARVC is a progressive disease; patients who exhibited progression tended to have greater evidence.

### A scoping review of validated echocardiographic methods for grading right ventricular dysfunction: Proposal for an evidence-based multiparametric framework [^113BMZzF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). High credibility.

Assessing the severity of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction using echocardiography (echo) remains subjective, in part because guidelines do not recommend how to synthesize various echo parameters to form a global assessment of RV dysfunction. To address this unmet need, this scoping review aimed to identify all multiparametric RV dysfunction scoring systems that use routine echo parameters and synthesize these models with 2025 guidelines to create a multiparametric framework for RV dysfunction assessment.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched for studies in adult patients that propose and validate a multiparametric scoring system for grading RV dysfunction. All studies underwent independent review during abstract and full-text screening. Screening of 2,229 initial citations yielded 10 observational studies consisting of diverse cohorts, including but not limited to patients with heart failure, those undergoing cardiac surgery, and those admitted to the intensive care unit.

Six validated echo parameters were identified:

- **RV dilation**
- **RV systolic dysfunction**: Represented by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, S', or fractional area change.
- **Tricuspid regurgitation**
- **Elevated right atrial pressure**
- **RV-pulmonary artery uncoupling**: Ratio of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion to pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
- **Paradoxical interventricular septal motion**

The studies demonstrated that multiparametric RV dysfunction scores had greater clinical prognostic value than did any individual RV echo parameter alone.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^114Gu7qF]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, specifically with respect to the screening of family relatives using cardiac MRI, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the use of contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI in phenotype-negative family members. This approach aids in diagnosis and helps detect early disease in cases of familial cardiomyopathy without a genetic diagnosis.
