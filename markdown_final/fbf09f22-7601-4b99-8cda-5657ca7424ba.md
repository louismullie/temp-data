## Question

Test for left flanknpain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and test for left flank pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and red flags. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for left flank pain. Next, I will outline the initial laboratory workup and its limitations. After that, I need to define an imaging algorithm tailored to patient risk and pregnancy status. Then, I will consider special populations and rare but critical mimics. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision pathway and highlight pitfalls and quality-improvement considerations, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid identification of life threats such as sepsis, hemorrhage, vascular catastrophe, or surgical abdomen, because these mandate immediate intervention before diagnostic testing proceeds [^1149qknL] [^11361VUE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should construct a differential that spans renal, ureteral, vascular, gastrointestinal, splenic, musculoskeletal, and gynecologic causes, with emphasis on entities that classically present on the left side or with left-predominant features, including nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, renal infarction, renal vein thrombosis, nutcracker syndrome, splenic infarction, pancreatitis, diverticulitis, lumbar hernia, and musculoskeletal rib syndromes [^116kqVkn] [^111nkKSU] [^113Y3yaq] [^1139tidE] [^115KHZNn].

> Wait, let me verify the initial laboratory strategy; urinalysis with microscopy is foundational to separate hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria, while CBC, BMP, and LDH help screen for infection, renal function, and ischemia, but I should remember that hematuria is neither sensitive nor specific for stones and that normal labs do not exclude serious disease, so I must not anchor on normal results [^1124EhWh] [^113EvwKa].

> I will now examine the imaging algorithm for suspected urolithiasis; noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the first-line test for acute-onset flank pain when stone disease is suspected and there is no known prior stone disease, given sensitivity and specificity around 94–100% and the ability to detect alternative diagnoses, but I need to balance this against radiation and overuse concerns [^114sk6Tz] [^114eahRc] [^113pnxG3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ultrasound has poor sensitivity for stones and should be avoided; hold on, I should verify the role of ultrasound because it can detect hydronephrosis, perinephric fluid, and ureteral jets, and in low-risk or previously imaged patients it can safely reduce CT use without missing clinically important disease when combined with clinical judgment and selective CT [^113pnxG3] [^1176hw5S].

> Let me consider pregnancy specifically; ultrasound is the initial modality of choice, and if nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, noncontrast MRI can be considered to avoid ionizing radiation, so I should not default to CT in this population unless there is a compelling alternative indication [^114eahRc].

> Next, I should review the approach to recurrent stone formers; I need to ensure I avoid unnecessary repeat CT when the presentation is typical for uncomplicated recurrent colic and there are no red flags, using ultrasound selectively and reserving CT for diagnostic uncertainty or change in clinical status, consistent with Choosing Wisely and ED stewardship data [^113pnxG3] [^115TQTBA].

> But wait, what if the CT is negative for stones; I should double-check for alternative diagnoses that CT can reveal, including appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, vascular events, and gynecologic pathology, because up to a third of unenhanced CTs for flank pain uncover non-stone findings that explain symptoms and alter management [^116kqVkn] [^1152jgsx].

> I need to ensure I do not miss vascular emergencies; in patients with atrial fibrillation or embolic risk and acute flank pain, renal infarction or renal artery embolism should be considered, with contrast-enhanced CT angiography as the diagnostic test of choice and LDH as a sensitive marker, because delays worsen outcomes and noncontrast CT can miss these entities [^113EvwKa] [^112cnLoG].

> Let me reconsider left-sided vascular compression; nutcracker syndrome presents with left flank pain, hematuria, and proteinuria and requires duplex ultrasound with Doppler, CT or MR venography, and, if intervention is planned, venography with pressure gradients, so I should keep this in the differential when left flank pain is chronic or recurrent with hematuria or varicocele/pelvic congestion features [^112UhLS7] [^112Qw4t3].

> Hold on, I should verify renal vein thrombosis mimics; calcified RVT can masquerade as a calculus on ultrasound or noncontrast CT, so if the morphology is atypical or the clinical course is discordant, I should escalate to contrast-enhanced CT or CT venography to avoid inappropriate lithotripsy and to secure the correct diagnosis [^115d6kGs] [^114Ey9Zb].

> I will now examine splenic causes of left flank pain; splenic infarction often presents with left upper quadrant or flank pain and may be the sentinel manifestation of hematologic disease, and contrast-enhanced CT is far more sensitive than ultrasound for detection, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with pain out of proportion and risk factors [^114sbL8g] [^1112TMbw].

> Let me think about gastrointestinal mimics; pancreatitis can rarely present with isolated left flank pain, and early CT is not routinely indicated unless the diagnosis is unclear or the patient fails to improve, so I should rely on lipase and clinical evolution first and reserve CT for unresolved cases or complications [^111nkKSU] [^116RsY8r].

> I should confirm musculoskeletal contributors; twelfth rib syndrome can cause persistent focal left flank pain and is diagnosed by localized tenderness and response to trigger-point injection, so when standard evaluations are unrevealing, a targeted exam and trial injection can be both diagnostic and therapeutic [^1139tidE].

> Next, I should review trauma-related considerations; in stable patients with concerning mechanism or exam, IV contrast-enhanced CT is indicated to evaluate for renal injury, and I must remember Page kidney from subcapsular hematoma causing flank pain and secondary hypertension, which CT readily detects and which changes management toward observation or decompression depending on severity [^112iRJri] [^116V2XXA].

> I need to check for rare but critical mimics; incarcerated lumbar hernia can present with sudden severe left flank pain and a tender mass, and CT delineates herniated bowel and obstruction, prompting urgent surgical consultation, so I should palpate the flank carefully and image promptly when suspected [^115KHZNn].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway; start with urinalysis and core labs, apply the STONE score or similar clinical prediction to stratify stone probability, use ultrasound first in low-risk, pregnant, or recurrent presentations, and escalate to noncontrast CT when ultrasound is nondiagnostic, red flags are present, or intervention is anticipated, while maintaining vigilance for alternative diagnoses throughout [^115Esah5] [^114sk6Tz] [^113pnxG3].

> Hold on, I should verify quality and safety levers; unnecessary CT in young patients with recurrent uncomplicated colic exposes patients to radiation without improving outcomes, so embedding decision rules, POCUS protocols, and feedback on CT utilization can safely reduce imaging while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and patient safety [^113pnxG3] [^1176hw5S] [^113TbXJr].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation reflects the reasoning for imaging choice, radiation risk discussion when applicable, and follow-up plan, because clear communication and alignment with guideline-based care reduce harm, improve efficiency, and close the loop on diagnostic uncertainty in left flank pain presentations [^113TbXJr].

For left flank pain, start with **urinalysis and CBC** to screen for infection, hematuria, and inflammation [^113BGCaZ]. If a stone is suspected, **non-contrast CT** is the gold standard for diagnosis and alternative findings [^114sk6Tz] [^116kqVkn]; use ultrasound first in pregnancy or children to avoid radiation [^114eahRc]. Consider contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for vascular or soft-tissue causes (e.g. Nutcracker syndrome, renal infarction, tumor) [^113EvwKa] [^112UhLS7]. Use clinical judgment to guide further testing (e.g. lipase, ECG, D-dimer) based on history and exam [^114vc3RD].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

History should document onset, duration, character, radiation, associated symptoms (fever, nausea, hematuria, dysuria), trauma, and relevant medical history (stones, hypertension, malignancy, recent infections) [^114LkTft]. The **physical examination** should include vital signs, abdominal and flank tenderness, CVA tenderness, and signs of peritoneal irritation or a palpable mass [^114LkTft].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

| **Test** | **Indication** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Urinalysis | - All patients <br/> - Screens for hematuria, infection, proteinuria | - Hematuria suggests **stones or renal pathology** <br/> - Pyuria suggests **infection** <br/> - Proteinuria suggests **renal disease** |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Suspected infection or inflammation | Leukocytosis suggests infection or inflammation |
| Serum chemistry (BMP/CMP) | Renal function, electrolytes | - Elevated creatinine suggests renal impairment <br/> - Electrolyte abnormalities may indicate renal disease |
| Serum amylase/lipase | Suspected pancreatitis | Elevated levels suggest pancreatitis |
| Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) | Suspected renal infarction or ischemia | Elevated LDH suggests renal infarction or ischemia |
| D-dimer | Suspected thromboembolism | Elevated D-dimer suggests thromboembolism |

---

## Imaging modalities

### First-line imaging

- **Non-contrast CT (NCCT)**: Gold standard for suspected nephrolithiasis; high sensitivity/specificity, detects alternative diagnoses [^116kqVkn].

- **Ultrasound (US)**: First-line in pregnancy, children, and patients with contraindications to radiation; evaluates hydronephrosis, renal size, and vascular flow [^114eahRc] [^111kMaDx].

---

### Second-line imaging

- **Contrast-enhanced CT**: For suspected vascular, infectious, or neoplastic causes; evaluates renal arteries/veins, tumors, and abscesses [^113EvwKa].

- **MRI**: Alternative to CT for soft-tissue characterization, vascular anomalies, and when radiation/contrast is contraindicated [^1127p2xX].

- **Plain radiography (KUB)**: Limited role; may detect large radio-opaque stones but misses radiolucent stones [^115UeTak].

---

## Specialized tests

Specialized tests include **Doppler ultrasound** to evaluate renal vein compression (nutcracker syndrome) and vascular anomalies [^112UhLS7], and **CT angiography** to assess renal artery stenosis, aneurysm, or dissection [^notfound]. Nuclear medicine studies such as renal scintigraphy can assess renal function and obstruction when other modalities are inconclusive [^113e37tN].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Renal causes**: Nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, renal infarction, renal vein thrombosis, nutcracker syndrome, renal tumor, polycystic kidney disease [^116kqVkn].

- **Non-renal causes**: Pancreatitis, splenic infarction, musculoskeletal pain, gastrointestinal causes (diverticulitis, constipation), gynecological causes (ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy) [^116kqVkn].

---

## Clinical decision-making

Use **clinical judgment** to integrate history, exam, and initial tests to guide imaging and further workup [^114vc3RD]. Apply a **stepwise approach**, starting with less invasive tests (urinalysis, ultrasound) and escalating to CT/MRI as needed [^11361VUE]. Tailor testing to **patient-specific factors** — including age, pregnancy, comorbidities, and radiation risk [^114eahRc].

---

## Conclusion

A structured approach to left flank pain begins with **urinalysis and CBC**, followed by **imaging** (ultrasound or non-contrast CT) based on clinical suspicion and patient factors. Escalate to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI for vascular, infectious, or neoplastic causes, and use specialized tests when indicated.

### Controversies in treating nutcracker syndrome [^112w2V7W]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a rare vascular disorder that involves the compression of the left renal vein (LRV), usually between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. It may lead to specific symptoms, including hematuria and flank pain, which can significantly affect a patient's quality of life. In male patients, a varicocele may be noted, whereas in females, pelvic congestion syndrome could be a possible manifestation.

Although NCS is a well-recognized medical condition, diagnosis and treatment remain debatable due to the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, and emerging innovative treatment modalities. One of the primary challenges in the management of NCS is the absence of a universally accepted diagnostic algorithm, resulting in variability of diagnostic criteria, leading to inconsistencies in patient evaluation. Another key controversy lies in determining the most appropriate treatment approach. While conservative management is generally preferred in the pediatric population, invasive treatments, including surgical and endovascular interventions, are considered for more severe cases. However, these interventions present challenges, including procedural risks, long-term complications, and uncertainty regarding material durability, particularly in younger patients. Emerging technologies, such as 3D-printed stents, hold promises for personalized treatment, yet their clinical application remains under investigation.

In terms of persistent uncertainties regarding NCS diagnosis and treatment, this brief communication aims to highlight and summarize the most important controversies in managing anterior NCS. The overview of current controversies underscores the necessity for standardized diagnostic guidelines, a multidisciplinary approach, and further research to optimize treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.

### Imaging of flank pain: readdressing state-of-the-art [^1167C6W1]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pain resulting from renal and ureteral stones is a common cause for patients presenting in the acute setting. Since the late 1990s, computed tomography (CT) has been the initial imaging method of choice to evaluate patients with suspected ureteral stones; however, concerns regarding both radiation dose and cost-effectiveness have prompted investigations into a different imaging algorithm. Studies utilizing ultrasound have provided evidence indicating that it may be a more appropriate first step, with selective use of CT in selected cases, in the diagnostic work-up. Techniques have evolved with low-dose CT, dual-energy CT, and magnetic resonance urography emerging as useful in imaging of renal colic patients. This manuscript reviews the current literature on state-of-the-art imaging for acute flank pain and proposes a new imaging algorithm in the evaluation of patients with acute flank pain and suspected ureteral stones.

### What do we miss without contrast in patients with flank pain? [^112cnLoG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Flank pain is a common complaint in the emergency department, and the most frequent cause of flank pain is urolithiasis. Spontaneous renal artery dissection and renal artery thrombosis are rare causes of abdominal pain which can result in renal parenchymal injury. They are mostly difficult to diagnose and treat in the emergency setting. The present report describes 2 patients admitted to the emergency department because of acute flank pain who were diagnosed with renal infarction.

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^1124EhWh]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

### Modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain: review of all imaging modalities [^112Ge6Uv]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common and complex clinical problem which might be caused by a variety of urinary and extraurinary abnormalities among which ureterolithiasis being the most frequent cause. Plain abdominal radiographs combined with intravenous urography (IVU) have been the standard imaging procedures of choice for the evaluation of acute flank pain over the last decades. Direct detection of even small ureteral calculi is achieved in 40–60%, whereas using indirect signs such as ureteral and renal pelvic dilatation stone detection is possible in up to 80–90% of all cases. However, IVU might be hampered by poor quality due to lack of bowel preparation, by nephrotoxicity of contrast agents, by serious allergic and anaphylactic reactions in 10% and 1% of the patients, respectively, and by significant radiation exposure. The use of ultrasonography (US) in the management of acute flank pain has been growing and when combining the findings of pyeloureteral dilatation, direct visualization of stones, and the absence of ureteral ejaculation, the sensitivity to detect ureteral dilatation can be as high as 96%. Recently, unenhanced helical CT (UHCT) has been introduced as imaging modality with a high sensitivity and specificity for the evaluation of acute flank pain. UHCT has been demonstrated to be superior since (1) it detects ureteral stones with a sensitivity and specificity from 98% to 100% regardless of size, location and chemical composition, (2) it identifies extraurinary causes of flank pain in about one third of all patients presenting with acute flank pain, (3) it does not need contrast agent, and (4) it is a time saving imaging technique being performed within 5min. Based on the data published, one can predict that UHCT will become the imaging procedure of choice for evaluation of acute flank pain within the next years. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the role all imaging modalities available for a modern approach of diagnosis and management of acute flank pain with regard to their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and their complications, toxicicty and morbidity.

### A systematic review on nutcracker syndrome and proposed diagnostic algorithm [^112UhLS7]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is an increasingly recognized venous compressive disease. Although people with NCS can experience debilitating symptoms, making an accurate diagnosis can often be challenging owing to the broad spectrum of clinical presentations and radiologic findings. In the present systematic review, we assessed the most frequent clinical and radiologic criteria used in establishing a diagnosis of NCS and have proposed a comprehensive framework for clinical decision-making.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to identify all observational studies or case series conducted within the previous 10 years that had studied patients with a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of NCS. The extracted data included details related to the study design, participant demographics, presenting clinical features, and radiologic criteria. These details were compared between studies and synthesized to establish a comprehensive diagnostic framework that would be applicable to clinical practice.

Results

In the present review, we included 14 studies with a total of 384 patients with NCS. The most common clinical features of NCS were hematuria (69.5%), left flank or abdominal pain (48.4%), pelvic pain (23.1%), and varicocele (15.8%). Computed tomography and ultrasound were the most commonly used imaging modalities, with a threshold for left renal vein stenosis of > 80% the most frequently used diagnostic parameter. Eight studies had used venography, with the renocaval pressure gradient the most commonly measured parameter. Two studies had reported using intravascular ultrasound. The findings from our review have shown that a thorough clinical workup of NCS should include critical evaluation of the presenting clinical features and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. All patients should undergo duplex ultrasound with or without the addition of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Any patient considered for therapeutic intervention should also undergo diagnostic venography with measurement of the renocaval pressure gradient and, if available, intravascular ultrasound with measurement of the left renal vein diameters.

Conclusions

NCS is a challenging condition in terms of the diagnosis and management both. We have proposed a comprehensive diagnostic framework based on the currently available literature to aid in clinical decision-making.

### Alternative diagnoses to stone disease on unenhanced CT to investigate acute flank pain [^1152jgsx]. Emergency Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute flank pain is a common problem in emergency medicine. The most frequent cause is urolithiasis, but many other entities can cause the same clinical presentation. In many institutions unenhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen is used in this setting. One of the major advantages of unenhanced CT is its ability to detect other pathologies causing flank pain. In this pictorial review, we present the CT findings of pathologies other than stone disease in patients with acute flank pain.

### Left flank pain as the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis: a report of a case with an initial misdiagnosis [^116RsY8r]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is not an uncommon disease in an emergency department (ED). It manifests as upper abdominal pain, sometimes with radiation of pain to the back and flank region. Isolated left flank pain being the sole manifestation of acute pancreatitis is very rare and not previously identified in the literature. In this report, we present a case of acute pancreatitis presenting solely with left flank pain. Having negative findings on an ultrasound initially, she was misdiagnosed as having possible "acute pyelonephritis or other renal diseases". A second radiographic evaluation with computed tomography showed pancreatitis in the tail with abnormal fluid collected extending to the left peri-renal space. We performed a literature review and discussed this rare occurrence of acute pancreatitis. We also discussed the clinical pitfalls in this case.

### Does the protocol for suspected renal colic lead to unnecessary radiation exposure of young female patients? [^1123K2H7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Unenhanced multidetector computed tomography (CT KUB) is now firmly established as the best imaging method in the evaluation of suspected acute renal colic, and is replacing intravenous urography at an increasing number of hospitals. The female patient presenting at the emergency department with suspected acute renal colic presents a particular diagnostic problem, as the positive rate for stone disease in female patients is considerably lower compared with male patients. The indiscriminate use of suspected renal colic protocol and CT KUB in all female patients with flank pain should be avoided.

### Flank pain and hematuria is not always a kidney stone [^116kWkn6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with flank pain and hematuria are common emergency department presentations of nephrolithiasis. We may anchor on this etiology and potentially miss other less common differentials. We present a case of a patient with hematuria and flank pain typical of nephrolithiasis who was diagnosed with a Page kidney causing secondary hypertension. A 50 year-old male with no significant past medical history presented to the Emergency Department with severe left-sided flank pain, vomiting, and blood-tinged urine. We pursued a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis and found a left renal subcapsular hematoma on non-contrast CT. A CTA was done with no active hemorrhage found. The patient had no history of recent trauma and was found to be hypertensive on evaluation. Urology was consulted and management for the patient's hypertension was initiated. He was diagnosed with Page Kidney and admitted to medicine for observation and hypertension management with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Page Kidney is a diagnosis that describes compression of the renal parenchyma by a hematoma or mass causing secondary hypertension through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Causes may include traumatic subcapsular hematoma, renal cyst rupture, tumor, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformation, among others. Treatment may involve conservative measures including hypertension management, or more invasive measures like evacuation or nephrectomy. We describe the case of a patient presumed to have nephrolithiasis presenting with typical left-sided flank pain, diagnosed with Page kidney, and treated conservatively.

### Left lower-quadrant pain: guidelines from the American college of radiology appropriateness criteria [^113Y3yaq]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of left lower-quadrant pain includes gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and renal/ureteric pathology. Imaging is helpful in evaluating left lower-quadrant pain, and is generally guided by the clinical presentation. Acute sigmoid diverticulitis should be suspected when the clinical triad of left lower-quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis is present. The severity of disease varies from mild pericolonic and peridiverticular inflammation to severe inflammatory changes with complications such as perforation, peritonitis, or abscess or fistula formation. Computed tomography is the preferred test in evaluating clinically suspected diverticulitis. It is used to evaluate the severity and extent of disease and to identify complications, but it also may diagnose other causes of left lower-quadrant pain that can mimic diverticulitis. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess left lower-quadrant pain. It has superior resolution of soft tissues and does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and requires more time to perform. Transabdominal ultrasonography with graded compression is another effective technique but is limited by its high operator dependency and technical difficulties in scanning patients who are obese. Pelvic ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality in women of childbearing age. Radiography with contrast enema is less sensitive than computed tomography in diagnosing diverticulitis and is seldom used.

### Unenhanced helical CT in the investigation of acute flank pain [^116tBF7J]. Clinical Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT has emerged as the imaging technique of choice for the investigation of patients presenting with acute flank pain and suspected nephroureteric stone disease. There are several signs identifiable on unenhanced CT that support a diagnosis of stone disease. However, there are many pitfalls, that may confound a correct diagnosis. Some of the common pitfalls, together with methods to avoid such occurrences, will be discussed. A review of some of the common alternative diagnoses that may mimic the symptoms of nephroureteric stone disease is illustrated.

### Nutcracker syndrome in children: appearance, diagnostics, and treatment – A systematic review [^114PCBuu]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is defined by compression of the left renal vein (LVR) and may present with a wide variety of symptoms. Due to its rarity in pediatric patients, incidence, diagnostics and performed therapy regimen are widely undefined. To this date, there are only case reports and small collectives of pediatric patients described but comprehensive research is lacking.

Methods

A systematic literature research on pediatric NCS was carried out on Medline and Scopus databases according to PRISMA principles using predefined search terms and inclusion criteria. The PROSPERO registered review (CRD42021237415) identified patients' characteristics regarding age, sex, clinical symptoms, applied diagnostic methods and treatment options.

Results

In total 47 articles were included. Overall, 423 children (218 boys and 205 girls) with diagnosed NCS were included in the analysis. Mean age was 12.0 (boys 12.9, girls 12.0) years. Hematuria was most common presentation (55.5%), followed by proteinuria (49.9%). Classical flank pain was only detected in 19.1% of patients. Sonographic evaluation was the most commonly used diagnostic tool (99%). Invasive diagnostic studies were performed in 97 children. 86.8% patients were treated conservatively and 94.9% showed complete resolution (42.8%) or at least improvement (52.2%) of symptoms. Type of operative treatment comprised of open surgery with transposition of LRV, endovascular stenting and laparoscopy.

Conclusions

Overall, data quality regarding NCS in children is poor. However, conservative approach in pediatric patients is recommended and should be regarded first treatment option. Diagnostic and treatment should follow a defined algorithm when NCS is suspected. Sufficient observation and follow-up must be assured in all patients to get significant results in this heterogenous syndrome.

### An easily missed diagnosis: flank pain and nutcracker syndrome [^116UidCm]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 27-year-old woman presented to her primary care doctor's office with left flank pain. CT of the abdomen showed an isolated left renal vein thrombus. The clot was initially attributed to her oral contraceptive use; however, closer inspection of CT images revealed nutcracker phenomenon (compression of the renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta). Intravascular ultrasound imaging confirmed the diagnosis. Nutcracker syndrome is a rare condition, which if left untreated may cause damage to the left kidney. Although under diagnosed, there are several treatment options available ranging from simple surveillance to surgical resolution.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: management of acute pancreatitis [^111nkKSU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) — diagnostic criteria and early CT use: Diagnosis is most often established by identification of 2 of the 3 criteria — abdominal pain consistent with the disease, serum amylase and/or lipase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or characteristic findings from abdominal imaging. Patients with AP typically present with epigastric or left upper quadrant pain that is usually constant with radiation to the back, chest, or flanks, whereas pain described as dull, colicky, or located in the lower abdominal region is not consistent with AP and suggests an alternative etiology. Abdominal imaging is often helpful to determine the diagnosis of AP in patients with atypical presentations. Due to limitations on sensitivity and negative predictive value, serum amylase alone cannot be used reliably for the diagnosis of AP, and serum lipase is preferred. Regarding early imaging, "We suggest that early at/admission routine computed tomography (CT) not be performed for the purpose of determining severity in AP and should be reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically within the first 48–72 hours after hospital admission and intravenous hydration".

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute onset flank pain-suspicion of stone disease (urolithiasis) [^114eahRc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Noncontrast CT (NCCT) is the imaging study of choice for initial evaluation of patients with acute onset of flank pain and suspicion of stone disease without known prior stone disease. NCCT can reliably characterize the location and size of an offending ureteral calculus, identify complications, and diagnose alternative etiologies of abdominal pain. Although less sensitive in the detection of stones, ultrasound may have a role in evaluating for signs of obstruction. Radiography potentially has a role, although has been shown to be less sensitive than NCCT. For patients with known disease and recurrent symptoms of urolithiasis, NCCT remains the test of choice for evaluation. In pregnancy, given radiation concerns, ultrasound is recommended as the initial modality of choice with potential role for noncontrast MRI. In scenarios where stone disease suspected and initial NCCT is inconclusive, contrast-enhanced imaging, either with MRI or CT/CT urogram may be appropriate. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Urolithiasis in children: medical approach [^116GDzSP]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

The classic adult presentation of acute, severe flank pain, which radiates to the groin is uncommon in children, particularly in children younger than 5 years. Although adolescents present similarly to adult patients, younger children have varied presentations including nonspecific pain localized to the abdomen, flank, or pelvis. In infants, symptoms of stones may be confused with colic pain. Macroscopic or microscopic hematuria can occur in up to 90% of children with urolithiasis. Ureteral stones are much more likely to cause obstruction that leads to pain. Renal stones may be found incidentally and remain present for years without causing symptoms. Approximately 10% of calculi can present with dysuria and urinary frequency and are usually localized to the lower urinary tract. UTI may also complicate nephrolithiasis, although pyuria may also be present without bacteriuria or infection. Rarely, a urethral stone can present with acute urinary obstruction.

### Pulmonary embolism presenting as flank pain: a case series [^115TV4Jx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially fatal disease that can be effectively treated once diagnosed. Due to insidious and often cryptogenic presentations, the diagnosis of this disease can easily elude clinicians. Over the last several years the use of computed tomography (CT) scanning has improved the clinician's ability to diagnose PE. In addition, the widespread use of CT to investigate other complaints such as flank and abdominal pain could theoretically result in radiographic findings not previously identified that could point to the diagnosis of PE. The current case series reveals the unexpected and initially unrecognized CT finding of a pulmonary infarct in two patients presenting with flank pain; a third patient presented with flank pain and was also found to have a PE.

Objective

We describe three cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain who were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.

Case Reports

The cases reported here discuss patients who presented with flank pain and were ultimately diagnosed with PE. In the first two cases, the patients had incidental findings of pulmonary infiltrates on abdominal CT scans, which prompted further diagnostic investigation. In the third case, the patient had risk factors for PE and presented with flank pain and the diagnosis was quickly made by CT imaging.

Conclusion

Physicians should consider pulmonary embolism in the differential diagnosis of patients with isolated flank pain. Additionally, unexpected pulmonary findings on abdominal CT scans may help suggest the diagnosis of PE in the appropriate clinical setting.

### Unusual solution to abdominal pain with contrast enhanced ultrasound [^1112TMbw]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Splenic infarction might be the symptom onset of an important underlying disease. The possibility of splenic infarction must be inserted into differential diagnosis in all those patients who have pain in the upper left quadrant and/or on the left flank. When faced with a case of splenic infarction in a patient who has flown or climbed to high altitudes, it is appropriate to consider the possibility of an haemoglobinopathy. The diagnosis is far from being obvious for emergency physicians. For these reasons, it is very important to proceed as a multidisciplinary team with appropriate diagnostic examinations. The European Guidelines for non-hepatic applications of contrast enhanced ultrasound suggest the usage of this tool for investigation of suspected ischaemic lesions of the spleen.

### Treatment rationale in nutcracker syndrome with concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome [^113zj7CA]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) refers to a symptomatic compression of the left renal vein (LRV) as it passes either between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the aorta ("classic" or "anterior nutcracker") or posteriorly between the aorta and the spine as an anatomical variant ("posterior nutcracker"). Patients typically exhibit left flank pain, hematuria and proteinuria and may develop secondary gonadal vein insufficiency as a result of collateral formation. The term "nutcracker syndrome" should be limited to symptomatic patients since a physiological tapering of the left renal vein in its aortomesenteric portion can be frequently observed in asymptomatic and, in particular, slender patients. This imaging finding is commonly referred to as "nutcracker phenomenon". NCS poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the non-specific nature of symptoms, a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria and uncertainties regarding optimal treatment. In this article, we describe our therapeutic approach for patients with suspected NCS exemplified by four illustrative cases, with a focus on concurrent pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).

### Chronic back pain: recognising twelfth rib syndrome [^1139tidE]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Chronic back pain is commonly attributed to musculoskeletal or spinal issues, but rarer conditions like twelfth rib syndrome can often be overlooked, leading to ineffective treatments. This case presents a male in his 50s with persistent left-sided flank pain, initially attributed to low back pain and degenerative disc disease. Despite conservative treatments, his symptoms persisted, prompting further investigation. A physical examination revealed localised tenderness over the twelfth rib, and a trigger-point injection provided immediate pain relief, confirming the diagnosis of twelfth rib syndrome. Differential diagnoses, including musculoskeletal pain, slipping rib syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, pleuritis, renal pathology and costochondritis, were considered but ruled out. The patient's treatment involved trigger-point injections and physical therapy, resulting in significant symptom improvement. This case emphasises the importance of considering twelfth rib syndrome in patients with unexplained flank pain, especially when standard treatments fail and highlights the role of targeted interventions in improving patient outcomes.

### CT for the evaluation of flank pain [^1157qAsw]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

Unenhanced helical CT allows rapid and accurate determination of whether a stone is present anywhere in the urinary tract. There is a learning curve for both radiologist and urologist, but a number of signs are highly predictive of stone. Helical CT scans should always be accompanied by a "scoutogram" to convey an idea of what the stone might look like. The scan requires no contrast medium and takes only 5 to 10 minutes of imaging time, making it cost effective. It behooves both urologists and radiologists to familiarize themselves with the techniques for reading these scans.

### Emergency department visits, use of imaging, and drugs for urolithiasis have increased in the United States [^111FWqw6]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The reasons for the increased use of advanced radiologic evaluations in the ED for urolithiasis patients are unclear and cannot be determined from the study database. They may include increased sensitivity and specificity of CT evaluation for urolithiasis, pressures related to fear of medical malpractice claims, and patient demand. Physician time pressures, increased reliance on technology, and use of radiologic techniques as default measures for consultation gateways and admission decisions may constitute incentives to lower the threshold for use of such tests. Although CT evaluation can locate a stone and assess hydronephrosis, the clinical decision-making for a urolithiasis patient, especially a recurrent stone former, in the absence of radiologic assessment is often straightforward. After evaluation of flank pain by physical examination and exclusion of other causes of abdominal pain, urinalysis can suggest infection, and hydration and provision of analgesics can be instituted. This is especially true in patients with a history of urolithiasis. If a stone is not passed during a follow-up observation period, radiologic assessment can then proceed, perhaps with an ultrasound. The proper balance between traditional physical examination and use of advanced radiologic techniques in patients with suspected urolithiasis is uncertain, in part, because of the lack of evidence and practice guidelines to inform clinical approaches for such patients.

### Use of diagnostic testing in the emergency department for patients presenting with non-traumatic abdominal pain [^113BGCaZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to measure the utilization and diagnostic value of tests used in the Emergency Department (ED) on patients with undifferentiated non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain. Specific goals were to measure how often these tests led to changes in diagnosis or disposition, which tests were most commonly used, and which tests providers considered most helpful. We conducted a pilot single-center, prospective descriptive study, enrolling all eligible adult patients who presented to our ED with non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain during defined hours of our intake period. Based on serial provider interviews pre- and post-testing, we measured the frequency of change of most likely diagnosis and disposition, which tests were performed, and the provider-perceived value of tests. We enrolled 124 subjects with a mean age of 44 years; 27% were admitted. Testing led to a change in most likely diagnosis in 37% of subjects, and in disposition in 41%. Frequency of diagnostic test use varied from a high of 93% for CBC to 6% for a blood or urine culture. Overall, 65% of patients had at least one imaging study performed, and 39% had an abdominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan. Over all subjects, providers identified the most useful tests as the CT scan (31%) and urinalysis (17%). In conclusion, among ED patients who presented with non-traumatic abdominal or flank pain to one academic center, the pre-test most likely diagnosis and disposition were changed based on the ED evaluation in over one-third of subjects. Almost all received blood tests and two-thirds received one or more imaging studies. Based on providers' subjective opinions, the most valuable tests were the abdomino/pelvic CT scan and the urinalysis.

### Present-day imaging of patients with renal colic [^112rWafe]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

In the past decade alternatives to urography have been proposed for the study of patients with renal colic. In 1992 it was suggested to replace urography with KUB and ultrasonography. In 1993 the combination of KUB and ultrasonography followed by urography in unresolved cases was proposed and, in 1995, it was suggested to replace urography with unenhanced helical CT (UHCT). This article illustrates the contribution of UHCT to the study of patients with renal colic and analyses advantages and shortcomings of the technique compared with other diagnostic approaches. Diagnostics of the patient with renal colic is based on the detection of direct and indirect signs which allow identification of not only the calculus, with a sensitivity of 94–100% and accuracy of 93–98% according different authors, but also other signs that can serve to guide patient management and evaluate long-term prognosis. Unenhanced helical CT has the capability to detect extraurinary abnormalities which present with flank pain and mimic renal colic. The examination technique affects the quality of the images and therefore diagnostic accuracy as well as the dose to the patient. With regard to setting parameters, the choice of thickness and table feed should be guided by numerous factors. Multiplanar reconstruction is indicated in the study of the entire ureter course to identify the exact site of the calcification for the urologist to perform an evaluation similar to that obtained by urography. Many authors consider UHCT to be a valuable tool for suggesting the best therapeutic approach. Among these there are also urologists. The evaluation is based on the stone detection, its size and level in the urinary tract. Cost analysis shows that the cost of UHCT is equal to or inferior to the cost of urography. With regard to the dose, different data are reported in the literature. A high pitch (more than 1.5) and a thin collimation (3-mm thickness) are good compromise between quality and dose which can be compared to the dose of normal urography. What is to be done if helical CT is not available? If helical CT is not available, plain film plus ultrasonography should be considered. This approach does not solve all the cases; in unresolved cases urography is indicated. It should also be noted that US has a good sensitivity in detecting other conditions such as biliary lithiasis, acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis and abdomino-pelvic masses which are responsible for pain that mimics renal colic. In conclusion, IVU should not have any more the priority in investigating the patients with renal colic. Helical CT should be the first choice in imaging a patient with renal colic. If this technique is not available, plain film and ultrasonography should be considered adding urography in unresolved cases.

### Derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for uncomplicated ureteral stone – the STONE score: retrospective and prospective observational cohort studies [^115Esah5]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Kidney stones are estimated to occur at some point in nearly 1 in 11 people in the United States, with flank or kidney pain resulting in over two million annual visits to the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) has been described as the "best imaging study to confirm the diagnosis of a urinary stone" and is now the first line imaging study for suspected kidney stone in the United States. Though accurate, CT is costly, involves the use of ionizing radiation, and does not seem to have impacted patient centered outcomes, such as rates of diagnosis or hospital admission, in those with suspected kidney stones.

Many patients with flank pain will not benefit from a CT scan, as most kidney stones will pass spontaneously. Moreover, it is unlikely that a CT scan in the setting of flank pain will detect acutely important alternative findings in patients without signs of infection. Hence an objective clinical prediction rule for renal colic that could reliably identify patients highly likely to have a ureteral stone (and thus unlikely to have an important alternative diagnosis) may allow patients to be safely managed without imaging, or imaged with other approaches such as ultrasonography or reduced dose CT.

We derived and validated a clinical prediction score for ureteral stones that cause symptoms, identifying patients with either a very high or a very low probability of having an uncomplicated ureteral stone. We hypothesized that patients who are highly likely to have a kidney stone are unlikely to harbor an important alternative diagnosis, and may be appropriate for imaging choices other than standard dose CT.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^11361VUE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

What are the optimal methods in diagnosing IAI that balances benefits and risks?

Statement 2

Early clinical evaluation is essential for diagnosing IAIs. It helps to optimize diagnostic testing and can result in earlier implementation of a proper management plan (Recommendation 1C).

Statement 3

A step-up approach for diagnosis should be used and tailored to the clinical setting, resources, patient's age beginning with clinical and laboratory examination and progressing to imaging examinations (Recommendation 1C).

Diagnosis of complicated IAIs is mainly clinical. Early detection and treatment is essential to minimize complications of IAIs.

Patients with IAIs typically present with rapid-onset abdominal pain and signs of local and systemic inflammation (pain, tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and/or tachypnea). Hypotension and hypoperfusion signs such as oliguria, acute alteration of mental status, and lactic acidosis are indicative of ongoing organ failure.

Physical evaluation may limit the differential diagnosis to direct decisions regarding a proper management plan including the need for appropriate diagnostic testing, the need for initiation of antimicrobial therapy, and whether emergent intervention is required.

The value of physical findings in the diagnostic work-up for IAIs has been studied in relation to acute appendicitis where signs and symptoms are helpful in diagnosing or excluding appendicitis.

The presence of a positive psoas sign, fever, or migratory pain to the right lower quadrant suggests an increased likelihood of appendicitis. Conversely, the presence of vomiting before pain makes appendicitis unlikely.

Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) have been used over the last two decades to complete the clinical assessment of patients with IAIs. Although CT has higher sensitivity and specificity, concerns about radiation exposure have recently prompted reappraisal of the roles of sonography including performance by surgeons.

### Renal mass and localized renal cancer: evaluation, management, and follow-up: AUA guideline: part I [^111tsYBA]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Presentation and diagnosis of RCC — symptom patterns, incidental detection, and examination findings are characterized: The "classic triad" of symptoms associated with a malignant renal mass includes hematuria, flank pain and abdominal mass, and these symptoms are uncommon in clinically localized disease; in fact, less than 5 percent of patients in contemporary series present with these symptoms and greater than 50 percent of renal masses are diagnosed incidentally during an evaluation for unrelated signs or symptoms; physical examination has a limited role in the diagnosis of clinically localized disease, while paraneoplastic syndromes (i.e., hypertension, polycythemia, hypercalcemia) are present in approximately 10–20 percent of patients with metastatic RCC.

### A 47-year-old woman with left shoulder pain [^116EaSSY]. NEJM Evidence (2025). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 47-year-old woman who presented with pain in the left shoulder, fevers, and fatigue. Through a structured clinical approach, including targeted history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges, and the differential diagnosis is refined. As the clinical course progresses, additional investigations provide key insights, leading to the final diagnosis.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a complicated febrile urinary tract infection detected by point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^114mM6SD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) include a spectrum of pathologies from uncomplicated pyelonephritis to urosepsis, including xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Most febrile UTIs are treated with antibiotics alone, but studies indicate nearly 12% of cases of presumed simple pyelonephritis require emergent urologic intervention. How to identify these individuals, while limiting unnecessary advanced imaging and delays in diagnosis, challenges all emergency providers. We review the diagnosis and management of XGP, as well as the evidence regarding the role of renal ultrasound in the identification of complicated presentations of febrile UTIs.

Case Report

We present a case of XGP, a complicated febrile UTI requiring immediate urologic intervention, diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound. A 40-year-old female presented in severe sepsis and complaining of flank pain. Prompt bedside ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrosis, expediting definitive urologic treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With a mortality rate exceeding 40%, obstructed pyonephrosis requires prompt decompression. Given its exceptional sensitivity for identifying hydronephrosis and ability to detect abscesses and emphysematous changes, we advocate a point-of-care ultrasound-first approach to screen for cases of complicated febrile UTIs in order to expedite treatment and limit radiation in uncomplicated presentations.

### Considerations in the diagnosis and therapy for acute loin pain [^114YoNX8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and flank pain in combination with acute elevation of blood pressure should raise high suspicion of renal infarction. However, because of its nonspecific presentation, diagnosis may be delayed. We report the case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a 2-day history of right flank pain that was treated initially as a renal stone. He had a background history of atrial fibrillation. Further investigations confirmed this as a case of renal infarction. Renal infarction is underdiagnosed because of the similarity of its presentation to other renal pathology. Renal infarction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of loin pain, particularly in a patient with atrial fibrillation.

### A rare case of page kidney in a young man with flank pain [^116V2XXA]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Page kidney is a rare condition in which an external compression of the kidney as a result of a hematoma or mass causes renal ischemia and hypertension. In a patient with flank pain, elevated blood pressure, and recent trauma, this condition should be considered. Since this condition was first described in 1939, more than 100 case reports have surfaced.

Case Report

We describe the case of a 26-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department with flank pain, vomiting, and elevated blood pressure. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed the presence of a perinephric hematoma, and the interventional radiology team was consulted to resolve the Page kidney. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Symptoms seen in Page kidney may be similar to other more common diagnoses encountered in the emergency department. It is important to maintain a high suspicion and order imaging studies as needed, especially in the setting of trauma, or a recent procedure in the vicinity of the renal parenchyma.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^114RNVhw]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of APN is still a challenge. At least in settings such as ours in which patients are referred to the Emergency Room after a few days of empirical treatment, the prevalence of incomplete oligosymptomatic presentations is high.

In a context of high prevalence of abscessed lesions (39.5%), severe kidney involvement coexisted with incomplete presentations. None of the clinical or biochemical markers at presentation allowed discrimination between small simple lesions and multifocal or abscessed ones. Hence imaging techniques were needed to assess the severity of kidney involvement and to plan the antibiotic therapy. The relatively high prevalence of kidney scars at presentation (15.1%), mostly with a silent clinical history, draws attention to the difficulty in diagnosing and preventing long-term sequelae of APN.

Therefore, we believe that two recommendations for clinical practice can be drawn from our experience. First, the differential diagnosis of APN should be considered in all patients presenting at least one suggestive clinical feature (fever, flank pain, lower UTI symptoms) accompanied by high inflammatory markers. Second, second-line imaging tests (MRI or CT scans) should be systematically used to define the prevalence and type of parenchymal lesions in order to tailor interventions to the specific clinical contexts.

### Robotic-assisted left adrenal cystic mass excision in a pregnant patient [^111Mqigs]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A symptomatic adrenal mass diagnosed during pregnancy is a rare clinical scenario. Two primary considerations are the timing of intervention and determining the appropriate surgical approach. Here, we present the case of a young female patient with flank pain, whom on diagnostic imaging, was found to have a large cystic adrenal mass. She was taken for a robotic-assisted resection of her left-sided adrenal mass during the second trimester of pregnancy. Preoperative and postoperative assessment demonstrated a viable intrauterine pregnancy. She tolerated the procedure well and was discharged 5days later with resolution of her symptoms on follow-up. As one of only three reported cases of robotic adrenal surgery during pregnancy, we demonstrate that a robotic-assisted surgical approach is a viable and durable surgical option under the given clinical circumstances.

### Modified whitaker test: a novel diagnostic for nephroptosis [^111haufS]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 77-year-old woman presented with right flank pain radiating to the ipsilateral groin and associated nausea, consistent with renal colic. In the emergency department, a non-contrast CT scan revealed severe right-sided hydronephrosis but failed to demonstrate a calculus or ureteropelvic obstruction. The patient improved with fluids and followed up with a community urologist. Initial work-up with cystoscopy and ureteroscopy, voiding cystourethrogram and diuretic renography failed to deduce a diagnosis. At our hospital, we used a modified dynamic (supine and upright) Whitaker test in a novel fashion to diagnose nephroptosis, a rare hypermobility condition of the kidney.

### Left renal vein transposition using autologous gonadal vein graft in patient with combined anterior nutcracker and May-Thurner syndromes [^116gVsAw]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Anterior nutcracker syndrome (ANCS) and May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) are part of a rare group of vascular compression syndromes where extrinsic compression of arteries or veins results in non-specific clinical presentation posing diagnostic and management challenges. We present the case of a female patient in her early 40s with a 3 year history of left flank and pelvic pain, left leg swelling and microscopic haematuria attributed to a rare combination of ANCS and MTS. Compression of the left common iliac vein (MTS) was managed with left common iliac stenting and compression of the left renal vein (LRV; ANCS) was managed surgically with a novel modified technique of LRV transposition using an autologous gonadal vein graft with subsequent resolution of all symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the fourth case presenting the coexistence of the two syndromes in the literature and the first presenting the modified treatment approach.

### Splenic infarction: 10 years of experience [^114sbL8g]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to study the clinical presentation of splenic infarction.

Methods

A retrospective examination of files during a 10-year period was conducted. Only computed tomography-proven diagnoses of splenic infarction were included. Signs, symptoms, medical history, and results of investigation were recorded.

Results

We found 49 episodes of acute splenic infarction. Abdominal or left flank pain was the most common symptoms (80%), and left upper quadrant tenderness was the most common sign (35%). Splenic infarction was the presenting symptom of underlying disease in 16.6% of the patients. Based on the computed tomography results, ultrasound was diagnostic only in 18% of patients. There was no in-hospital mortality or serious complications.

Discussion

We present, to the best of our knowledge, the largest series of patients with splenic infarction diagnosed on clinical and radiological grounds. Awareness of the diagnostic possibility of splenic infarction in a patient with unexplained abdominal pain is important because it can be the presenting symptom of potentially fatal diseases.

### Inferior lumbar triangle hernia with incarceration [^115KHZNn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Lumbar hernia is a rare condition in which intra or extraperitoneal tissue protrudes through a defect in the posterolateral region of the flank. Incarceration is uncommon but represents a surgical emergency when present. A 54-year-old-male presented to the ED after sudden onset left flank pain after coughing. He was in significant distress secondary to pain and vomiting, and his physical exam revealed a tender mass in his left lateral lumbar region near the site of a previous stab wound. Bedside ultrasound revealed a fluid-filled structure, and CT scan demonstrated herniation of small bowel though the inferior lumbar triangle with associated small bowel obstruction. The patient underwent emergent surgical reduction with mesh repair and recovered uneventfully. Incarcerated lumbar hernia represents a rare diagnosis that may not be at the forefront of most practitioners' differential diagnoses. CT scan is useful to distinguish hernia from solid mass, abscess, or other pathology, while bedside ultrasound may prompt an attempt at immediate reduction. The presence of incarcerated bowel or obstruction warrants immediate surgical consultation.

### Sudden onset flank pain: spontaneous renal rupture [^115H9J8J]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Undifferentiated abdominal pain is a common condition encountered in the emergency department. While a patient's age, risk factors, and comorbidities often aid in risk stratification and guide emergency department evaluation, atypical presentations of serious disease may still occur suddenly in young otherwise healthy patients.

Case Report

In this vignette we discuss a case of spontaneous, atraumatic renal rupture with large retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich's Syndrome) in a 22year old male.

Discussion

Emergency physicians regularly encounter uncommon causes of abdominal pain. Wunderlich's syndrome is rare but proper understanding of the disease process will aid in decision making and improve disposition and outcomes for patients. Likely presentations and risk factors for atraumatic renal rupture will be discussed as well as ED management and definitive treatment options.

### Can obstructive urolithiasis be safely excluded on contrast CT? A retrospective analysis of contrast-enhanced and noncontrast CT [^114nwJMM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine if contrast-enhanced CT can safely exclude obstructive urolithiasis in patients with flank plain. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis to compare the negative predictive values of contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CTs for the detection of obstructing urolithiasis.

Methods

Through report analysis, we identified all non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis performed on adult patients in the emergency department at a single, multi-site academic medical institution in 2017 with an indication of flank pain. The prevalence of obstructive urolithiasis in each group was calculated. We subsequently analyzed 200 consecutive studies from each of these groups (reported negative for obstructive urolithiasis) for negative predictive value calculation. Follow up abdominal imaging within 7 days from original presentation was used as a reference standard for analysis.

Results

In the noncontrast group, 1 study out of 200 was false negative (negative predictive value = 99.5%). In the contrast-enhanced group, there were no false negatives (negative predictive value = 100%). The prevalence of obstructive urolithiasis was 44.0% (351/797) in the noncontrast group and 18.7% (86/459) in the contrast-enhanced group.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that contrast-enhanced CT can safely exclude obstructing ureteral calculi in the setting of acute flank pain. This finding is of clinical relevance given the inherent benefit of IV contrast in diagnosing abdominopelvic pathology.

Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) describes the symptomatic compression of the left renal vein (LRV)between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery. The term nutcracker phenomenon is often used for the anatomical finding of LRV compression when there are no clinical symptoms present. Whereas asymptomatic compression is a common radiological finding, patients with NCS can report a range of symptoms. Reduction of venous outflow from the left kidney through the LRV into the inferior vena cava can lead to renovenous hypertension. This in turn can lead to venous collateral development or incompetence and retrograde flowing in the ancillary veins and subsequent secondary affect in the pelvis and/or lower limbs. Other forms of NCS include posterior NCS, in which the retroaortic renal vein may be compressed between aorta and the spine.

Patients with NCS can present with a variety of symptoms, including hematuria, proteinuria, and left flank and pelvic pain.NCS can be challenging to diagnose, owing to the variety of symptoms and because no specific diagnostic criteria have been validated. NCS can often be a diagnosis by exclusion of other causes. Most diagnostic modalities including computed tomography venography, magnetic resonance venography, and duplex ultrasound examination have been described as well as invasive phlebography, venous pressure measurement and intravascular ultrasound examination.

Whereas incidental findings of venous compression are common, conversely the prevalence of NCS is unknown and may be slightly higher in female patients. Interventional treatments of NCS includes both open surgical and endovascular interventions, which can focus on the LRV itself or decompression of the venous outflow from the kidney elsewhere.

The absence of evidence concerning NCS makes it difficult to make recommendations on the diagnostics and management of this condition. Therefore, the objective of this study was to reach a Delphi consensus on the diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up for patients with NCS using an international, multispecialty expert panel. An additional goal was to identify areas where consensus was lacking and focus future clinical research on those fields.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^115d6kGs]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) with flank pain, and hematuria, is often mistaken with renal colic originating from ureteric or renal calculus. Especially in young and otherwise healthy patients, clinicians are easily misled by clinical presentation and calcified RVT.

Case Presentation

A 38-year-old woman presented with flank pain and hematuria suggestive of renal calculus on ultrasound. She underwent extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy that failed, leading to the recommendation that percutaneous lithotomy was necessary to remove the renal calculus. In preoperative view of the unusual shape of the calculus without hydronephrosis, noncontrast computed tomography was taken and demonstrated left ureteric calculus. However computed tomography angiography revealed, to our surprise, a calcified RVT that was initially thought to be a urinary calculus.

Conclusion

This case shows that a calcified RVT might mimic a urinary calculus on conventional ultrasonography and ureteric calculus on noncontrast computed tomography. Subsequent computed tomography angiography disclosed that a calcified RVT caused the imaging findings, thus creating a potentially dangerous clinical pitfall. Hence, it is suggested that the possibility of a RVT needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever one detects an uncommon shape for a urinary calculus.

### How safe are paediatric emergency departments? A national prospective cohort study [^115RzsRx]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

AE severity: < 1 day of symptoms.

System response: ED visit.

Responsible services: ED services.

Diagnostic and management AE (preventable). A 6-year-old boy presented with a limp. He slipped and fell down two steps 7 days earlier but had not complained of pain or had a limp until 2 days ago. He has had no further trauma. Examination revealed the child had difficulty weight bearing on right leg, normal range of motion of hip and knee and tenderness on palpation of distal tibia. He had a mild runny nose and oral temperature of 38.2°C for 1 day. X-ray of his ankle revealed no fracture. He was diagnosed with an ankle sprain and an upper respiratory tract infection. He presented 5 days later, still not weight bearing and with a persistent fever. MRI revealed osteomyelitis of his distal tibia. He was admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics.

AE severity: > 1 day of symptoms.

System response: Repeat ED visit, admission to hospital.

Responsible service: ED services (diagnostic AE, given that he had no pain after his earlier fall and had developed a limp only in the last 2 days, suggesting another aetiology for his pain and tenderness on examination).

Unsafe disposition decision and management AE (preventable). A 15-year-old male patient fell and hit his left flank on ski gate. Ambulance was called, and the patient fainted on standing. Seen in the ED, heart rate was 110 at triage, some mild left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness, no blood pressure was measured. He was discharged home with no investigations and with no reassessment documented. He returned to the ED later that day with increasing pain and dizziness. Ultrasound showed splenic injury. The patient was admitted and observed. He was discharged home in 4 days.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: kidney cancer, version 2.2024 [^1127p2xX]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Kidney cancer initial evaluation and staging — patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) typically present with a suspicious renal mass seen on imaging, and with widespread imaging use, incidental detection has increased and fewer patients present with the typical triad symptoms (hematuria, flank mass, and flank pain); less frequently, presentations reflect metastatic disease with bone pain, adenopathy, and pulmonary symptoms attributable to lung parenchyma or mediastinal metastases, and other presentations include fever, weight loss, anemia, or a varicocele. RCC in younger patients (≤ 46 years) may indicate an inheritable disorder, and these patients should be referred to a hereditary cancer clinic for further evaluation. A thorough physical examination should be performed along with obtaining a complete medical history; laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and the metabolic panel may include serum corrected calcium, serum creatinine, liver function studies, and urinalysis. CT of the abdomen with or without pelvic CT and CT chest (preferred) or chest x-ray are essential studies in the initial workup; abdominal MRI is used to evaluate the inferior vena cava if tumor involvement is suspected, or it can be used instead of CT for detecting renal masses or for staging when contrast material cannot be administered because of allergy or moderate renal insufficiency; all imaging studies should be performed with and without contrast, such as renal protocol.

Materials and methods

Patients

Details of the study protocol have been published elsewhere. We identified consecutive patients presenting with acute abdominal pain for more than 2 h and less than 5 days at the emergency department (ED) of two university and four (large) teaching hospitals. Patients discharged from the ED by the treating physician without any diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, CT or plain radiographs), patients under 18 years, pregnant women, patients with a blunt or penetrating trauma, patients with distinctive flank pain, suspected with renal colic, as well as patients in haemorrhagic shock caused by a gastrointestinal bleeding or acute abdominal aneurysm were not invited. Two of the teaching hospitals included patients from Monday to Friday between 9 am and 5 pm. In all other hospitals, patients were included 7 days a week from 8 am until 11 pm.

Eligible patients were invited to the study after being informed orally about the study by the treating physician. An information brochure was provided to them. Consenting patients were included in the study. This study had been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of participating hospitals before its initiation.

All included patients were clinically evaluated at the ED by the treating physician, usually a surgical or emergency medicine resident, after which the patients underwent a full diagnostic protocol. The treating physician prospectively recorded patients' characteristics and the findings of clinical history and examination in a case record form.

### Localized inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor involving the genitourinary system: adolescent case series and review [^115d35Kw]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

We describe four adolescent cases of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor involving the genitourinary system. Two patients with masses of the urinary bladder presented with gross hematuria. The third patient presented with left flank pain and a mass encasing the left ureter causing hydronephrosis. The fourth patient presented with a painless, growing palpable mass of the left hemiscrotum. Currently, no standards exist for the management of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Herein, we discuss the work-up and treatment approaches taken in each case.

### Recurrent nephrolithiasis associated with atazanavir use [^113R82Vh]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 64-year-old man with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (including atazanavir, a protease inhibitor) presented with left flank pain, nausea and vomiting. A kidney stone was suspected, and a CT scan demonstrated left hydronephrosis but failed to demonstrate nephrolithiasis or extrinsic compression. The patient had a ureteral stent placed which relieved his symptoms. A few months later, he underwent left ureteroscopy and a large ureteral calculus was found. The stone was removed and analysis showed 43% atazanavir and 57% calcium oxalate. Several months later, the patient developed flank pain on the opposite side. A renal ultrasound suggested right-sided nephrolithiasis and he subsequently underwent ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy of two stones. Stone analysis showed that they were composed of 100% atazanavir. This case highlights the fact that patients treated with protease inhibitors remain at risk for developing nephrolithiasis. Ultrasonography can be a useful diagnostic tool in the setting of these radiolucent calculi.

### Recurrent hematuria caused by nutcracker syndrome [^111xE1U5]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of left flank pain, and proteinuria and hematuria were detected during urinalysis. A renal ultrasound did not reveal any disorder, and after performing a computed tomography angiography scan, compression of the left renal vein between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta was seen. This compression is known as Nutcracker syndrome. From among the different treatment options available, it was decided, with patient consensus, to use open surgical management, performing a transposition of the left renal vein to a more distal level in the inferior vena cava. The immediate postoperative care progressed without complications and the symptoms resolved; after 1 year of surveillance, the patient continues to be asymptomatic. Nutcracker syndrome is a rare phenomenon, with few cases described. There are different therapeutic options for the treatment of Nutcracker syndrome, such as open surgery, endovascular treatment, or conservative treatment; because of the low prevalence of this syndrome, there are no sufficiently large series at present or with the necessary long-term surveillance to decide on the most suitable treatment. Distal transposition of the left renal vein in the inferior cava vein has proved to offer good long-term results, and this option offers a higher chance of resolution without the need for as many postsurgery controls as would be required with endovascular treatment.

### Pulmonary sequestration presenting as retroperitoneal cyst: case report [^115161n3]. Journal of Endourology (2005). Low credibility.

A 21-year-old woman presented with flank pain, and an abdominal and pelvic CT scan demonstrated a left 7.4-cm simple cyst superior to the left kidney. She underwent laparoscopic cyst decortication complicated by a diaphragmatic injury and pneumothorax. The final pathology report described a retroperitoneal pulmonary sequestration (RPS). Urologists need to consider RPS in the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal cyst because of the associated morbidity of hemorrhage during surgical excision. With the widespread use abdominal imaging techniques, more cases of RPS are likely to be identified and referred for laparoscopic management.

### The journey and barriers to treatment of patients with renal nutcracker syndrome [^111hoU3E]. Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To better understand renal nutcracker syndrome (NCS) from a patients' perspective starting at presentation and followed through to diagnosis and management METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted on a national level via a self-selected online survey distributed via river sampling by a post on the Facebook Page 'Renal Nutcracker Syndrome Support Group'.
Results

Of the 22 responses collected, 95.5% were female and 91% self-identified as White. 43% experienced symptoms as teenagers and 62% were diagnosed as young adults. Prior to receiving a definitive diagnosis, over half of the respondents were worked up for kidney stones (57%) and ovarian cysts (48%) and saw at least 10–15 providers. Nearly 80% experienced constant pain throughout the day. Pain management included prescription oral pain relievers (38%), prescription patches (29%), and physical therapy (19%). Surgical procedures included nephrectomy with auto transplant (38%), left renal vein transposition (10%), and laparoscopic extravascular stent placement (10%). Respondents had high healthcare utilization for management of NCS. Nearly 30% were unable to work and had filed for disability.

Conclusion

Awareness of NCS should increase among healthcare providers of all specialties to improve quality of care to those living with NCS. It is crucial to keep NCS within the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with gross hematuria and unusual abdominal and/or flank pain.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^113pnxG3]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Urolithiasis is the process of forming stones along the urinary tracts, including the kidney, bladder and urethra. Acute flank pain due to suspected urolithiasis is a common reason for emergency department (ED) visits, accounting for more than 1 million visits in the United States annually. The estimated lifetime incidence of these urinary stones is 12%, they most commonly presents in patients between 30 and 60 years of age, and they are three times more common in men.

Non-contrast abdominopelvic CT has become the most common initial imaging study for suspected urolithiasis due to its high sensitivity for urinary stone disease, which ranges from 91% to 100%. Unlike other imaging modalities such as ultrasonography (US), CT exposes patients to high levels of ionising radiation with consequent long-term cancer risk. It has been estimated that 14 000 additional cancers in the United States may be attributable to unnecessary abdominal and pelvic CT scans. These avoidable scans can also lead to increased false positives and incidental findings, resulting in unnecessary patient anxiety and inappropriate follow-up interventions, further exacerbating the cycle of unnecessary and potentially harmful care. These interventions additionally contribute to increased system-level costs of acute renal colic, which currently amount to over $5 billion annually in the United States. Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that increased CT use, despite its higher sensitivity, is associated with improved patient outcomes.

While ultrasound has lower sensitivities to visualise urinary stones, it is an alternative imaging modality which may be used to investigate renal colic without exposing patients to ionising radiation. Furthermore, ultrasound can accurately detect hydronephrosis, perinephric fluid and abnormal ureteric jets, which increases the sensitivity for detecting kidney stones when they are too small to be visualised directly. As such, the importance of reducing unnecessary CT imaging for presentations of renal colic is recognised at an international level. In support of choosing wisely (CW), the growing international movement to reduce the overuse of unnecessary medical interventions, the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) released 10 recommendations specifically targeting ED interventions. One of these recommendations was to 'avoid ordering CT of the abdomen and pelvis in young, otherwise healthy emergency department patients (age < 50) with known histories of kidney stones, or ureterolithiasis, presenting with symptoms consistent with uncomplicated renal colic'.

### Renal vein thrombosis mimicking urinary calculus: a dilemma of diagnosis [^115qgcxk]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old woman presented to the emergency room in a regional hospital with nausea and left flank pain that had suddenly started 12 h earlier. She had a history of left flank trauma, having fallen from 2-meter- height 5 years earlier. Physical examination revealed no tenderness over the abdomen or flank and normal chest auscultation. Blood analysis was within normal limits, except for leukocytosis (12.7 × 10 9 /L). Routine urine analysis showed microscopic hematuria without white blood cells or proteins. Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged kidney and a 16-mm hyperechoic focus in the left renal pelvis, suggesting a diagnosis of renal calculus. The patient was therefore administered extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy at the regional hospital. A follow-up ultrasound examination 2 weeks later showed that the shape and size of the hyperechoic focus had not changed.

Due to left lower back pain and the persistent left hyperechoic focus in the renal area, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Urine analysis and ultrasound examination showed the same results as in the regional hospital (Fig. 1a). An abdominal plain film showed a left-sided renal calcification (Fig. 2a), but there was no evidence of a palpable tender mass or an audible abdominal bruit. Laboratory data, except for urinalysis results, were within normal limits. Because of the failure of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous lithotomy was recommended.

### Abdominal wall actinomycotic mycetoma involving the bowel: a rare entity [^116pNJHs]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Actinomycotic mycetoma is a disease of the tropical region and usually presents as a chronic, suppurative and deforming granulomatous infection. We present an unusual case of actinomycotic mycetoma of the abdominal wall that was found to infiltrate into the bowel. A 51 year-old man presented with pain and swelling in the left flank of 2-year duration. Even after comprehensive preoperative evaluation with advanced radiological imaging, biochemistry and pathology, the diagnosis could not be arrived at. Histopathological examination of the excised specimen after the surgery guided to the diagnosis of actinomycotic mycetoma, which entirely changed the management in the postoperative period. We propose that mycetoma should be kept as a possible differential diagnosis for anterior abdominal wall swelling in the indicated clinical setting and the investigations be done keeping the same in mind. Otherwise, a lot of valuable time may be lost allowing the disease to progress further.

### Renal autotransplant as a definitive treatment for nutcracker syndrome: a multicenter retrospective study [^111N9hXs]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Multicenter retrospective study
- **Key Findings**: Renal autotransplant for nutcracker syndrome in 105 patients resulted in 93.1% of patients with complete pain relief and a significant decrease in the percentage of patients using opioids from 48.6% to 17.0% at 12 months (P < .001).
- **Take Home Message**: Renal autotransplant for nutcracker syndrome provides durable pain relief and a marked decrease in chronic opioid use.

Millions of Americans are affected by chronic pain. The social, clinical, and psychological aspects of chronic pain can result in loss of work productivity, decreased activities, and a significantly diminished overall quality of life. Despite evidence against the use of long-term opioids, and the considerable potential risk they pose, they are still commonly used in treating chronic pain. Nutcracker syndrome, a rare syndrome with a challenging diagnosis and a large female predilection, causes severe chronic left flank pain. This condition is benign and does not impact kidney function or viability, nor does it impact patient life expectancy. Unfortunately, treatment with prescription opioids in this patient population is alarmingly high with a self-reported prevalence of 67%.

The high prevalence of opioid use in nutcracker syndrome lies in part because it is relatively rare and difficult to diagnose. Nutcracker syndrome is generally considered a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out more common etiologies of flank pain with or without hematuria, such as infection, nephrolithiasis, medical renal disease, and neoplasm. In nutcracker syndrome, compression of the left renal vein as it courses from the kidney to the inferior vena cava can result in venous hypertension and retrograde reflux of the left kidney outflow into the lumbar, gonadal, and ureteric veins. These vascular alterations can then cause the kidney's intraparenchymal thin wall venous sinuses to build with pressure and ultimately create direct communication channels into the renal calices, resulting in hematuria. In addition to hematuria, the syndrome can also manifest a myriad of specific and nonspecific symptoms including, but not limited to, proteinuria, fatigue, headaches, gonadal varices, and, most important, chronic debilitating left flank pain, which is not well-understood.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association / endourological society guideline, PART I [^116edhuh]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) Surgical Management of Stones guideline — CT to guide selection between shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopy (URS): Clinicians may obtain a non-contrast CT scan to help select the best candidate for SWL versus URS; Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level Grade C. The guideline states that neither randomized trials nor comparative studies have addressed preoperative CT for treatment selection between SWL and URS, recognizes that multiple imaging modalities including renal ultrasound (US), intravenous pyelogram/intravenous urogram (IVU), and kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiography may be used to preoperatively assess candidates, and notes that CT can be useful to determine whether SWL or URS is better suited for a given patient. It adds that non-contrast CT is the most sensitive and specific imaging investigation for diagnosing upper urinary tract stone disease, while also highlighting concerns about long-term cancer risks from ionizing radiation that have led to calls for US in the initial diagnosis of acute flank pain and emphasizing clinician awareness of potential risks/harms when selecting imaging tests.

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^112JcdQp]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Spontaneous subcapsular hematoma

Spontaneous subcapsular renal hematoma is a rare entity. Patients may present with back or flank pain, and tenderness. Possible etiologies in children include tumors, vascular diseases, infections, and the use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs, with a small proportion of cases being idiopathic. It has been shown that hypertension is a risk factor in some cases where the etiology cannot be determined. The diagnosis of liquefied or layered hematomas is straightforward with US. However, these lesions may present as heterogeneous subcapsular solid masses, potentially mimicking neoplasms (Fig. 10). The absence of internal vascularity on color Doppler US is an important diagnostic feature for hematoma. In cases of large lesions or diagnostic uncertainty, further imaging is often required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying etiology. In emergency settings, CT is preferred due to its rapid acquisition time, offering high sensitivity — approaching 100% — for hematoma detection. MRI is appropriate for both diagnostic and etiological evaluation in pediatric patients.

### A novel surgical approach to symptomatic left renal vein aneurysm [^114ifsxQ]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Visceral venous aneurysms are uncommon and renal vein aneurysms are among the rarest in this subset. Renal vein aneurysms are frequently asymptomatic, but patients may present with flank pain or hematuria. Complications of untreated visceral venous aneurysms include thrombus formation and, very rarely, rupture. Treatment of renal vein aneurysms ranges from watchful waiting to surgical repair. We describe a patient with renal vein aneurysm presenting with recurrent pulmonary embolus with no other identifiable source. Furthermore, we propose a novel surgical treatment with complete resection of the aneurysm and reconstruction of venous return by transposing the inferior mesenteric vein to the remaining left renal vein.

### Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis with left renal venous infarction after vaginal delivery [^112g8wDz]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A primipara in her late 20s presented with abdominal pain and pain in the left flank 14 days after a ventouse delivery. She was treated with antibiotics, antiemetics and analgesics with the initial differential diagnosis of cystitis, pyelonephritis or nephrolithiasis. Despite the treatment, the patient experienced increased colic pain and nausea. An ultrasound showed an enlarged left kidney, suggesting pyelonephritis, and thereby, the antibiotic treatment was adjusted accordingly. Despite additional pain medication, pain relief could not be achieved. The diagnosis of ovarian venous thrombosis was considered, and an abdominal CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulant therapy. Hypercoagulability work-up revealed a heterozygous mutation of the Factor V Leiden. Our patient awaits a haematologic follow-up.

### Nephron-sparing management of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis presenting as spontaneous renal hemorrhage: a case report and literature review [^1136A5CR]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is an uncommon infectious disease of the kidney known to mimic other renal maladies. A rare presentation of this uncommon disease is spontaneous renal hemorrhage (SRH).

Case presentation

We report a case of XGP in a 58 year old woman who presented with abdominal pain, hematuria, and radiating left flank pain. CT scan was felt to be consistent with perirenal hemorrhage abutting a fat-containing renal mass. The patient was eventually taken to surgery for left partial nephrectomy. Pathology report returned as XGP, and the patient has no complications from this disease process at 8 month follow up.

Conclusion

Our search of the literature shows XGP presenting as SRH to be a rare clinical entity. Furthermore, this is the first such case managed with a nephron-sparing approach. The "great imitator" XGP should be added to the differential for patients presenting with spontaneous renal hemorrhage.

### Modified whitaker test: a novel diagnostic for nephroptosis [^113e37tN]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 77-year-old woman presented to her local emergency department with progressive right flank pain and associated severe nausea of 1.5 days duration. The pain radiated to the right groin and was worsened by movement. Initial vital signs were within normal limits and a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable. An abdominal CT scan demonstrated severe right hydronephrosis of right kidney with perinephric stranding; no dilation of the ureter or urinary calculi was seen. She improved with intravenous hydration and antiemetics and was advised to follow-up with a urologist. One week later, she was seen by a community urologist who performed a technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine diuretic renography scan, which revealed delayed clearance and excretion of radionucleotide without clear evidence of obstruction (post-Lasix T 1/2 = 11 min). A voiding cystourethrogram was also obtained that revealed no vesicoureteral reflux or abnormalities of the lower urinary tract.

### Can renal and bladder ultrasound replace computerized tomography urogram in patients investigated for microscopic hematuria? [^1175PFMw]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

RBUS was shown to detect renal cancer with high sensitivity, although 14 cases had false-positive results. In these false-positive cases a second scan would be done, typically renal protocol CT, which would better characterize the renal mass. Thus, the approach to cystoscopy with RBUS instead of CTU to investigate the upper tract of patients who present with microscopic hematuria should be the preferred upper tract imaging of choice.

We acknowledge that RBUS has poor sensitivity for identifying renal calculi. Therefore, we propose that patients who present with symptoms suggestive of renal colic such as flank pain would benefit from RBUS with noncontrast CT of the kidneys, ureters and bladder or CTU. We acknowledge that replacing CTU with RBUS in patients with microscopic hematuria would potentially miss asymptomatic renal calculi when no hydronephrosis presents with microscopic hematuria. We believe that such patients would be uncommon and identifying them would be at the expense of subjecting a high number to CTU which would yield negative results.

In an ideal world all patients should be investigated with the best diagnostic test available. However, the risk of adverse events, the low disease incidence in the specific patient cohort and the high cost of diagnostic testing suggest that this may not be warranted. Cases of microscopic hematuria have a 0% disease specific incidence of UTUC and are below the 3% threshold for diagnostic investigation used by the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) and the 1% suggested by the AUA. Additionally, while the risk of an adverse reaction to iodinated contrast medium is low, it can be life threatening. The ionizing radiation from CTU is 4 mSv, which is 200 times that of a standard chest x-ray. Also, cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation was shown to account for 0.6% to 0.9% of diagnosed cancers.

### Renal medullary carcinoma: unsuspected diagnosis at stone protocol CT [^112SRgSo]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive neoplasm occurring almost exclusively in adolescents and young adults with sickle cell (SC) hemoglobinopathies, usually sickle cell trait (SCT) or hemoglobin SC disease. The most common presentations are hematuria and flank or abdominal pain. It is a highly malignant tumor, and responses to chemotherapy are rare and transient resulting in a dismal prognosis. A high level of suspicion is necessary when evaluating at risk patients presenting with hematuria or flank pain, as currently it appears that only early diagnosis could potentially alter the outcome of this disease. We report a case of RMC in a young male patient with SCT, who presented to the emergency department with low back pain and microscopic hematuria, clinically mimicking acute obstructing urolithiasis. Our case emphasizes the need to consider alternate diagnoses when evaluating computed tomography scans for acute flank pain.

### Current trends in the diagnosis and management of renal nutcracker syndrome: a review [^112CT8xk]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Nutcracker syndrome is caused by compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery where it passes in the fork formed at the bifurcation of these arteries. The phenomenon results in left renal venous hypertension. The syndrome is manifested by left flank and abdominal pain, with or without unilateral haematuria. Other common presentation is as "pelvic congestion syndrome" characterized by symptoms of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, post-coital ache, lower abdominal pain, dysuria, pelvic, vulvar, gluteal or thigh varices and emotional disturbances. Likewise compression of the left renal vein can cause left renal-to-gonadal vein reflux resulting in lower limb varices and varicoceles in males. Its diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, basic lab tests to exclude other causes of haematuria, cystoscopy and ureteroscopy to confirm unilateral haematuria and exclude other causes of this sinister symptom. Sequence of imaging has more or less been rationalised to USS with Doppler studies, CT or MR angiography and finally phlebography with renal vein and IVC manometery to confirm the diagnosis.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^114vc3RD]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Mimics of renal colic: alternative diagnoses at unenhanced helical CT [^116kqVkn]. Radiographics (2004). Low credibility.

During the past decade, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) has become the standard of reference in the detection of urinary calculi owing to its high sensitivity (> 95%) and specificity (> 98%) in this setting. Numerous diseases may manifest as acute flank pain and mimic urolithiasis. Up to one-third of unenhanced CT examinations performed because of flank pain may reveal unsuspected findings unrelated to stone disease, many of which can help explain the patient's condition. Alternative diagnoses are most commonly related to gynecologic conditions (especially adnexal masses) and nonstone genitourinary disease (eg, pyelonephritis, renal neoplasm), closely followed by gastrointestinal disease (especially appendicitis and diverticulitis). Hepatobiliary, vascular, and musculoskeletal conditions may also be encountered. Vascular causes of acute flank pain must always be considered, since these constitute life-threatening emergencies that may require the intravenous administration of contrast material for diagnosis. Radiologists must be familiar with the typical findings of urinary stone disease at unenhanced CT, as well as the spectrum of alternative diagnoses that may be detected with this modality, to accurately diagnose the source of flank pain.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^1176hw5S]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Despite low uptake during our initiative, the use of validated clinical decision-making tools and algorithms remain a useful resource in helping emergency physicians decide when to employ CT imaging for suspected urolithiasis. Dalziel et al proposed a prospectively validated algorithm for the use of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) for the management of renal colic in the ED. The algorithm uses hydronephrosis found on POCUS as the primary sign to guide the use of CT imaging. Kartal et al found that after using this algorithm, up to 50% of patients with renal colic in the ED could be discharged without further imaging other than US. The STONE score and POCUS are examples of evidence-based interventions to reduce CT use in patients with renal colic.

Our study has several limitations. First, given the nature of retrospective chart reviews, our initial audit is subject to documentation bias. We only included patients based on a discharge diagnosis of renal colic rather than a presenting complaint of flank pain. Emergency physicians may have considered a diagnosis of urolithiasis but an alternative discharge diagnosis may have been input into EDIS (eg, haematuria, back pain). Thus, it is possible that the study may have underestimated the number of patients receiving CT imaging for suspected renal colic. Nonetheless, we believe that our data abstraction methods were robust, as all study variables were defined a priori and a standardised data collection tool was developed. Finally, the generalisability of our study is limited given that this was a single centre audit with a small sample size. Further, practice will vary greatly at different centres based on local culture and awareness of CW initiatives. Despite this, our demographic results suggested a fairly representative patient population. Given previous studies, we expect that other jurisdictions would benefit from similar practice improvements.

### Management of chronic pain in a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease by sequential celiac plexus blockade, radiofrequency ablation, and spinal cord stimulation [^117B3HHK]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic pain frequently is associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and is a significant cause of morbidity. The classic approach to treat pain in patients with this disease starts with nonpharmacologic therapy and progresses to high-dose opioid therapy and more invasive procedures, including surgery. We present the case of a 43-year-old white woman presenting in our clinic with poorly controlled chronic left flank and epigastric pain secondary to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease despite high-dose opioids and multiple cyst decompression procedures. After temporarily successful management with celiac plexus neurolysis and intercostal nerve radiofrequency ablations for years, the next more permanent step was dorsal column neurostimulation, affording excellent analgesia with significantly improved quality of life to this day.

### Unenhanced versus multiphase MDCT in patients with hematuria, flank pain, and a negative ultrasound [^113Ec2Rj]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the impact of unenhanced and contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) for the detection of urinary stones and urinary obstruction in patients with suspected renal colic.

Methods

95 patients with suspected renal colic underwent a three-phase MDCT for evaluation of the urinary tract. The unenhanced scan and the multiphase examination were reviewed retrospectively by two radiologists for the characterization of urinary stones and signs of obstruction. Results of unenhanced MDCT were compared with those obtained during the second review of the entire multiphase examination.

Results

Overall diagnosis of urinary stones revealed an accuracy of 97.0% for unenhanced, and 98.9% for multiphase MDCT with a significant difference between both protocols (mixed-effects logistic regression: odds ratio 3.3; p = 0.019). With 3 versus 15 false positive ratings, multiphase MDCT was superior to unenhanced MDCT for the diagnosis of urinary stones. There was no significant difference in detecting signs of obstruction. Inter-reader agreement for overall stone detection was excellent on both unenhanced (kappa 0.84) and multiphase (kappa 0.88) MDCT.

Conclusion

Contrast-enhanced multiphase MDCT offers distinct advantages compared to an unenhanced approach for the assessment of urinary stone disease, and therefore should be considered as a complementary examination for patients with inconclusive findings.

### Nephron-sparing management of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis presenting as spontaneous renal hemorrhage: a case report and literature review [^1134tcXv]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is an uncommon infectious disease of the kidney known to mimic other renal maladies. A rare presentation of this uncommon disease is spontaneous renal hemorrhage (SRH).

Case Presentation

We report a case of XGP in a 58 year old woman who presented with abdominal pain, hematuria, and radiating left flank pain. CT scan was felt to be consistent with perirenal hemorrhage abutting a fat-containing renal mass. The patient was eventually taken to surgery for left partial nephrectomy. Pathology report returned as XGP, and the patient has no complications from this disease process at 8 month follow up.

Conclusion

Our search of the literature shows XGP presenting as SRH to be a rare clinical entity. Furthermore, this is the first such case managed with a nephron-sparing approach. The "great imitator" XGP should be added to the differential for patients presenting with spontaneous renal hemorrhage.

### Role of imaging in visceral vascular emergencies [^113EvwKa]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal vasculature

Kidneys are highly vascular organs and receive 20% of the cardiac output via bilateral renal arteries. US and CT are the two most commonly used imaging modalities for assessing the renal vasculature. Protocoling is essential for detecting vascular abnormalities and CT provides high temporal and spatial resolution with less demand for patient compliance as compared to US. Several emergent situations affecting the renal vasculature may be quickly assessed with CT.

Renal artery embolism

Embolic disease of the renal arteries is a rare clinical situation. The heart appears to be the most common source of embolism with atrial fibrillation, valvular diseases, and myocardial infarction among the common predisposing situations. Renal arteries are the least commonly affected arterial structure with arterial thrombosis. In a series of 621 patients with peripheral arterial embolism, the renal arteries were affected in only 2% of these patients. Acute flank pain with associated hematuria, nausea, vomiting, and hypertension are the common presenting symptoms. Serum lactate dehydrogenase elevation in the serum is reported to be the most sensitive biomarker for renal infarction.

CT plays an important role in diagnosing this rare acute clinical situation. Proper timing is important as renal arteries are much better appreciated on arterial phase images. Coronal and sagittally reformatted images may be extremely helpful, in addition axial plane images, for detecting the endoluminal filling defects (Fig. 11). Venous and nephrogram phase images should also be included in clinically suspected cases to detect associated renal infarcts. The typical appearance of renal infarction on post-contrast CT is single or multiple foci of non-enhancement areas in the corticomedullary region. These infarcted areas are typically wedge-shaped with extension to the renal capsule. In patients with total occlusion of the main renal artery, the whole kidney may appear as a completely non-enhancing organ with only capsular enhancements due to collateral capsular circulation. This capsular enhancement is also known as the "cortical rim" sign.

### Appropriate use of CT for patients presenting with suspected renal colic: a quality improvement study [^115TQTBA]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our initial audit found that 27% of patients under the age of 50 years presenting with uncomplicated, recurrent renal colic received CT imaging, suggesting non-adherence with an ACEP CW recommendation. Importantly, none of the patients who received CT imaging during our audit period demonstrated significant findings warranting hospital admission or leading to identifiable changes in management plans in the ED. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients referred to outpatient urology in either study group.

Our patient demographics and presenting complaints are similar to those reported in the literature, suggesting that our study population represented typical patients presenting to the ED with renal colic. Our audit did not have the statistical power to perform meaningful subgroup analyses, however, certain trends were noted. Patients who had presented to an ED with renal colic or flank pain in the last 30 days were less likely to undergo CT imaging during their second presentation. Presumably, on their initial visit, many of these patients had received imaging which was able to identify a stone, and were thus less likely to receive CT imaging at their return visit. It was also noted that the patient group that received CT imaging was given more narcotic analgesia, suggesting that the perceived severity of a patient's pain may have also influenced the decision to order CT imaging.

### Progress in the use of helical CT for imaging urinary calculi [^113stMui]. Journal of Endourology (2004). Low credibility.

Helical CT has become the preferred method to diagnose urinary calculi in patients presenting with abdominal or flank pain. Recent in vitro studies have shown that CT also can display the internal structure in stones with remarkable detail. Because some stones respond better to SWL than others, knowing stone structure at diagnosis could be helpful in choosing among treatment options. This paper examines the potential for CT to be used in this way. Older CT technology proved to be problematic, in that all studies using low-resolution CT will suffer from an artifact in which stone size affects apparent CT attenuation values. Thus, the observation that stones with low measured CT attenuation break more easily than stones with high attenuation could be attributable entirely to an artifact of stone size. Most stones are composed of more than one mineral, and heterogeneity of composition may contribute to variability in stone response to SWL. Older technology is not useful in evaluating stone composition, but current and emerging CT machines have sufficient resolution to determine the composition and structure of stones inside the patient, provided proper viewing windows are used. Continuing improvement in image resolution in helical CT promises to provide information about stone composition and structure that will ultimately lead to better care for patients with stone disease.

### Abnormal left kidney in a patient with acute flank pain… [^114Ey9Zb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

History A 40-year-old man had crampy pain in the left flank. This pain had an acute onset the previous evening, and the patient was afebrile. The left side of the abdomen was tender to deep palpation, but there was no rebound tenderness or palpable mass. Urinalysis demonstrated proteinuria without hematuria, bacteriuria, or pyuria. Figure 1 shows a 30-minute delayed roentgenogram from the excretory urogram. There were no abnormal calcifications on the scout roentgenogram. The left kidney now measures 1 cm longer than on a previous urogram four months earlier. The size of the right kidney is unchanged. Diagnosis. Left renal vein thrombosis. Comment This urogram demonstrates extremely poor visualization of the left pelvocalyceal system and left ureter, indicating diminished function. This, combined with the fact that the left kidney has enlarged since the earlier examination, should strongly suggest renal vein thrombosis. The definitive study is selective renal phlebography: 75–76.
