## Question

How does GFR change in kidney failure during dialysis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) changes in kidney failure once dialysis begins, and what that means clinically and for outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline residual kidney function at dialysis initiation. Then, I should verify how GFR is measured in dialysis patients and why standard eGFR equations fail. Next, I will examine the trajectory of residual GFR decline after dialysis starts and whether it slows. After that, I need to check whether hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis differ in GFR preservation. I will then consider how timing of dialysis initiation affects residual function decline. Finally, I should review clinical implications, including survival, dialysis dosing, and guideline-based management, and close with practical takeaways and caveats about measurement and interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the baseline context: at dialysis initiation, most patients have minimal residual kidney function, typically in the single digits, and the NECOSAD cohort reported a mean GFR around 5.2 mL/min/1.73 m², which aligns with typical stage 5 CKD physiology and the clinical threshold for kidney failure, so I should anchor on that low starting point before discussing change over time [^117H61Ud] [^115sqj2N].

> Wait, let me verify the measurement issue because I need to ensure we are not mixing concepts. Standard creatinine-based eGFR equations are not valid in dialysis patients due to non-GFR determinants of creatinine and altered kinetics, so residual kidney function on dialysis should be quantified with urea clearance (KRU) or measured GFR using timed urine collections rather than serum creatinine–based eGFR, and guidelines explicitly recommend urea clearance as the preferred metric for residual function in both HD and PD [^113Pg5LU].

> I will now examine the trajectory of residual GFR decline after dialysis initiation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from pre-dialysis patterns; the NECOSAD analysis showed that the rate of GFR decline attenuates markedly after starting dialysis, from about −0.53 mL/min/1.73 m²/month pre-dialysis to roughly −0.12 mL/min/1.73 m²/month by 2–4 months on dialysis, with similar attenuation in HD and PD, indicating a substantial slowing of residual function loss once dialysis begins [^117H61Ud].

> Let me consider whether modality matters for residual function preservation. Initially, I thought PD universally preserves residual function better than HD, but wait, I should double-check for selection and informative censoring biases; indeed, some observational comparisons are vulnerable to these biases, yet analyses that account for dropout patterns still suggest PD patients experience a slower decline in residual GFR than HD patients, supporting a modest modality effect favoring PD for RKF preservation, though the absolute differences are small and patient selection remains important [^116viS13].

> Next, I should review how timing of dialysis initiation influences residual function decline. Higher eGFR at initiation is associated with faster subsequent loss of residual kidney function in the first year on HD, and faster annual KRU decline correlates with higher mortality, implying that earlier initiation may accelerate residual function loss without clear survival benefit, consistent with the IDEAL randomized trial showing no mortality advantage to starting at eGFR 10–14 versus 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m², and with contemporary guidance to avoid starting solely based on a numeric eGFR threshold [^1124GkL1] [^1161KR8H] [^1154YSUL] [^114STYkA].

> I need to ensure the clinical implications are explicit. Residual kidney function contributes to solute and volume clearance, reduces intradialytic hypotension and organ stunning, and is associated with better survival. Full loss of residual GFR increases mortality risk, and guidelines advise incorporating residual clearance into dialysis adequacy planning and monitoring KRU at least quarterly, adjusting dialysis dose as residual function wanes to maintain overall clearance targets [^1152GWEz] [^115KqKL4] [^114cyJ6m].

> But wait, what about practical measurement and monitoring nuances. I should confirm that urea clearance is preferred and that creatinine-based eGFR should not be used to guide dialysis initiation or RKF assessment in dialysis patients; when more accurate GFR ascertainment will change management, measured clearance with exogenous markers or careful timed urine collections can be used, and in advanced non-dialysis CKD, combined creatinine–cystatin C equations improve risk prediction, though this does not translate into validity for dialysis patients' residual function estimation [^113Pg5LU] [^112yiJoE] [^114MUoHU].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency. In kidney failure, residual GFR is already very low at dialysis initiation, declines rapidly before dialysis, and then the rate of decline slows substantially after dialysis starts. PD may modestly slow residual function loss compared with HD, and starting dialysis at higher eGFR is linked to faster residual function decline without proven survival benefit, so preserving residual function and monitoring it properly meaningfully influence dialysis prescription, symptoms, and outcomes [^117H61Ud] [^116viS13] [^1124GkL1] [^111snNxz].

---

GFR continues to decline after dialysis initiation, but the rate of decline **slows markedly** compared with the pre-dialysis period [^117H61Ud]. On average, residual GFR declines by about 1–2 mL/min/1.73 m² per year on dialysis, with faster loss in hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis [^116viS13] and in patients starting at higher eGFR [^1124GkL1]. Early dialysis initiation (higher eGFR) is associated with faster residual function loss and higher mortality, so **timing should be symptom-driven**, not based on eGFR alone [^111snNxz] [^114STYkA]. Preserving residual GFR improves survival and quality of life, and can be supported by avoiding nephrotoxins, optimizing volume and blood pressure, and using ACEi/ARBs when indicated [^113GvP5E] [^115KqKL4].

---

## Trajectory of GFR decline after dialysis initiation

- **Pre-dialysis decline**: Before dialysis, GFR typically declines rapidly, averaging ~0.53 mL/min/1.73 m²/month (≈6.4 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) [^117H61Ud].

- **Post-dialysis decline**: After dialysis starts, the decline slows to ~0.12 mL/min/1.73 m²/month (≈1.4 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) [^117H61Ud].

- **Annual decline**: Most studies report a residual GFR loss of 1–2 mL/min/1.73 m²/year on dialysis [^117H61Ud].

---

## Factors influencing GFR decline on dialysis

Several factors influence the **rate of residual GFR decline** in dialysis patients:

| **Factor** | **Influence on gfr decline** |
|-|-|
| Dialysis modality | - PD better preserves residual GFR than HD [^116viS13] [^114vRD1o] <br/> - HD-associated hemodynamic instability accelerates decline [^113qh7Fk] |
| Timing of dialysis initiation | Earlier initiation (higher eGFR) is linked to faster residual GFR loss and higher mortality [^1124GkL1] [^1161KR8H] |
| Patient-specific factors | - Younger age <br/> - Male sex <br/> - Diabetes <br/> - Cardiovascular disease <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Volume overload <br/> - Nephrotoxin exposure all accelerate decline [^1128Wek6] |
| Dialysis-related factors | - High ultrafiltration rates <br/> - Intradialytic hypotension <br/> - Bioincompatibility <br/> - Infections contribute to faster decline [^113qh7Fk] |

---

## Clinical implications of declining GFR on dialysis

- **Survival**: Lower residual GFR is associated with higher mortality; each 1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year faster decline increases mortality risk by ~10% [^115KqKL4].

- **Quality of life**: Residual GFR improves volume control, blood pressure stability, and solute clearance, enhancing quality of life [^1152GWEz].

- **Dialysis adequacy**: Declining GFR reduces total clearance, potentially requiring dialysis dose adjustments [^114cyJ6m].

---

## Strategies to preserve residual GFR on dialysis

Preserving residual GFR is clinically important; effective strategies include:

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize exposure to nephrotoxic drugs and contrast agents [^notfound].

- **Optimize volume and blood pressure**: Prevent intradialytic hypotension and volume overload [^113qh7Fk].

- **Use ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: These may slow residual GFR decline in appropriate patients [^113Ntve2].

- **Choose PD when feasible**: PD better preserves residual GFR than HD [^116viS13] [^114vRD1o].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **symptom-based initiation** and residual function preservation:

- **Initiation**: Base dialysis initiation on symptoms, signs, and patient preferences, not eGFR alone [^114STYkA] [^113BjXZQ].

- **Monitoring**: Track residual GFR regularly and adjust dialysis prescriptions accordingly [^114cyJ6m].

- **Preservation**: Use strategies to preserve residual GFR, including ACEi/ARBs and nephrotoxin avoidance [^113GvP5E] [^1118zRHf].

---

GFR continues to decline after dialysis, but **the rate slows** compared with pre-dialysis. The decline is influenced by modality, timing of initiation, and patient factors; preserving residual GFR improves outcomes, so management should prioritize its preservation and symptom-guided care [^117H61Ud] [^1124GkL1] [^1154YSUL].

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m², we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

Purpose Of Review

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increasing, as are its complications. Central to the diagnosis, evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease is the estimation of glomerular filtration rate. This article summarizes the various equations used to estimate filtration function and the performance of each in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

During the past year the prediction equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate, especially the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, continued to receive much interest. Many studies have compared the performance of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation and the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The performance of these equations in various patient populations, such as patients with advanced heart failure, diabetic patients, renal transplantation patients, and the healthy general population, has been extensively studied. Overall, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation has had an acceptable validity and has outperformed the Cockcroft-Gault equation in the various populations, but with some limitations that the physician should account for in clinical practice.

Summary

The use of the prediction equations to estimate glomerular filtration rate, especially the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation, should be implemented more frequently in clinical practice. An ever increasing number of studies has validated its use in different patient populations.

### Timing of dialysis initiation to reduce mortality and cardiovascular events in advanced chronic kidney disease: nationwide cohort study [^112hrgHs]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, more than 3 million people with kidney failure need maintenance dialysis treatment for survival. These numbers are expected to double by 2030. The societal and individual burden of kidney failure treated by dialysis is high: for instance, the US Medicare fee-for-service spending for beneficiaries with kidney failure was $36.6bn in 2018. The mean annual healthcare costs per haemodialysis patient are $93 191 in the US, and similar numbers are reported for European countries. Dialysis treatment also places a large burden on patients' daily lives. Determining the optimal timing of dialysis is therefore of substantial importance.

Despite extensive previous literature, evidence on whether an optimal glomerular filtration rate to start dialysis exists, and if so where it lies, is lacking. Previous observational studies that attempted to investigate multiple estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) strategies have been limited by insufficient power, immortal time bias, or lead time and selection biases. In 2010 the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) trial showed that a strategy to start dialysis at an eGFR of 10–14 mL/min/1.73 m² was not superior to one of waiting until symptoms develop or eGFR is 5–7 mL/min/1.73 m 2. This is reflected in subsequent guidelines, which recommend starting dialysis when symptoms and signs attributable to kidney failure arise rather than at a specific kidney function. However, IDEAL compared only two strategies, from which an optimal eGFR cannot be derived. In addition, the achieved eGFR separation in IDEAL was 1.8 (9.0 v 7.2) mL/min/1.73 m 2 by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. That a kidney function outside this range exists at which starting dialysis is associated with better outcomes therefore remains possible, and uncertainty on this question among providers persists.

### Angiotensin blockade and progressive loss of kidney function in hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled trial [^113Ntve2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines during long-term dialysis treatment. In peritoneal dialysis, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system reduces GFR decline. Observational studies suggest that similar treatment may preserve kidney function in hemodialysis (HD).

Study Design

A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, with 1-year follow-up.

Setting & Participants

Adult HD patients with urine output > 300mL/24h, HD vintage less than 1 year, and cardiac ejection fraction > 30%. Patients were included from 6 HD centers.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or the angiotensin II receptor blocker irbesartan, 300mg daily. Target systolic blood pressure (BP) was 140mm Hg.

Outcomes & Measurements

Primary outcomes were change in GFR measured as the mean of creatinine and urea renal clearance together with urine volume. Secondary outcomes were change in albuminuria, renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone hormone plasma levels, and time to anuria.

Results

Of 82 patients randomly assigned (41 patients in each group), 56 completed 1 year of treatment. The placebo and irbesartan groups were comparable at baseline in terms of sex balance (26 vs 30 men), mean age (62 vs 61 years), median HD vintage (137 vs 148 days), mean HD time (10 vs 11h/wk), median urine volume (1.19 vs 1.26L/d), and mean GFR (4.8 vs 5.7mL/min/1.73 m²). The target BP level was reached in both groups and BP did not differ significantly between groups over time. Adverse-event rates were similar. GFR declined by a mean of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2–2.3) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1–2.4) mL/min/1.73m(2) per year in the placebo and irbesartan groups, respectively. Mean difference (baseline values minus value at 12 months) between groups was -0.0 (95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8). In each group, 4 patients became anuric.

Limitations

GFR decline rates were lower than expected, reducing the power.

Conclusions

At equal BP levels, we found that irbesartan treatment did not affect the decline in GFR or urine volume significantly during 1 year of treatment in HD patients. Irbesartan treatment was used safely in the studied population.

### Full loss of residual renal function causes higher mortality in dialysis patients; findings from a marginal structural model [^115KqKL4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Declining residual renal function, as indicated by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is associated with an increased mortality risk in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis.

Methods

We monitored GFR and mortality in 1800 haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in 1996–2006. We used a marginal structural model to estimate the causal effects both of GFR when it was not completely lost and of the subsequent full loss of GFR on mortality, avoiding the drawbacks of standard regression models that include covariates to adjust for confounding. Instead, effect estimates were adjusted for possible baseline and time-varying confounders using inverse probability weighting.

Results

We estimated a hazard ratio (HR) corresponding to the effect of the full loss of GFR on mortality, as compared to not having fully lost GFR, of 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–2.07]. The HR corresponding to the effect of GFR when GFR is not (yet) fully lost on mortality was 0.97 (95% CI 0.92–1.02) (per mL/min/1.73 m(2)). We found no significant difference in the effect of GFR on mortality between patients starting on PD and HD.

Conclusions

Preventing or delaying the full loss of GFR can improve survival in dialysis patients. This supports the importance that is given to the effect of treatment options for patients with ESRD on the rate of decline of the residual renal function.

### Factors influencing dialysis withdrawal: a scoping review [^115dmeAD]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of renal function over a period of months or years and is classified into five stages based on the measurement of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). End stage renal disease (ESRD), or CKD stage 5, represents the most severe form of renal function, is characterized by an eGFR of < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m² and requires maintenance dialysis or renal transplantation. The prevalence of both CKD and dialysis is increasing globally, mainly because of long-term survival rates. There are nearly 700,000, 120,000 and 135,000 people with CKD stage 5 in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and Europe, respectively. The prevalence of ESRD in Saudi Arabia ranges from 5.7%–6% and 6% in Australia. Furthermore, from 2006 to 2012 Canada had the third highest ESRD incident and prevalence rates after the US and Japan.

### Creatinine-based formulae for estimating glomerular filtration rate: is it time to change to chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation? [^1166CF9F]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the most commonly used creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations, focus on the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation and the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, and review studies that have directly compared their performance, estimated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and assessed prognosis related to each equation.

Recent Findings

The CKD-EPI equation was published in 2009 and appears to be more generalizable and accurate for estimating GFR in comparison with the MDRD equation. Compared with the MDRD study equation, the CKD-EPI equation results in a lower prevalence of CKD and a more accurate assessment of prognosis, particularly when estimated GFR is greater than 60ml/min/1.73m(2).

Summary

The CKD-EPI equation appears to be a more generalizable and accurate equation for estimating GFR in comparison with the MDRD equation. Additional studies in subgroups such as the elderly, in the general population where individuals are not selected for being at high risk of CKD, and across different race/ethnic populations are needed in order to further generalize these findings. In the meantime, there is accumulating evidence to support the recommendation that the CKD-EPI equation should replace the MDRD equation.

Chronic kidney disease staging — glomerular filtration rate (GFR) thresholds are defined as follows: Stage I "Kidney damage (protein in the urine) and normal GFR" with GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) ≥ 90; Stage II "Kidney damage and mild decrease in GFR" with 60–89 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage III "Moderate decrease in GFR" with 30–59 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage IV "Severe decrease in GFR" with 15–30 mL/min/1.73 m2; Stage V "Kidney failure (dialysis or kidney transplant needed)" with < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### GFR slope as a surrogate end point for kidney disease progression in clinical trials: a meta-analysis of treatment effects of randomized controlled trials [^117AcxkZ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surrogate end points are needed to assess whether treatments are effective in the early stages of CKD. GFR decline leads to kidney failure, but regulators have not approved using differences in the change in GFR from the beginning to the end of a randomized, controlled trial as an end point in CKD because it is not clear whether small changes in the GFR slope will translate to clinical benefits.

Methods

To assess the use of GFR slope as a surrogate end point for CKD progression, we performed a meta-analysis of 47 RCTs that tested 12 interventions in 60,620 subjects. We estimated treatment effects on GFR slope (mean difference in GFR slope between the randomized groups), for the total slope starting at baseline, chronic slope starting at 3 months after randomization, and on the clinical end point (doubling of serum creatinine, GFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, or ESKD) for each study. We used Bayesian mixed-effects analyses to describe the association of treatment effects on GFR slope with the clinical end point and to test how well the GFR slope predicts a treatment's effect on the clinical end point.

Results

Across all studies, the treatment effect on 3-year total GFR slope (median R 2 = 0.97; 95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI], 0.78 to 1.00) and on the chronic slope (R 2 0.96; 95% BCI, 0.63 to 1.00) accurately predicted treatment effects on the clinical end point. With a sufficient sample size, a treatment effect of 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 /yr or greater on total slope over 3 years or chronic slope predicts a clinical benefit on CKD progress with at least 96% probability.

Conclusions

With large enough sample sizes, GFR slope may be a viable surrogate for clinical end points in CKD RCTs.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^116kk3j1]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes associated with heart failure in CKD G4+

HF is associated with poor outcomes in patients with CKD, including greater risk of death, particularly in patients who are older, have HFrEF (Supplementary Table S6), or have severely decreased GFR (Figure 4). HF contributes significantly to morbidity among CKD patients, leading to frequent hospitalizations and re-hospitalizations. – HF is also associated with episodes of acute kidney injuryand progression of CKD. Among incident dialysis patients, volume overload compared with other dialysis indications is associated with the greatest risk of post-KRT mortality.

Progression of clinical and subclinical heart failure after initiation of dialysis

Only a few studies have evaluated longitudinal changes in subclinical HF, as assessed by echocardiograms, in patients with CKD G4+, and the results are not consistent. In the CRIC study, mean left ventricular mass index did not change after the initiation of KRT. However, there was a modest but statistically significant decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The CASCADE study examined echocardiograms in patients with CKD G3+and reported that left ventricular mass index and left atrial volume both increased within a year; however, the change in left ventricular ejection fraction was not statistically significant. In the IDEAL trial, serial echocardiograms performed 12 months apart showed no change in left ventricular mass index, left atrial diameter, diastolic dysfunction, or left ventricular ejection fraction after dialysis initiation. It should be noted, however, that in this study, over 40% initiated peritoneal dialysis (PD) versus hemodialysis (HD). In another study of 41 HF patients, left ventricular mass index decreased after initiation of HD.

Vascular access and heart failure

Vascular access preparation is a key component of management in CKD G4+ patients. There are numerous postulated changes in the cardiovascular system after creation of an arteriovenous fistula(Supplementary Table S7). Small studies or case reports have suggested that arteriovenous fistula may lead to development of high-output HF. – Arteriovenous fistula creation has also been reported in small studies to worsen right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension, and found to be associated with significant right ventricular dilatation and remodeling and an increased risk for development of incident heart failure. On the other hand, other studies found a stabilization of kidney function after access creation. Larger prospective studies are needed to understand optimal access management in patients with CKD G4+ and HF.

Hemodialysis adequacy — preparation for kidney failure (CPG 1.1): Patients who reach chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 (estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) should receive timely education about kidney failure and options for its treatment, including kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD) in the home or in-center, and conservative treatment, and patients' family members and caregivers also should be educated about treatment choices for kidney failure (B).

### A randomized, controlled trial of early versus late initiation of dialysis [^111snNxz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

The study IDEAL was published by Cooper BA and colleagues in 2010 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic kidney disease. In the IDEAL study, the trial question was: what is the role of early initiation of dialysis in patients with stage V CKD? In the IDEAL study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the IDEAL study, the population was: 828 patients (286 female, 542 male). The inclusion criteria were patients ≥ 18 years of age with progressive CKD and an eGFR between 10.0 and 15.0 mL/min/1.73 m² of body-surface area. The key exclusion criteria were younger than 18 years of age, estimated GFR < 10.0 mL/min, plans to receive a kidney transplant from a live donor within the next 12 months, recently diagnosed cancer that was likely to affect survival, or unable to provide written informed consent. In the IDEAL study, the interventions were: n = 404 early dialysis initiation (initiation of dialysis when the estimated GFR was 10.0–14.0 mL/min) n = 424 late dialysis initiation (initiation of dialysis when the estimated GFR was 5.0–7.0 mL/min). In the IDEAL study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in all-cause death (37.6% vs. 36.6%; HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.3). In the IDEAL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events (10.9/100 py vs. 8.8/100 py; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.56) Borderline significant increase in the incidence of infectious events (12.4/100 py vs. 14.3/100 py;). In the IDEAL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in frequency of adverse events. In the IDEAL study, the conclusion was: in patients ≥ 18 years of age with progressive CKD and an eGFR between 10.0 and 15.0 mL/min/1.73 m² of body-surface area, early dialysis initiation was not superior to late dialysis initiation with respect to a all-cause death.

### Epidemiology, contributors to, and clinical trials of mortality risk in chronic kidney failure [^11624JUX]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney failure — defined as a glomerular filtration rate persistently below 15 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) — have an unacceptably high mortality rate. In developing countries, mortality results primarily from an absence of access to renal replacement therapy. Additionally, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality are several times higher in patients on dialysis or post-renal transplantation than in the general population. Mortality of patients on renal replacement therapy is affected by a combination of socioeconomic factors, pre-existing medical disorders, renal replacement treatment modalities, and kidney failure itself. Characterisation of the key pathophysiological contributors to increased mortality and cardiorenal risk staging systems are needed for the rational design of clinical trials aimed at decreasing mortality. Policy changes to improve access to renal replacement therapy should be combined with research into low-cost renal replacement therapy and optimum clinical care, which should include multifaceted approaches simultaneously targeting several of the putative contributors to increased mortality.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^112VGHtN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the guidelines — clinical outcomes are optimized when the patient is treated with the delivered dose of dialysis recommended, but because dose as small‑solute clearance is a composite measure, an occasional patient may generate toxins at a rate well above average and therefore require more dialysis than recommended. Clinicians should be alert to subtle symptoms and signs of kidney failure that may indicate a need for more dialysis or a different dialysis modality. After the immediate life‑threatening effects of uremia have been controlled by standard hemodialysis, the patient is often left with symptoms and objective disorders termed a "residual syndrome", whose combined effect may account for the relatively high yearly mortality rate observed in the dialysis population; in many cases, relief from specific aspects of the syndrome requires additional treatments that may not yet be available to clinicians.

### A meta-analysis of GFR slope as a surrogate endpoint for kidney failure [^112XqDA3]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline is causally associated with kidney failure and is a candidate surrogate endpoint for clinical trials of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. Analyses across a diverse spectrum of interventions and populations is required for acceptance of GFR decline as an endpoint. In an analysis of individual participant data, for each of 66 studies (total of 186,312 participants), we estimated treatment effects on the total GFR slope, computed from baseline to 3years, and chronic slope, starting at 3months after randomization, and on the clinical endpoint (doubling of serum creatinine, GFR < 15mlmin -1 per 1.73 m² or kidney failure with replacement therapy). We used a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression model to relate treatment effects on GFR slope with those on the clinical endpoint across all studies and by disease groups (diabetes, glomerular diseases, CKD or cardiovascular diseases). Treatment effects on the clinical endpoint were strongly associated with treatment effects on total slope (median coefficient of determination (R 2) = 0.97 (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI) 0.82–1.00)) and moderately associated with those on chronic slope (R 2 = 0.55 (95% BCI 0.25–0.77)). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across disease. Our results support the use of total slope as a primary endpoint for clinical trials of CKD progression.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular diseases [^111PoQ9h]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Outcome measures in glomerular disease — practice points are limited; goals for proteinuria reduction vary by disease, and a drop in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40% over 2–3 years may be a surrogate outcome measure for kidney failure. The document states: "The specific practice points in this section are limited: Practice Point 1.9.1 states that goals for proteinuria reduction vary by disease and Practice Point 1.9.2 reports that a drop in eGFR ≥ 40% over 2–3 years may be a surrogate outcome measure for kidney failure".

### Sex differences in mortality among binational cohort of people with chronic kidney disease: population based data linkage study [^11749ygf]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

In the general population, the life expectancy of women consistently exceeds that of men in many developed countries. This difference has been attributed to biology, such as the effect of oestrogen, and increased healthcare seeking behaviour and greater engagement with healthcare in women. However, sex inequalities in health service delivery might mean the survival advantage in women does not always persist. Growing evidence supports sex specific mechanisms whereby women might not develop the same symptoms of disease as men, leading to systematic differences in care including misdiagnosis and delays in receiving treatment. Women are also underrepresented in randomised clinical trials and animal models, which can lead to the development of drugs and treatments that are more harmful or less effective in women.

Chronic kidney disease manifests differently in men and women. Women have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease, but men have a faster progression to kidney failure and so represent a greater proportion of the population with kidney failure. Current evidence suggests there are differences in care received by men and women with chronic kidney disease. Women are more likely to start dialysis late at lower levels of kidney function, and have higher rates of dialysis withdrawal. After a cardiovascular event, women receiving dialysis have lower rates of cardiac catheterisation and cardiac rehabilitation. Serum creatinine is a commonly used indicator of kidney function, but is not directly comparable between sexes. At the same level of serum creatinine, men have better kidney function than women because of higher muscle mass on average and increased endogenous creatinine production. To some extent this disparity is mitigated by the use of estimated glomerular filtration rate to monitor changes in kidney function, which accounts for sex, but women might still be referred for specialist care later than men with comparable kidney function. These factors could contribute to the poorer long term outcomes in women with kidney failure. Recommended dialysis dosage calculations were also found to favour male body compositions in a cohort study, but these effects were reduced in a subsequent clinical trial.

### Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria are associated with mortality and end-stage renal disease. A collaborative meta-analysis of kidney disease population cohorts [^111QW2Ju]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

We studied here the independent associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria with mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We performed a collaborative meta-analysis of 13 studies totaling 21,688 patients selected for CKD of diverse etiology. After adjustment for potential confounders and albuminuria, we found that a 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² lower eGFR below a threshold of 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² was significantly associated with mortality and ESRD (pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.47 and 6.24, respectively). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for both HR estimates. After adjustment for risk factors and eGFR, an eightfold higher albumin- or protein-to-creatinine ratio was significantly associated with mortality (pooled HR 1.40) without evidence of significant heterogeneity and with ESRD (pooled HR 3.04), with significant heterogeneity between HR estimates. Lower eGFR and more severe albuminuria independently predict mortality and ESRD among individuals selected for CKD, with the associations stronger for ESRD than for mortality. Thus, these relationships are consistent with CKD stage classifications based on eGFR and suggest that albuminuria provides additional prognostic information among individuals with CKD.

### End-stage renal disease preceded by rapid declines in kidney function: a case series [^1124yVGG]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Although there is a large body of epidemiology literature on patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) — and in the past decade, also on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — relatively few studies have focused on the transition from CKD to ESRD. We hypothesize based on our clinical experience that in a sizable minority of incident ESRD patients develop ESRD after suffering period of rapid loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which may or may not fit the current definition of acute kidney injury (abrupt rise in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dl or ≥ 50% within 48 hours). This has a number of clinical and policy implications which we believe deserve consideration.

The purpose of this study is to quantify the frequency with which chronic dialysis was precipitated by periods of rapid decline in kidney function at two dialysis units in Northern California, USA.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^116U4h93]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy — initiation timing and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) note that it is difficult to make a recommendation for initiating kidney replacement therapy (KRT) based solely on a specific level of GFR; several studies concluded there is no statistically significant association between renal function at the time of initiation of KRT and subsequent mortality, others suggested that worse kidney function at initiation of KRT is associated with increased mortality or morbidity, and when corrections are made for lead-time bias, there is no clear survival advantage to starting dialysis therapy earlier. The Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) Study is described as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing outcomes in patients starting dialysis with a Cockcroft-Gault GFR of 10 to 14 versus 5 to 7 mL/min/1.73 m 2. In 2000, the NKF KDOQI CPG on Nutrition in CKD advocated that — in patients with CKD and estimated GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 who are not undergoing maintenance dialysis — if protein-energy malnutrition develops or persists despite vigorous attempts to optimize protein-energy intake and there is no apparent cause for it other than low nutrient intake, initiation of KRT should be recommended. The page also states that average GFR at initiation has increased in all age groups since 1995, increasing most in the oldest patients.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114kXwKq]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation — We suggest that dialysis be initiated when one or more of the following are present: symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure (serositis, acid base or electrolyte abnormalities, pruritus); inability to control volume status or blood pressure; a progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention; or cognitive impairment. This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 (2B). Living donor preemptive renal transplantation in adults should be considered when the GFR is < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2, and there is a progressive deterioration in kidney function over the preceding 6 months (Not Graded). The commentary work group agrees that dialysis initiation, for both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, should not be based on estimates of kidney function alone, but should take into account symptoms and other complications of advancing kidney disease.

### Effect of cause and time of dropout on the residual GFR: a comparative analysis of the decline of GFR on dialysis [^116viS13]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The decline of residual renal function (RRF) on dialysis has been reported to be slower in peritoneal dialysis (PD) then hemodialysis (HD). However, some clinicians have questioned whether this reported difference might not be caused by selection bias. In particular, if continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) delivers only marginally adequate therapy as some clinicians speculate, then perhaps those patients on CAPD with low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are purposefully switched to HD. If true, transferring CAPD patients with low GFR to HD could create a selection bias that very well may account for the differences in GFR between PD and HD. This is particularly problematic if one then censors patients at the time of transfer from PD to HD from analysis (that is, patients are no longer followed in the study once they have switched treatment modalities). When this occurs, the data are said to be informatively censored, a term used by statisticians to describe any kind of systematic bias associated with censored or incomplete data. In particular, informative censoring occurs when patients who die or transfer to another modality very early have an associated lower starting GFR or higher rate of decline of GFR than patients who either complete the study or who die or transfer much later. If patient dropout is indeed related to the rate of decline in GFR and if this relationship differs between PD and HD but is ignored in the analysis, then the results of such analysis may be biased.

Methods

This article analyzes the decline in GFR among 141 incident dialysis patients (39 HD and 102 PD) undergoing either HD or PD at the University of Missouri-Columbia. The decline in GFR was modeled as a nonlinear function of time, taking into account the possibility that missing values of GFR may be associated with patient dropout (death, transfer to another modality, or transplantation). To safeguard against this possibility, we utilized a conditional nonlinear mixed-effects model. The model was used to fit and compare each patient's GFR data to time adjusting for the patient's treatment modality (HD vs. PD), cause of dropout (death, transfer, transplant, lost to follow-up/study ended), and time to dropout. The model allowed a comparison of the starting GFR and the rate of decline in GFR between PD and HD adjusting for these three factors.

Results and Conclusions

The results of our analysis suggest that such informative censoring is independent of treatment modality and that even after correcting for dropout caused by death or transfer to another modality, patients starting on PD have a lower rate of decline in GFR (that is, better preservation of GFR) than patients starting on HD.

### Update of dialysis initiation timing in end stage kidney disease patients: is it a resolved question? A systematic literature review [^114ETzW2]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Currently, clinical practice guidelines recommend that: decision to initiate maintenance dialysis primarily depends on clinical signs and symptoms which may be attributed to uremic syndrome. In this regard, the Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group suggested that the decision is usually occurring within the GFR range between 5 and 10 ml/min/1.73 m2″. The Additionally, the Canadian Society of Nephrology suggested that in the absence of these factors, the eGFR should only serve as a sole criterion for the initiation of dialysis if it is 6 mL/min/1.73 m² or less";. The Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy proposes that patients endure under conservative treatment until the GFR < 8 mL/min/1.73m2, even if symptoms of renal failure are observed and hemodialysis is recommended to be initiated prior to a GFR of 2 mL/min/1.73 m2. Our present systematic review included 13 studies of the last 5 years which investigated optimal dialysis initiation in ESKD patients, 9 of the 13 studies mainly focused on the optimal GFR of maintenance dialysis initiation; 7 studies used eGFR, 1 study used mGFR, 1 study used both. Compared to previous studies, wider range of GFR values and more detailed data stratification were applied in the study design and data processing stages; 7 studies taken GFR ≤ 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 or even lower into account, the lowest data range was mGFR < 4.3 mL/min/1.73m2 and the highest range was eGFR 15–16 mL/min/1.73 m2. 5 studies showed none association between GFR and mortality or other adverse outcomes, 2 studies showed dialysis initiation at higher GFR levels were with poor prognosis, and 2 studies showed higher GFR levels with better prognosis. However, it's worth noting that Fu et al. observed a parabolic relation between eGFR and mortality, with the lowest mortality risk at eGFR15–16 mL/min/1.73m2; compared with dialysis initiation at eGFR6–7 mL/min/1.73m2, initiation at eGFR15–16 mL/min/1.73m2 was associated with a 5.1% lower absolute 5 year mortality risk and 2.9% lower risk of a major adverse cardiovascular; this 5.1% absolute risk difference corresponded to a mean postponement of death of 1.6 months over 5 years of follow-up, and dialysis would need to be started 4 years earlier; so they concluded that "although very early dialysis initiation was associated with a modest reduction in mortality and cardiovascular events, this may not outweigh the burden of a substantially longer period spent on dialysis. In recent years there has been an increase in the prevalence of elderly population, which, along with advances in dialysis technology and increasing survival of maintenance dialysis patients, lead to an increasing proportion of elder dialysis patients. Two studies researched timing of dialysis initiation in elderly ESKD patients, and they both concluded that eGFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality and quality of life. So to summarize, most studies proved that GFR at dialysis initiation was not associated with mortality, timing of dialysis initiation should not be based on GFR both in all maintenance dialysis population and in elderly, which is consistent with present clinical guidelines.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate at reinitiation of dialysis and mortality in failed kidney transplant recipients [^116mKxto]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent observational studies and a controlled trial suggest more favorable outcomes upon later dialysis initiation in chronic kidney disease. The role of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in predicting outcome at reinitiation of dialysis in failed kidney transplant recipients is unclear.

Methods

Five-year data in a large dialysis organization was linked to the 'Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients' to identify 747 failed kidney transplant patients with CKD Stage 5, who had restarted dialysis therapy. A propensity score for early (eGFR > 10.5 mL/min/1.73 m2) versus late reinitiation of dialysis was fit by logistic regression. The mortality hazard ratio (HR) was estimated across tertiles of the fitted score.

Results

Patients were 44 ± 14 years old and included 42% women. Male gender {odds ratio (OR), [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 1.82 (1.22–2.73)}, diabetes mellitus [OR: 1.75 (1.14–2.68)] and peripheral vascular disease [OR: 3.55 (1.17–10.77)] were associated with higher odds of early dialysis reinitiation. Each mL/min/1.73 m2 higher eGFR was associated with 6% higher death risk in unadjusted model [HR: 1.06 (1.01–1.11)], and although not significant in fully adjusted models [HR: 1.02 (0.96–1.07)], it was significant in some subgroups including women and younger patients. The death HR of higher eGFR across lowest to highest tertiles of propensity score of early dialysis initiation (corresponding healthiest to sickest patients) were 1.10 (0.98–1.24), 1.00 (0.91–1.10) and 0.99 (0.92–1.07), respectively (P for trend < 0.05), indicating a trend toward higher mortality risk with earlier dialysis initiation in the healthiest patients.

Conclusions

Earlier return to dialysis therapy in failed kidney transplant patients tends to correlate with worse dialysis survival especially among healthiest and younger patients and women. Additional studies need to verify these findings.

### International consensus definitions of clinical trial outcomes for kidney failure: 2020 [^111DBydi]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Kidney failure is an important outcome for patients, clinicians, researchers, healthcare systems, payers, and regulators. However, no harmonized international consensus definitions of kidney failure and key surrogates of progression to kidney failure exist specifically for clinical trials. The International Society of Nephrology convened an international multi-stakeholder meeting to develop consensus on this topic. A core group, experienced in design, conduct, and outcome adjudication of clinical trials, developed a database of 64 randomized trials and the 163 included definitions relevant to kidney failure. Using an iterative process, a set of proposed consensus definitions were developed and subsequently vetted by the larger multi-stakeholder group of 83 participants representing 18 different countries. The consensus of the meeting participants was that clinical trial kidney failure outcomes should be comprised of a composite that includes receipt of a kidney transplant, initiation of maintenance dialysis, and death from kidney failure; it may also include outcomes based solely on laboratory measurements of glomerular filtration rate: a sustained low glomerular filtration rate and a sustained percent decline in glomerular filtration rate. Discussion included important considerations, such as (i) recognition of existing nomenclature for kidney failure; (ii) applicability across resource settings; (iii) ease of understanding for all stakeholders; and (iv) avoidance of inappropriate complexity so that the definitions can be used across ranges of populations and trial methodologies. The final definitions reflect the consensus for use in clinical trials.

### Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in France-The constances cohort [^111vvpn1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined independently of its cause, by the presence for more than 3 months of markers of kidney damage and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/1.73 m². Different stages of CKD were defined according to the level of eGFR. Stages 3 to 5 concern patients whose GFR falls below 60 ml/min/1.73 m². This chronic pathology constitutes a frequent complication of diabetes or hypertension. In 2018, hypertension and diabetes represented almost half of the causes of kidney failure in incident patients undergoing kidney replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation) in France. CKD is also associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and mortality, so that, for a patient at an early stage, the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is greater than that of reaching dialysis. Finally, this pathology has a considerable impact on the quality of life of patients. Preventing the risk of CKD, improving its detection at an early stage and slowing its progression towards kidney failure constitute real public health objectives.

In this respect, our main objectives were to estimate global prevalence of CKD, overall and by CKD stage (stages 1 to 5 without replacement therapy) across the Constances cohort overall and by subgroups (decreased eGFR or/and increased albuminuria) in order to establish a description of the CKD patient population, and to study its determinants.

### Low protein diets in patients with chronic kidney disease: a bridge between mainstream and complementary-alternative medicines? [^111doeaK]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conversely, delaying dialysis requires attaining stable metabolic balance that is, at least partly, independent of GFR. However, the analysis of this short term goal is only apparently easier since it is deeply entangled with the pharmacological "mainstream approach" and reflects various policies of dialysis start which are not merely based upon (relatively) simple measures, such as GFR. The new Canadian guidelines on dialysis start clearly underline that whenever an "intent to defer" policy is chosen, wise clinical judgement cannot be replaced by formulae.

Heterogeneity of diseases, heterogeneity of progression, and heterogeneity of goals and measures add to the charm, but also to the complexity of the analysis of dietary approaches in CKD patients. Without a change in the approach, the issue will probably remain open forever.

Low-protein diets in CKD: why is the evidence not evident enough?

Many of the questions posed in the 1986 paper published in the Lancet entitled: "Dietary treatment for chronic renal failure, ten unanswered questions" are currently still unanswered. Among them, some highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of chronic kidney disease (Does chronic renal failure always progress?), while others underline the difficulties in standardization of low protein diets in clinical practice (When should a low-protein diet start? Which low-protein diet? How should we assess progression, nutritional status or compliance?). However, in the literature there are several evidence-based demonstrations of the possible role low protein diets may play in delaying ESRD, including several RCTs and a Cochrane review. Furthermore, we are not aware of any large studies demonstrating a higher progression rate in non-malnourished, on-diet patients; in addition, data on lower costs are concordant, and there is no evidence showing that being on the diet results in any survival disadvantage after the start of dialysis.

### Changing the choice from dialysis to conservative care or vice versa in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^112YjhVh]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Maintenance dialysis is the most commonly chosen treatment for kidney failure in older patients. Current guidelines recommend presenting conservative care (CC) as a valid alternative to older patients who do not want to start dialysis. While the survival benefit of dialysis is distinct, it appears to be reduced for the oldest patients and those with multiple comorbid conditions. Also, the risk of treatment burden and the impact on daily life increase after dialysis initiation. In terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom burden, both treatment pathways have the potential to achieve similar outcomes.

Determining the most appropriate treatment pathway — often a difficult process — results from a dialogue between healthcare professionals, patients and their relatives on the goals of care, possible treatment options and risks and patients' values and preferences. This process of shared decision making (SDM) may start as early as from an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, allowing time for dialogue, education and preparation for kidney replacement therapy. Reasons for choosing either dialysis or CC are based on aspects other than mortality and HRQoL and are likely to differ between patients, their relatives and physicians. Furthermore, as patients' circumstances and preferences may change over time, the choice of therapy might also be subject to change.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^1178HTZ2]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by persistent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or the presence of other signs of kidney damage, is classified based on GFR and albuminuria categories. The risk for adverse outcomes, including mortality and kidney failure, increases with decreasing GFR and increasing albuminuria. Individuals with a GFR below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (i.e. CKD G4 or G5) are at particularly high risk across all albuminuria categories (Figure 1). In addition, CKD-specific complications increase markedly at low levels of GFR, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Of particular relevance is heart failure (HF), one of the most common CVD conditions for patients with CKD G4 or higher.

Kidney replacement therapy (KRT; i.e. dialysis or transplantation) can mitigate the consequences of kidney failure and improve prognosis. However, there are large variations in incidence rates of KRT, and globally only approximately half of those with kidney failure receive KRT. Inequalities in access to KRT play an important role, but differences in practice patterns also exist. There is agreement that level of GFR alone should not be used as a trigger for KRT initiation, and that signs and symptoms associated with kidney failure should be considered. Nevertheless, defining the optimal time for KRT initiation remains a challenge. Importantly the first few months on dialysis have been identified as a very high-risk period, though it remains unknown to what extent adverse events are triggered by dialysis initiation. Referral to nephrology services shortly before dialysis initiation has been associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes as compared with earlier referral.

Thus, low GFR (< 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) corresponding to CKD G4 or G5 (excluding patients on KRT and referred to subsequently as "CKD G4+") reflects a critical state for patients. A better understanding of prognosis of patients with CKD G4+ may inform treatment strategies, including decision-making for initiation of KRT. Therefore, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) collaborated with the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) to initiate a global meta-analysis of cohort studies (population-based cohorts, referred CKD cohorts, and research cohorts). The primary aim was to determine the prognosis of patients with advanced CKD with respect to initiation of KRT, CVD events, mortality, and relative timing of these events, with a second aim to determine variability of patient prognosis according to cohort, demographic, or health characteristics.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^113Pg5LU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Preferred metric for residual kidney function in dialysis — measurement guidance notes that for both PD and HD, the preferred measure of RKF is urea clearance, with reasons including that unlike creatinine clearances, measurements of urea clearance are not confounded by renal tubular secretion. Native kidney urea clearances are lower than the kidney's GFR, so the patient is protected, whereas creatinine clearances are always higher than GFR. MDRD estimates of GFR based on serum creatinine level are not valid in patients managed with dialysis, and inclusion of native kidney urea clearances in kinetic modeling programs allows accurate calculation of G and nPCR as an aid to diet assessment.

### Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^114FF5g6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is important in the diagnosis and prognostication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The current standards for CKD progression in clinical trials are kidney failure and the doubling of serum creatinine (∼57% decline in eGFR). These endpoints have limitations as they are only applicable to patients with later stages of CKD and often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power.

Recent Findings

Lesser declines in eGFR (30% and 40%) have been evaluated as potential endpoints in recent studies. These endpoints are more common and show a strong association with the risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality. These findings have been shown to be consistent across different causes of CKD and for different interventions. A particular limitation of reduced thresholds is an elevated risk of type I errors in the presence of acute treatment effects, particularly with a 30% eGFR decline cut off.

Summary

Surrogate endpoints for kidney failure and mortality are needed in clinical trials to allow for the reasonable management of timelines and resources, and the achievement of adequate sample sizes. Lesser eGFR decline thresholds should be considered to aid in the design and conduct of more randomized controlled trials in nephrology.

### Arteriovenous fistula in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients and rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate [^114tszxv]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To quantify the evidence for the role of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in predialysis CKD patients for the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Background

Pre-emptive placement of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in late-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is being advocated by all the major guidelines. Recent studies have suggested that pre-emptive AVF has a beneficial effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) also.

Methods

We conducted a literature search to retrieve all published studies related to the effect of AVF on the rate of decline of GFR using the electronic databases Google Scholar, PubMed, Central, Cochrane Library, clinialtrial.gov. Screening of studies and data extraction were done according to the PRISMA guidelines. We used the NIH assessment tool for the methodological quality assessment of the included studies. Extracted data from the six studies were pooled and analyzed.

Results

Six studies involving 3871 patients reported the effect of AVF creation on the rate of decline of GFR in late CKD patients. Evidence for statistically significant decline of eGFR after AVF creation compared to prior status (SMD -1.57, 95% CI -3.08 to -0.07, p < 0.001) was observed.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis observed preliminary evidence that the creation of AVF might have a potential added benefit in terms of estimated GFR improvement, though to a very small extent with a low level of certainty. More scientific data with high-quality studies are needed to substantiate this finding.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate decline as a predictor of dialysis in kidney transplant recipients [^116CU1Sv]. American Journal of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

It is now common for individuals to require dialysis following the failure of a kidney transplant. Management of complications and preparation for dialysis are suboptimal in this group. To aid planning, it is desirable to estimate the time to dialysis requirement. The rate of decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may be used to this end.

Methods

This study compared the rate of eGFR decline prior to dialysis commencement between individuals with failing transplants and transplant-naïve patients. The rate of eGFR decline was also compared between transplant recipients with and without graft failure. eGFR was calculated using the four-variable MDRD equation with rate of decline calculated by least squares linear regression.

Results

The annual rate of eGFR decline in incident dialysis patients with graft failure exceeded that of the transplant-naïve incident dialysis patients. In the transplant cohort, the mean annual rate of eGFR decline prior to graft failure was 7.3 ml/min/1.73 m(2) compared to 4.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in the transplant-naïve group (p < 0.001) and 0.35 ml/min/1.73 m(2) in recipients without graft failure (p < 0.001). Factors associated with eGFR decline were recipient age, decade of transplantation, HLA mismatch and histological evidence of chronic immunological injury.

Conclusions

Individuals with graft failure have a rapid decline in eGFR prior to dialysis commencement. To improve outcomes, dialysis planning and management of chronic kidney disease complications should be initiated earlier than in the transplant-naïve population.

### Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment and reimbursement of treatments for the management of chronic kidney disease [^115LTj8R]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (i.e. dialysis or a kidney transplant) is a serious but relatively rare consequence of CKD that occurs after many years in most patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) slope, a biomarker reflecting of changes in kidney function over time, has gained recent attention as a validated surrogate endpoint for CKD therapies with very strong evidence of its prediction of long-term patient-relevant kidney failure outcomes. The United States Food and Drug Agency (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have recently approved GFR slope as an acceptable primary endpoint for trials of CKD therapies.

Beyond licensing approval, most advanced healthcare systems impose an additional regulatory requirement–health technology assessment (HTA)–which must be met before therapies are funded. HTA seeks to assess the broader health value of new therapies, informing healthcare payers whether the therapy should be reimbursed, be that through a public funding or a social insurance system. Alongside the licensing requirements of efficacy and safety, HTA agencies typically require the additional evidentiary criteria of comparative effectiveness (i.e. does the therapy provide sufficient health benefit over the longer term compared to standard of care?) and incremental cost-effectiveness (i.e. does this benefit relative to the cost of therapy represent good value for money?).

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^1152GWEz]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Residual kidney function in dialysis — background and rationale: Recent data support the notion that RKF is an important predictor of survival and delivered Kt/Vurea can be adjusted to reflect the presence of renal function; RKF is an important contributor to dialysis adequacy, and adequacy was shown to impact on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, and in contrast to HD, RKF provides continuous clearance of both small and large solutes and helps attenuate the large fluctuations in fluid balance and blood pressure that are more pronounced in anuric patients.

### Variability in estimated glomerular filtration rate values is a risk factor in chronic kidney disease progression among patients with diabetes [^116HjnNb]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, this study provides support for evaluating eGFR variability as an independent risk factor of dialysis/death, regardless of CKD stage. It has important clinical implication because patients may benefit from monitoring of eGFR variability in addition to their rates of eGFR decline.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to RRT, indications, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate dialysis in the presence ≥ 1 of the following, often but not invariably occurring in the glomerular filtration range of 5–10 mL/min/1.73 m²:

- symptoms or signs attributable to kidney failure, such as neurological signs and symptoms attributable to uremia, pericarditis, anorexia, medically resistant acid-based or electrolyte abnormalities, intractable pruritus, serositis, and acid-base or electrolyte abnormalities

- inability to control volume status or BP

- progressive deterioration in nutritional status refractory to dietary intervention, or cognitive impairment.

### Trends in timing of dialysis and incidence of end-stage kidney disease… [^112F4G2E]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

This cohort study of 983 122 individuals in the initial 3-year interval to 1 844 317 individuals in the final interval used data from a large, integrated health care delivery system in Northern California and found that an increase in the number of individuals starting dialysis with an eGFR of 10 to 24 mL/min/1. 73 m2 was associated with changes over time in the likelihood of receiving dialysis at this eGFR independent of the number of people in the underlying population who had this same eGFR. In the last 2 decades, there have been notable changes in the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate at which patients initiate long-term dialysis in the US and around the world. How changes over time in the likelihood of dialysis initiation at any given eGFR level in at-risk patients are associated with the population burden of end-stage kidney disease has not been not well defined.

Main Outcomes and Measures One-year risk of initiating long-term dialysis stratified by eGFR levels. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess temporal trends in each 3-year cohort with adjustment for age, sex, race, and diabetes status. The potential change in dialysis initiation in the final cohort was estimated using the relative difference between the standardized risks in the initial cohort and the final cohort. In the last 2 decades, there have been notable changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate at which long-term dialysis is initiated in the US and around the world. 1 For example, according to the nationally comprehensive US Renal Data System registry, the proportion of new patients with end-stage. By contrast, among patients with very low index eGFR, we observed stable or decreased unadjusted and adjusted odds of initiating dialysis over time.

These patterns were similar among the subset of patients with elective dialysis starts. to an emphasis on recommending a "healthy/timely" dialysis, 1 which included efforts to promote the placement of arteriovenous fistulas at higher eGFR levels. 34 This may have contributed to patients accepting dialysis at relatively higher eGFR levels during the present study period, especially if they had a mature arteriovenous fistula and symptoms that are challenging to manage medically.

### The effect of a lower target blood pressure on the progression of kidney disease: long-term follow-up of the modification of diet in renal disease study [^115FvR8H]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a risk factor for progression of chronic kidney disease. The optimal blood pressure to slow progression is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of a low target blood pressure on kidney failure and all-cause mortality.

Design

Long-term follow-up of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study, a randomized, controlled trial conducted from 1989 to 1993.

Setting

15 outpatient nephrology practices.

Participants

840 persons with predominantly nondiabetic kidney disease and a glomerular filtration rate of 13 to 55 mL/min per 1.73 m².

Intervention

A low target blood pressure (mean arterial pressure < 92 mm Hg) or a usual target blood pressure (mean arterial pressure < 107 mm Hg).

Measurements

After the randomized trial was completed, kidney failure (defined as initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation) and a composite outcome of kidney failure or all-cause mortality were ascertained through 31 December 2000.

Results

Kidney failure occurred in 554 participants (66%), and the composite outcome occurred in 624 participants (74%). After Cox proportional hazards modeling and intention-to-treat analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.68 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82; P < 0.001) for kidney failure and 0.77 (CI, 0.65 to 0.91; P = 0.0024) for the composite outcome in the low target blood pressure group compared with the usual target blood pressure group. Evidence was insufficient to conclude that the benefit of a low target blood pressure differed according to the cause of kidney disease, baseline glomerular filtration rate, or degree of proteinuria.

Limitations

The exact mechanism underlying the benefit of a low target blood pressure is unknown.

Conclusions

Assignment to a low target blood pressure slowed the progression of nondiabetic kidney disease in patients with a moderately to severely decreased glomerular filtration rate.

### The ratio of measured to estimated glomerular filtration rate may be a marker of early mortality and dialysis requirement [^116NZtzC]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Unplanned dialysis initiation (DI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Since the association is believed to be causal, physicians generally try to avoid it by planning DI in a timely manner. The prescription of maintenance dialysis is usually based on clinical problems combined with current eGFR. We hypothesized that a measurement of the ratio of mGFR to eGFR (M/E) would provide supplementary information, independent of eGFR, in predicting requirement for dialysis.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^111xF4ad]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Research recommendations of interest — Less critical issues include the development of prediction instruments to allow estimation of time to symptomatic kidney failure on the basis of serial GFR estimates, and less critical questions include measurement of patient preferences about the tradeoffs between the burdens and benefits of earlier therapy; investigation of dialysis creatinine kinetics would help assess the effect of muscle mass on outcome and compare somatic with visceral body mass as risk factors for survival, and studies of large patient populations to correlate urine output with RKF would help determine whether urine volume-related cutoff values for ignoring RKF are useful; although potential insults listed in CPR Table 16 are known to injure normal and partially damaged native kidneys, little is known about the threshold concentrations and duration of exposure required to incite each insult in patients with CKD stage 5, it is unlikely that controlled clinical trials will appear in the near future; therefore, observational studies are encouraged; the benefits of RKF may relate more to renal mass than urine volume, this possibility should be considered in outcome studies, and correlating kidney size with RKF may help determine whether RKF is predictable based on size.

Uncertainties about initiation of kidney replacement therapies and research priorities

A recent meta-analysis of cohort studies and trials has demonstrated that those who commence dialysis with a higher eGFR have a higher mortality. It is likely that this is due to reverse causality, with frailty and accumulated comorbidities, in particular HF, pushing the patient and clinician to initiate dialysis. Global differences exist in how planned KRT is initiated. These include a "PD first" approach, commencement with a functioning arteriovenous fistula and differences in site of fistula placement and "incremental" start to dialysis with either reduced blood flow rates, reduced hours, or limited PD exchanges. To which extent these factors influence outcomes is largely unclear. The indication for initiation of dialysis should be recorded routinely in registry data in addition to reporting elective versus unplanned start to dialysis. In the IDEAL study the majority of patients allocated to late start who started early had the indication for start identified as "uremia". Hence, it would be useful to understand the spectrum of symptoms that prompted initiation of dialysis to provide greater clarity regarding the optimum commencement. Research recommendations are summarized in Table 6.

### Initiation of dialysis at higher GFRs: is the apparent rising tide of early dialysis harmful or helpful? [^113VaaTU]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Over the past decade a trend of increasing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the initiation of dialysis for treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been noted in the United States. In 1996, only 19% of patients began dialysis therapy with an eGFR of greater than 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 (denoted as 'early start'), but by 2005 the fraction of early start dialysis patients had risen to 45%. This review examines US dialysis data, national guidelines, and publications relevant to the early start phenomenon. It is not known whether early start of dialysis is beneficial, harmful or neutral with respect to the outcome of dialysis treatment for ESRD. Available data indicate that mortality while on dialysis therapy may be higher in those subjects with early start. Comorbidities present at the time of dialysis initiation do not appear to be a major driving force for early start patients. As well, residual kidney function in these patients is a major contributor to total urea or creatinine clearance. This can be a positive factor for patient outcomes and might be compromised by early start. Finally, we estimate the dollar cost of early start to the US Medicare-supported ESRD program. Properly designed, prospective and randomized studies may help to clarify the benefit or harm of early start of dialysis for ESRD.

### Trajectories of kidney function decline in the 2 years before initiation of long-term dialysis [^117H3ZR3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about patterns of kidney function decline leading up to the initiation of long-term dialysis.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

5,606 Veterans Affairs patients who initiated long-term dialysis in 2001–2003.

Predictor

Trajectory of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during the 2-year period before initiation of long-term dialysis.

Outcomes & Measurements

Patient characteristics and care practices before and at the time of dialysis initiation and survival after initiation.

Results

We identified 4 distinct trajectories of eGFR during the 2-year period before dialysis initiation: 62.8% of patients had persistently low level of eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean eGFR slope, 7.7 ± 4.7 [SD] mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), 24.6% had progressive loss of eGFR from levels of approximately 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m2 (mean eGFR slope, 16.3 ± 7.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), 9.5% had accelerated loss of eGFR from levels > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean eGFR slope, 32.3 ± 13.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), and 3.1% experienced catastrophic loss of eGFR from levels > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 within 6 months or less. Patients with steeper eGFR trajectories were more likely to have been hospitalized and have an inpatient diagnosis of acute kidney injury. They were less likely to have received recommended predialysis care and had a higher risk of death in the first year after dialysis initiation.

Conclusions

There is substantial heterogeneity in patterns of kidney function loss leading up to the initiation of long-term dialysis perhaps calling for a more flexible approach toward preparing for end-stage renal disease.

### The French chronic kidney disease-renal epidemiology and information network (CKD-REIN) cohort study [^112hLBKA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined since 2002 by the presence of kidney damage or reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), affects ∼10% of the adult population worldwide and more than one-third of the elderly. A recent large meta-analysis of 46 general population, high risk and CKD cohorts, including more than 2 million participants, showed that both low estimated GFR (eGFR) and high albuminuria were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) regardless of age. Despite the consistency of CKD-associated risk estimates across cohorts, one of the most striking epidemiological observations remains the contrast between the small geographic variation in CKD prevalence and the large variation in ESRD incidence, three times higher, for example, in the USA than in Europe. Whether this results from differences in genetic or environment-related risk factors or clinical practice is unexplained.

ESRD is a major outcome of CKD, with an important effect on mortality, morbidity, quality of life and health resource utilization. In France, the overall incidence of treated ESRD was 149 per million population (pmp) in 2011 and rose 7% since 2007, mainly due to population growth and ageing. Advanced CKD, defined by an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and the transition to ESRD constitute high clinical risk situations with substantial healthcare costs, but remain understudied. In 2010, 20% of all patients starting haemodialysis versus 5% of those starting peritoneal dialysis had no prior nephrology care. A most concerning issue is the high proportion of emergency dialysis (∼30%). A greater understanding of individual, provider and healthcare system determinants is needed to reduce this risk.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^113qh7Fk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Timing of therapy (CPG 1.3) — initiation of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is based on the assumption that overall kidney function correlates with GFR, and caregivers should be alert to signs of declining health and initiate KRT earlier in such patients; they should consider that dialysis therapy is not innocuous and does not replace all functions of the kidney and that HD-related hypotension may accelerate the loss of RKF. Even when GFR is greater than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, individual uraemic manifestations may warrant consideration, but these considerations necessitate conservative management until GFR decreases to less than 15 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, unless there are specific indications to initiate dialysis therapy. Thus, the recommended timing is a compromise designed to maximize patient QOL while avoiding complications, with theoretical considerations supporting initiation at approximately 10 mL/min/1.73 m2; in 2003, mean estimated GFR at initiation was 9.8 mL/min/ 1.73 m2, with lower average values (~7 to 9 mL/min/1.73 m2) for young and middle-aged adults.

Hemodialysis initiation — kidney function estimation in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) should not rely on a specific estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level; serum creatinine–based equations are influenced by muscle mass and cohorts link higher eGFR at dialysis start with higher mortality without a similar signal using measured clearances. The Work Group elected not to recommend a specific GFR estimating equation for advanced CKD and favored not recommending routine 24-hour urine collections, while recognizing possible utility when uremic symptoms are discordant with measured kidney function.

### Experiences of individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: a qualitative study [^11697QA7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background of study

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects a growing proportion of the Chinese population, increasing from 10.8% in 2012 to 12.5% in 2022, with an estimated 850,000 individuals requiring maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) due to kidney failure in China. Kidney failure, defined by a glomerular filtration rate below 15 ml/min/1.73 m² or the necessity for dialysis, represents the terminal stage of CKD and is linked to high rates of morbidity and mortality. As CKD advances to kidney failure, patients must undergo kidney replacement therapy (KRT), which includes hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation, or opt for conservative management to sustain life. KRT plays a crucial role in eliminating metabolic waste and excess fluid, correcting electrolyte imbalances, and supporting survival when renal function is severely impaired. The latest kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines advocate for a patient-centered, individualized approach to initiating and managing KRT. Hemodialysis, in particular, is a life-sustaining intervention that typically requires at least three sessions per week to ensure adequate dialysis clearance.

The outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in late 2019 and its rapid spread throughout China prompted the government to adopt stringent measures and implement a "zero-COVID-19" policy aimed at halting viral transmission. This policy remained in effect until January 8, 2023. The pandemic introduced additional complications as authorities enforced lockdowns, prioritized COVID-19 treatment, and restricted public transportation services. At the onset of the pandemic, regions including mainland China, Australia, and New Zealand enacted strict containment measures to minimize infection risks and prevent healthcare system overload. Although the "zero-COVID" strategy was intended to safeguard public health and reduce viral spread, it simultaneously created substantial challenges in healthcare accessibility for individuals undergoing dialysis. In August 2021, the concept of "dynamic zero-COVID" emerged, signaling a shift toward a more flexible and adaptive policy framework in mainland China.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^114W85y1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Main text

Current nephrology guidelines recommend an age-neutral approach to chronic kidney disease (CKD) management based upon the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. Nephrology referrals are recommended for patients with estimated glomerulofiltration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2, abrupt sustained fall in eGFR (Acute Kidney Injury – AKI), albumin to creatinine ratio of > 300 mg/gm. or rapid progression of renal failure, as defined by a sustained decline in renal function of > 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year. This approach may need to be modified, as there are large differences in prognosis and the trajectory of illness for older and younger adults with similar levels of eGFR. As compared with younger adults, older adults with advanced kidney disease lose their renal function more slowly, have multiple other comorbidities, and face a substantially higher competing risk of death (from comorbidities) before being required to make a decision regarding the initiation of dialysis.

Dialysis initiation trends have led to earlier initiation, that is, starting dialysis at higher levels of eGFR. Because of this trend, many older adults who may have otherwise died from non-renal failure issues are faced with a decision regarding dialysis. Between 1996 and 2009 the percent of "early", at eGFR > 10 ml/min/1.73 m 2, US dialysis starts in older adults increased from 25% to 62%. Several recent observational studies using US and other countries' dialysis registry data and one randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate a survival benefit for "early start" dialysis. These studies provide support for recent guidelines, which recommend deferring dialysis until patients have low levels of eGFR (≤ 6 ml/min/1.73 m 2) unless a patient is symptomatic at a higher eGFR level. Although there is agreement that a patient's symptoms should be the primary determinant for starting dialysis, eGFR remains a primary consideration for many nephrologists and symptoms that drive the decision to start dialysis are generally non specific and not life threatening.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^113BjXZQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Commentary and clinical utility for timing dialysis — The evidence available to inform recommendations about the timing of initiation of dialysis remains limited, and the KDOQI Work Group agrees that initiation of dialysis should be informed by multiple dimensions of a patient's health and livelihood, with symptoms assessed regularly and considered during the shared decision-making process of determining the time to initiate dialysis; the KDIGO guidelines continue to expound on considering initiation of dialysis as "early" or "late" defined by eGFR, but a consideration may be to abandon the labels of early or late and recognize that 1 factor (eg, eGFR) is insufficient, and if no difference in outcomes based on the timing of initiation has been identified, then the reason for characterizing initiation as early or late comes into question; the final practice point is revised to emphasize the role of vascular access planning and introduces the consideration of kidney failure risk prognosis, with preliminary research aligning with a 2-year risk of > 40% and reporting that the combination of eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 and risk ≥ 20% have a strong association with dialysis initiation and use of a vascular access, and the guidelines suggest that the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calculating the risk of kidney failure although implementation of the KFRE within the EHR remains variable across health systems.

### Survival among older adults with kidney failure is better in the first three years with chronic dialysis treatment than not [^116pKiJG]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Comparisons of survival between dialysis and nondialysis care for older adults with kidney failure have been limited to those managed by nephrologists, and are vulnerable to lead and immortal time biases. So we compared time to all-cause mortality among older adults with kidney failure treated vs. not treated with chronic dialysis. Our retrospective cohort study used linked administrative and laboratory data to identify adults aged 65 or more years of age in Alberta, Canada, with kidney failure (2002–2012), defined by two or more consecutive outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 10 mL/min/1.73 m², spanning 90 or more days. We used marginal structural Cox models to assess the association between receipt of dialysis and all-cause mortality by allowing control for both time-varying and baseline confounders. Overall, 838 patients met inclusion criteria (mean age 79.1; 48.6% male; mean estimated glomerular filtration rate 7.8 mL/min/1.73m 2). Dialysis treatment (vs. no dialysis) was associated with a significantly lower risk of death for the first three years of follow-up (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% confidence interval 0.46–0.77]), but not thereafter (1.22 [0.69–2.17]). However, dialysis was associated with a significantly higher risk of hospitalization (1.40 [1.16–1.69]). Thus, among older adults with kidney failure, treatment with dialysis was associated with longer survival up to three years after reaching kidney failure, though with a higher risk of hospital admissions. These findings may assist shared decision-making about treatment of kidney failure.

### Long-term changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate in left ventricular assist device recipients: a longitudinal joint model analysis [^114Lmj59]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can be life‐saving medical therapy for individuals with advanced heart failure. Since 2006, > 33 000 patients have received LVADs in the United States, with ≈70% of newly implanted LVADs intended for life‐long use (destination therapy). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common comorbid condition among individuals with advanced heart failure. Advanced CKD is a relative contraindication to LVAD implantation because of concerns for poor outcomes accompanying chronically low glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These include poor survival, poor quality of life, and potential worsening of kidney disease necessitating dialysis. With the increased proportion of patients receiving LVADs as destination therapy, management of CKD in these patients will be of increasing clinical focus.

Prior literature mostly focuses on the presence of CKD before LVAD implantation as a risk factor for adverse kidney events in the initial weeks to months after LVAD implantation. There are less published data about longer‐term risk. Several studies have shown an initial improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after LVAD implantation followed by a subsequent decline over the next several months. There are only limited data on long‐term changes in eGFR, need for kidney replacement therapy, and survival, which are critical elements to patients and programs for making allocation decisions. To our knowledge, no studies to date have accounted for the competing risks of death and heart transplantation when describing changes in GFR over time, a limitation that may bias results.

The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal changes in eGFR over the first 2 years following LVAD implantation while accounting for the competing risks of death and heart transplantation. These results will have important implications for understanding prognosis and patient selection for LVAD placement. Findings also have the potential to inform decisions surrounding heart versus combined heart and kidney transplantation by providing a better understanding of the trajectory of eGFR after restoration of cardiorenal hemodynamics.

### GFR at initiation of dialysis and mortality in CKD: a meta-analysis [^1161KR8H]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The proportion of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) initiating dialysis therapy at a higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has increased during the past decade. Recent data suggest that higher GFR may be associated with increased mortality.

Study Design

A meta-analysis of cohort studies and trials.

Setting & Population

Patients with advanced CKD.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, American Society of Nephrology abstracts, and bibliographies of retrieved articles to identify studies reporting on GFR at dialysis therapy initiation and mortality.

Predictor

Estimated or calculated GFR at dialysis therapy initiation.

Outcome

Pooled adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of continuous GFR for all-cause mortality.

Results

16 cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial were identified (n = 1,081,116). By meta-analysis restricted to 15 cohorts (n = 1,079,917), higher GFR at dialysis therapy initiation was associated with a higher pooled adjusted HR for all-cause mortality (1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.05; P < 0.001). However, there was significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 97%; P < 0.001). The association persisted among the 9 cohorts that adjusted analytically for nutritional covariates (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02–1.04; P < 0.001; residual I(2) = 97%). The highest mortality risk was observed in hemodialysis cohorts (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.08; P < 0.001), whereas there was no association between GFR and mortality in peritoneal dialysis cohorts (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99–1.08, P = 0.1; residual I(2) = 98%). Finally, higher GFR was associated with a lower mortality risk in cohorts that calculated GFR (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71–0.91; P = 0.003), contrasting with a higher mortality risk in cohorts that estimated GFR (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03–1.05; P < 0.001; residual I(2) = 97%).

Limitations

Paucity of randomized controlled trials, different methods for determining GFR, and substantial heterogeneity.

Conclusions

Higher estimated rather than calculated GFR at dialysis therapy initiation is associated with a higher mortality risk in patients with advanced CKD, independent of nutritional status. Although there was substantial heterogeneity of effect size estimates across studies, this observation requires further study.

### Treatment strategies of the thromboembolic risk in kidney failure patients with atrial fibrillation [^116NHrCZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is defined as severely reduced when it decreases to < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2. This stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as kidney failure and identified as CKD G5 if the patient is not on dialysis or CKD G5D if the patient is on dialysis. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in kidney failure patients is high and probably underestimated due to the high rate of intradialytic AF episodes that often remain undiagnosed. In fact, haemodialysis (HD) session may be a trigger of arrhythmias due to the large and abrupt HD-related volume and electrolyte changes. In 2020 the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) reported a prevalence of AF of 21% in patients on HD and 13% in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis. A meta-analysis including 25 studies conducted in HD patients showed that ≈12% (range 4.5–27%) of the patients had AF.

The presence of AF among patients with kidney failure is associated with an increase in all-cause mortality {hazard ratio [HR] 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–2.31]} and cardiovascular mortality [HR 2.15 (95% CI 1.27–3.64)] compared with patients without AF. The USRDS registry reports a 2-year mortality rate of 45% in HD patients with AF and 28% in those without AF.

The major concern for all patients with AF is the increased risk of embolic stroke, and this also applies to HD patients. A recently published Scottish study showed that in patients receiving kidney replacement therapy between January 1996 and December 2016, the incidence of stroke was 2- to 4-fold higher compared with the general population and was associated with a poor prognosis. A more than doubled prevalence of stroke (5.2 versus 1.9 events/100 patients/year) and an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.5 for new-onset cerebral infarction were demonstrated in CKD G5D patients with AF compared with patients without AF. Older age, diabetes mellitus, higher blood pressure, malnutrition and inflammatory markers were the factors most strongly associated with ischaemic stroke.

### National Kidney Foundation K / DOQI clinical practice guidelines for nutrition in chronic renal failure [^1176f2EA]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Renal Failure was recently published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases. This publication provides 27 clinical practice guidelines for adults and 10 clinical practice guidelines for children. The adult guidelines focus primarily on patients undergoing maintenance dialysis therapy, although there are several clinical practice guidelines on nutritional issues for patients with advanced chronic renal failure (CRF) not undergoing dialysis therapy. The pediatric guidelines focus entirely on children undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. The present article discusses a number of the more prominent clinical practice guidelines for the adults. Among these is the recommendation that the protein-energy nutritional status in these patients should be assessed by a panel of measures rather than by any single measure. Also, non-dialyzed patients with advanced CRF (ie, glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL/min) and those undergoing maintenance hemodialysis or chronic peritoneal dialysis should be prescribed a dietary energy intake of 35 kcal/kg/day for patients who are < 60 years of age and 30 kcal/kg for patients ≥ 60 years of age. Maintenance hemodialysis patients should be prescribed 1.2 g protein/kg/d; chronic peritoneal dialysis patients should be prescribed 1.2 to 1.3 g protein/kg/d. For non-dialyzed patients with CRF (glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL/min), 0.60 g protein/kg/d should be prescribed. For patients who will not accept such a diet or are unable to maintain an adequate energy intake on that diet, a protein intake of up to 0.75 g protein/kg/d may be prescribed. At least 50% of the protein intake for all of these patients should be of high biologic value. A guideline concerning indications for inaugurating maintenance dialysis treatment or renal transplantation on the basis of deteriorating nutritional status is also given.

### The impact of multidisciplinary pre-dialysis care on the outcomes of incident peritoneal dialysis patients [^114vRD1o]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by reduced glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria or structural kidney disease, is an important global health issue with the prevalence around 12–16% and high associated mortality. CKD is generally progressive and irreversible, and could progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients with ESKD require renal replacement therapy to maintain their lives. Because of a shortage of organ donation, the majority of ESKD patients in Taiwan undergo maintenance dialysis, including hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). PD is cost-effective dialysis modality associated with better preservation of residual renal function compared to HD. However, the majority of ESKD patients in Taiwan received HD rather than PD. A higher technique failure rate and a higher risk of peritonitis in patients treated with PD compared to those treated with HD are major challenges for caring PD patients.

As patients with CKD usually have multiple coexisting comorbidities, a coordinated multidisciplinary care may be needed to improve the management and outcome of these patients. A nationwide multidisciplinary pre-dialysis care (MDPC) program has been established since November 2006 in Taiwan to improve the quality and outcomes of pre-dialysis care. The team of MDPC consists of nephrologists, dietitians and nurses and provides standardized pre-dialysis education according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. Dietitians provide dietary consultation. Nurses of case management contact patients to ensure regular follow-up and deliver knowledge of nutrition, life style modification, nephrotoxin avoidance, medication, risk factors and complications of kidney disease, pre-dialysis preparation, and dialysis modality every 1–3 months. The benefits, disadvantages and self-care for different renal replacement modalities are explained. However, studies about the impact of MDPC on the outcome of PD patients are limited. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of MDPC on the risks of post-dialysis peritonitis, technique failure and mortality in PD patients using recent data at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.

### Pre-dialysis decline of measured glomerular filtration rate but not serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate is a risk factor for mortality on dialysis [^1112LifG]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Monitoring of renal function is important in patients with chronic kidney disease progressing towards end-stage renal failure, both for timing the start of renal replacement therapy and for determining the prognosis on dialysis. Thus far, studies on associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements in the pre-dialysis stage and mortality on dialysis have shown no or even inverse relations, which may result from the poor validity of serum creatinine-based estimation equations for renal function in pre-dialysis patients. As decline in renal function may be better reflected by the mean of the measured creatinine and urea clearance based on 24-h urine collections (mGFR by C Cr-U), we hypothesize that in patients with low kidney function, a fast mGFR decline is a risk factor for mortality on dialysis, in contrast to a fast eGFR decline.

Methods

For 197 individuals, included from the multicentre NECOSAD cohort, pre-dialysis annual decline of mGFR and eGFR was estimated with linear regression, and classified according to KDOQI as fast (> 4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year) or slow (≤ 4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year). Cox regression was used to adjust for potential confounders.

Results

Patients with a fast mGFR decline had an increased risk of mortality on dialysis: crude hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95% confidence interval: 1.13–2.98), adjusted HR 1.94 (1.11–3.36). In contrast, no association was found between a fast eGFR decline in the pre-dialysis phase and mortality on dialysis: crude HR 1.20 (0.75–1.89), adjusted HR 1.14 (0.67–1.94).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the importance of mGFR decline (by C Cr-U) as opposed to eGFR decline in patients with low kidney function, and gives incentive for repeated mGFR measurements in patients on pre-dialysis care.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate at dialysis initiation and subsequent decline in residual kidney function among incident hemodialysis patients [^1124GkL1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis initiation, known as earlier start of dialysis, is often a surrogate of poor outcomes including higher mortality. We hypothesized that earlier dialysis initiation is associated with a faster decline in residual kidney function (RKF), which is also associated with higher mortality among incident hemodialysis (HD) patients.

Methods

In a cohort of 4911 incident HD patients who initiated HD over a 5-year period (July 2001 to June 2006), we examined the trajectories of RKF, ascertained by renal urea clearance (KRU), over 2years after HD initiation across strata of eGFR at HD initiation using case-mix adjusted linear mixed-effect models. We then investigated the association between annual change in RKF and mortality using Cox proportional hazard models.

Results

The median (interquartile range) baseline KRU was 2.20 (1.13–3.63) mL/min/1.73m2. The decline of KRU was faster in patients who initiated HD at higher eGFR. The relative changes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in KRU at 1year after HD initiation were -1.29 (-1.28 to -1.30), -1.17 (-1.16 to -1.18), -1.11 (-1.10 to -1.12) and -0.78 (-0.78 to -0.79) mL/min/1.73m2 in the eGFR categories of ≥ 10, 8- < 10, 6- < 8 and < 6mL/min/1.73m2, respectively. The faster decline of KRU at 1year was associated with higher all-cause mortality (reference: ≥ 0mL/min/1.73m2): hazard ratios (95% CIs) for change in KRU of -1.5 to < 0, -3 to less than -1.5 and less than -3mL/min/1.73m2 were 1.20 (1.03–1.40), 1.42 (1.17–1.72) and 1.88 (1.47–2.40), respectively.

Conclusions

The faster decline of RKF happens with earlier dialysis initiation and is associated with higher all-cause mortality.

### Decline in glomerular filtration rate as an endpoint in heart failure clinical trials: challenges and solutions [^112yjei2]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease are tightly interconnected, with common mechanisms that underlie the development and progression of both diseases, recently articulated into the framework of the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome. CKD and heart failure commonly coexist in the same individual, with increasing evidence for common therapies in both disease states. It is valuable for patients, clinicians, and regulatory agencies to understand how to best assess CKD progression in patients with heart failure for evaluation of individual patients and as part of an endpoint for outcome trials. Given the relatively short duration of most heart failure outcome trials, early measures of CKD progression prior to the occurrence of clinical events of kidney replacement therapy would be desirable. Such surrogate measures include slowing of the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline either computed as annualized mean change in GFR (GFR slope) or time to substantial declines in GFR by specified threshold percentages (40% or 50% GFR decline). Regulatory agencies accept these endpoints for full drug approval which has enabled progress in design and conduct of trials for CKD progression. Application of these endpoints in heart failure outcome trials has the potential for similar progress. However, an immediate reduction in GFR is common following initiation of several of the guideline directed therapy for heart failure. Understanding how to best interpret an immediate GFR reduction vs long term kidney benefit is critical to optimal assessment of endpoint in an outcome trial and in the use of these medications for management of patients with heart failure. Here, the intersection of heart failure and CKD is described, how GFR and its change over time are assessed in both individual patients and in interventional trials, the evidence supporting use of GFR changes as endpoints in CKD progression trials, and the challenges and possible solutions for the use of GFR as endpoint in heart failure outcome trials and for care of individual patients, guided by case studies to inform the discussion.

### Effect of statins on kidney disease outcomes: a Systematic Review and meta-analysis [^113CCJ6D]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of statin administration on kidney disease outcomes remain controversial. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of statins on kidney outcomes.

Study Design

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using MEDLINE (1946 to August 31, 2015), EMBASE (1966 to August 31, 2015), and the Cochrane Library database (no date restriction).

Setting & Population

Adults who were not receiving dialysis, for whom kidney disease outcomes were reported.

Selection Criteria For Studies

RCTs in which statins were given for at least 6 months and kidney outcomes were measured.

Intervention

Statins versus control, including placebo, usual care, and different types or doses of statins.

Outcomes

Kidney failure events, rate of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) per year, change in proteinuria or albuminuria, and, in patients with chronic kidney disease, major cardiovascular events.

Results

57 eligible studies with 143,888 participants were included. Statin treatment did not produce an apparent beneficial effect for kidney failure events (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87–1.10; P = 0.7) or end-stage renal disease events (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90–1.07; P = 0.7). However, mean difference for rate of decline in eGFR (0.41 [95% CI, 0.11–0.70] mL/min/1.73m(2) per year slower in statin recipients) and standardized mean difference for change in proteinuria or albuminuria (-0.65 [95% CI, -0.94 to -0.37] standard deviation units, statin recipients vs controls) were statistically significant. In addition, statin therapy significantly reduced the risk for cardiovascular events (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61–0.79; P < 0.001) in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Limitations

Inclusion of several post hoc analyses from large RCTs and substantial heterogeneity in secondary outcome analyses.

Conclusions

Statin therapy does not reduce the risk for kidney failure events in adults not receiving dialysis for whom kidney disease outcomes were reported, but may modestly reduce proteinuria and rate of eGFR decline.

### Decline in glomerular filtration rate during pre-dialysis phase and survival on chronic renal replacement therapy [^112sRGvX]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is widely used in follow-up and assessment of patients before start of chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT). Reported data on impact of eGFR decline pattern during pre-dialysis phase on consequent survival on RRT are, however, non-existent.

Methods

Using the database of the Finnish Registry for Kidney Diseases, we conducted a cohort study of all incident adult patients (n = 457) entering chronic RRT in Finland in 1998, with follow-up until 31 December 2008. We included those (n = 319) with three serum creatinine measurements (at ∼12 and 3 months and 1 to 2 weeks prior to RRT start) and calculated their slopes of eGFR using the modification of diet in renal disease formula. According to eGFR slopes (in mL/min/1.73m(2)/year), patients were divided into tertiles: most rapid (> 8.5, n = 107), intermediate (3.4–8.5, n = 107) and slowest decline (< 3.4, n = 105).

Results

Median survival time was 5.6 (95% confidence interval 4.2–7.0) years. Compared to the patient group with the slowest eGFR decline, age- and gender-adjusted relative risk of death was 1.1 (0.8–1.5) in the intermediate group and 1.7 (1.2–2.4, P = 0.002) in the most rapid decline group. When further adjusting for kidney disease diagnosis, comorbidities, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, body mass index, blood haemoglobin and serum albumin, the association was no longer significant.

Conclusions

Rapid decline in eGFR before entering chronic RRT associates with increased mortality on RRT. The elevated mortality appears to be caused by known risk factors for death on RRT.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^115tCHtg]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Residual kidney function (RKF) and incremental hemodialysis (HD) — Some patients with slowly progressive kidney disease might benefit from incremental dialysis frequency with initiation of HD at a frequency < 3 times per week, and studies are needed to determine whether this practice would help preserve RKF in those with significant urine output or a marginally functional renal allograft; additionally, RKF imparts a stronger survival advantage than dose of dialysis, and investigations should explore potential kidney synthetic functions that may provide survival benefits not explained by level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

### Is the decline of renal function different before and after the start of dialysis? [^117H61Ud]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of glomerular filtration in dialysis patients is associated with improved survival and quality of life. This study explores the time course of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 1 year before and 1 year after the start of haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).

Methods

This study included 1861 incident dialysis patients (NECOSAD cohort; 62% male, 60 ± 15 years, 61% HD, GFR 5.2 ± 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). A decline of the GFR was estimated using linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, primary kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The rate of decline was allowed to change at a certain point in time.

Results

The decline of the GFR attenuated from -0.53 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/month (95% CI: -0.58, -0.48) in the period before the start of dialysis to -0.12 (95% CI: -0.20, -0.04) at 2–4 months of dialysis in all patients. In HD, decline attenuated from -0.51 (95% CI: -0.57, -0.44) to -0.14 (95% CI: -0.26, -0.02); in PD from -0.55 (95% CI: -0.62, -0.48) to -0.11 (95% CI: -0.23, 0.01). In patients who started dialysis with a GFR equal/above median GFR at dialysis start, the decline attenuated (at 3 months) from -0.70 (95% CI: -0.78; -0.62) to -0.21 (95% CI: -0.36; -0.05). In patients who started dialysis with a GFR below median GFR at dialysis start, the decline attenuated (at 1 month) from -0.73 (95% CI: -0.88; -0.58) to -0.04 (95% CI: -0.27, 0.19).

Conclusions

The apparent decline of the GFR slows down after 2–4 months of dialysis. This decline was similar in HD and PD patients, although at a different level of GFR. Further studies are needed to examine explanations for this phenomenon.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^114cyJ6m]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Residual kidney function (RKF) adjustments specify that the minimally adequate dose of dialysis can be reduced in patients with Kr greater than 2 mL/min/1.73 m2; in the absence of dose-ranging outcomes data, the minimum spKt/V target for patients with substantial RKF can be reduced, but the reduced target should be no lower than 60% of the minimum target for patients with no residual renal function; and when the minimally adequate dose is reduced because of substantial RKF, Kr should be monitored at least quarterly and as soon as possible after any event that might have acutely reduced RKF.

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease: executive summary and glossary from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes consensus conference [^112SwgYC]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Developing consistent, patient-centered and precise descriptions of kidney function and disease in the scientific literature is an important objective to align communication in clinical practice, research and public health. Although some terms have been in use for decades, the increased exchange of information among stakeholders makes it timely to revisit nomenclature in order to ensure consistency. The goal is to facilitate communication within and across disciplines and between practitioners and patients, with the ultimate hope of improving outcomes through consistency and precision.

Attendees at the conference included editors of kidney subspecialty journals, kidney subspecialty editors at general medical journals and journals from other subspecialties, experienced authors of clinical kidney health research and patients. The guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centered, precise and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines. The discussion focused on general description of acute and CKD and kidney measures, rather than specific kidney diseases and particular measures of function and structure. Classifications of causes of kidney disease and procedures, performance measures and outcome metrics for dialysis and transplantation were considered beyond the scope of discussion.

As described in detail in the conference report, the meeting attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations: (i) to use 'kidney' rather than 'renal' or 'nephro-' when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use 'kidney failure' with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs and treatment rather than 'end-stage kidney disease' (ESKD); (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders and acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of these; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of CKD rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify it; and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rather than 'abnormal' or 'reduced' kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function (Table 1). Accordingly, the proposed glossary contains five corresponding sections, and comprises specific items for which there was general agreement among the conference participants (Table 2). For each section, the glossary includes preferred terms, abbreviations, descriptions and terms to avoid, with the acknowledgment that journals may choose which of the recommendations to implement, and that journal style will dictate when and how to abbreviate terms to be consistent with nomenclature for other diseases.

### Progression of chronic renal failure… [^112GzYTN]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic renal failure is characterized by a persistently abnormal glomerular filtration rate. It represents an evolving process that is initiated by various causes, all with the common end result of persistent and usually progressive damage of varying severity to the kidneys. However, the rate of decline, often referred to as progression, can vary substantially. The present article will discuss processes that affect progression after the initial renal insult has occurred. Early diabetic nephropathy is well known to be associated with an elevated GFR. 38–40 Experimentally, increased glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure and hyperfiltration occur due to a proportionally greater reduction in the afferent relative to efferent arteriolar resistance.

41 Indirect measurements suggest that glomerular capillary hypertension is present in human patients with diabetes as well, and there is also a correlation between urine albumin excretion and the glomerular pressure but not systemic pressure. Thus, as in the remnant kidney model, the glomerular hypertension in diabetic nephropathy itself propagates chronic GFR decline, at least partly by increasing protein leakage across the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman space. 42 Apart from increased glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure, cytokines activated by injury may counteract tonic mesangial cell contraction and also contribute to hyperfiltration.
43. In rat models, nitric oxide inhibition results in proteinuria, 79, 108 increased blood pressure, and decreased GFR independent of renal AII levels. 79 Collagen I expression is also increased, independent of systemic hemodynamics.

81 It has been suggested that nitric oxide inhibits collagen I expression in the renal vasculature, and the detrimental effects of endogenous AII are increased in states of low nitric oxide availability. Two chains, PDGF-A and PDGF-B, form the active homodimers or heterodimers. Experimentally, PDGF-BB, but not PDGF-AA, induces renal myofibroblast transdifferentiation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. 133 Platelet-derived growth factor BB has also been shown to increase the expression of type III collagen by tubular cells and by myofibroblasts. 57, 134 In rat anti-Thy1. 1 nephritis, transient antagonism of PDGF after disease induction prevented development of glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial damage, and collagen accumulation. 135.

### Treatment decisions for older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease [^116L5SYR]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical considerations for dialysis versus conservative management decisions [Table 1]

Rate of loss of renal function and the potential need for dialysis

Some older adults, when informed that they have advanced CKD, may assume that dialysis is inevitable [Fig. 1]. This diagnosis may be the result of a single eGFR that may not be reflective of the severity (a repeat eGFR may be lower) or the course of a patient's kidney disease. Patterns of eGFR may reflect intervals of stability, increases, decreases and slow or fast rates of change. The rate of decline in a patient's eGFR (their renal function decline, RFD) may be more important in determining a patient's prognosis than any single eGFR measure. Patterns of eGFR change are usually determined by slope analysis (least squares and Bayesian methodologies). As slope based methodologies to determine rates of renal decline are not readily available to clinicians, a simpler calculation uses a patient's initial and final or the average of first and last year's eGFRs to calculate their change in eGFR per year [Table 1]. This estimate makes several assumptions: a) that eGFR declines (increases and stable e GFRs are not uncommon; b) that eGFR approximates true GFR (this assumes stable muscle mass and the lack of an unusual dietary pattern or body habitus), c) that the eGFR declines linearly (non linear patterns may occur in 40% of patients); and c) that patients do not have episodes of AKI, during the measurement interval. Using this simple calculation, clinicians can determine whether a patient has a slow (< 3 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year) medium (> 3 and < 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year) or fast (≥ 5 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year) RFD (normal older adult RFD is approximately 1 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year) as one factor that may relate to a future need for dialysis [Table 1].

Most older adults with advanced CKD lose renal function at a slow rate, and two thirds may have stable renal function for several years. This slow rate of loss may relate to the fact that proteinuria is the main determinant of a fast RFD and that low proteinuric vascular nephropathy may account for 39% of the causes of advanced CKD in older adults. Nonproteinuric CKD with stable eGFR may be a common pattern for many older adults.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^116wakmY]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease affects 10–16% of the general adult population in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the United States. Chronic kidney disease, typically defined by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or albuminuria, is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and progression to end stage renal disease. Go and colleagues found in administrative healthcare data that estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were independently associated with hospitalisations, cardiovascular events, and death. In a collaborative meta-analysis of general population cohorts we found that mortality rises exponentially with decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while albuminuria shows linear association across its entire measurement range. Recent data indicate that the risk associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate is even stronger when glomerular filtration rate is estimated using the more accurate equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration.

Existing data regarding potential sex differences in the risk of chronic kidney disease suggest that women have a lower incidence of end stage renal disease, lower cardiovascular risk, and (in countries with low maternal mortality) lower risk of all-cause mortality than men. Whether sex differences exist with respect to estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes, and in particular whether such differences exist based on the combined effect of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, is largely unknown.

Given the clinical uncertainty, we sought to determine if sex modifies the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and end stage renal disease, using a global consortium of 46 cohorts and more than two million participants.

### How to preserve residual renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease and on dialysis? [^113GvP5E]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

A review is given on various aspects of GFR in patients with chronic kidney disease and in dialysis patients. These include the measurement of GFR, measures to preserve GFR in chronic kidney disease and dialysis, the importance of residual GFR in dialysis patients and factors that influence GFR in patients treated with haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

### The ratio of measured to estimated glomerular filtration rate may be a marker of early mortality and dialysis requirement [^114nbj4C]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that, in patients with CKD stage 5, measured GFR (mGFR), defined as the mean of urea and creatinine clearance, as measured by a 24-h urine collection, is a better measure of renal function than estimated GFR (eGFR), based on the CKD-EPI formula. This could be due to reduced muscle mass in this group. Its use is recommended in the ERBP guidelines. Unplanned dialysis initiation (DI) is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and reduced modality choice and is generally considered undesirable. We hypothesized that the ratio mGFR/eGFR (M/E) aids prediction of death and DI.

Methods

All 24-h measurements of urea and creatinine excretion were extracted from the clinical biochemistry databases in Zealand. Data concerning renal diagnosis, comorbidity, biochemistry, medical treatment, mortality and date of DI, were extracted from patient notes, the National Patient Registry and the Danish Nephrology Registry. Patients were included if their eGFR was < 30ml/min/1.73m 2. The last available value for each patient was included. Follow-up was 12months.

Results

One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients were included. M/E was median 0.91 ± 0.43. It was highly correlated to previous determinations. It was negatively correlated to eGFR, comorbidity, high age and female sex. It was positively related to albumin and negatively to C-reactive protein. M/E was higher in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and diuretics but no other treatment groups. On a multivariate analysis, M/E was negatively correlated with mortality and combined mortality/DI, but not DI. A post hoc analysis showed a negative correlation to DI at 3 months. For patients with an eGFR 10–15ml/min/1.73m 2, combined mortality and DI at 3 months was for low M/E (< 0.75) 36%, medium (0.75–1.25) 20%, high (> 1.25) 8%. A low M/E predicted increased need for unplanned DI. A supplementary analysis in 519 patients where body surface area values were available, allowing BSA-corrected M/E to be analyzed, revealed similar results.

Conclusion

A low mGFR/eGFR ratio is associated with comorbidity, malnutrition, and inflammation. It is a marker of early DI, mortality, and unplanned dialysis initiation, independently of eGFR, age and comorbidity. Particular attention paid to patients with a low M/E may lower the incidence of unplanned dialysis requirement.

### The estimation, measurement, and relevance of the glomerular filtration rate in stage 5 chronic kidney disease [^115r82EC]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered the best index of overall kidney function. The level of GFR is used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to classify them into CKD stages. Stage 5 CKD encompasses patients with a GFR below 15 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) and those requiring chronic dialysis. Preservation of GFR, even at its very low level, is of great importance in both dialysis and non-dialysis stage 5 CKD patients. Residual GFR is considered in the prescription of both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and interventions to preserve residual GFR are an active area of clinical research. The application of traditional methods of estimating and measuring GFR can be problematic in this patient population. This review will focus on the methods available to quantify GFR in stage 5 CKD and their use in both clinical and research settings.

### The glomerular filtration rate estimated by new and old equations as a predictor of important outcomes in elderly patients [^111wHY62]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem. First, dialysis and kidney transplantation impose a high cost on society. The cost of dialysis per patient per year in Belgium is more than 50,000 Euros, and > 1% of the health budget of the Belgian government is used to cover dialysis costs. Second, patients with CKD have a high risk for cardiovascular events and mortality. Therefore, many therapeutic and diagnostic drugs cannot be used or, if used, require dosing adaptation prior to use in patients with CKD.

The prevalence of CKD, when defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, increases with age. In Western countries, prevalence is approximately 10% at the age of 65 years and increases to 60% in individuals aged 80 years and older. The best method for estimating the GFR in older individuals remains unclear. Until recently, only limited validation of the equations used to estimate GFR in older individuals has been performed.

In 2012, three new GFR-estimating equations based on serum creatinine and serum cystatin C values, age, and gender were validated. Two of the studies were based on data from the CKD-EPI consortium (with only limited numbers of older persons), and one was based on data from the Berlin Initiative Study (with only persons aged 70 and older). However, the epidemiology of CKD in older individuals and the relationship between low eGFR and adverse outcomes determined using these new equations have not been investigated.

In this study, we used the data from the BELFRAIL study to analyze the ability of GFR, estimated by older equations like the MDRD and CKD-EPI creatinine equations and the three new GFR equations, to predict mortality, necessity of renal replacement therapy (RRT), hospitalization, and severe cardiovascular events.

### GFR decline as an alternative end point to kidney failure in clinical trials: a meta-analysis of treatment effects from 37 randomized trials [^115FNx41]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is increased interest in using alternative end points for trials of kidney disease progression. The currently established end points of end-stage renal disease and doubling of serum creatinine level, equivalent to a 57% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), are late events in chronic kidney disease (CKD), requiring large clinical trials with long follow-up. As part of a comprehensive evaluation of lesser declines in eGFR as alternative end points, we describe the consistency of treatment effects of intervention on the alternative and established end points in past trials.

Study Design

Diagnostic test study.

Setting & Population

9,488 participants from 37 randomized controlled trials of CKD progression across 5 intervention types.

Index Test

Alternative end points including percentage change in eGFR from baseline (20%, 30%, 40%, and 57%) throughout study duration and to 12, 18, and 24 months. eGFR change confirmed versus nonconfirmed at the next visit.

Reference Test

The historically established end point of time to composite of treated kidney failure (end-stage renal disease), untreated kidney failure (GFR < 15mL/min/1.73m(2)), or doubling of serum creatinine level throughout study duration.

Results

Over a median of 3.62 years' follow-up, there were 3,070 established end points. Compared to the established end point, the number of alternative end points was greater for smaller versus larger declines in eGFR and longer versus shorter follow-up intervals. There was a general trend toward attenuation of the treatment effect with end points defined by a lesser eGFR decline, with greater attenuation with nonconfirmed end points, except for the low-protein-diet intervention, for which a stronger treatment effect was observed. The ratio (95% credible interval) of the HR for the alternative to established end point for the 5 intervention types ranged from 0.91 (0.64–1.43) to 1.12 (0.89–1.40) for 40% decline and from 0.88 (0.63–1.39) to 1.15 (0.88–1.54) for 30% decline for the overall study duration, indicating consistency of treatment effects.

Limitations

Limited variety of interventions tested and low statistical power for many CKD clinical trials.

Conclusions

These results provide some support for the use of lesser eGFR declines as a surrogate end point, with stronger support for the 40% than 30% decline.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hemodialysis adequacy, update 2006 [^111GGPqC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Estimation of kidney function (CPG 1.2) — the section titled "Use of GFR-Estimating Equations and Clearances Rather Than Serum Creatinine to Guide Dialysis Initiation" states that "Variability in creatinine generation across the population makes serum creatinine level alone an inaccurate test for patients with kidney failure likely to benefit from dialysis treatment", and that "For most patients in CKD stages 4 and 5, estimating equations based on values of serum creatinine and other variables approximate GFR with adequate accuracy". Validated equations listed are, for "Age ≥ 18 Years", the "Cockcroft-Gault Equation", "MDRD 4 Variable Equation", and "MDRD 6 Variable Equation", and for "Age < 18 Years", the "Schwartz Formula", with "MDRD: Modification of diet in renal disease".

### Preserving residual renal function in dialysis: what we know [^1128Wek6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Residual renal function confers a survival benefit among dialysis patients thought to be related to greater volume removal and solute clearance. Whether the presence of residual renal function is protective or merely a marker for better health is not clear. The basic mechanisms governing the decline or persistence of residual renal function are poorly understood and few studies have examined the role of medical therapy in its preservation. Dialysis modality, inflammatory processes often associated with comorbid diseases (including diabetes mellitus and obesity), volume dysregulation, and vitamin D deficiency are predictive of residual renal function decline. We review potential mechanisms for preservation of remaining glomerular filtration rate among chronic dialysis patients.

### The risk of acute renal failure in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116CoNNh]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

Few studies have defined how the risk of hospital-acquired acute renal failure varies with the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is also not clear whether common factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and proteinuria increase the risk of nosocomial acute renal failure independent of GFR. To determine this we compared 1,746 hospitalized adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who developed dialysis-requiring acute renal failure with 600,820 hospitalized members who did not. Patient GFR was estimated from the most recent outpatient serum creatinine measurement prior to admission. The adjusted odds ratios were significantly and progressively elevated from 1.95 to 40.07 for stage 3 through stage 5 patients (not yet on maintenance dialysis) compared to patients with estimated GFR in the stage 1 and 2 range. Similar associations were seen after controlling for inpatient risk factors. Pre-admission baseline diabetes mellitus, diagnosed hypertension and known proteinuria were also independent risk factors for acute kidney failure. Our study shows that the propensity to develop in-hospital acute kidney failure is another complication of chronic kidney disease whose risk markedly increases even in the upper half of stage 3 estimated GFR. Several common risk factors for chronic kidney disease also increase the peril of nosocomial acute kidney failure.

### Timing of initiation of dialysis: time for a new direction? [^1163RDqo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The past 15 years have seen tremendous growth in the initiation of dialysis at higher levels of kidney function in the setting of mixed evidence and at great societal economic cost. We review recent data on the early dialysis initiation trend, the clinical and economic impact of early dialysis initiation and the future implications for the management of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent Findings

The percentage of patients who initiate dialysis with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) above 10 ml/min/1.73m(2) is now greater than 50%, including 20% who initiate with an eGFR above 15 ml/min/1.73m(2). The drivers behind these findings are probably diverse but recent literature does not seem to support a higher symptom burden among the ageing CKD population as the major cause. The Initiating Dialysis Early And Late (IDEAL) trial provides guidance on the safety of waiting for symptoms or lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate prior to beginning dialysis. In addition, economic analyses based on the IDEAL and US Renal Data System findings suggest that significant cost savings could be achieved by reversing the early initiation trend.

Summary

These findings should help clinicians and policy makers looking to rein in costs while maintaining the quality of CKD care.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^112Cphzd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

KDOQI hemodialysis adequacy — timing of hemodialysis initiation. Patients who reach chronic kidney disease stage 4 (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) should receive education about kidney failure and treatment options including kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis (PD), hemodialysis (HD) in the home or in-center, and conservative treatment, and family members/caregivers should also be educated (Not Graded). The decision to initiate maintenance dialysis should be based primarily on assessment of signs and/or symptoms associated with uremia, evidence of protein-energy wasting, and the ability to safely manage metabolic abnormalities and/or volume overload with medical therapy rather than on a specific level of kidney function in the absence of such signs and symptoms (Not Graded).

### Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and subsequent risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality [^111aLLFH]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The established chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression end point of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration (corresponding to a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of −57% or greater) is a late event.

Objective

To characterize the association of decline in estimated GFR with subsequent progression to ESRD with implications for using lesser declines in estimated GFR as potential alternative end points for CKD progression. Because most people with CKD die before reaching ESRD, mortality risk also was investigated.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Individual meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants with 12,344 ESRD events and 223,944 deaths from 35 cohorts in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with a repeated measure of serum creatinine concentration over 1 to 3 years and outcome data.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Transfer of individual participant data or standardized analysis of outputs for random-effects meta-analysis conducted between July 2012 and September 2013, with baseline estimated GFR values collected from 1975 through 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

End-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or transplantation) or all-cause mortality risk related to percentage change in estimated GFR over 2 years, adjusted for potential confounders and first estimated GFR.

Results

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ESRD and mortality were higher with larger estimated GFR decline. Among participants with baseline estimated GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the adjusted HRs for ESRD were 32.1 (95% CI, 22.3–46.3) for changes of −57% in estimated GFR and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.5–6.4) for changes of −30%. However, changes of −30% or greater (6.9% [95% CI, 6.4%-7.4%] of the entire consortium) were more common than changes of −57% (0.79% [95% CI, 0.52%-1.06%]). This association was strong and consistent across the length of the baseline period (1 to 3 years), baseline estimated GFR, age, diabetes status, or albuminuria. Average adjusted 10-year risk of ESRD (in patients with a baseline estimated GFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 99% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for estimated GFR change of −57%, was 83% (95% CI, 71%-93%) for estimated GFR change of −40%, and was 64% (95% CI, 52%-77%) for estimated GFR change of −30% vs 18% (95% CI, 15%-22%) for estimated GFR change of 0%. Corresponding mortality risks were 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%), 60% (95% CI, 56%-63%), and 50% (95% CI, 47%-52%) vs 32% (95% CI, 31%-33%), showing a similar but weaker pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Declines in estimated GFR smaller than a doubling of serum creatinine concentration occurred more commonly and were strongly and consistently associated with the risk of ESRD and mortality, supporting consideration of lesser declines in estimated GFR (such as a 30% reduction over 2 years) as an alternative end point for CKD progression.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for hemodialysis adequacy: 2015 update [^114UeM3b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Guideline 1.2 — starting kidney replacement therapy should not rely on an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) number alone but on symptoms and preferences: Symptoms of uremia are nonspecific, and attempts should be made to evaluate for other, sometimes reversible, causes of symptoms, and uremic symptoms can be subtle, with patients adapting to lower levels of functioning without clearly expressing symptoms. The decision to initiate KRT should not be based on estimated GFR (eGFR) level alone, and the balance among the benefits, risks, and disadvantages of initiating or not initiating dialysis should be evaluated, taking into account education received and preferences expressed by the patients and/or their caregivers. While no specific numeric threshold is endorsed, the Work Group noted there likely is a floor GFR below which KRT is required, and that there is a level at which delaying for KRT initiation versus electing for conservative care becomes imperative.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition support in adult acute and chronic renal failure [^113u8GTo]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2010). Medium credibility.

A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines — background on acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) describe terminology, causes, classification, and outcomes. The Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative Group recommended a change in terminology from acute renal failure to acute kidney injury (AKI). The major causes of AKI include sepsis, trauma, hypotension, intravenous contrast dye, medications, and preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite improvements in dialysis therapy and the delivery of nutrition support, the mortality of AKI continues in the range of 50%–60%. The evidence-based National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K-DOQI) guidelines classify CKD into 5 categories (I-V) based on measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR). According to the United States Renal Data System, the annual mortality for chronic dialysis patients exceeds 20%, and life expectancy of dialysis patients is 3–11 years shorter than the age-matched general population.

### A meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials for implications of acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate for long-term kidney protection [^115FeScN]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic interventions to slow chronic kidney disease progression, such as ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, often produce acute treatment effects on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that differ from their long-term chronic treatment effects. Observational studies assessing the implications of acute effects cannot distinguish acute effects from GFR changes unrelated to the treatment. Here, we performed meta-regression analysis of multiple trials to isolate acute effects to determine their long-term implications. In 64 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 154,045 participants, we estimated acute effects as the mean between-group difference in GFR slope from baseline to three months, effects on chronic GFR slope (starting at three months after randomization), and effects on three composite kidney endpoints defined by kidney failure (GFR 15 ml/min/1.73m 2 or less, chronic dialysis, or kidney transplantation) or sustained GFR declines of 30%, 40% or 57% decline, respectively. We used Bayesian meta-regression to relate acute effects with treatment effects on chronic slope and the composite kidney endpoints. Overall, acute effects were not associated with treatment effects on chronic slope. Acute effects were associated with the treatment effects on composite kidney outcomes such that larger negative acute effects were associated with lesser beneficial effects on the composite kidney endpoints. Associations were stronger when the kidney composite endpoints were defined by smaller thresholds of GFR decline (30% or 40%). Results were similar in a subgroup of interventions with supposedly hemodynamic effects that acutely reduce GFR. For studies with GFR 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 or under, negative acute effects were associated with larger beneficial effects on chronic GFR slope. Thus, our data from a large and diverse set of RCTs suggests that acute effects of interventions may influence the treatment effect on clinical kidney outcomes.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.
