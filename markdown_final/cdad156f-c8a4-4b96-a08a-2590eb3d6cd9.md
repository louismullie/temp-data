## Question

iv thrombolytic therapy in MI caused by cocaine us

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous thrombolytic therapy is indicated for cocaine-associated myocardial infarction, and if so, under what circumstances it should be used. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of cocaine-related MI and how it influences reperfusion strategy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about fibrinolysis versus primary PCI in STEMI, including any cocaine-specific nuances. Next, I will examine the evidence comparing fibrinolysis with PCI and weigh bleeding and efficacy trade-offs. After that, I need to check for any cocaine-specific contraindications or cautions that modify standard STEMI care. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-sensitive algorithm and state a clear bottom-line recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology, because that shapes whether thrombolysis is likely to help. Cocaine can precipitate myocardial ischemia and infarction through multiple mechanisms: increased myocardial oxygen demand via catecholamine surge, coronary vasospasm, and potent platelet activation with thrombus formation, so the ischemic substrate can be spasm, thrombosis, or both, and this mixed biology argues that some cases will respond to fibrinolysis while others will not [^112HjJid] [^113sH5cL] [^112j1aFa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should anchor on guideline-directed STEMI care before layering cocaine-specific issues. Contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA guidance recommend primary PCI as the preferred reperfusion strategy when available within 90–120 minutes, and if timely PCI is not feasible, fibrinolysis should be administered as soon as possible, ideally prehospital, within 12 hours of symptom onset in the absence of contraindications [^116FaRZ3] [^113L4QdV] [^1142BYBF].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness of PCI versus fibrinolysis, because that determines the default choice. Meta-analyses and randomized data consistently show lower short-term mortality, reinfarction, and stroke with primary PCI compared with thrombolysis, reinforcing PCI as first-line when available, while fibrinolysis remains an effective alternative when PCI cannot be delivered promptly [^114LDTLF] [^1142BYBF].

> I need to ensure I am not missing cocaine-specific contraindications to fibrinolysis. Initially, I wondered if cocaine intoxication itself might be a formal contraindication, but I should double-check; neither ESC nor ACC/AHA list cocaine use as a contraindication to fibrinolysis, and the main concern is the heightened risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation with beta-blockers in acute intoxication, not a prohibition of fibrinolytics per se [^112HjJid] [^113sH5cL] [^111PFkLv] [^1169n5TJ].

> Let me consider the bleeding risk profile, because that is the critical safety trade-off. Fibrinolysis increases major bleeding risk, including intracranial hemorrhage, by roughly 1.5–3 fold across indications, and cocaine users may have labile hypertension and vascular injury that could theoretically amplify bleeding, so careful screening for absolute and relative contraindications is essential before lysis [^114iM2uo].

> Next, I should review adjunctive and antithrombotic therapy nuances that intersect with cocaine physiology. Aspirin should be given promptly, and when fibrinolysis is used, clopidogrel is recommended as co-therapy in contemporary guidance; beta-blockers should be avoided in acute cocaine intoxication due to vasospasm risk, whereas calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and benzodiazepines are reasonable to mitigate adrenergic tone and vasospasm while definitive reperfusion is arranged [^1164VkHP] [^111PFkLv] [^115MCkgm] [^112HjJid].

> But wait, what if the infarct mechanism is pure vasospasm without thrombus; would fibrinolysis still help? I should confirm that fibrinolysis targets thrombus rather than spasm, so in presumed vasospasm without ST elevation or biomarker rise, conservative therapy with nitrates, benzodiazepines, and observation is appropriate, whereas clear STEMI or NSTEMI with occlusion should still follow reperfusion pathways, recognizing that spasm and thrombosis can coexist in cocaine users [^112HjJid].

> I will now examine real-world and case-based signals to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. Observational registries show cocaine-associated ACS is not rare, often presents with STEMI in younger patients, and contemporary series suggest similar adjusted in-hospital mortality despite less frequent use of drug-eluting stents and beta-blockers, supporting the principle that timely reperfusion drives outcomes; case reports also document successful thrombolysis followed by angiography and surgical management in complex thrombotic presentations, underscoring that lysis can be bridge therapy when PCI is delayed [^112p92u3] [^117SQRuY].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and make sure it aligns with guidance. If the patient has STEMI within 12 hours and primary PCI can be achieved within about 90–120 minutes, proceed to PCI; if PCI cannot be achieved within that window, administer guideline-concordant fibrinolysis without undue delay, screen rigorously for contraindications, give aspirin and clopidogrel, avoid beta-blockers in acute intoxication, and arrange urgent transfer for angiography with rescue PCI if reperfusion fails or ischemia recurs; for NSTEMI without ST elevation, urgent invasive evaluation is preferred, and fibrinolysis is not indicated [^116FaRZ3] [^1142BYBF] [^1164VkHP] [^111PFkLv].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the conclusion clearly. Yes, intravenous thrombolytic therapy is indicated for cocaine-associated STEMI when primary PCI cannot be performed within guideline-recommended time frames, provided there are no absolute contraindications; cocaine use itself is not a contraindication to fibrinolysis, and the decision should follow standard STEMI algorithms with attention to cocaine-specific hemodynamic and vasospastic considerations and a low threshold for rescue angiography [^116FaRZ3] [^1142BYBF] [^112HjJid].

IV thrombolysis is indicated for cocaine-associated STEMI when **primary PCI is not available within 120 minutes** [^1142BYBF] and there are no contraindications [^116FaRZ3]. Cocaine-related MI is often due to vasospasm and thrombosis [^112HjJid]; thrombolysis is appropriate when STEMI is confirmed and PCI is delayed. Avoid thrombolysis if there is **suspected aortic dissection**, active bleeding, or recent stroke. Primary PCI is preferred when available because of lower bleeding risk and higher efficacy [^114LDTLF]. Use standard fibrinolytics (tenecteplase, alteplase, reteplase) with adjunct antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy [^115aJBgP] and monitor closely for bleeding and reperfusion arrhythmias.

---

## Pathophysiology of cocaine-associated myocardial infarction

Cocaine-associated MI reflects a combination of **increased myocardial oxygen demand** — via tachycardia, hypertension, and increased contractility [^112j1aFa] — and **reduced oxygen supply** due to coronary vasospasm, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombus formation [^112j1aFa]. These effects can cause ischemia and infarction even without significant atherosclerosis [^11762SGU].

---

## Indications for IV thrombolytic therapy in cocaine-associated MI

IV thrombolysis is indicated in cocaine-associated STEMI when **primary PCI is not available within 120 minutes** [^1142BYBF] of first medical contact and there are no contraindications [^116FaRZ3]. The decision should be based on standard STEMI criteria, not cocaine use alone [^113sH5cL].

---

## Contraindications to IV thrombolytic therapy

Absolute and relative contraindications to IV thrombolysis in cocaine-associated MI are the same as in standard STEMI care:

| **Absolute contraindications** | **Relative contraindications** |
|-|-|
| - Previous hemorrhagic stroke | - Recent major surgery or trauma |
| - Active internal bleeding | - Uncontrolled hypertension |
| - Suspected aortic dissection | - Recent gastrointestinal bleeding |
| - Known intracranial neoplasm | - Pregnancy or postpartum period |
| - Severe uncontrolled hypertension | - Known bleeding disorders |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting IV thrombolytic therapy in cocaine-associated MI

Evidence is limited but suggests thrombolysis is effective and safe when **PCI is delayed**. Case reports and small series document successful reperfusion with thrombolysis in cocaine-related STEMI, including cases with large thrombus burden and normal coronaries [^117SQRuY]. No large randomized trials specifically address cocaine-related MI, so decisions should follow general STEMI evidence and guidelines [^1142BYBF].

---

## Risks and complications associated with IV thrombolytic therapy in cocaine users

Cocaine users have a **higher bleeding risk** due to hypertension, vasospasm, and platelet activation [^notfound]. Major complications include:

- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: Rare but serious [^notfound].
- **Bleeding complications**: More common in cocaine users [^notfound].
- **Reperfusion arrhythmias**: Monitor closely [^notfound].

---

## Alternative reperfusion strategies

Primary PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy for cocaine-associated STEMI when available within 120 minutes [^116FaRZ3] because it offers **lower bleeding risk and higher efficacy** than thrombolysis [^notfound]. If PCI is delayed, thrombolysis is appropriate, followed by **urgent transfer for PCI**.

---

## Adjunctive medical management

Adjunctive therapy should follow standard STEMI care, with **aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and anticoagulation** [^1164VkHP]. Beta-blockers should be avoided in acute cocaine intoxication due to risk of unopposed alpha stimulation and vasospasm [^111PFkLv]; consider calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and benzodiazepines for vasospasm and symptom control [^116dHQzS].

---

## Clinical outcomes and prognosis

Outcomes after thrombolysis in cocaine-associated MI are generally favorable when reperfusion is achieved, though recurrence and complications are more common with ongoing cocaine use. Prognosis depends on **timely reperfusion**, adherence, and substance use cessation.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend thrombolysis for cocaine-associated STEMI when **PCI is not available within 120 minutes** [^1142BYBF] and there are no contraindications [^116FaRZ3]. Primary PCI is preferred when available [^114LDTLF].

---

IV thrombolysis is indicated for cocaine-associated STEMI when **PCI is delayed**, with the same contraindications as standard STEMI care. Primary PCI is preferred when available, and adjunctive therapy should be tailored to cocaine-related pathophysiology.

### Acute myocardial infarction: etiologies and mimickers in young patients [^112HjJid]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug Use

An important risk factor for AMI in young adults is illicit drug abuse, which is associated with a poor prognosis. For this reason, a detailed history of illicit drug use is a necessary part of assessment of a young individual with an AMI. The most implicated substances are stimulants such as cocaine, amphetamines, and 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy). Mechanisms that lead to cardiac complications with these drugs typically involve vessel damage, prothrombotic effects and direct myocardial injury. In contrast, cocaine may increase myocardial oxygen demand because of increase in blood pressure and heart rate, while also promoting platelet activationor coronary vasospasm, resulting in acute myocardial ischemia. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of AMI following amphetamine use is not well understood but likely because of a combination of coronary vasospasm, intracoronary thrombus formation, and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Management of AMI secondary to amphetamine and cocaine abuse is not clearly defined but includes calcium channel blockers for treatment of suspected coronary vasospasm or thrombolytics/anticoagulants for coronary thrombi. Selective beta‐1 adrenergic receptor blockade is generally avoided until the absence of illicit drug use is confirmed as it may exacerbate coronary vasospasm via unopposed alpha adrenergic agonism. The incidence of cocaine‐induced AMI has been reported as high as 25% among AMI patients aged 18 to 45 years, particularly in those with other cardiac risk factors. When there is clear thrombus, plaque disruption, or occlusive disease the treatment of ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction in patients with recent substance use within 6 hours of onset of chest pain follows standard protocol with immediate PCI or thrombolytic therapy if PCI is not available.

### Percutaneous interventions in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction: a case series and review [^116dHQzS]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2002). Low credibility.

Cocaine-associated myocardial infarction (CAMI) is a well-reported entity. Most previous reports on CAMI have been limited to conservative care utilizing benzodiazepines, aspirin, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, and thrombolytics. Current guidelines on CAMI advocate immediate use of angiography and angioplasty if available rather than routine administration of thrombolytics. However, based on literature search from 1966 to 2001 (using keywords "cocaine", "myocardial infarction", and "angioplasty"), there have been only two case reports of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction. Both were notable for complications either during or immediately after the procedure. We report a series of 10 patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction who were treated with percutaneous interventions, which included angioplasty, stenting, and AngioJet mechanical extraction of thrombus. Despite the different arteriopathic process involved, our findings suggest that PCI can be performed safely and with a high degree of procedural success in patients with CAMI.

### Reconsidering recent myocardial infarction as a contraindication for IV stroke thrombolysis [^112woFWW]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

We reviewed the literature on IV stroke thrombolysis for patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI).

Methods

We searched PubMed and Ovid databases, relevant trials, and guidelines.

Results

Only 5 thrombolyzed stroke patients with recent MI were reported to have cardiac tamponade. Pathological studies show MI healing is completed by 7 weeks.

Conclusion

The time window from MI as a contraindication for IV stroke thrombolysis may be narrowed from 3 months in current guidelines to 7 weeks.

### Thrombolysis and adjunctive therapy in acute myocardial infarction: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^115aJBgP]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (MI) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients with ischemic symptoms characteristic of acute MI of < 12 h in duration, and ST-segment elevation or left bundle-branch block (of unknown duration) on the ECG, we recommend administration of any approved fibrinolytic agent (Grade 1A). We recommend the use of streptokinase, anistreplase, alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase over placebo (all Grade 1A). For patients with symptom duration < 6 h, we recommend the administration of alteplase over streptokinase (Grade 1A). For patients with known allergy or sensitivity to streptokinase, we recommend alteplase, reteplase, or tenecteplase (Grade 1A). For patients with acute posterior MI of < 12 h duration, we suggest fibrinolytic therapy (Grade 2C). In patients with any history of intracranial hemorrhage, closed head trauma, or ischemic stroke within past 3 months, we recommend against administration of fibrinolytic therapy (Grade 1C+). For patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI whether or not they receive fibrinolytic therapy, we recommend aspirin, 160 to 325 mg p.o., at initial evaluation by health-care personnel followed by indefinite therapy, 75 to 162 mg/d p.o. (both Grade 1A). In patients allergic to aspirin, we suggest use of clopidogrel as an alternative therapy to aspirin (Grade 2C). For patients receiving streptokinase, we suggest administration of either i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 2C] or subcutaneous UFH (Grade 2A). For all patients at high risk of systemic or venous thromboembolism (anterior MI, pump failure, previous embolus, atrial fibrillation, or left ventricular thrombus), we recommend administration of IV UFH while receiving streptokinase (Grade 1C+).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to cocaine and methamphetamine users, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering benzodiazepines alone or in combination with nitroglycerin for the management of hypertension and tachycardia in patients with NSTEMI and signs of acute cocaine or methamphetamine intoxication.

### Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the manchester royal infirmary. acute myocardial infarction in cocaine induced chest pain presenting as an emergency [^113WNpDd]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish the incidence of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting as emergencies with post-cocaine chest pain. Altogether 198 papers were found using the reported search, of which eight presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. A clinical bottom line is stated.

### Cocaine use and acute myocardial infarction [^112TNRnP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Cocaine use in the United States is widespread, affecting more than 30 million Americans. Although many of these persons do not seek healthcare, the overriding cause for hospitalization is cocaine-associated chest pain. Because only a minority of these patients suffer myocardial injury, it is important to exclude even rarer life-threatening causes for chest pain, such as aortic dissection or pneumothorax. Following that, a thorough knowledge of the pathophysiology and existing literature helps to provide cost-effective care, which focuses resources on those patients most likely to suffer complications. Regardless of the severity of complications, referral to cocaine detoxification programs, counseling, social support, and outpatient follow-up care for modification of cardiac risk factors is a fundamental component of long-term patient care.

### Cocaine-associated chest pain [^117Wguno]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Current estimates establish that more than 30 million people in the United States use cocaine. Cardiovascular complaints commonly occur among patients who present to emergency departments(EDs) after cocaine use, with chest pain the most common complaint in several studies. Although myocardial ischemia and infarction account for only a small percentage of cocaine-associated chest-pain, physicians must understand the pathophysiology of cocaine and appropriate diagnostic and treatment strategies to best manage these patients and minimize adverse outcomes. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, its role in the pathogenesis of chest pain with specific emphasis on inducing myocardial ischemia and infarction, and current diagnostic and management strategies for cocaine-associated chest pain encountered in the ED.

### Best evidence topic report. beta-blockers in cocaine induced acute coronary syndrome [^113YaGmB]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether beta blockers should be used in the treatment of chest pain associated with cocaine use. 12 papers were found, of which two presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that Beta Blockers should not be used in the treatment of cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia.

### Thrombolytic therapy: current clinical practice [^111huA1T]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Thrombolytic therapy is an essential tool in the array of therapies designed to reopen arteries and veins occluded with thrombus. As the use of thrombolytic agents has entered mainstream practice, their application has expanded to include a wide variety of indications and settings. Thrombolytic agents are used in patients who have thrombosis of coronary arteries, precerebral and cerebral arteries, the aorta, iliac and mesenteric arteries, and peripheral arteries. The use of thrombolysis in venous thrombosis has included deep venous thrombosis of the upper and lower extremities and vena cava, mesenteric veins, cerebral veins, and central access catheters. Guidelines are available from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association regarding thrombolysis in myocardial infarction and from the American Stroke Association regarding thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^114m3Uii]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Our presentation is one of the rare cases reported in literature referring in AMI due to thrombosis of LM related to cocaine use, in a young patient with normal CA, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity because of their usually coexistent several problems of general health. Furthermore, a majority of patients that suffer ST continue cocaine and are noncompliant with medical therapy. Improved handling techniques and postoperative long term dual antiplatelet therapy additionally to special consultation services could reduce the incidence of this terrible event. The lack of specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in CA, especially in LM, a catastrophic consequence of cocaine use, leads to a unique and individualized approach to these patients. The small number of reported cases prevents the development of an evidence-based management, but due to high probability of post PCI ST, as mentioned before, we strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically.

### Acute stroke thrombolysis: an update [^112HMDDy]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Acute stroke therapy took a major step forward in 1996 after the approval of Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients presenting within 3 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Since that time, there have been considerable advances in imaging techniques as well as the advent of devices to help in the management of acute stroke patients. As a result, the arsenal to treat acute stroke has grown, and the field of stroke as a subspecialty of neurology has emerged. Despite these advances, only 3% to 8% of eligible patients with acute stroke in the United States are administered thrombolytics.(1) We herein review the use of thrombolytics in stroke and provide an overview of the imaging advances, new devices, and recent trials that are shaping modern stroke therapy. Finally, we provide a practical approach to the management of acute stroke, specifically for the practicing cardiologist, who may encounter stroke during cardiac catheterization, post myocardial infarction (MI), and in a variety of other settings.

### The cardiovascular effects of cocaine [^116tukkN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Cocaine use continues to be prevalent among all races and socioeconomic groups in the United States. Patients presenting to emergency departments after cocaine ingestion frequently present with a chief complaint of chest pain. Although acute myocardial infarction is perhaps the most concerning diagnosis in this setting, there are many other potential causes of chest pain after cocaine ingestion. This article reviews the pharmacology of cocaine, as well as the etiologies and treatment of cocaine-associated chest pain, with an emphasis on this drug's range of cardiovascular effects.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^117SQRuY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 28-year-old man smoker and substance abuser (cocaine and circumstantial intravenous heroin) for the last 8 years, without known familiar history for CAD, presented to a local hospital with an antero-lateral ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (Figure 1A), associated with a low cardiac output syndrome. Heart ultrasound revealed severe hypokinesia of anterolatelar wall with ejection fraction of 30%. The patient was given immediately thrombolysis with tenecteplase (Metalyse) and his symptoms and ECG changes almost resolved. Few hours later he was transferred to our hospital for urgent catheterization due to recurrent ischemia and hemodynamic instability. At his admission the patient suffered from AMI complicated with cardiogenic shock and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Chest x-ray examination showed mild cardiomegaly, diffuse pulmonary congestion and perihilar infiltrates with the classic butterfly pattern, and Kerley B lines (Figure 1B). He was supported medically by combination of dobutamine, dopamine and furosemide. Coronary angiography revealed a huge thrombus formation of LM and suspicion of mobile parts to the rest of the left coronary system (Figures 1C, D). He stabilized hemodynamically using an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), but due to a lot of episodes of angina and no clear-cut guidelines describing the best management approach for patients under this condition we decided to operate him under an estimated risk of 30% according to logistic EURO-score. Urgent CABG by using cardiopulmonary bypass at normothermia (37°C) with continuous warm blood cardioplegia was done. An organized thrombus was found in the opened left anterior descending artery and removed. Finally, the vessel was bypassed by the left internal thoracic artery. In addition, the first obtuse marginal branch was bypassed by a free left radial graft. After a successful bypass weaning, he was transferred in intensive care unit and extubated 12 hours later. The IABP was removed 24 hours later. Inotropes infusion was interrupted at 36 hours and he discharged from the hospital on the 8 th postoperative day in a good condition.

### WITHDRAWN: primary angioplasty versus intravenous thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction [^115uWrFo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous thrombolytic therapy is the standard care for patients with acute myocardial infarction, based upon its widespread availability and ability to reduce patient mortality well demonstrated in randomised trials. Despite its proven efficacy, thrombolytic therapy has limitations. Many patients are ineligible for treatment with thrombolytics. Of those given thrombolytic therapy, 10 to 15 percent have persistent occlusion or reocclusion of the infarct-related artery. Consequently, primary angioplasty (primary PTCA) has been advocated as a better treatment of myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To determine whether primary coronary angioplasty is superior to thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Search Strategy

Electronic search of The Cochrane Library (1998; Issue 2). MEDLINE (to January 1998); references from reviews, trials and previously published meta-analyses; and experts. Date of most recent searches January 1998.

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded, randomised controlled trials comparing primary angioplasty against intravenous thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two independent reviewers abstracted data on morbidity and mortality and trial characteristics. The following outcomes were assessed: total mortality at the end of the study, reinfarction, stroke of any type, composite endpoint of death and reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, severe bleeding and coronary artery bypass grafting.

Main Results

Ten trials including 2573 subjects were identified. Compared to thrombolytic therapy, primary angioplasty was associated with a significant reduction in short-term mortality at the end of the studies (relative reduction in risk RRR = 32% 95%CI = 5%;50%). Similar reductions were observed for the rate of reinfarction (RRR = 52%, 95%CI = 30%;67%), recurrent ischemia (RRR = 54%; 95%CI = 39%,66%) and for the combined criteria death or reinfarction (RRR = 46%; 95%CI = 30%;58%). The frequency of strokes of any cause was significantly decreased by 66% (95%CI = 28%;84%). No significant difference was observed for the incidence of major bleeding (relative risk RR = 1.18, 95%CI = 0.73;1.90) but the confidence interval was large. The superiority of the primary angioplasty over thrombolysis in terms of the composite endpoint (mortality and reinfarction) was less with accelerated t-PA (RR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.51;0.97) than with streptokinase (RR = 0.30, 95%CI = 0.17;0.53). The biggest and most recent trial, Gusto 2B (GUSTO-2B 97), which involved general as well as highly specialised centres, obtained less favorable results.

Authors' Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that angioplasty provides a short-term clinical advantage over thrombolysis which may not be sustained. Primary angioplasty when available promptly at experienced centres, may be considered the preferred strategy for myocardial reperfusion. In most situations, however, optimal thrombolytic therapy should still be regarded as an excellent reperfusion strategy.

The superiority of the primary angioplasty over thrombolysis in terms of the composite endpoint (mortality and reinfarction) was less with accelerated t-PA (RR = 0.70, 95%CI = 0.51;0.97) than with streptokinase (RR = 0.30, 95%CI = 0.17;0.53). The biggest and most recent trial, Gusto 2B (GUSTO-2B 97), which involved general as well as highly specialised centres, obtained less favorable results.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that angioplasty provides a short-term clinical advantage over thrombolysis which may not be sustained. Primary angioplasty when available promptly at experienced centres, may be considered the preferred strategy for myocardial reperfusion. In most situations, however, optimal thrombolytic therapy should still be regarded as an excellent reperfusion strategy.

### Acute arterial thrombosis associated with cocaine abuse [^111GaJAr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cocaine-induced arterial thrombosis is uncommon, and most reported cases involved small-diameter vessels such as the cerebral and coronary arteries. This study was undertaken to review our experience with peripheral arterial thrombosis presumed caused by cocaine abuse.

Methods

Hospital records were reviewed for all patients admitted over 10 years with acute arterial occlusion involving the peripheral arterial system. Patients with confirmation of cocaine use or of its derivative, crack cocaine, within 24 hours of hospital admission formed the basis of this study. Symptoms at presentation, management, and outcome in these patients were reviewed.

Results

Three hundred eighty-two patients with acute peripheral arterial occlusion were identified during the study period. The presumptive diagnosis of cocaine-induced arterial occlusion was made in 5 patients (4 men, mean age 38 years). Cocaine use was achieved via intranasal inhalation in 2 patients (40%), whereas the 3 remaining patients smoked crack cocaine (60%). The mean time between cocaine use and onset of arterial thrombosis was 9.2 hours (range, 2–20 hours). Symptoms at presentation included acute limb ischemia without pedal Doppler signals (3 patients, 60%) and abdominal pain without femoral pulses (2 patients, 40%). Arterial occlusion was confirmed on angiograms in all patients, which revealed aortic thrombosis in 1 patient (20%), iliac thrombosis in 2 patients (40%), superficial femoral artery thrombosis in 1 patient (20%), and popliteal artery occlusion in 1 patient (20%). Surgical thrombectomy was successfully performed in 4 patients (80%), and 1 patient (20%) underwent successful thrombolytic therapy for femoropopliteal artery occlusion. There was no perioperative mortality. All 5 patients who were discharged were available for follow-up (mean, 36 months; range, 6–75 months). There was 1 late death from myocardial infarction. In 1 patient recurrent lower extremity arterial thrombosis developed after 28 months, which was successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy.

Conclusions

Our study underscores cocaine abuse as a potential cause of acute arterial thrombosis. Cocaine-induced arterial thrombosis should be suspected in patients with recent history of cocaine abuse with acute limb ischemia without an identifiable source or overt cardiovascular risk factors. Prompt angiography with operative or endovascular intervention should be performed to avert arterial ischemic sequelae.

### Clinical outcomes after treatment of cocaine-induced chest pain with beta-blockers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112negw3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines have suggested avoiding beta-blockers in the setting of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome. However, the available evidence is both scarce and conflicted. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the evidence pertaining to the use of beta-blockers in the setting of acute cocaine-related chest pain and its implication on clinical outcomes.

Methods

Electronic databases were systematically searched to identify literature relevant to patients with cocaine-associated chest pain who were treated with or without beta-blockers. We examined the end-points of in-hospital all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all outcomes using a random-effects model.

Results

Five studies with a total of 1447 patients were included. Our analyses found no differences between patients treated with or without beta-blockers for either myocardial infarction (RR 1.08; 95% CI, 0.61–1.91) or all-cause mortality (RR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.46–1.24). Heterogeneity among included studies was low to moderate.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is not associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients presenting with acute chest pain related to cocaine use.

### Pharmacoinvasive therapy for acute myocardial infarction [^115LmjP3]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2011). Low credibility.

Thrombus remains the bane of interventional cardiology. The use of thrombus extraction devices and distal protection devices has been controversial. Pharmacological modulation using intracoronary (IC) thrombolytic therapy during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is also not an established choice although intravenous thrombolytic therapy is widely accepted and applied treatment of choice for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This case report shows successful management of a patient of STEMI using a combination of IC thrombolytic therapy, thrombectomy device, and PCI.

### Thrombotic storm revisited: preliminary diagnostic criteria suggested by the thrombotic storm study group [^11516iW7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Physicians periodically encounter patients with an extraordinarily accelerated course of hypercoagulability who develop thromboses in multiple organ systems over days to weeks. Such patients may harbor underlying hypercoagulable clinical conditions, but their clinical course sets them apart from most patients with similar risk factors. Underlying triggers of "thrombotic storm" include pregnancy, inflammation, trauma, surgery, and infection. Aggressive anticoagulant therapy may control thrombotic storm, yet thrombotic storm may resume with even brief interruptions of anticoagulant therapy. The authors of this communication formed the Thrombotic Storm Study Group in order to identify clinical characteristics of such patients, thus constructing preliminary criteria to better define, identify, and study the course of patients deemed to have thrombotic storm. The characteristics culled from these 10 patients are: younger age (oldest was 38 years old at time of presentation); at least 2 arterial or venous (or both) thromboembolic events, typically in unusual sites with or without microangiopathy; unexplained recurrence; and frequently proceeded by a trigger. The following characteristics were not used in defining thrombotic storm: underlying malignancies; use of acute myocardial infarction as a defining arterial event in the setting of established coronary artery disease; use of cocaine; thrombotic complications expected with various intravascular devices; known paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or myeloproliferative disorders; severe trauma; and premorbid conditions.

### Consequences of overutilization and underutilization of thrombolytic therapy in clinical practice. TRACE study group. TRAndolapril cardiac evaluation [^115Uu7Sv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences, measured as mortality and in-hospital stroke, of the use of thrombolytic therapy among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), who do not fulfill accepted criteria or who have contraindications to thrombolytic therapy (i.e., overutilization) and among patients who are withheld thrombolytic treatment despite fulfilling indications and having no contraindications (i.e., underutilization).

Background

The implementation of treatment with thrombolysis in clinical practice is not in accordance with the accepted criteria from randomized studies. The consequence has been over- and underutilization of thrombolytic therapy among patients with AMI in clinical practice. The outcome of overutilization of thrombolytic therapy has not been described previously.

Methods

We examined 6,676 consecutive patients admitted to the hospital with an AMI and recorded characteristics, in-hospital complications and long-term mortality.

Results

Overall, 41% of the patients received thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic therapy was underutilized in 14.3% and overutilized in 12.9% of the patients. The use of thrombolytic therapy was associated with reduced mortality in every subgroup examined, including patients without an accepted indication, with an accepted indication and in patients with prior stroke. The risk ratio of in-hospital stroke was not increased in connection with thrombolytic therapy, not even in patients with prior stroke (relative risk = 0.237, 95% confidence interval: 0.031 to 1.810, p = 0.17).

Conclusions

With the large benefit known to be associated with thrombolytic therapy and the favorable result of thrombolytic therapy in patients with contraindications observed in this study, we conclude that a formal evaluation of thrombolytic therapy in wider patient categories is warranted.

### Comparison of in-hospital outcomes for β-blocker use versus non-beta blocker use in patients presenting with cocaine-associated chest pain [^113dJQFo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Beta blockers are indicated for management of acute coronary syndromes, but they generally are withheld in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain because of concerns for adverse outcomes related to the unique physiological effects of cocaine. Because few clinical studies have evaluated this interaction, we identified patients with toxicology screen results positive for cocaine treated for chest pain at 2 academic hospitals. Clinical characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were compared between patients with and without β-blocker therapy. We then constructed propensity scores to evaluate the independent relation between β-blocker use and the composite primary end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, ventricular arrhythmia, or all-cause mortality after adjusting for clinical characteristics. Of 376 consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain, β blockers were used in 164 (44%). Compared with no β blockers, patients treated with β blockers were more likely to describe anginal chest pain, to have known cardiovascular risk factors, and to receive other antiatherosclerotic therapies. Despite these higher risk clinical characteristics, patients treated with β blockers experienced similar peak troponin levels, individual adverse events, and rates of the composite primary end point (15.9% vs 12.3%, p = 0.32). The primary end point also was similar after propensity score analysis (odds ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 2.93, p = 0.42), including specific comparisons of beta-1 selective (odds ratio 1.83, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 4.24) and nonselective (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 2.42) β blockers, when compared with patients not receiving β blockers. In conclusion, no differences in outcomes were observed between patients treated versus not treated with β-blocker therapy in the setting of cocaine-related chest pain.

### Relationship between cocaine use and coronary artery disease in patients with symptoms consistent with an acute coronary syndrome [^116ZeEYH]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Observational studies of patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction have suggested more coronary disease than expected on the basis of patient age. The study objective was to determine whether cocaine use is associated with coronary disease in low- to intermediate-risk emergency department (ED) patients with potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Methods

The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of low- to intermediate-risk patients < 60 years of age who received coronary computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the ED. Patients were classified into three groups with respect to CAD: maximal stenosis < 25%, 25% to 49%, and ≥ 50%. Prespecified multivariate modeling (generalized estimating equations) was used to assess relationship between cocaine and CAD.

Results

Of 912 enrolled patients, 157 (17%) used cocaine. A total of 231 patients had CAD ≥ 25%; 111 had CAD ≥ 50%. In univariate analysis, cocaine use was not associated with a lesion 25% or greater (12% vs. 14%; relative risk [RR] = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5 to 1.4) or 50% or greater (12% vs. 11%; RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.6 to 2.3). In multivariate modeling adjusting for age, race, sex, cardiac risk factors, and Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score, cocaine use was not associated with the presence of any coronary lesion (adjusted RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.69 to 1.31) or coronary lesions 50% or greater (adjusted RR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.38). There was also no relationship between repetitive cocaine use and coronary calcifications or between recent cocaine use and CAD.

Conclusions

In symptomatic ED patients at low to intermediate risk of an ACS, cocaine use was not associated with an increased likelihood of coronary disease after adjustment for age, race, sex, and other risk factors for coronary disease.

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. With the increase in substance abuse, the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in younger population has been on the rise. Traditionally, cocaine has been blamed for acute MI; however, recently, there have been more incidences of marijuana as an inciting factor. We present a case of marijuana-induced acute MI and discuss the proposed mechanism.

### Hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114iM2uo]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article about hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulant and thrombolytic treatment is part of the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy. The criteria for defining the severity of bleeding vary considerably between studies, accounting in part for the variation in the rates of bleeding reported. The major determinants of vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-induced bleeding are the intensity of the anticoagulant effect, underlying patient characteristics, and the length of therapy. There is good evidence that VKA therapy, targeted international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0), is associated with a lower risk of bleeding than therapy targeted at an INR > 3.0. The risk of bleeding associated with IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients with acute venous thromboembolism is < 3% in recent trials. This bleeding risk may increase with increasing heparin dosages and age (> 70 years). Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is associated with less major bleeding compared with UFH in acute venous thromboembolism. Higher doses of UFH and LMWH are associated with important increases in major bleeding in ischemic stroke. In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, addition of LMWH, hirudin, or its derivatives to thrombolytic therapy is associated with a small increase in the risk of major bleeding, whereas treatment with fondaparinux or UFH is associated with a lower risk of bleeding. Thrombolytic therapy increases the risk of major bleeding 1.5-fold to threefold in patients with acute venous thromboembolism, ischemic stroke, or ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^1151n1ya]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

It is common knowledge that cocaine has been linked to the development of various acute and chronic cardiovascular complications including acute coronary syndromes. We present a young, male patient, drug abuser who underwent CABG due to anterolateral myocardial infarction. Our presentation is one of the very rare cases reported in literature regarding acute thrombosis of left main coronary artery related to cocaine use, in a patient with normal coronary arteries, successfully operated. Drug-abusers seem to have increased mortality and morbidity after surgery and high possibility for stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary interventions, because of their usually terrible medical compliance and coexistent several problems of general health. There are no specific guidelines about treatment of thrombus formation in coronary arteries, as a consequence of cocaine use. So, any decision making concerning the final treatment of these patient is a unique and individualized approach. We strongly recommend that all these patients should be treated surgically, especially patients with thrombus into the left main artery.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^11722fHQ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Beta blocker use in cocaine intoxication — risk context and consultation: Historically, beta blockers have been avoided when treating cocaine intoxication due to case reports theorizing risks associated with unopposed alpha stimulation, which can result in an acute increase in blood pressure and/or coronary artery vasoconstriction following beta blocker administration. Evidence suggests that this risk is lower than hypothesized, and a systematic review and meta-analysis found beta blockers were not associated with adverse events — including myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial necrosis, or death — during hospitalization and long-term follow-up; however, this issue remains an area of controversy in the field and for complex cases, consult with cardiology and/or medical toxicology.

### Characteristics, management, and outcomes of cocaine-positive patients with acute coronary syndrome (from the national cardiovascular data registry) [^112p92u3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Although cocaine ingestion may cause or contribute to myocardial infarction (MI), few contemporary data are available describing cocaine-associated MI. We describe the characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with MI and recent cocaine use from the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) program. The study population was 102,952 patients enrolled in the American College of Cardiology ACTION Registry-GWTG from July 2008 to March 31, 2010 from 460 sites across the United States. Cocaine exposure was defined as self-reported cocaine use within the last 72 hours or a positive urine test for cocaine. Demographics and medical history, presenting characteristics, treatments, and in-hospital outcomes were reported on a standard case record form. A total of 924 patients (0.9%) were cocaine positive. Compared with cocaine-negative patients, cocaine-positive patients were younger and predominantly men with fewer cardiovascular risk factors. There was a higher percentage of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (46.3% vs 39.7%) and cardiogenic shock at presentation in the cocaine-positive group, but the percentage of multivessel coronary artery disease was lower (53.3% vs 64.5%). Beta blockers within 24 hours (85.8% vs 90.1%, p < 0.0001) and drug-eluting stents (40.1% vs 68.8%, p < 0.0001 in patients with non-STEMI; 27.6% vs 54.6%, p < 0.0001 in patients with STEMI) were used less commonly in cocaine-positive patients. Multivariable-adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar between cocaine-positive and cocaine-negative patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.44, p value = 0.98). In conclusion cocaine-positive patients with acute coronary syndrome are younger with fewer risk factors, multivessel coronary artery disease and lower drug-eluting stent and β-blocker usage. Cocaine use was not associated with in-hospital mortality.

### Should β-blockers be used in the treatment of cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome? [^114z35UG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To critically evaluate the 30 year debate of beta-blocker use in cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (CIACS).

Data Sources

An Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, and Ovid MEDLINE (1966-August 21, 2007) search of the medical literature was conducted using the key terms cocaine, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and adrenergic beta-antagonists.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All clinical trials, case reports, national cardiovascular guidelines, and reviews published in English were evaluated. Case reports were included based on whether (1) acute coronary syndrome was suspected, (2) a beta-blocker was used during the treatment course, and (3) objective and subjective patient-specific information was documented.

Data Synthesis

Three case reports and 2 placebo-controlled trials were identified that used 4 beta-blockers (atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, propranolol). Three national guidelines addressed beta-blocker use. Although published data are limited, propranolol and labetalol exert minimal to no effect on alleviating cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction. None of the evaluated national guidelines recommends beta-blockers as first-line agents in CIACS management.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers should not be considered first-line agents for controlling chest pain in patients with documented CIACS. If long-term beta-blockade is warranted, its benefits should be weighed against recurrent use of cocaine and possible exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome. Given that carvedilol exhibits ancillary pharmacologic proprieties beneficial in CIACS, and post-myocardial infarction mortality data are available regarding its use, this agent could be considered to be appropriate therapy.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^112j1aFa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Three factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of cocaine-related myocardial ischemia-infarction: the increased myocardial oxygen demand, the marked vasoconstriction of CA, and the exaggerated platelet aggregation. Cocaine is a powerful sympathomimetic and dramatically increases oxygen demand by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine at the presynaptic adrenergic terminals. Also, induces significant increase of myocardial oxygen demand due to increased heart rate, systemic arterial pressure and left ventricular contractility. The chronotropic effects of cocaine are intensified in the setting of alcohol use. In addition, cocaine produces a significant coronary vasoconstriction either in normal CA or -more marked- in diseased one. Factors that are implicated to this coronary vasoconstriction are the increased endothelial production of endothelin and the decreased production of nitric oxide. There are a lot of reported cardiovascular complications of cocaine users but the incidence of most severe of them is relatively uncommon. According to Hollander J, et al, ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 4–17%, congestive heart failure in 5–7%, and death in < 2%. Therefore, the incidence of cocaine abusers who will need an emergency interventional or surgical reperfusion is low. Interventions should be directed either to treat ischemic complications due to thrombosis, dissection, or acute/subacute thrombosis of an implanted coronary stent. Vasoconstrictive and atherosclerotic effects of cocaine, combined with the well documented platelet-activating effect, significantly increase the post-PCI risk of stent thrombosis (ST), in the early and late post implantation phase. Karlsson G et al, reported that among the actively using cocaine patients who underwent PCI, 33% of them presented with ST 51 ± 40 days after the intervention, with an incidence of ST almost 10-fold higher in cocaine users. Similar results reported in a retrospective study by Singh S, et al. Of their patients with active cocaine use 5% suffered SF with a mean period from stent implantation 28.5 ± 14 days.

### Best evidence topic report. cocaine induced myocardial ischaemia: nitrates versus benzodiazepines [^1111AFHD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether nitrates are better than benzodiazepines in the treatment of cocaine induced chest pain. Seven citations were reviewed of which two answered the three part question. The clinical bottom line is that in patients with cocaine induced chest pain it appears that nitrates or benzodiazepines are effective in combination or alone in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. We recommend that the agent of choice may be influenced by the presence or absence of concurrent CNS symptoms.

Chronic coronary disease — substance use burden and screening: Substance use is underrecognized, contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and outcomes, and substances including cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, alcohol, and marijuana can lead to premature or recurrent CVD events; drug use was observed in 10% of patients < 50 years of age presenting with an myocardial infarction (MI) from 2000 to 2016, and recreational use of alcohol, cannabis, and amphetamines was independently associated with premature CVD; single-question screening for unhealthy alcohol and drug use has been validated in primary care and can be self-administered.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of acute coronary syndrome, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to manage patients with NSTEMI and a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use in the same manner as patients without cocaine- or methamphetamine-related NSTEMI, except for patients with signs of acute intoxication (such as euphoria, tachycardia, and/or hypertension) and β-blocker use unless receiving coronary vasodilator therapy.

### Outcomes of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction in women [^114Q7B4M]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in women older than 50 years of age. Thrombolytic therapy substantially reduces mortality in both women and men with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction. However, the mortality risk reduction is somewhat lower in women, in spite of similar rates of successful coronary reperfusion after thrombolytic therapy in women and men. Hemorrhagic complications including stroke and other major bleeding appear to be more common in women, particularly elderly women. The risk of reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy also is greater in women compared with men. Because of the higher complication rates, women should be monitored closely after thrombolytic therapy. However, this lifesaving treatment should not be withheld or delayed in women when indicated.

### Bolus thrombolytic infusion during prolonged refractory cardiac arrest of undiagnosed cause [^116xxuDc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pulmonary embolism (PE) account for about 70% of cardiac arrest. Although thrombolytic therapy is an effective therapy for both AMI and PE, it is not routinely recommended during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for fear of life threatening bleeding complications. Numerous case reports and retrospective studies have suggested a beneficial effect of thrombolytics in cardiac arrest secondary to AMI and PE; however, we present a case of successful use of bolus thrombolytics during CPR in a patient with undifferentiated cardiac arrest (undiagnosed cause) after prolonged conventional resuscitation without success.

### Clinical profile, acute care, and middle-term outcomes of cocaine-associated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in an inner-city community [^111BRTKR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Although cocaine is a well-recognized risk factor for coronary disease, detailed information is lacking regarding related behavioral and clinical features of cocaine-associated ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban settings. Nor are systematic or extended follow-up data available on outcomes for cocaine-associated STEMI in the contemporary era of percutaneous coronary intervention. We leveraged a prospective STEMI registry from a large health system serving an inner-city community to characterize the clinical features, acute management, and middle-term outcomes of cocaine-related versus cocaine-unrelated STEMI. Of the 1,003 patients included, 60% were black or Hispanic. Compared with cocaine-unrelated STEMI, cocaine-related STEMI (n = 58) was associated with younger age, male gender, lower socioeconomic score, current smoking, high alcohol consumption, and human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity but less commonly with diabetes or hypertension. Cocaine users less often received drug-eluting stents or β blockers at discharge. During median follow-up of 2.7 years, rates of death, death or any rehospitalization, and death or cardiovascular rehospitalization did not differ significantly between cocaine users and nonusers but were especially high for death or any hospitalization in the 2 groups (31.4 vs 32.4 per 100 person-years, p = 0.887). Adjusted hazard ratios for outcomes were likewise not significantly different. In conclusion, in this low-income community, cocaine use occurred in a substantial fraction of STEMI cases, who were younger than their nonuser counterparts but had more prevalent high-risk habits and exhibited similarly high rates of adverse outcomes. These data suggest that programs targeting cocaine abuse and related behaviors could contribute importantly to disease prevention in disadvantaged communities.

Thrombolysis risk trade-offs — mortality vs stroke and methodologic differences: Stanek et al suggested participants were most concerned with mortality and most often unwilling to accept a higher risk of death in exchange for reduced stroke risk; under conditions of no cost and 0% risk of mortality, approximately one-third chose tissue plasminogen activator (associated with higher stroke risk). Differences included Stanek's self-administered questionnaire versus Heyland's face-to-face elicitation and Stanek's focus on hemorrhagic stroke versus Heyland's inclusion of both hemorrhagic stroke and myocardial infarction.

### Infrequent causes of stroke [^113D641B]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Infrequent causes of stroke are likely to be encountered by emergency physicians. Infrequent causes of stroke can be recalled using the ABC-IT mnemonic. Of the many infrequent causes, the five conditions more likely to be encountered are sickle cell anemia, migrainous stroke, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, arterial dissection, and cocaine-related stroke. Consideration of the use of thrombolytic therapy in a patient with stroke from any cause lies at the forefront of treatment strategy in the emergency department.

### Evaluation and management of stroke [^115mMamp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

In contrast to myocardial infarction, stroke is a heterogeneous disease with multiple different causes. Determination of stroke mechanism is critical to choosing optimal therapy to prevent recurrence. This article reviews the diagnostic approach to stroke and prognostic and treatment implications of specific stroke mechanisms. Data on the role of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in secondary stroke prevention, as well as the role of these agents and thrombolytic therapy in acute stroke treatment are reviewed. Situations of particular relevance to the practicing hematologist-stroke in the young, patients with multiple recurrent strokes, patients with abnormal hypercoagulable laboratory testing, and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage following thrombolytic therapy-are discussed.

### New recommendations from the 1999 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association acute myocardial infarction guidelines [^113wPcCs]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review literature relating to significant changes in drug therapy recommendations in the 1999 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for treating patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Data Sources

1999 ACC/AHA AMI guidelines, English-language clinical trials, reviews, and editorials researching the role of drug therapy and primary angioplasty for AMI that were referenced in the guidelines were included. Additional data published in 2000 or unpublished were also included if relevant to interpretation of the guidelines.

Study Selection

The articles selected influence AMI treatment recommendations.

Data Synthesis

Many clinicians and health systems use the ACC/AHA AMI guidelines to develop treatment plans for AMI patients. This review highlights important changes in AMI drug therapy recommendations by reviewing the results of recent clinical trials. Insights into evolving drug therapy strategies that may impact future guideline development are also described.

Conclusions

Several changes in drug therapy recommendations were included in the 1999 AMI ACC/AHA guidelines. There is emphasis on administering fibrin-specific thrombolytics secondary to enhanced efficacy. Selection between fibrin-specific agents is unclear at this time. Low response rates to thrombolytics have been noted in the elderly, women, patients with heart failure, and those showing left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram. These patient groups should be targeted for improved utilization programs. The use of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in non-ST-segment elevation MI was emphasized. Small trials combining reduced doses of thrombolytics with GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors have shown promise by increasing reperfusion rates without increasing bleeding risk, but firm conclusions cannot be made until the results of larger trials are known. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) trials suggest lower mortality rates for primary PCI when compared with thrombolysis alone. However, primary PCI, including coronary angioplasty, is only available at approximately 13% of US hospitals, making thrombolysis the preferred strategy for most patients. Clopidogrel has supplanted ticlopidine as the recommended antiplatelet agent for patients with aspirin allergy or intolerance following reports of a better safety profile. The recommended dose of unfractionated heparin is lower than previously recommended, necessitating a separate nomogram for patients with acute coronary syndromes. Routine use of warfarin, either alone or in combination with aspirin, is not supported by clinical trials; however, warfarin remains a choice for antithrombotic therapy in patients intolerant to aspirin. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers continue to be recommended, and emphasis is placed on improving rates of early administration (during hospitalization), even in patients with moderate left ventricular dysfunction. New recommendations for drug treatment of post-AMI patients with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and/or elevated triglycerides are included, with either niacin or gemfibrozil recommended as an option. Supplementary antioxidants are not recommended for either primary or secondary prevention of AMI, with new data demonstrating lack of efficacy vitamin E in primary prevention. Estrogen replacement therapy or hormonal replacement therapy should not be initiated solely for prevention of cardiovascular disease, but can be continued in cardiovascular patients already taking long-term therapy for other reasons. Bupropion has been added as a new treatment option for smoking cessation. As drug therapy continues to evolve in treating AMI, more frequent updates of therapy guidelines will be necessary.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for stimulant use disorder, more specifically with respect to management of acute coronary syndrome, ACC/AHA 2014 guidelines recommend to do not administer β-blockers in patients with acute coronary syndrome with a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use demonstrating signs of acute intoxication because of the risk of potentiating coronary spasm.

### Cocaine-induced very late stent thrombosis [^114QZCd9]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Cocaine misuse is a known cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Management of these patients has always been a challenge due to medication compliance and eventual risk of stent thrombosis. However, even cocaine misusers who are compliant with dual antiplatelet therapy have been reported to have stent thrombosis. All cases of cocaine-induced stent thrombosis reported in the literature have occurred within first year of stent placement (acute, subacute or late). We report a first case of very late stent thrombosis in a 54-year-old active cocaine misuser who presented with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, which was successfully managed with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A review of all the reported cases of cocaine-induced stent thrombosis is also discussed. Given the high mortality associated with stent thrombosis, treatment option for cocaine misusers presenting with ACS should be conservative when possible. If percutaneous coronary intervention is needed, bare metal stent should be preferred.

### Cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use [^113sH5cL]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular consequences of cocaine use are numerous and can be severe, with mechanisms of cardiotoxicity unique to cocaine that include sympathomimetic effects, blockade of sodium and potassium channels, oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, and disruption of excitation-contraction coupling. In combination, these effects increase myocardial oxygen demand while simultaneously decreasing oxygen supply. Cocaine-associated chest pain is particularly common and, in some instances, associated with a more severe cardiac syndrome, such as myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, aortic dissection, or endocarditis. Therapy for cocaine-associated chest pain and myocardial infarction is similar to treatment in non-cocaine users, except for differences in the use of benzodiazepines and phentolamine and avoidance of beta-blockers in the acute setting. In this review, we discuss the most up-to-date literature regarding the mechanisms of cocaine-associated cardiotoxicity and clinical consequences, diagnosis, and treatment; we also discuss relevant controversies while proposing several important areas for future research.

### Alteplase (Activase) [^114WSvBE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1	INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Activase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) indicated for the treatment of:

Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). (1.1)
Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) to reduce mortality and incidence of heart failure. (1.2)

Limitation of Use in AMI: the risk of stroke may be greater than the benefit in patients at low risk of death from cardiac causes. (1.2)
Acute Massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE) for lysis. (1.3)

1.1 Acute Ischemic Stroke

Activase is indicated for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Exclude intracranial hemorrhage as the primary cause of stroke signs and symptoms prior to initiation of treatment [see Contraindications (4.1)]. Initiate treatment as soon as possible but within 3 hours after symptom onset.

1.2 Acute Myocardial Infarction

Activase is indicated for use in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the reduction of mortality and reduction of the incidence of heart failure.

Limitation of Use: The risk of stroke may outweigh the benefit produced by thrombolytic therapy in patients whose AMI puts them at low risk for death or heart failure.

1.3 Pulmonary Embolism

Activase is indicated for the lysis of acute massive pulmonary embolism, defined as:

Acute pulmonary emboli obstructing blood flow to a lobe or multiple lung segments.
Acute pulmonary emboli accompanied by unstable hemodynamics, e.g., failure to maintain blood pressure without supportive measures.

### Cardiac rupture after intravenous t-PA administration in acute ischemic stroke [^111Nn79L]. Neurocritical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Ventricular free wall rupture is a fatal complication of myocardial infarction (MI). Although described in MI patients who receive thrombolytic therapy, this complication is not well known in ischemic stroke patients who receive intravenous (IV) t-PA.

Methods

Case report.

Results

We present a 93-year-old woman with an acute onset of a right middle cerebral artery syndrome in the setting of subacute MI. IV t-PA was administered and she subsequently developed asystolic arrest and died. Autopsy showed subacute MI, hemopericardium, and rupture of the left ventricle.

Conclusions

This case illustrates a fatal cardiac complication of IV thrombolytic therapy for stroke. The speculated mechanism is hemorrhage into the infarcted myocardium.

### Acute aortoiliac thrombosis due to cocaine intake [^113u1Sdm]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Cocaine has become one of the most commonly abused recreational drugs, resulting in a significantly increased number of visits to the emergency department due to the acute symptoms caused by its intake. The acute onset of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, stroke, and kidney and spleen infarction, has been described in association with cocaine use, but aortic thrombosis has rarely been studied in this context. We report a case of acute aortoiliac thrombosis in a young male patient with no underlying medical records.

### Cocaine use is associated with an increased risk of stent thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention [^116inYbF]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of cocaine-related acute coronary syndromes presents unique challenges. Although percutaneous coronary intervention in cocaine abusers appears to be safe in the short term, longer-term outcomes have not been reported. We postulated that cocaine use would be associated with increased risk for stent thrombosis.

Methods

We report 30-day and 9-month clinical outcomes including stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and death in 71 cocaine abusers who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention at our institution (66 of whom received a stent) compared with 3216 control patients. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed to control for statistical bias present in nonrandomized study populations.

Results

Stent thrombosis occurred in 5 (7.6%) of the 66 stented cocaine abusers during the 9-month follow-up period compared to a 0.6% rate of stent thrombosis in the control database, a highly statistically significant difference (P < .001). In the propensity analysis, stent thrombosis occurred in 4 stented cocaine abusers and 0 of 70 matched controls (6.2% vs 0%; p = 0.04) throughout the 9-month follow-up period. There was no significant difference in overall rates of myocardial infarction, death, or repeat revascularization at 9 months.

Conclusions

Because of the increased risk of stent thrombosis, consideration should be given to a more conservative approach in cocaine abusers who present with acute coronary syndromes.

### Acute left main coronary artery thrombosis due to cocaine use [^11762SGU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The first relationship between myocardial ischemia or acute coronary syndrome and cocaine use, was reported by Coleman D, et al, in 1982. Many studies have investigated and documented the mentioned relationship concerning its pathophysiology and management. The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is increased 24-fold during the first hour after cocaine use in patients with normal coronary arteries (CA). According to several studies, most cocaine-abusers with myocardial related complications are young, smokers, nonwhite and male, without other risk factors for atherosclerosis. Therefore, when young patients with no or few risk factors for atherosclerosis, are present with AMI, they should be questioned about cocaine use, and urine plus blood samples should be analyzed for cocaine and its metabolites. Cocaine induces vasoconstriction of epicardial CA in patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD), combined with an enhanced platelet activation and aggregation, leading in thrombus formation. Of note, in most of the reported cases the affected CA is a distal coronary branch and not the left main coronary artery (LM). We describe herein a LM thrombosis in a young cocaine-abuser, who underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for persistent post-infarction angina and acute heart failure.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, more specifically with respect to fibrinolytic therapy, administration, ACC/ACEP/AHA/NAEMSP/SCAI 2025 guidelines recommend to administer fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI and symptom onset of < 12 hours, with an anticipated delay to primary PCI ≥ 120 minutes from first medical contact, in the absence of contraindications, to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Cocaine-induced renal infarction: report of a case and review of the literature [^111hnj3i]. BMC Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Various imaging techniques including CT scan, Magnetic Resonant Imaging (MRI), angiography, Ultrasound and Nuclear Scintigraphy Scans have been used to make the diagnosis. However, MRI, angiography and nuclear scintigraphy are expensive, system-specific and time-consuming, and they may not be readily available at all institutions. Ultrasound lacks sensitivity and specificity for renal infarction. Therefore, CT scan has been recommended for the diagnosis of this challenging disease. CT scan, however, becomes less reliable when the infarct is global and there is loss of viable cortical rim, or when the infarct simulates a tumefactive process.

There is no consensus on the treatment of renal infarction due to cocaine use. Prior treatment modalities in the literature range from no treatment to anticoagulation, thrombolytic use, aspirin therapy and surgical nephrectomy. Given that no evidence of underlying coagulopathy or thromboembolic events were identified in our patient, we opted to conservatively manage him with supportive therapy and pain management. He was successfully discharged on hospital day six with a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (106.1 umol/L).

### Successful use of intra-arrest thrombolysis for electrical storm due to acute myocardial infarction [^112vayri]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Acute vascular thrombotic disease, including acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism, accounts for 70% of sudden outpatient cardiac arrest. The role of intra-arrest thrombolytic administration aimed at reversing the underlying cause of cardiac arrest remains an area of debate with recent guidelines advising against routine use. We present a case of prolonged refractory ventricular fibrillation electrical storm in a patient who demonstrated intra-arrest electrocardiographic and sonographic markers confirming acute myocardial infarction. Return of spontaneous circulation was rapidly achieved after rescue intra-arrest bolus thrombolysis. Highlights of this case are discussed in the context of the current evidence for thrombolytic therapy in cardiac arrest with specific attention to the issue of patient selection.

### Thrombolytic therapy in patients of female gender [^114HuHmR]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Results of surveys and clinical trials have indicated that prognosis of female patients with acute myocardial infarction is worse than prognosis of male patients. Female patients are on average older than male patients, have a longer patient delay, present more often with equivocal ECG abnormalities, and have more often contraindications to thrombolytic therapy. Thrombolytic therapy is given less often to female patients with acute myocardial infarction than to male patients of the same age. This is only partly due to the absence of an indication for thrombolytic therapy or the presence of a contraindication. If thrombolytic therapy is given to female patients with acute myocardial infarction, this results in the same patency rate as in male patients. In the meta-analysis of the Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' Collaboration Group that included all randomised clinical trials that compared thrombolytic therapy with a placebo or control group, the absolute benefit of thrombolytic therapy with regard to 35-day mortality was 2.2% in female patients, higher than the observed absolute difference of 1.9% in male patients. In several studies age, gender, and body weight were identified as independent risk factors for the occurrence of stroke and bleeding complications after administration of thrombolytic therapy. Results of the ASSENT-2 study indicated that total stroke rate and 30-day mortality was lower in female patients over 75 years of age treated with tenecteplase than in those treated with alteplase, albeit that the difference was statistically not significant. With the data presently available it can be stated that female patients and patients over 75 years of age will probably benefit more from a thrombolytic agent that is given according to a weight-adjusted dose regimen, e.g., tenecteplase.

### Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in patients with cocaine-associated acute ischemic stroke [^116fvCfQ]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The safety of thrombolytic therapy in patients with cocaine-associated acute ischemic stroke (CIS) is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with CIS who presented to our stroke center. Thrombolytic treatment was compared between cocaine-positive (n = 29) and cocaine-negative (n = 75) patients. We also compared patients with CIS treated with tissue plasminogen activator versus those who did not receive tissue plasminogen activator (n = 58). Safety outcomes were determined by the incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale at hospital discharge.

Results

There were no complications in tissue plasminogen activator-treated patients with CIS. Cocaine-positive and cocaine-negative treated patients had similar stroke severity and safety outcomes. Patients with CIS treated with tissue plasminogen activator had more severe strokes on baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale but similar safety outcomes compared with nontreated patients with CIS.

Conclusions

Thrombolytic therapy for CIS appears to be safe in this small study. Further research is needed to more definitively assess safety and efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator for CIS.

### Antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^112ZzFQS]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy for coronary artery disease (CAD) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following: For patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), we recommend immediate and then daily oral aspirin (Grade 1A). For patients with an aspirin allergy, we recommend immediate treatment with clopidogrel, 300-mg bolus po, followed by 75 mg/d indefinitely (Grade 1A). In all NSTE ACS patients in whom diagnostic catheterization will be delayed or when coronary bypass surgery will not occur until > 5 days, we recommend clopidogrel as bolus therapy (300 mg), followed by 75 mg/d for 9 to 12 months in addition to aspirin (Grade 1A). In NSTE ACS patients in whom angiography will take place within 24 h, we suggest beginning clopidogrel after the coronary anatomy has been determined (Grade 2A). For patients who have received clopidogrel and are scheduled for coronary bypass surgery, we recommend discontinuing clopidogrel for 5 days prior to the scheduled surgery (Grade 2A). In moderate- to high-risk patients presenting with NSTE ACS, we recommend either eptifibatide or tirofiban for initial (early) treatment in addition to treatment with aspirin and heparin (Grade 1A). For the acute treatment of NSTE ACS, we recommend low molecular weight heparins over unfractionated heparin (UFH) [Grade 1B] and UFH over no heparin therapy use with antiplatelet therapies (Grade 1A). We recommend against the direct thrombin inhibitors as routine initial antithrombin therapy (Grade 1B). For patients after myocardial infarction, after ACS, and with stable CAD, we recommend aspirin in doses from 75 to 325 mg as initial therapy and in doses of 75 to 162 mg as indefinite therapy (Grade 1A). For patients with contraindications to aspirin, we recommend long-term clopidogrel (Grade 1A). For primary prevention in patients with at least moderate risk for a coronary event, we recommend aspirin, 75 to 162 mg/d, over either no antithrombotic therapy or vitamin K antagonist (VKA) [Grade 2A]; for patients at particularly high risk of events in whom the international normalized ratio (INR) can be monitored without difficulty, we suggest low-dose VKA (target INR, 1.5) [Grade 2A].

### Outcomes of beta blocker use in cocaine-associated chest pain: a meta-analysis [^1163DpLa]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Beta blockers (β-blockers) remain a standard therapy in the early treatment of acute coronary syndromes. However, β-blocker therapy in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain (CACP) continues to be an area of debate due to the potential risk of unopposed α-adrenergic stimulation and coronary vasospasm. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available studies to compare outcomes of β-blocker versus no β-blocker use among patients with CACP.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through September 2016 using the keywords 'beta blocker', 'cocaine' and commonly used β-blockers ('atenolol', 'bisoprolol', 'carvedilol', 'esmolol', 'metoprolol' and 'propranolol') to identify studies evaluating β-blocker use among patients with CACP. We specifically focused on studies comparing outcomes between β-blocker versus no β-blocker usage in patients with CACP. Studies without a comparison between β-blocker and no β-blocker use were excluded. Outcomes of interest included non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I 2 statistics.

Results

A total of five studies evaluating 1794 subjects were included. Overall, there was no significant difference on MI in patients with CACP on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 1.36, 95%CI 0.68 to 2.75; p = 0.39). Similarly, there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality in patients on β-blocker versus no β-blocker (OR 0.68, 95%CI 0.26 to 1.79; p = 0.43).

Conclusions

In patients presenting with acute chest pain and underlying cocaine, β-blocker use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of MI or all-cause mortality.

Baseline characteristics, medical history, home medications, and drug use on admission.

Preventative medication use was low throughout the cohort. Aspirin was the most common medication (14%), followed by angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (12%), statins (11%) and beta‐blockers (9.1%). Rates did not differ between genders. Drug use in this cohort was uncommon, although not insignificantly so. In total, 53 patients (8.3%) had a history of marijuana (4.3%), methamphetamine (2.0%), or cocaine use (2.0%). The median 10‐year ASCVD risk was low, although slightly higher in women compared with men (6 [3–10] % vs. 4 [2–6] %, p < .001) (Table 1).

### A prehospital acute coronary syndrome in a cocaine user: an unstable clinical situation [^111AGMUx]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason why cocaine-addicted patients call the emergency department, and acute coronary syndromes are difficult to diagnose in these situations. A 30-year-old cocaine-user patient contacts the Emergency Medical Assistance Service with constrictive chest pain. A doctor is sent out to the patient at home. The initial ECG is normal. No other aetiology of chest pain is revealed, except nicotine and cocaine addictions. First, a coronary artery spasm is suggested, caused by the injection of cocaine. During the journey, the patient indicates that the chest pain has returned. A 12-lead ECG shows repolarisation abnormality in the form of a subepicardial ischaemia. Fibrinolysis is not prescribed in view of the patient's history and of the proximity of the interventional cardiology team. The coronary angiogram enables the diagnosis of myocardial bridging in the middle anterior interventricular artery, and no significant lesion of the coronary arteries is noted. A particular feature of prehospital management in France is that medical care can be given in the early stages by a physician who is called by the patient. This case report discusses the specific care requirements of which the emergency physician needs to be aware in the context of this unstable clinical situation due to the urgency associated with the difficulties of ECG diagnosis of ST-segment elevation in cocaine users.

### Tenecteplase (Tnkase) [^112FWWMW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5	Increased Risk of Heart Failure and Recurrent Ischemia when used with Planned Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) in STEMI.

In a trial of patients with STEMI, there were trends toward worse outcomes in the individual components of the primary endpoint between TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone (mortality 6.7% vs. 4.9%, respectively; cardiogenic shock 6.3% vs. 4.8%, respectively; and CHF 12% vs. 9.2%, respectively). In addition, there were trends towards worse outcomes in recurrent MI (6.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p = 0.03) and repeat target vessel revascularization (6.6% vs. 3.4%, respectively; p = 0.0045) in patients receiving TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In patients with large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, physicians should choose either thrombolysis or PCI as the primary treatment strategy for reperfusion. Rescue PCI or subsequent elective PCI may be performed after administration of thrombolytic therapies if medically appropriate; however, the optimal use of adjunctive antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies in this setting is unknown.

5.6	Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity, including urticarial / anaphylactic reactions, have been reported after administration of TNKase (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and urticaria). Monitor patients treated with TNKase during and for several hours after infusion. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, initiate appropriate therapy (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids).

### Hospital admissions for chest pain associated with cocaine use in the United States [^1113nmCf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The outcomes related to chest pain associated with cocaine use and its burden on the healthcare system are not well studied.

Methods

Data were collected from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2001–2012). Subjects were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.

Results

We identified 363,143 admissions for cocaine-induced chest pain. Mean age was 44.9 (± 21.1) years with male predominance. Left heart catheterizations were performed in 6.7%, whereas the frequency of acute myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary interventions were 0.69% and 0.22%, respectively. The in-hospital mortality was 0.09%, and the primary outcome occurred in 1.19% of patients. Statistically significant predictors of primary outcome included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; confidence interval, 1.00–1.35; p = 0.046), age > 50 years (OR, 1.24, CI, 1.07–1.43; p = 0.004), history of heart failure (OR, 1.63, CI, 1.37–1.93; P < .001), supraventricular tachycardia (OR, 2.94, CI, 1.34–6.42; p = 0.007), endocarditis (OR, 3.5, CI, 1.50–8.18, P = .004), tobacco use (OR, 1.3, CI, 1.13–1.49; P < .001), dyslipidemia (OR, 1.5, CI, 1.29–1.77; P < .001), coronary artery disease (OR, 2.37, CI, 2.03–2.76; P < .001), and renal failure (OR, 1.27, CI, 1.08–1.50; p = 0.005). The total annual projected economic burden ranged from $155 to $226 million with a cumulative accruement of more than $2 billion over a decade.

Conclusion

Hospital admissions due to chest pain and concomitant cocaine use are associated with low rates of adverse outcomes. For the low-risk cohort in whom acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out, hospitalization may not be beneficial and may result in unnecessary cardiac procedures.

### Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: clinical implications and diagnostic challenges. overlooked and underappreciated in Asia? [^113QKz8h]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

There is currently no guideline directed medical therapy for SCAD. However, there is expert consensus that since the pathophysiology and disease progression differ greatly, medical treatment of SCAD cannot be extrapolated from treatment of usual atherosclerotic coronary disease. The routine use of heparin and dual antiplatelet therapy may result in increased intramural bleeding and further complications in SCAD patients. The recommendation is to give single agent antiplatelet therapy instead, and continuation beyond 1 year should be made on a case‐by‐case basis, taking into account the bleeding risk and benefits of therapy. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated if SCAD patients had coronary stents implanted to prevent stent‐related thrombosis. Regarding anticoagulation, heparin may be used during revascularization with PCI if indicated. However, long‐term anticoagulation therapy is recommended only where there is a clear clinical indication such as left ventricular thrombus formation or atrial fibrillation. Statin therapy should not be routine in SCAD and should be initiated according to guideline‐based indications for primary prevention of atherosclerosis. Beta‐blockers for those with depressed left ventricular function, hypertension, or arrhythmias have been shown to be helpful. Lastly, antianginals have been shown to have a role in symptomatic treatment of chest pain syndromes post‐SCAD, but routine use is not required in asymptomatic patients. 1

Recurrent de novo SCAD has been reported in 10% of patients. A 2‐fold increase of recurrent SCAD is seen in those with hypertension. Secondary prevention with beta‐blocker should be considered. By reducing arterial shear stress, hypertension, and myocardial contractility beta‐blockers seem to play a pivotal role in protecting patients from further coronary dissection. Management of emotional and physical stressors through tailored exercise programs and psychosocial counseling also help. Illicit drug use of methamphetamine and cocaine should be addressed. Further pregnancy after a diagnosis of SCAD has usually been discouraged by the medical community, although this life changing advice has been based on few case reports and series. 10

Cardiac rehabilitation is fundamental in recovery. Patients reported less chest pain and improved quality of life scores in depression, anxiety and stress level at the end of a dedicated rehabilitation program. 24 There was also lower MACE rates in rehabilitation participants (4.3%) vs the nonparticipating group (26.2%). Long‐term prognosis is usually good for those who survive the initial episode, although the risk of recurrence has been reported to be up to 22%. 3 Pregnancy is generally discouraged in patients diagnosed with SCAD, and strict contraceptive advice should be given if the affected women are in the reproductive age group.

### Beta-blockers are associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction after cocaine use [^116KnuXm]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Beta-blocker use is associated with coronary artery spasm after cocaine administration but also decreases mortality in patients with myocardial infarction or systolic dysfunction. We conduct a retrospective cohort study to analyze the safety of beta-blockers in patients with positive urine toxicology results for cocaine.

Methods

The cohort consisted of 363 consecutive telemetry and ICU patients who were admitted to a municipal hospital and had positive urine toxicology results for cocaine during a 5-year period (307 patients). Fifteen patients with uncertain history of beta-blocker use before admission were excluded. The primary outcome measure was myocardial infarction; secondary outcome measure was inhospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations models and propensity scores compared outcomes.

Results

Beta-blockers were given in 60 of 348 admissions. The incidence of myocardial infarction after administration of beta-blocker was significantly lower than without treatment (6.1% versus 26.0%; difference in proportion 19.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 10.3% to 30.0%). One of 14 deaths occurred in patients who received beta-blockade (incidence 1.7% versus 4.5% without beta-blockade; difference in proportion 2.8%; 95% CI -1.2% to 6.7%). Multivariate analysis showed that use of beta-blockers significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 0.06; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61).

Conclusion

In our cohort, administration of beta-blockers was associated with reduction in incidence of myocardial infarction after cocaine use. The benefit of beta-blockers on myocardial function may offset the risk of coronary artery spasm.

### Intracoronary poloxamer 188 prevents reperfusion injury in a porcine model of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^113x3RYQ]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

The CORE trial, a phase II, open-label clinical trial published in 1997, tested the safety and potential benefits of P188 in 2,948 STEMI patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. No clinical benefit was observed. However, multiple significant limitations to the protocol can now be observed (Table 1). First, P188 was delivered by peripheral IV approximately 30 min after thrombolytic therapy was administered. Although the detailed timing is not described in the published study, the CORE trial protocol recommended randomization within 15 min of thrombolytic infusion with initiation of the P188 within 15 min of randomization. This provides a 30-min delay in P188 therapy from the time of revascularization. Prior studies using cyclosporine, known to prevent reperfusion injury by inhibiting opening of the mPTP in the setting of cardiac arrest, have shown a severe degradation in efficacy of treatment within as little as 3 min after return of spontaneous circulation. Therefore, the 30-min delay in the CORE trial may have negated the opportunity to attenuate reperfusion injury. In contrast, our study demonstrates a 68% reduction in infarct size when a similar dose of P188 was delivered directly into the affected coronary artery immediately after reperfusion.

Table 1
Comparison of the CORE Trial and the Current Study

Use of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the current study represents the current standard of care for STEMI patients in the United States where catheterization laboratories are available. Until recently, thrombolytic therapy was the standard treatment modality for patients experiencing myocardial infarction. However, 26% of patients failed to achieve reperfusion even in recent trials. In the CORE trial, which exclusively enrolled patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, 46% of control subjects did not achieve revascularization after administration of the thrombolytic. If reperfusion is never achieved, treatments that prevent reperfusion injury will be ineffective. PCI has been shown to result in normal coronary artery flow in over 90% of patients. Although absolutely necessary, reinitiation of coronary flow increases the potential for reperfusion injury, creating a need for innovative therapies to prevent this damage.

### Intracoronary thrombolysis in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HBCTL]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischaemic heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) occurs due to coronary vessel occlusion causing transmural myocardial ischaemia and subsequent necrosis. The cornerstone of contemporary management involves prompt reopening of the occluded coronary artery with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Despite restoring epicardial blood flow, roughly 50% of patients fail to achieve adequate microvascular perfusion. This phenomenon, known as microvascular obstruction (MVO), is predictive of a poor cardiac prognosis driven by left ventricular remodelling and larger infarct size.

In patients with STEMI, MVO is characterised by distal embolisation of atherothrombotic debris and fibrin-rich microvascular thrombi. A growing body of evidence supports the efficacy of adjunctive low-dose intracoronary (IC) thrombolysis in this population. Sezer et al performed the first randomised controlled trial (RCT), demonstrating an improvement in myocardial perfusion with low-dose IC streptokinase post-PCI. Subsequent studies focused on newer fibrin-specific agents with a lower propensity for systemic bleeding. Despite encouraging results, many studies were inadequately powered and yielded conflicting outcomes. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjunctive IC thrombolytic therapy at the time of primary PCI in patients with STEMI.

### Myocardial infarction… [^114HHTR7]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake. The complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque is usually the underlying mechanism of an MI. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress and extreme cold, among others. Many tests are helpful with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms, blood tests and coronary angiography. An ECG, which is a recording of the heart's electrical activity, may confirm an ST elevation MI, if ST elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB. Treatment of an MI is time-critical. Aspirin is an appropriate immediate treatment for a suspected MI.

Nitroglycerin or opioids may be used to help with chest pain; however, they do not improve overall outcomes. Supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low oxygen levels or shortness of breath. In a STEMI, treatments attempt to restore blood flow to the heart and include percutaneous coronary intervention, where the arteries are pushed open and may be stented, or thrombolysis, where the blockage is removed using medications. People who have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction are often managed with the blood thinner heparin, with the additional use of PCI in those at high risk. In people with blockages of multiple coronary arteries and diabetes, coronary artery bypass surgery may be recommended rather than angioplasty. After an MI, lifestyle modifications, along with long-term treatment with aspirin, beta blockers and statins, are typically recommended.

Genome-wide association studies have found 27 genetic variants that are associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. The strongest association of MI has been found with chromosome 9 on the short arm p at locus 21, which contains genes CDKN2A and 2B, although the single nucleotide polymorphisms that are implicated are within a non-coding region. Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills have a modestly increased risk of myocardial infarction, especially in the presence of other risk factors. The use of non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, even for as short as a week, increases risk. Endometriosis in women under the age of 40 is an identified risk factor. A cholesterol core forms as foam cells die. In response to growth factors secreted by macrophages, smooth muscle and other cells move into the plaque and act to stabilize it. A stable plaque may have a thick fibrous cap with calcification.

If there is ongoing inflammation, the cap may be thin or ulcerate. Exposed to the pressure associated with blood flow, plaques, especially those with a thin lining, may rupture and trigger the formation of a blood clot. The cholesterol crystals have been associated with plaque rupture through mechanical injury and inflammation. Tissue death If impaired blood flow to the heart lasts long enough, it triggers a process called the ischemic cascade; the heart cells in the territory of the blocked coronary artery die, chiefly through necrosis, and do not grow back. A collagen scar forms in their place. When an artery is blocked, cells lack oxygen, needed to produce ATP in mitochondria. ATP is required for the maintenance of electrolyte balance, particularly through the Na/K ATPase. This leads to an ischemic cascade of intracellular changes, necrosis and apoptosis of affected cells.

### Β-blockers for chest pain associated with recent cocaine use… [^111Se8kD]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Over a median follow-up of 972 days, after adjusting for potential confounders, patients discharged on a β-blocker regimen exhibited a significant reduction in cardiovascular death. -4 As a sodium channel blocker, cocaine may also be proarrhythmic, potentially resulting in malignant ventricular arrhythmias. 4 Owing to these multiple effects, cocaine may trigger severe hypertension, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and death. 3, 4 Traditional teaching dictates that β-blockers are contraindicated in the setting of cocaine-associated chest pain. β-Blockers have definitively been shown to improve outcomes after MI, 14, 15 and evidence to withhold this potentially life-saving therapy in the setting of cocaine-associated chest pain may not be sufficiently robust.

While patients with cocaine-associated chest pain givenβ-blockers may be at risk, many may also derive the same benefits afforded other populations with ischemic chest pain. A recent study found a decreased incidence of MI among cocaine users given β-blockers in the emergency department. 16 However, only a small proportion of these patients were admitted with chest pain, and long-term mortality was not assessed. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that β-blockers are safe when administered to patients with chest pain and recent cocaine use, we studied short-term outcomes and long-term mortality in a cohort of patients with chest pain with positive urine toxicologic test results for cocaine, who did and did not receive β-blockers. We performed a retrospective study of consecutive patients admitted to San Francisco General Hospital between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2006, with chest pain and urine toxicologic test results positive for cocaine.

Patients were identified based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for chest pain, angina, or chest discomfort and positive urine toxicologic test results for cocaine using a previously established electronic database maintained by the Division of Internal Medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, California. The primary predictor was receipt of a β-blocker in the ED, and the primary outcome was death. Of note, treatment of chest pain in the setting of recent cocaine use was not dictated by any established protocol, and β-blocker use was determined by the discretion of the treating physicians. Secondary predictors included the receipt of any β-blocker during the hospitalization and discharge on a β-blocker regimen.

Secondary outcomes included peak troponin level in the first 24 hours of admission, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia requiring defibrillation, need for intubation, and need for vasopressor agents. Cardiovascular death as determined by death certificates from the National Death Index was also a secondary outcome. Analyses were performed to examine any abnormal troponin I level and troponin I level in the MI range. A positive troponin level lower than 1. 5 ng/mL was considered indeterminate, and a troponin level higher than
1. 5 ng/mL was considered to represent an acute MI. Troponin levels in the indeterminate or acute MI range were considered positive. The majority of patients received a β-blocker at some point during their hospitalization.

### Thrombolysis… [^114NwH8D]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Thrombolysis, also called fibrinolytic therapy, is the breakdown of blood clots formed in blood vessels, using medication. It is used in ST elevation myocardial infarction, stroke, and in cases of severe venous thromboembolism. The main complication is bleeding, and in some situations thrombolysis may therefore be unsuitable. Thrombolysis can also play an important part in reperfusion therapy that deals specifically with blocked arteries. Medical uses Diseases where thrombolysis is used:

- ST elevation myocardial infarction: Large trials have shown that mortality can be reduced using thrombolysis in treating heart attacks. It works by stimulating secondary fibrinolysis by plasmin through infusion of analogs of tissue plasminogen activator, the protein that normally activates plasmin.
- Stroke: Thrombolysis reduces major disability or death when given within 3 hours of ischaemic stroke onset when there are no contraindications to treatment.
- Massive pulmonary embolism. For the treatment of a massive pulmonary embolism, catheter-directed therapy is a safer and more effective alternative to systemic thrombolysis. This involves the injecting of drugs directly into the clot.
- Severe deep vein thrombosis, such as phlegmasia cerulea dolens, which threatens limb loss, or iliofemoral DVT, where clots involve at a minimum the common iliac vein
- Acute limb ischaemia
- Clotted hemothorax Thrombolysis is usually intravenous. It may also be used directly into the affected blood vessel during an angiogram, e.g. when patients present with stroke beyond three hours or in severe deep vein thrombosis.

Myocardial infarction Absolute contraindications:

- Any previous history of hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke within 3 months.

### Cocaine [^111d4kNJ]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

Intoxication may cause euphoria, psychosis, and physical symptoms like tachycardia and mydriasis. An overdose can lead to stroke, heart attack, or sudden cardiac death. Chronic cocaine use leads to cocaine dependence and can cause nose disorders, commonly referred to as "Cocaine nose", including cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions when insufflated. Since 1961, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime. In the United States, cocaine is regulated as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act, meaning that it has a high potential for abuse but has an accepted medical use. While rarely used medically today, its accepted uses include serving as a topical local anesthetic for the upper respiratory tract and as an antihemorrhagic agent to stop bleeding in the mouth, throat, and nasal cavities.

Medical Karl Koller's groundbreaking discovery of cocaine as a local anesthetic is regarded as the second most significant advance in the history of anesthesia. Although cocaine was once widely preferred for topical anesthesia, the search for replacement agents intensified due to rising costs, strict regulations, and its habit-forming potential. Today, the US Drug Enforcement Administration classifies cocaine as a Schedule II drug, recognizing its high potential for abuse but still permitting its limited use for medical purposes. Although some absorption and systemic effects may occur, the use of cocaine as a topical anesthetic and vasoconstrictor is generally safe, rarely causing cardiovascular toxicity, glaucoma, and pupil dilation. Occasionally, cocaine is mixed with adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate and used topically for surgery, a formulation called Moffett's solution.

It is occasionally used in surgeries involving the pharynx or nasopharynx to reduce pain, bleeding, and vocal cord spasm. Cocaine hydrochloride was approved for medical use in the United States in January 2020. Headache and epistaxis are the most frequently reported adverse reactions with Goprelto, while hypertension and tachycardia-including sinus tachycardia-are most common with Numbrino. Cocaine can act as a teratogen, having various effects on the developing fetus. Some common teratogenic defects caused by cocaine include hydronephrosis, cleft palate, polydactyly, and down syndrome. Cocaine as a drug has a low molecular weight and high water and lipid solubility which enables it to cross the placenta and fetal blood-brain barrier. Cocaine also may cause an unborn baby to have a stroke, irreversible brain injury, or a myocardial infarction. Levamisole syndromes Cocaine is frequently cut with levamisole.

Levamisole induced necrosis syndrome Levamisole induced necrosis syndrome is a complication characterized by necrosis resulting from exposure to levamisole, a medication with immunomodulatory properties. While LINES can occur with levamisole use alone, most reported cases are associated with the use of cocaine adulterated with levamisole as a cutting agent. This syndrome is marked by skin necrosis, often affecting areas such as the ears, face, and extremities, and is thought to result from levamisole's effects on blood vessels and the immune system. Cocaine/levamisole-associated syndromes The skin necrosis associated with levamisole toxicity ranges from leukocytoclastic vasculitis to occlusive vasculopathy. Several cases of severe agranulocytosis associated with cocaine use have been reported since 2006. With the recently recognized dermal disease, the face and ears are commonly affected, especially the bilateral helices and cheeks.

### Management of thrombolysis-associated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage… [^111Q9JAq]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Ongoing bleeding after diagnosis in a patient with thrombolysis-associated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. A, A 56-year-old man with acute left-sided weakness and dysarthria underwent computed tomography 1. 5 hours after symptom onset and received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator 35 minutes later. B, Follow-up CT 11 hours later showed hemorrhagic conversion of a large right frontoparietal ischemic infarct, along with small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right cerebral convexity. C, Follow-up CT 8 hours later showed increased hemorrhage with increasing edema and mass effect. Background Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is the most devastating complication of thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke. It is not clear whether patients with sICH continue to bleed after diagnosis, nor has the most appropriate treatment been determined.

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of our prospectively collected Get With the Guidelines–Stroke database between April 1, 2003, and December 31, 2007. Radiologic images and all procoagulant agents used were reviewed. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Results Of 2362 patients with acute ischemic stroke during the study period, sICH occurred in 19 of the 311 patients who received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and 2 of the 72 who received intra-arterial thrombolysis. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with sICH than in those without. Treatment for coagulopathy was not associated with outcome. Continued bleeding occurred in 4 of 10 patients with follow-up scans available.

Conclusions In many patients with sICH after thrombolysis, coagulopathy goes untreated. Our finding of continued bleeding after diagnosis in 40. 0% of patients suggests a powerful opportunity for intervention. A multicenter registry to analyze management of thrombolysis-associated intracerebral hemorrhage and outcomes is warranted. Acute ischemic stroke causes substantial morbidity and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. 1 The only current pharmacotherapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Thrombolytic therapies can also be delivered intra-arterially, 2 and this method of therapy is commonly used off-label. 3 Several clinical trials have found that thrombolytic therapy decreases morbidity and improves long-term outcome.

4–7 The American Heart Association has recommended that systems of care be established to maximize the ability of all patients with stroke to receive the best available therapy, including thrombolytic agents. 8 In fact, it appears that the use of thrombolytic agents is increasing9 and may continue to increase because recent evidence suggests an expanded time window for intravenous thrombolysis.
4. The most feared complication of this therapy is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. 10 Although the overall benefits of tPA for stroke appear to outweigh the risks, 4, 5, 11 up to 7% of patients treated for stroke will develop this complication. The development of sICH is associated with worse outcome, 12–14 and clinicians caring for these patients are faced with the difficult decision of how best to treat them. During the study period, 2362 patients presented with acute ischemic stroke, of whom 352 (14.
