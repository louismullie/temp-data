what should i do about 63 year old female with dizziness, fatigue with CRP of 15

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to approach a 63-year-old woman presenting with dizziness, fatigue, and a CRP of 15 mg/L, including how to interpret the CRP, prioritize the differential, and outline a stepwise diagnostic and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of a CRP of 15 mg/L in an older adult. Then, I should verify the most likely and most dangerous causes of dizziness and fatigue in this age group. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to an initial workup. After that, I need to outline immediate management steps, including when to start empiric therapy. Finally, I will consider follow-up, monitoring, and special scenarios like COVID-19 or medication effects, and I will double-check where my initial assumptions might be off and correct them as needed.

> Let me first confirm the meaning of the CRP value. A CRP of 15 mg/L sits in the "moderate inflammation" range by consensus thresholds, and importantly, in adults aged 61–98, higher CRP independently predicts greater fatigue and new-onset fatigue over subsequent months, suggesting a true inflammatory contribution rather than just sickness behavior or subclinical disease confounding, so I should not dismiss it as trivial in this 63-year-old patient [^115Gemak] [^111GA8jc] [^112JuQdz]. Wait, let me verify the kinetics and context: CRP rises within 12–24 hours of an inflammatory trigger and peaks around 48 hours, so a single value of 15 mg/L is meaningful but should be interpreted alongside the clinical picture and, if needed, trended to clarify trajectory and treatment response [^112YoH1B] [^117Rowvf].

> Next, I should review the most likely and most dangerous causes of dizziness plus fatigue in a 63-year-old with elevated CRP. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — dizziness spans vestibular, cardiovascular, hematologic, endocrine, infectious, and medication-related etiologies, and fatigue in this age group with elevated CRP often signals systemic inflammation from infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy, or cardiovascular disease, so I need to keep a broad differential while prioritizing time-sensitive threats like anemia, giant cell arteritis, cardiac arrhythmia or failure, and serious infection [^notfound] [^notfound].

> I will now examine anemia as a leading cause of dizziness and fatigue with an inflammatory backdrop. Let me think about iron deficiency anemia of chronic disease: a microcytic anemia with elevated CRP fits, and even mild to moderate anemia can cause orthostatic dizziness, reduced exercise tolerance, and cognitive slowing; I should confirm hemoglobin, MCV, iron studies, and reticulocyte count, and remember that anemia in inflammatory states may reflect hepcidin-mediated iron sequestration rather than pure iron deficiency, so ferritin can be misleadingly normal or high despite iron-restricted erythropoiesis. Wait, I should verify that I'm not overlooking acute blood loss — occult GI bleeding remains a critical consideration in older adults with fatigue and dizziness, so stool testing and, if indicated, endoscopic evaluation should be on the radar once hemodynamics are stable [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the dizziness is actually vertigo or presyncope suggesting a vestibular or cardiovascular cause rather than pure lightheadedness from anemia. I need to check orthostatic vitals and perform a focused neurologic and otologic exam, and if vertigo persists or there are neurologic signs, I should consider MRI of the brain and internal auditory canals per ACR guidance, while remembering that BPPV is common and treatable with canalith repositioning maneuvers; if dizziness is episodic and positional, BPPV moves to the top of the list, whereas continuous vertigo or focal deficits warrant neuroimaging [^115VcHnj] [^111rQ6dj]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not over-ordering CT for undifferentiated dizziness — routine CT is not recommended in episodic vestibular presentations without red flags, which helps avoid low-yield radiation [^112daYq2].

> Giant cell arteritis (GCA) must be actively considered in any patient over 50 with new headache, visual symptoms, jaw claudication, or constitutional symptoms, but I should double-check that atypical presentations exist — vertigo, dry cough, and even stroke can be the presenting features, and up to 18% of biopsy-proven GCA cases may present with only atypical features, which delays treatment and increases morbidity. Importantly, normal inflammatory markers do not exclude GCA, so clinical suspicion should drive urgent temporal artery ultrasound or biopsy and empiric high-dose glucocorticoids if vision is threatened or symptoms are compelling [^112pkbBT] [^114KFwW4] [^116cxA4Z]. I need to ensure I ask about new headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms today, and if present, I should not wait for confirmatory testing before initiating steroids when the risk of irreversible vision loss is real [^1179mCdj] [^115LrK3U].

> Next, I should review cardiovascular causes of dizziness and fatigue, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and valvular disease. Let me first confirm vitals, orthostatics, an ECG, and a basic cardiac exam. If there are red flags such as exertional symptoms, chest discomfort, palpitations, or edema, I should obtain natriuretic peptides and troponin when appropriate and consider echocardiography, because myocarditis and new heart failure can present with nonspecific fatigue and dizziness and may be accompanied by elevated CRP, and syncope or presyncope warrants guideline-based evaluation for autonomic or structural causes [^114VUdnw] [^113yqfDP]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not attributing all fatigue to cardiac disease — overlap is common, but objective testing prevents premature closure.

> I need to check for infectious etiologies that can present subtly in older adults, including occult respiratory, urinary, or tick-borne disease. Let me consider COVID-19 given fatigue and dizziness are common and CRP may be modestly elevated in mild disease; testing is reasonable if epidemiologically or clinically suspected, and I should remember that in hospitalized patients with progressive severe COVID-19 and elevated inflammatory markers, adding tocilizumab to steroids can be considered per IDSA, though that threshold is typically higher than 15 mg/L and not applicable to mild outpatient disease [^117Qu6No] [^1138MxEE] [^117RRMEx]. I should also review exposure risks for tick-borne illness in endemic regions, as Borrelia miyamotoi and other pathogens can cause fatigue, dizziness, and elevated inflammatory markers, and may require targeted testing and therapy when suspected [^115sLyB8].

> Now, I should review medication contributions and orthostatic intolerance. Polypharmacy is common at 63, and agents like antihypertensives, diuretics, antiemetics, and sedatives can precipitate orthostatic hypotension and dizziness; I need to reconcile medications and, if orthostatic symptoms are present, pursue guideline-based autonomic evaluation and management, including volume optimization and, when indicated, further autonomic testing [^113yqfDP]. Wait, let me verify that I'm not missing a medication-induced myopathy or neuropathy contributing to fatigue — reviewing dose changes and new starts is essential.

> Let me synthesize a prioritized differential and immediate workup. Most likely: anemia of chronic disease or iron deficiency anemia; possible: vestibular disorder such as BPPV, orthostatic hypotension, early heart failure or arrhythmia, thyroid disease, or medication effect; must-not-miss: giant cell arteritis, serious infection, malignancy, and myocarditis or pericarditis. I should obtain CBC with indices, iron studies, ferritin, renal and hepatic panel, TSH, ECG, orthostatic vitals, urinalysis, and consider COVID-19 testing if indicated; if anemia is confirmed, I should evaluate for sources of chronic blood loss and consider inflammatory anemia physiology, and if GCA is suspected, I should order ESR, CRP (already 15 mg/L), and arrange urgent temporal artery ultrasound or biopsy while not delaying steroids if vision-threatening features are present [^114KFwW4] [^1179mCdj]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overtesting — trending CRP can be helpful if the inflammatory contribution remains unclear after initial evaluation, especially in chronic disease contexts [^115Gemak].

> For immediate management, I need to ensure hemodynamic stability and address reversible contributors. If anemia is significant, transfusion thresholds and iron repletion should follow standard practice, with attention to the underlying cause. If BPPV is likely, perform canalith repositioning maneuvers. If orthostatic hypotension is present, adjust offending medications, reinforce hydration, and consider compression and salt strategies per autonomic guidance. If GCA is suspected with visual symptoms, start high-dose glucocorticoids urgently while arranging confirmatory testing. If heart failure or myocarditis is suspected, initiate guideline-directed therapy and monitor response. And if infection is identified, treat appropriately while recognizing that a CRP of 15 mg/L alone does not distinguish bacterial from viral etiologies and must be interpreted in clinical context [^111rQ6dj] [^113yqfDP] [^115LrK3U] [^114VUdnw]. I should double-check that I'm not starting steroids prematurely in the absence of GCA suspicion, as that could obscure other diagnoses; steroids are reserved for compelling indications like suspected GCA or severe inflammatory disease after weighing risks and benefits [^115LrK3U].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. I will reassess symptoms and repeat CRP in 1–2 weeks to document the inflammatory trajectory and tie it to clinical response; if CRP rises or fails to fall despite treatment, I should broaden the search for infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease and consider advanced imaging such as CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis or PET-CT when the source remains occult, guided by pretest probability and evolving findings [^115Gemak]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm aligning imaging with clinical evolution — indiscriminate imaging without localization risks harm and low yield, so I will anchor testing to new symptoms or persistently unexplained inflammation.

> Special scenarios deserve explicit consideration. If there is a history of COVID-19 or persistent post-viral symptoms, I should consider post-COVID fatigue and dysautonomia, recognizing that CRP may be modestly elevated and that symptoms often reflect neurologic involvement rather than ongoing systemic hyperinflammation. Management is supportive and rehabilitative rather than immunosuppressive in the absence of active inflammatory disease [^11734suL] [^115DYNEM]. If the patient is on or recently started methotrexate or other DMARDs, I should confirm that fatigue and dizziness are not adverse effects and ensure appropriate laboratory monitoring, as these agents can contribute to malaise and cytopenias that mimic or exacerbate anemia [^112Era3e] [^116QAxaE].

> In summary, I need to ensure a structured approach: interpret CRP 15 mg/L as moderate inflammation with a likely true inflammatory driver of fatigue in this age group, prioritize anemia, giant cell arteritis, cardiovascular disease, and infection in the differential, execute a focused but comprehensive initial workup, treat urgent conditions without delay (especially GCA with visual symptoms), and use serial CRP and clinical response to refine diagnosis and management over the next 1–2 weeks, correcting course if new data contradict my initial assumptions [^115Gemak] [^114KFwW4] [^117Rowvf].

A 63-year-old woman with dizziness and fatigue and a CRP of 15 mg/L has **moderate inflammation** [^115Gemak] that warrants a **structured workup** to identify the cause. Begin with a focused history and exam to characterize dizziness, screen for red flags, and assess for infection, autoimmune disease, malignancy, or cardiovascular disease. Order CBC, ESR, CMP, TSH, glucose, HbA1c, urinalysis, and a 12-lead ECG; add chest X-ray, echocardiography, or brain MRI only if indicated by clinical suspicion [^115VcHnj]. Management targets the underlying cause, with urgent action for red flags (e.g. temporal artery biopsy for suspected GCA [^1179mCdj], **echocardiography for suspected myocarditis** [^114VUdnw]). Monitor CRP trends to track response, and refer to cardiology, rheumatology, or neurology as needed.

---

## Clinical significance of CRP 15 mg/L

By GLIM criteria, **moderate inflammation** is 10–50 mg/L; > 50 mg/L is severe [^115Gemak]. CRP rises within 12–24 hours and peaks at 48 hours, so a single value reflects current activity; serial measurements help track response [^112YoH1B] [^117Rowvf]. In older adults, higher CRP independently predicts fatigue and future fatigue onset, supporting a true inflammatory contribution [^111GA8jc] [^112JuQdz].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The combination of dizziness, fatigue, and moderate CRP elevation suggests several **categories**:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Pneumonia <br/> - Urinary tract infection <br/> - Endocarditis <br/> - COVID-19 [^112fuswT] [^117Qu6No] |
| Autoimmune/inflammatory | - Polymyalgia rheumatica <br/> - Giant cell arteritis <br/> - Systemic lupus erythematosus <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis [^115BvAij] [^114KFwW4] |
| Cardiovascular | - Heart failure <br/> - Arrhythmias <br/> - Myocarditis <br/> - Pericarditis [^114VUdnw] |
| Hematologic | - Anemia <br/> - Leukemia <br/> - Lymphoma [^114LAMpw] |
| Endocrine | - Hypothyroidism <br/> - Hyperthyroidism <br/> - Diabetes mellitus [^112Xv2Rw] |
| Neurologic | - Vestibular disorders <br/> - Parkinson's disease <br/> - Multiple sclerosis [^115VcHnj] |
| Medication-related | - Antihypertensives <br/> - Sedatives <br/> - Antidepressants [^notfound] |

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate for anemia, infection, or hematologic malignancy [^notfound].
- **Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)**: Complement CRP for inflammatory activity [^115BvAij].
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: Assess renal, hepatic function, electrolytes, and glucose [^1166CkGv].
- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: Screen for thyroid dysfunction [^notfound].
- **HbA1c**: Evaluate for diabetes mellitus.
- **Urinalysis**: Screen for urinary infection or renal disease [^notfound].
- **12-lead ECG**: Identify arrhythmias or ischemia [^114VUdnw].

---

### Imaging studies (if indicated)

Order a **chest X-ray** for suspected respiratory infection or heart failure [^1144kk9X]. Use **echocardiography** when myocarditis, pericarditis, or structural heart disease is suspected [^113meB6H]. Obtain a **brain MRI** for focal deficits, persistent vertigo, or suspected CNS disease [^115VcHnj].

---

### Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

- **Temporal artery ultrasound or biopsy**: Suspected giant cell arteritis [^114KFwW4].
- **Autoimmune panel (ANA, RF, anti-CCP)**: Suspected autoimmune disease [^notfound].
- **COVID-19 PCR or serology**: Suspected recent or ongoing infection [^116nDenZ].
- **HIV screening**: Risk factors present [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on identifying and treating the **underlying cause** while providing symptomatic relief:

- **Infectious etiologies**: Appropriate antibiotics or antiviral therapy [^111Er4Xm].
- **Autoimmune/inflammatory conditions**: Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. corticosteroids, methotrexate) [^113qjJC5].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Standard heart failure, arrhythmia, or myocarditis management [^1113ymcM].
- **Anemia**: Iron supplementation, transfusion if severe [^111mviMJ].
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Hormone replacement or antithyroid therapy [^112Xv2Rw].
- **Medication-related**: Adjust or discontinue offending agents [^113qjJC5].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **CRP trends** to assess treatment response and disease course [^117Rowvf]. Reassess symptoms regularly to gauge improvement or progression. Refer to cardiology, rheumatology, or neurology as indicated for specialized evaluation and management.

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation

- **Chest pain or dyspnea**: Suspected cardiovascular disease [^114VUdnw].
- **Visual disturbances or jaw claudication**: Suspected giant cell arteritis [^114KFwW4].
- **Severe headache or focal neurologic deficits**: Suspected stroke or CNS disease [^notfound].
- **Fever or chills**: Suspected infection [^117Qu6No].
- **Unexplained weight loss or night sweats**: Suspected malignancy [^notfound].

---

A CRP of 15 mg/L in a 63-year-old woman with dizziness and fatigue indicates **moderate inflammation** and merits a structured workup to identify the cause. Use a focused history, exam, and targeted labs/imaging; treat the underlying condition and monitor CRP to track response, escalating care for red flags or lack of improvement.

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — movement/habituation-based VR is "significantly less effective than CRP as an initial treatment for BPPV", so VR "should be considered an option in the treatment of BPPV rather than a recommended first-line treatment modality for BPPV". VR is "indicated for patients with BPPV who have persistent disability following CRP, refuse CRP, or are not candidates for CRP", and is "particularly indicated in patients with additional impairments where further therapy is needed to resolve more nonspecific dizziness and those patients with heightened fall risk (eg, elderly)". Supporting evidence notes "An RCT found that individuals with BPPV who were treated with CRP and additional VR exercises (balance/habituation) had significantly improved measures of overall gait stability when compared with those who had received isolated CRP (Epley) for their BPPV", and "this study documented that increased balance performance was achieved in patients only when additional movement/habituation-based VR was administered".

Regarding diagnostic investigations for fever in the ICU, more specifically with respect to inflammatory markers, IDSA/SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining CRP, in addition to bedside clinical evaluation, if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed low-to-intermediate in critically ill patients with new fever and no clear focus of infection. Avoid obtaining CRP to rule out bacterial infection if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed high.

### Giant cell arteritis: is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing? [^115LrK3U]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

On physical examination, it is important to look for abnormalities in temporal arteries (i.e. thickening, tenderness, beading or reduced pulsation), but attention must also be focused on the remaining peripheral arterial territories to disclose pulse deficits, bruits or asymmetric arterial pressure measurements in any of the four limbs. Although there is no specific laboratory marker for the disease, acute phase reactants (platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C reactive protein) are elevated in the majority of patients. Conversely, normal values are not sufficient to rule out the diagnosis when there is a strong clinical suspicion. Anemia can also be present, as well as raised liver enzymes.

Temporal artery biopsy, performed with appropriate technique, is considered the gold-standard for diagnosis. Nevertheless, the most recent EULAR guidelines consider that early imaging test, such as temporal artery ultrasound, performed by a trained specialist using appropriate operational procedures and settings, may be an alternative to the temporal artery biopsy. Treatment should not be delayed due to pending biopsy results, and it has been demonstrated that histologic changes are recognizable within two weeks after starting therapy. Advances in imaging over the last few years have constituted a major step forward in the diagnosis of GCA. Besides the use of duplex ultrasonography of the temporal artery for the diagnosis of GCA in patients presenting with the typical pattern of cranial manifestations, other Imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance, computed tomography (CT)-angiography, and [¹⁸F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET/CT) can help to diagnose patients with predominant extracranial manifestations, many of them presenting with atypical manifestations of the disease. These new imaging techniques allows to identify clinically silent large vessel involvement. Experts in the field consider that in some cases they may also be used to monitor response to treatment.

### Methotrexate (Rasuvo) [^112Era3e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4	Laboratory Tests

Patients undergoing Rasuvo therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests and a chest X-ray.

During therapy, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

During initial or changing doses, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver has not been established for patients with psoriasis. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population.

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.5	Risks from Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that Rasuvo is administered once weekly and that mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.6	Patients with Impaired Renal Function, Ascites, or Pleural Effusions

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Rasuvo administration.

5.7	Dizziness and Fatigue

Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and fatigue, may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.8	Malignant Lymphomas

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment. Discontinue Rasuvo first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted.

Patient #1: a longstanding disease with multiple system involvement and a dramatic response to vemurafenib

A 39 year-old woman of Turkish-Iraqi descent presented in September 2007 to the emergency department with low grade fever, signs of weakness and difficulty walking due to diffuse bone pain mostly in the knees and both pectoral and pelvic girdles. Shortly before her admission the patient began experiencing alternating hot flashes and cold bouts disproportionate to the weather or clothing and suffered from frequent night sweats. Approximately six months prior to this incident, fatigue and leg pain slowly developed. The pain originally began as a tingling sensation, accompanied by paresthesia. It had escalated over several months and progressed to fully fledged bone pain. At the time of presentation, the pain was described as initiating at rest and constant, occasionally accompanied by episodes of fever. The patient was admitted for several consecutive hospitalizations. Upon inspection of her face, both exophthalmos and yellowish peri-orbital xanthelasmae-like lesions were apparent. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable, without deformation or bony swelling and without neurological deficits. It is noteworthy that the patient was polydypsic and polyuric for approximately five years prior to the onset of bone pain, consuming and excreting up to 12 liters of water per day. Despite this, a diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was established and treatment with intranasal desmopressin initiated only upon hospitalization, presumably due to the patient's adjustment to the gradual changes in water metabolism over the years. Apart from her known iron deficiency anemia, laboratory studies revealed increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP: 70 mg/L) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 72 mm/hour). A broad panel of immunologic studies, including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear antibodies was unremarkable. Negative blood and urine cultures ruled out an infectious etiology. Protein electrophoresis (PEP) yielded no monoclonal spike and the oncological markers were found to be within normal limits. Further investigations included radiography, which revealed bilateral sclerotic changes in the femoral and tibial bones and electromyography, which demonstrated normal muscle and nerve functionality. A subsequent 99m Tc bone scintigraphy demonstrated increased tracer uptake in the superior aspect of both orbits, the central sphenoidal region, left humeral head, right femoral greater trochanter and lateral superior aspect of the left iliac crest as well as diffuse, symmetric, bilateral increased tracer uptake in the femurs and tibiae enveloping both knees (Figure 1 A). A CT of the femurs and tibiae exhibited an irregular osseous texture demonstrating bones riddled with mixed patchy lesions of sclerotic and lytic nature. This was suggestive of either a metabolic, malignant or granulomatous process. An additional CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed congestion of both renal sinuses with slightly distended ureters (Figure 2 A). CT and later MRI of the brain revealed bilateral retro-orbital nodular lesions (Figure 3 A), diffuse thickening and tortuosity of the optic nerves, enlargement of both lacrimal glands and soft tissue fullness of the sphenoid sinus (Figure 3 C). An MRI dedicated to the pituitary revealed no deviation from the normal anatomy. Over the two week period between two consecutive hospitalizations papilledema developed, accompanied by headaches, blurred vision and nausea. A lumbar puncture revealed an increased opening pressure of 44 cmH₂O. Treatment with acetazolamide (250 mg × 3 daily) was initiated, the increased intracranial pressure normalized and related symptoms abated. Biopsies were obtained from the tibial bone marrow and from a lacrimal gland. A microscopic examination of the tibial biopsy revealed bony trabeculae separated by a xanthomatous, diffuse spindle cell macrophage population with few interspersed giant cells (Figure 4 A). The spindle cells stained relatively uniformly for the presence of CD163, and in a more patchy fashion but quite strongly for factor XIIIa (Figure 4 C), surface staining for CD14 and granular intense staining for CD68 (Figure 4 B). CD1a and S-100 staining were globally negative (Figure 4 D) except for one focus of S-100(+) cells, suggesting infiltration of the marrow with Langerhans cells. Overall, these findings were most consistent with a diagnosis of ECD with a component of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Over the five years pursuant to her diagnosis on May 2007, the patient was treated with several treatment protocols. At first, steroids (prednisone, 60 mg/day) provided a temporary relief - a marked decrease in bone pain, decrease in CRP levels and normalization of fever. Two months later vinblastine (6 mg/m²/week) was introduced as a steroid sparing agent. This protocol failed to evoke a favorable long lasting response and was substituted for treatment with interferon-α. Since then, interferon-α has served as the primary therapeutic agent administered at dosages as low as 3 × 10⁶ IU × 3 times weekly and as high as 6 × 10⁶ IU × 5 times weekly. Initially, interferon-α was administered as a single agent. Later on, it was complemented by vinblastine (8 mg/1 to 4 months) and by pamidronic acid (60 mg/1 to 3 months) in order to better control the lytic lesions. It is noteworthy that this patient continued to deteriorate neurologically even at the highest doses of interferon-α administered (6 × 10⁶ IU × 5 times weekly). However, the addition of vinblastine to this regimen succeeded in stabilizing the patient clinically and allowed for a gradual decrease in the dosage of interferon-α to a maintenance dose of 6 × 10⁶ IU × 2 times weekly over a two year period. Three years after the diagnosis of ECD, a four-month trial of anakinra (100 mg/day) was attempted, mainly due to multifocal disease progression. However, this agent yielded unsatisfactory results. This attempt was followed by a five-month trial of cladribine (0.14 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days, every four weeks), a drug which yielded no apparent benefit to the patient and was very poorly tolerated. By this time, the patient's neurological symptoms, vis-à-vis her lingual and motor capabilities, had deteriorated greatly once again. She was markedly dysarthric and confined to a wheelchair. Consequently, a biopsy obtained from the peri-renal mass was attempted and found to contain ECD histiocytes which harbor the V600E BRAF mutation. After receiving proper counseling and signing an informed consent, treatment with vemurafenib (1,920 mg/day later tapered to 960 mg/day) was initiated with no less than a spectacular improvement. After two weeks of treatment the patient began to exhibit clinical improvement. Ultimately, following treatment with this agent, the patient regained her ability to walk distances of up to 500 meters and recovered her ability to speak fluently.

Abstract

A 61-year-old man with a medical history of human immunodeficiency virus well controlled on antiretroviral therapy presented for distal sensorimotor symptoms, fatigue, and recurrent fevers. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both elevated. Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody and antinuclear antibodies were negative. Neurologic imaging workup was unremarkable. ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT, which was crucial for diagnosis, demonstrated pathological tracer activity throughout the medium-sized vessels with sparing of the aorta. In view of presentation, comorbidities, and imaging findings, polyarteritis nodosa was diagnosed. The patient was treated appropriately with steroids and cyclophosphamide with significant symptomatic improvement.

Biochemical data and inflammation markers in oncology — Careful interpretation of laboratory results may be required because oncology patients can experience wide variations in glucose and white blood cell (WBC) values due to treatment; C-reactive protein (CRP) should not be used to evaluate the presence of inflammation, although elevated CRP may be indicative of inflammation; past interpretation of > 10mg/L CRP has been used to indicate inflammation, and determining the presence and degree of inflammation influences the significance of many lab values and their interpretation.

A 12-year-old Hispanic girl presented with fatigue, lightheadedness, and intermittent headaches. She was depressed and appeared pale to her mother. Her examination was unremarkable except for palpebral conjunctival pallor and was otherwise noncontributory. She had a profound hypoproliferative microcytic anemia with low iron level, low transferrin saturation, and a normal ferritin level. The patient experienced improvement in clinical symptoms following transfusion of packed red blood cells and oral iron therapy. At follow-up 2 months later, she presented with similar symptoms and persistent microcytic anemia with low iron levels. Her ferritin level was increased along with markedly elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An oral iron challenge demonstrated lack of absorption, and hepcidin level was also significantly elevated. Thorough gastrointestinal and rheumatologic evaluations were performed to search for a source of inflammation. Key components of the patient's social history supplemented by serology, radiographic, and pathologic findings ultimately cinched an unexpected diagnosis.

Assessment of treatment response

The main objective of the core study was to assess the efficacy of canakinumab with respect to treatment response (Table 1). The extension study assessed the long‐term efficacy of canakinumab with respect to relapse in patients who completed the core study. Complete response was defined as a physician global assessment of autoinflammatory disease activity as less than or equal to "minimal" (on a 5‐point scale of absent, minimal, mild, moderate, and severe) and assessment of skin disease as less than or equal to "minimal" (on a 5‐point scale of absent, minimal, mild, moderate, and severe) and serologic response indicated by serum C‐reactive protein (CRP) < 15 mg/liter or serum amyloid A protein (SAA) < 10 mg/liter 21. Relapse was defined for complete responders based on clinical features (physician global assessment greater than "minimal" or physician global assessment greater than or equal to "minimal" and assessment of skin disease greater than "minimal") and serologic features (serum CRP > 30 mg/liter or SAA > 30 mg/liter).

Table 1
Assessment of response to canakinumab in patients with cryopyrin‐associated periodic syndrome a

Physician global assessment of autoinflammatory disease activity

For the physician global assessment, the following 8 features were each graded on a 5‐point scale (ranging from absent to severe): skin disease (urticaria‐like skin rash), arthralgia, myalgia, headache/migraine, conjunctivitis, fatigue/malaise, other symptoms related to autoinflammatory syndrome, and symptoms not related to autoinflammatory syndrome.

Evaluation of markers of inflammation

Serum levels of the inflammation markers CRP and SAA were determined in a central laboratory for all patients, regardless of age. The normal ranges for CRP and SAA levels were 0–6 mg/liter and 0–6.7 mg/liter, respectively.

Safety assessment

Safety of canakinumab was assessed in terms of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 17.1) reporting criteria for clinical trials.

Immunogenicity assessment

Anticanakinumab antibody concentrations were assessed in serum, and their potential correlation with any AEs or SAEs and/or loss of efficacy was analyzed.

### Rilonacept (Arcalyst) [^116yAGGo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The changes in mean symptom scores for the randomized parallel-group period (Part A) and the randomized withdrawal period (Part B) of the study are shown in Table 2. ARCALYST-treated patients had a larger reduction in the mean symptom score in Part A compared to placebo-treated patients. In Part B, mean symptom scores increased more in patients withdrawn to placebo compared to patients who remained on ARCALYST.

Daily mean symptom scores over time for Part A are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Group Mean Daily Symptom Scores by Treatment Group in Part A and Single-blind ARCALYST Treatment Phase from Week -3 to Week 15

Improvement in symptom scores was noted within several days of initiation of ARCALYST therapy in most patients.

In Part A, patients treated with ARCALYST experienced more improvement in each of the five components of the composite endpoint (joint pain, rash, feeling of fever/chills, eye redness/pain, and fatigue) than placebo-treated patients.

In Part A, a higher proportion of patients in the ARCALYST group experienced improvement from baseline in the composite score by at least 30% (96% vs. 29% of patients), by at least 50% (87% vs. 8%) and by at least 75% (70% vs. 0%) compared to the placebo group.

Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels are acute phase reactants that are typically elevated in patients with CAPS with active disease. During Part A, mean levels of CRP decreased versus baseline for the ARCALYST treated patients, while there was no change for those on placebo (Table 3). ARCALYST also led to a decrease in SAA versus baseline to levels within the normal range.

During the open-label extension, reductions in mean symptom scores, serum CRP, and serum SAA levels were maintained for up to one year.

### Methotrexate (Otrexup) [^116QAxaE]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Tests

Patients undergoing Otrexup therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly. Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts, hepatic enzymes, renal function tests and a chest X-ray.

During therapy, monitoring of these parameters is recommended: hematology at least monthly, renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

During initial or changing doses, or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels (e.g., dehydration), more frequent monitoring may also be indicated.

Liver Function Tests

Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy. Persistent liver function test abnormalities, and/or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver has not been established for patients with psoriasis. Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population.

Pulmonary Function Tests

Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate-induced lung disease is suspected, especially if baseline measurements are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.5 Risks from Improper Dosing

Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that Otrexup is administered weekly and that mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

5.6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function, Ascites, or Pleural Effusions

Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function, ascites, or pleural effusions. Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or, in some cases, discontinuation of Otrexup administration.

5.7 Dizziness and Fatigue

Adverse reactions, such as dizziness and fatigue, may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery.

5.8 Malignant Lymphomas

Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low-dose oral methotrexate. However, there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low-dose oral methotrexate, which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate, without requiring active anti-lymphoma treatment. Discontinue Otrexup first and, if the lymphoma does not regress, appropriate treatment should be instituted.

5.9 Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Like other cytotoxic drugs, methotrexate may induce "tumor lysis syndrome" in patients with rapidly growing tumors.

### Promoting appropriate utilisation of laboratory tests for inflammation at an academic medical centre [^115jFBYD]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Strategy

Prior to developing our interventions, we conducted an email survey of selected physician leaders in groups with high ESR utilisation rates to investigate reasons for the current practice. Five open-ended questions explored: (A) perceived drivers of combined ESR/CRP testing, (B) potential negative impact of reducing ESR testing, (C) clinical situations in which ESR would be preferable to CRP, (D) potential barriers to change and (E) anticipated impact of EMR CDS on the clinical practice of their group.

We performed an informal thematic analysis of survey results, which identified several recurring themes. Surveyed physicians across different specialties indicated low awareness that CRP was a more sensitive and specific test for acute phase inflammation and that the American Society for Clinical Pathology recommended against ordering an ESR in this clinical scenario. Clinical habit and ease of test ordering were identified as key drivers of ESR overuse. In addition, several surveyed physicians identified specific disease states or clinical scenarios where they felt ESR provided additive or more accurate clinical information than CRP, and thus, completely eliminating ESR use would not be a clinically prudent or feasible goal. One surveyed physician indicated that she preferred ESR because she (mistakenly) believed it was a less expensive test than CRP. As anticipated, there was a general concern that EMR changes would make it more difficult to order appropriate tests.

Case‐Based Dynamic Learning of Inhaled treatment for dyspnea in a rare childhood disease

Podcast 1

(pulmonologist #1): In a patient presenting with dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, and clubbing, these complaints may be signs of a chronic disease involving the respiratory tract. In addition, other causes, including cardiac causes and other organ system diseases, must be considered with these findings.

(pulmonologist#2): In the differential diagnosis of cardiac disease, we search for findings of pulmonary edema, elevated pulmonary artery or systemic blood pressure, and rhythm disorderfindings.

(pulmonologist#3): Tuberculosis, malignancy, and collagen tissue diseases are primarily includedin the differential diagnosis because of weight loss. The patient's sedimentation, C‐reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin (Hb), and leucocyte values were within normal limits. However, tuberculosis, pulmonary involvement of collagen tissue diseases, or interstitial lung disease may be investigatedin cases where findings related to the respiratory system are at the forefront. PFT and imagingmethods may be the next step for differential diagnosis.

### Clinical reasoning: a 62-year-old woman with transient vision loss [^112hVoBu]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Transient visual loss (TVL) is a common complaint in the emergency department, with numerous possible etiologies. Prompt evaluation and management of TVL can potentially prevent progression to permanent visual loss. In this case, a 62-year-old woman presented with acute, painless, unilateral TVL. Two weeks before presentation, the patient reported bitemporal headaches and paresthesia of the distal extremities. A review of systems revealed chronic fatigue, cough, diffuse arthralgias, and decreased appetite for the previous 6 months. This case highlights the diagnostic approach to patients with TVL. Some common and rare causes associated with this clinical manifestation are briefly reviewed.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^116mw7YP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. Blood levels of the prototypic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is hepatically synthesized and released in response to interleukin-6 stimulation, is markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Markedly high CRP levels correlate with poor prognosis for survival. Insights into CRP structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 pathologies and prognoses. Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of CRP blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in COVID-19 patients.

### Age modification of the relationship between C-reactive protein and fatigue: findings from understanding society (UKHLS) [^112JuQdz]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic inflammation may play a role in the development of idiopathic fatigue, that is, fatigue not explained by infections or diagnosed chronic illness, but this relationship has never been investigated in community studies including the entire adult age span. We examine the association of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and fatigue assessed annually in a 3-year outcome period for UK adults aged 16–98.

Methods

Multilevel models were used to track fatigue 7, 19, and 31 months after CRP measurement, in 10 606 UK individuals. Models accounted for baseline fatigue, demographics, health conditions diagnosed at baseline and during follow-up, adiposity, and psychological distress. Sensitivity analyses considered factors including smoking, sub-clinical disease (blood pressure, anaemia, glycated haemoglobin), medications, ethnicity, and alcohol consumption.

Results

Fatigue and CRP increased with age, and women had higher values than men. CRP was associated with future self-reported fatigue, but only for the oldest participants. Thus, in those aged 61–98 years, high CRP (> 3 mg/L) independently predicted greater fatigue 7, 19, and 31 months after CRP measurement [odds ratio for new-onset fatigue after 7 months: 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21–2.92; 19 months: 2.25, CI 1.46–3.49; 31 months: 1.65, CI 1.07–2.54]. No significant longitudinal associations were seen for younger participants.

Conclusions

Our findings support previously described CRP-fatigue associations in older individuals. However, there are clear age modifications in these associations, which may reflect a contribution of unmeasured sub-clinical disease of limited relevance to younger individuals. Further work is necessary to clarify intervening processes linking CRP and fatigue in older individuals.

### Guillain-barrésyndrome in a patient with antibodies against SARS-COV-2 [^117FHkGf]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case

On March 20th, a 68 years old man developed dry cough, headache, fatigue, myalgia and fever up to 39°C followed by anosmia and ageusia. He was tested for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA 10 days after symptom onset, which revealed a negative result and was treated by the primary care physician at home. Premedical history was uneventful and the patient did not take regular medication. On April 1 st, oral methylprednisolone 10 mg/day was started for suspected rheumatoid arthritis due to persistent pelvic girdle and muscle pain of the proximal lower extremities, a C‐reactive protein of 8.5 mg/dl (normal: 0.0–0.5 mg/dl), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (63 mm/1 h). On April 3rd (14 days after onset of pulmonary disease) the patient had recovered from respiratory symptoms, but still complained of severe fatigue and developed symmetric distal tingling in both feet followed by ascending dysesthesias up to the knees and proximal weakness. The next day he presented at the neurological emergency room with inability to walk. On examination, the patient was alert and fully oriented, afebrile with normal vital signs (oxygen saturation 98% on room air, blood pressure 143/90 mmHg, heat rate 85 bpm). Laboratory examination revealed slightly elevated C‐reactive protein (2.3 mg/dl, normal: 0.0–0.5 mg/dl), fibrinogen level 650 mg/dl (normal: 210–400 mg/dl), white blood cell count 8.1 G/l (normal: 4.0–10.0 G/l), lactate dehydrogenase 276 U/L (normal: 100–250 U/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 55 mm/1 h. Neurological examination showed decreased sensation to touch and pinprick in the lower extremities, absent ankle jerk, atactic stance and inability to walk without assistance. Additional truncal dysesthesia prompted spinal cord MRI with unremarkable findings. Lumbar CSF on day 2 after onset of neurological symptoms showed normal cell counts (2/mm [) and protein level (64 mg/dl) and a serum/CSF glucose ratio of 0.83. Due to the history of pulmonary symptoms a chest‐computed tomography was performed and revealed residual ground‐glass opacities in both lower lungs suggestive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Based on the neurological presentation GBS was diagnosed, the patient was admitted to the COVID‐19 isolation ward and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG, 30 g) was initiated. His respiratory condition worsened, and the patient required oxygen supplementation (3 l/min) followed by pressure support non‐invasive ventilation after 36 h. Nerve conduction studies performed on the following day showed F‐wave abnormalities in all nerves, delayed distal motor latency in one nerve, reduced distal amplitudes in two and a sural‐sparing pattern supporting acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy subtype of the GBS (Table 1). Simultaneously, the neurologic presentation worsened with progressive weakness (Medical Research Council grading 1–5) in both arms (2/5) and hands (4/5) and both legs (2/5) and feet (4/5) and generalized areflexia. PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was repeatedly negative in oropharyngeal swabs (three times) as well as in CSF and the patient was transferred to the neurological intensive care unit. At the same time, Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2‐ antibodies were highly positive in serum and CSF with an optical density (OD) ratio relative to the calibrator OD (normal < 0.8) of 9.6 in serum (diluted 1:100) and 9.1 in CSF (diluted 1:2) determined by commercially available CE‐marked ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany;) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Due to the non‐linearity of the read‐out the intrathecal fraction (i.e. antibody specific index) could not be quantified and it is not possible to differentiate intrathecal synthesis of antibodies or passive transfer across the blood‐CSF barrier. As yet, we detected no false positives or negatives using this ELISA. Anti‐ganglioside antibodies, PCR for Cytomegalovirus, Epstein‐Barr virus, Influenza virus A/B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus and IgM antibodies for Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative in this patient. Due to muscle weakness accompanied by respiratory failure the patient underwent elective intubation in a fully conscious state and the initial intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, which was initiated on April 6th (total dose 30 g) was switched to plasma exchange on April 7th, which was 3 days after symptom onset. In total four cycles of plasma exchange were performed. Again, SARS‐CoV‐2 on PCR assay from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was negative. The patient improved gradually and was transferred to a neuro‐rehabilitation facility 4 weeks after symptom onset, where he regained mobility without significant help another 4 weeks later.

### Atypical signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis: a systematic review [^112pkbBT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis can present with atypical manifestations that delay treatment and risk severe complications.

Objectives

To comprehensively describe all atypical signs/symptoms of giant cell arteritis.

Design

In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to October 2022. Primary research articles that included at least one participant with an atypical sign/symptom of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis were included. Study screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with atypical giant cell arteritis features. Time to treatment was compared between participants with atypical giant features only and participants with both typical and atypical features.

Results

Of 21,828 screened records, 429 studies corresponding to 746 individuals (median [IQR] age 72 [IQR, 66–78] years, 63% female) with at least one atypical feature of GCA were included. Eighty-two percent had both atypical and at least one concurrent typical giant cell arteritis feature, whereas 18% of patients with atypical signs and symptoms only presented with atypical features. Patients with atypical symptoms presented to clinicians earlier than patients with typical features (p < 0.001). There was no difference between groups in proportion to elevated ESR and CRP (82.3% vs. 83.35%, p = 0.91) or mortality rate (8.2% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.42). Patients with atypical features only experienced greater delay in treatment initiation (p < 0.001). The most commonly reported atypical signs/symptoms were vertigo (11.9%), scalp necrosis/ulceration (7.9%), and dry cough (5.8%).

Conclusions

Eighteen percent of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis cases with at least one atypical feature have only atypical features and are more likely to experience delays in treatment. Clinicians should be aware of atypical signs/symptoms of giant cell arteritis and order inflammatory markers early to prevent giant cell arteritis-associated morbidity.

Case presentation

Case 1

In September 11, 2019, a 39-year-old woman was hospitalized for coughing, difficulty breathing, and a low-grade fever (38.0 °C) that persisted for 25 days, and a persistent sputum discharge 3 days before admission. During the course of the disease, there were no other symptoms (e.g. dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss). Her medical records included two cesarean sections but no other history of illness, and she was not taking any hormones or immunosuppressive agents. The patient did have a history of working for months in an unventilated office.

Diagnoses

On admission to the hospital, the patient's body temperature was 38.1 °C. In addition, the patient had developed symptoms of shortness of breath (35 bpm) and severe hypoxemia (PaO₂, 62 mmHg; FiO₂, 0.80). During auscultation, the patient had good air sounds in both lungs and medium moist rales. Hematological results showed normal white blood cell counts (6.6 × 10⁹/L), while neutrophil counts were slightly higher, accounting for 78.7% granulocytes (or neutrophils) (Additional file 1: Fig. 1); C-reactive protein at 102 mg/L was 13.7 times higher than normal; and there were fibrinogen in the plasma. The proteinogen level was 4.46 g/L. There were a large number of Gram-positive bacteria in the sputum smear, but no bacterial growth was observed in the culture. Procalcitonin and fungal-glucan levels were normal. The respiratory virus test was negative. Computed tomography of the lungs showed multiple bilateral pneumonia (Fig. 1 A, a, B, b).

Outcome measure selection after concussion — guidance states that evidence from high-quality CPGs informed by moderate-level evidence indicates that postconcussion symptom assessments/checklists should be used to monitor recovery, with perhaps more comprehensive outcome measures to specifically evaluate certain symptoms (eg, dizziness, headache, fatigue, and neck pain). Evidence from a moderate-quality cohort study indicates that the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and DVAT may be useful as outcome measures for individuals who have experienced a concussion and exhibit vestibular impairments.

### Fatigue and cognitive impairment after COVID-19: a prospective multicentre study [^11734suL]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The best predictor of post-COVID fatigue was the number of acute COVID symptoms. Among these, altered consciousness, dizziness and myalgia showed the strongest association. In contrast, COVID disease severity (in terms of home isolation vs. general hospital ward vs. intensive care) was not significantly associated with long-term fatigue, which is consistent with findings from a recent meta-analysis and a large cohort study in hospitalised patients. This suggests that the affected organ systems, especially central and peripheral nervous system involvement, are more relevant for the development of fatigue than overall illness severity.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying post-COVID fatigue remain largely elusive. However, accumulatingevidence points to a virus-related autoimmune aetiology. Both fatigue and increased autoimmunity are common sequela of infections with SARS-CoV-1, MERS, Epstein-Barr, herpes and hepatitis viruses, and fatigue is a common symptom of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosisand autoimmune encephalitis. Indeed, acute patients with COVID-19 who have neurological symptoms also show high frequencies of CSF autoantibodies. Furthermore, measures of inflammation have been found to be associated with overall post-COVID syndrome severity, independent of confounding inflammatory comorbidities, and COVID-related mortality, and have thus been suggested as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Indeed, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly correlated with concomitant fatigue severity in our univariate linear regression analysis (standardised beta = -0.08, p = 0.013), but showed no association in multivariable models. Future studies should investigate a wider spectrum of pro-inflammatory cytokines as potential biomarkers of post-COVID fatigue.

### Proceedings of the 32nd European paediatric rheumatology congress [^1113ymcM]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Results: At admission, the patient reported severe fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), appetite loss, dizziness, and subfebrile episodes. Initially evaluated for suspected lymphoma, she was later transferred to a cardiology center after clinical deterioration. Laboratory tests revealed elevated CRP (87 mg/L), NT-proBNP (21,838 pg/mL), D-dimer (16.84 mg/L), and anemia (Hb 78 g/L). Imaging confirmed bilateral pulmonary embolism with infarct pneumonia, a left ventricular thrombus, and angiographic signs of type V Takayasu arteritis. Involved vessels included the brachiocephalic trunk, both subclavian and renal arteries, the celiac trunk, abdominal aorta, and bilateral carotid arteries (with complete occlusion on the right). Optimal heart failure therapy was selected: sacubitril/valsartan 25 mg/day, bisoprolol 3.75 mg/day, spironolactone 50 mg/day, furosemide 40 mg/day, dopamine 3 mcg/kg/min, and warfarin 2.5 mg/day. In the rheumatology department, treatment was initiated with methylprednisolone 30 mg/day (with gradual tapering), mycophenolic acid 1500 mg/day, and biologic therapy with the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg (320 mg IV every 28 days). The patient showed progressive improvement: normothermia, stabilized blood pressure, and improved cardiac function (EF up to 25%). Inflammatory markers significantly decreased: CRP to 1.7 mg/L, NT-proBNP to 4252 pg/mL, D-dimer to 0.48 mg/L, and Hb to 128 g/L.

Conclusion: This case illustrates an uncommon presentation of Takayasu arteritis in a child, initially mimicking malignancy and heart failure. Diagnosis was achieved through a multidisciplinary approach and imaging. The patient responded well to individualized therapy and remains under follow-up for continued biologic treatment. Consent to published had been obtained.

Suggested approach to the diagnosis of HAPE: The diagnosis of HAPE requires a very specific clinical context — an unacclimatized lowlander ascending to elevations ≥ 2500 m — and relies on symptoms including dyspnea on exertion out of proportion to previous experience at high altitude or that experienced by other individuals at the same elevation. Nonproductive cough, fatigue, weakness, and gurgling sensation in the chest may also be present, and with progression individuals become dyspneic with mild exertion or at rest and may develop cyanosis and cough productive of pink frothy sputum.

C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds for inflammation — interpretation and use are as follows: CRP levels of 3.0–9.9 mg/L are consistent with mild inflammation, levels of 10–50 mg/L are consistent with moderate inflammation, and levels of > 50 mg/L are consistent with severe inflammation; these thresholds are provided to help support identification of individuals with inflammatory diseases and conditions, not to assess risk for development of disease. Serial CRP measures can be helpful when the status or contribution of inflammation is unclear in the setting of a chronic condition, and measurement of CRP trends can be helpful, because a single normal CRP value does not exclude the possible contribution of an inflammatory component; whenever possible, the opportunity to make use of CRP test results that have been ordered for other medical purposes is encouraged.

C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: Plasma CRP levels start to rise 12 — 24 hours after an acute inflammatory or infectious insult, reaching a maximum value after 48 hours. Levels of CRP are typically below 5 mg/L and the typical cutoff for CRP is 10 mg/L. Like PCT, results are available within minutes with point-of-care assays or within an hour with laboratory-based assays; laboratory assays are quantitative and suitable for serial monitoring. Unlike PCT, CRP concentrations can be affected by neutropenia, immunodeficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus negatively affects the functional performance of 6-min step test in chronic heart failure: a 3-year follow-up study [^112xqdZ8]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

6-min step test — 6MST

The 6MST has been previously validated for individuals with CHF. Prior to the test, upon arrival at the laboratory, participants were informed about the nature and dynamics of the test so that any doubts regarding carrying it out could be clarified. Then, they underwent a period of 4 min of rest (2 min sitting and 2 min standing) so that vital signs could be collected (resting heart rate [HR], peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO₂] and blood pressure systemic) in addition to perceived exertion for dyspnea and fatigue of the lower limbs using the BORG 10 scale in each position. At the end of the 4 min, they were instructed to go up and down a single step with a height of 20 cm (cm) in a self-paced manner, being allowed to slow down, if necessary, and even interrupt the test to rest. Verbal encouragement commands were used for each minute of testing and the time remaining until completion. The step numbers were counted from the beginning to the end of the 6-min time and recorded. Vital signs collected prior to the test, as well as feelings of lower limb fatigue and dyspnea were obtained immediately at the end of the test and the 6th min of recovery.

Despite being considered a test of a submaximal nature, some criteria for interrupting the exam were adopted so that the integrity of the patient's health was guaranteed: reaching 85% of maximum HR, arterial oxygen saturation ≤ 87%, systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 170 mmHg and DBP greater than 110 mmHg, BORG score greater than 7 for dyspnea and lower limb fatigue, anginal pain > 2, dizziness, vertigo and nausea. The prediction of functional performance of participants in the 6MST for the Brazilian population was made using the equations proposed by Arcuri et al. 6MST = 209 – (1.05 × age) for men and 6MST = 174 – (1.05 × age) for women, where age is expressed in years; and Albuquerque et al. 6MST = 106 + (17.02 × [0:woman; 1:man]) + (− 1.24 × age) + (0.8 × height) + (− 0.39 × weight) where 6MST is expressed in number of steps; age, in years; height, in cm; and weight, in kg.

### Diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, physical signs, and laboratory tests for giant cell arteritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KFwW4]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Main Findings

This updated meta-analysis provides more precise estimates of LRs associated with symptoms, signs, and laboratory features of GCA. Features that, if present, should upgrade the level of suspicion for GCA are limb claudication; jaw claudication; various temporal artery abnormalities; a platelet count of greater than 400 × 10³/μL; ESRs of greater than 60, 80, and 100 mm/h; and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Features that should downgrade the level of suspicion for GCA are 70 years or younger; a CRP level in the reference range or less than 2.5 mg/dL; and an ESR of no greater than 40, 50, or 60 mm/h. For most patients with suspected GCA, no single feature is likely to shift pretest probability sufficiently to render further investigation for GCA unnecessary. However, these likelihood ratios may inform clinical decisions, including selection and timing of investigations, and whether to immediately commence high-dose glucocorticoid therapy or await further test results.

### Giant cell temporal arteritis with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate: report of a case [^117QA5u7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Giant cell temporal arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis that affects individuals older than 50. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has typically been used in the ED as a screening test to rule out GCA. There have been documented cases in medicine and rheumatology journals of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis with a normal or low ESR before steroid therapy. In the ED, the practitioner must use multiple resources to make the diagnosis of GCA, as there is no specific test that establishes the diagnosis. Delaying this diagnosis based on a laboratory value can create substantial morbidity and mortality for the patient. We report a case of an elderly woman who developed visual changes and had a delayed diagnosis because of a normal ESR value.

An 89-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of chronic daily headaches that significantly worsened over the past 4 months. Initially episodic, the left-sided headaches became continuous and were accompanied by systemic symptoms such as weight loss and elevated inflammatory markers, specifically C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Over subsequent weeks, the neurologic examination revealed new-onset left-sided ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and marked visual acuity loss. This article explores the differential diagnosis for such a complex clinical presentation and highlights how a systematic diagnostic approach can guide clinicians toward the correct diagnosis.

### Epcoritamab-bysp (Epkinly) [^117MFyoc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma (FL)

CRS occurred in 49% (42/86) of patients with FL receiving EPKINLY at the recommended 3-step up dosage schedule in EPCORE NHL-1, with Grade 1 CRS occurring in 45% and Grade 2 in 9% of patients. Recurrent CRS occurred in 23% of patients. Of all the CRS events, most (88%) occurred during Cycle 1. In Cycle 1, 14% of CRS events occurred after the 0.16 mg dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, 7% after the 0.8 mg dose on Cycle 1 Day 8, 17% after the 3 mg dose on Cycle 1 Day 15, and 49% after the 48 mg dose on Cycle 1 Day 22. The median time to onset of CRS from the most recent administered EPKINLY dose across all doses was 59 hours (range: 0.1 to 7 days). The median time to onset after the first full 48 mg dose was 61 hours (range: 0.1 to 7 days). CRS resolved in 100% of patients and the median duration of CRS events was 2 days (range: 1 to 14 days).

In both patients with LBCL and FL who experienced CRS, the signs and symptoms included pyrexia, hypotension, hypoxia, dyspnea, chills, and tachycardia. Concurrent neurological adverse reactions associated with CRS occurred in 2.5% of patients with LBCL and 4.7% of patients with FL. Concurrent neurological adverse reactions observed in patients with LBCL included headache, confusional state, tremors, dizziness, and ataxia. Concurrent neurological adverse reactions observed in patients with FL included headache and dizziness.

Initiate therapy according to EPKINLY step-up dosage schedule. Administer pretreatment medications to reduce the risk of CRS and monitor patients for potential CRS following EPKINLY accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4)]. At the first signs or symptoms of CRS, immediately evaluate patients for hospitalization, manage per current practice guidelines, and administer supportive care as appropriate. Withhold or discontinue EPKINLY based on the severity of CRS [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Patients who experience CRS (or other adverse reactions that impair consciousness) should be evaluated and advised not to drive and to refrain from operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery until resolution.

### Older adults | Chronic disease indicators… [^112R4EYL]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know
- The U. S. population is aging, with almost a quarter of the population expected to be 65 or older by 2060.
- Aging increases the risk of chronic diseases like dementia, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and cancer.
- Older adults are also more vulnerable to severe illness from infections, including flu and pneumonia.
- Effective strategies for healthy aging are needed to improve the length and quality of life of older adults, and their ability to live independently. 1 In addition, COPD coexists with other conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, that have high hospitalization rates. 2 Risk factors for COPD-related hospitalization include patients with COPD who have a past history of similar events, severe airflow limitation, poor health status, increased age, presence of emphysema, leukocytosis, 3 poor health-related quality of life and lack of regular physical activity.

4 Disease-management programs, in addition to pharmacologic or surgical interventions, have been shown to reduce hospitalization among patients with severe COPD at risk for acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Sequential C-reactive protein measurements in patients with serious infections: does it help? [^117Rowvf]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation traditionally used as a complementary tool to support the clinical diagnosis and as a marker of severity of disease. CRP is an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver after stimulus by cytokines and its serum levels increase markedly within hours after the onset of infection, inflammation or tissue injury. Dynamic serial measurement of CRP has been widely used to help therapeutic decision-making. Decreasing plasma concentrations of this biomarker have been used as an indicator for resolution of infection or sepsis.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^117RRMEx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In COVID-19 infections, CRP levels that are minimally elevated (e.g. between 10 and 20 μg/mL) can be diagnostic of mild viral disease. Therapeutic considerations might focus on ways to control viral infectivity and replication using viral neutralization concepts (antibodies/vaccines and receptor blockers), or inhibiting viral-specific enzymes (e.g. remdesivir). COVID-19 patients with moderate elevations of CRP levels (e.g. > 20–40 μg/mL) may harbor some level of (reversible) tissue damage associated with the natural response to combating the viral disease. If these levels are measured relatively early in disease progression, before a cytokine storm response, these levels may suggest a confounding bacterial infection or more significant tissue involvement in disease. Therapeutic considerations may include, in addition to viral neutralization, the use of antimicrobials and immunomodulation using interferon therapies or biologic agents that can neutralize pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα, interleukin-1 (IL-1, and IL-6 inhibitors). COVID-19 patients with significantly elevated CRP levels (e.g. > 100 μg/mL) more readily reflect advanced tissue damage and pathologies associated with cytokine storm, coagulation abnormalities, and multiple organ failure. Such high CRP levels would correlate with a life-threatening prognosis.

### Diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, physical signs, and laboratory tests for giant cell arteritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1179mCdj]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the clinical and laboratory features that may be informative in making a diagnosis of GCA and that should be assessed when evaluating patients with suspected GCA. They should also be reported in future diagnostic cohort studies. Clinicians should obtain a comprehensive history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation for each patient suspected of having GCA. No single symptom, physical sign, or laboratory test is sufficient to completely rule in or rule out GCA. An additional imaging test or TAB is typically needed to make a confident diagnosis of GCA. Our study could not determine whether individual LRs can be combined, or whether there is collinearity between particular features (eg, ESRs and CRP levels with constitutional symptoms). Nonetheless, this study provides important data that could inform a future bayesian probability revision approach to investigation, diagnosis, and management of suspected GCA, which would need to be prospectively validated in future studies.

We report the case of a 78-year-old woman who presented with cardiovascular risk factors and a history of an atypical transient ischaemic attack. She was referred by her primary care physician to the vascular surgery department at our institution for evaluation of progressive weakness, fatigue, arm claudication and difficulty assessing the blood pressure in her right arm. She was being considered for surgical revascularisation, but a careful history and review of her imaging studies raised suspicion for vasculitis, despite her normal inflammatory markers. She was eventually diagnosed with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis with diffuse large-vessel involvement. Her symptoms improved with high-dose glucocorticoids.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^114coeC1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has continued to extend over most of the world, infecting several millions of people and causing more than 250,000 deaths to date (, accessed on May 6, 2020). There has been an intense focus on technologies to diagnose infections by the virus and to assess the prevalence of the infection. Equally important, there has been an unprecedented effort to identify and develop drugs, vaccines, and technologies to treat and prevent further infections as well as to assess disease severity and reduce mortality in affected patients. The purpose of this article was to offer an insight into the potential use of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as a diagnostic index of disease severity and a guide for therapeutic options in COVID-19–infected patients.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving acute inflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and multiple organ failure. Consistent blood markers in afflicted patients are normal to low white cell counts and elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels which, among its many activities, signal the liver to increase synthesis and secretion of CRP. –

C-reactive protein is a widely used diagnostic marker primarily used to assess ongoing inflammation. It is a key protein of the acute phase response, appears in blood within 6–10 hours of any tissue damaging event, has a plasma half-life of 19 hours, and is produced without a memory response. Although its appearance in blood is associated with ongoing inflammatory responses, it does not selectively accumulate into any tissue or organ even in patients known to have ongoing, prominent inflammation. Furthermore, its fractional catabolic rate is independent of its plasma concentration, indicating its rapidly changing blood concentration more nearly reflects on its synthesis rate and not its consumption rate.

### Reducing DNA rates and increasing positive contacts in an outpatient chronic fatigue service [^115qgznm]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) otherwise known as myalgic encephalomyelitis represents a complex debilitating disorder with a wide range of physical and psychological sequelae. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) released guidelines in 2007stating a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome should be considered if: fatigue is present for 3 months and is of new onset, persistent or recurrent, unexplained by any other condition, substantially reduces the amount of activity an individual can do, and the person subjectively feels worse after minimal physical activity. Associated symptomatology include, insomnia, muscle or joint pains without inflammation, recurrent headaches, tender lymph nodes, sore throat, flu-like symptoms, difficulty in thinking, dizziness, nausea, and heart palpitations without cardiac morbidity.

The diagnosis must be made by a clinician and is a diagnosis of exclusion, where other conditions have been ruled out. There is currently no conclusive epidemiological date in the UK for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, but estimates have been made from extrapolations in other countries. An estimated prevalence of between 0.2–0.4%has been calculated, so in a clinic with 10,000 patients, up to 40 people would suffer from the illness with half requiring specialist input from a CFS clinic. A more recent report from the MRCsuggests that the scale and impact of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) on individuals and society is significant. Around 250,000people in the UK have ME/CFS which is at least as disabling as multiple sclerosis and congestive heart failure. Many more people – carers, children and family members – are directly affected by the illness each year. The economic cost of ME/CFS was estimated at £6.4 billionper year in the UK in 2006, and this figure will likely have increased since.

Autonomic evaluation — neurogenic orthostatic hypotension notes that syncope due to neurogenic OH is common in patients with central or peripheral autonomic nervous system damage or dysfunction, and its causes should be sought so as to provide efficient, accurate, and effective management. Symptoms that may distinguish neurogenic OH include persistent and often progressive generalized weakness, fatigue, visual blurring, cognitive slowing, leg buckling, and the coat hanger headache, and these symptoms may be provoked or exacerbated by exertion, prolonged standing, meals, or increased ambient temperature. Confirmation of specific neurogenic OH conditions causing syncope often requires additional autonomic evaluation.

While CRP has been reported as a useful marker of viral and bacterial infection, synthesis of CRP may be reduced during liver failure or after steroid treatment. PCT is produced in response to endotoxin and to cytokines involved in the sepsis cascade. In immunocompetent and neutropenic septic patients, the prognostic value of PCT has been shown to be higher than that of CRP. In our patients, alemtuzumab infusion resulted in a marked increase in both acute phase proteins, especially on the first alemtuzumab infusion day. Some patients presented with PCT and CRP levels typical for acute septic disease, although all patients felt well and no infectious condition could be identified. Increases in CRP and PCT not linked to infection have been previously reported for other monoclonal antibody treatments, but methylprednisolone was not used as in the alemtuzumab protocol. Again, this phenomenon may be explained by lymphocyte destruction and cytokine-mediated effects. A profound stimulatory effect of TNF-α on PCT is sometimes observed. After administration of TNF-α, PCT reached half-maximal concentrations within 8–12 hours earlier than CRP. Hepatotoxicity could also be considered as a potential factor of CRP increase as we were able to demonstrate a distinct increase in liver enzymes as well. Our systematic analysis indicates that clinicians should be aware of the characteristic increase in CRP and PCT during the standard alemtuzumab infusion procedure. As leukocytes are markedly affected by infusions of methylprednisolone and alemtuzumab as well, these parameters are also not useful as a screen for potential infections, which are more frequent in cell-depleted patients. Thus, the need for additional analysis in such patients as seen in 2 cases of Listeria meningitis presenting with increased cell counts in CSF during the first alemtuzumab infusion week becomes apparent. Acute-phase proteins such as CRP and PCT are of limited value as diagnostic markers of severe bacterial infections during alemtuzumab treatment. A combination of a detailed clinical assessment and careful interpretation of collateral biochemical and microbiologic tests probably remains the optimal approach to these patients. Daily standard blood testing does not seem to be helpful during alemtuzumab infusion weeks as many cellular and serologic artifacts are observed that are not conducive to clinical interpretation. We suggest using blood tests only if indicated and knowing the characteristic alemtuzumab effects.

The Study

The patient was a previously healthy 30-year-old man residing in Austin near a creek greenbelt that he frequented (Figure 1); he had no recent travel outside the city. On March 5, 2020, he experienced acute dizziness, headache, myalgia, vomiting, chills, and fever of 37.8°C (reference 36.1°C–37.2°C). Symptoms were attributed to a foodborne illness, and he improved after several days. However, he continued to experience dizziness, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and intermittent severe night sweats, with no report of further fever.

The patient's suspected exposure location (black circle, Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park) was overlayed on a population density by ZIP code map. County boundaries are displayed as gray lines. Population density data was sourced from Esri's U.S. Updated Demographic (2020/2025) Data.

Within 2 weeks, he had Bell's palsy on his left side, and the primary care physician ordered a blood analysis. Results for complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver enzymes were unremarkable. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 62 mm/h (reference < 15 mm/h), and C-reactive protein was 97.5 mg/L (reference < 8.0 mg/L). Valacyclovir (1 g orally 3×/d for 7 d) and prednisone (20 mg orally 2×/d for 5 d) were prescribed, with partial improvement. Subsequent blood testing showed the erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined to 41 mm/h, and C-reactive protein declined to 43.2 mg/L.

Two weeks later, he had Bell's palsy on his right side, blurred vision, tinnitus, and cervical lymph node enlargement. Dizziness, headache, and fatigue continued. Results of complete blood count and metabolic panel were unremarkable. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast, which revealed faint nonspecific enhancement in the right internal auditory canal. High-resolution imaging of the 7th and 8th cranial nerves was not performed.

### Fever and neck pain in an adolescent: a case report [^113dU9Fh]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 16-year-old female with asthma presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. Four weeks prior, she had 2 days of fever, congestion, and headache (Figure 1). Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was positive. Symptoms resolved with supportive care. Three weeks later (1 week prior to presentation), she developed 4 days of fever, headache, neck pain, and fatigue. She presented to an outside emergency department (ED) with concern for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Laboratory evaluation showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 142 mg/L (normal: 0–20 mg/L) and ferritin of 277 ng/mL (normal: 20–90 ng/mL). As she did not meet criteria for MIS-C and laboratory findings were otherwise reassuring, she was discharged home with supportive care. While running in a track competition later that week, she developed acute chest pain, dizziness, and shortness of breath, prompting presentation to the ED.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^111Er4Xm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In normal healthy individuals, baseline CRP levels in blood are reported to be less than 10 μg/mL, with measured CRP below this threshold described as "high sensitivity CRP" values. In situations of tissue trauma or disease, CRP blood levels can increase 10- to 100-fold within 10–72 hours of the inciting cause (i.e. described as "conventional CRP" values), with higher levels correlating with disease severity. Although levels between 10 and 50 μg/mL are diagnostic of an ongoing inflammatory response that can be either acute or chronic, CRP levels above 100 μg/mL in any disease are diagnostic of fulminant inflammation and are associated with poor disease prognosis. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for interpreting the diagnostic significance of CRP describe the difference between conventional and high sensitivity values and provides guidance only for conventional CRP levels.

C-reactive protein levels have been used to differentiate viral from bacterial infections. In uncomplicated viral infections, CRP levels increase minimally to ∼ 20 μg/mL, whereas in bacterial infections, levels increase to > 40 μg/mL. These levels reflect on the degree of tissue involvement and can help diagnose confounding complications. Zhang et al.reported in 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, CRP levels varied from 28.7 μg/mL in non-severe disease (n = 82; range, 9.5–52.1 μg/mL) to 47.6 μg/mL in severe disease (n = 56; range, 20.6–87.1 μg/mL) (see Table 1). In previously studied respiratory viral infections, patients infected with the avian flu strain H7N9 (that emerged in 2013) had mean CRP levels of 84.0 μg/mL. Of note, mean CRP levels in patients who died were 129.6 μg/mL compared with 63.0 μg/mL in those who survived. Higher CRP levels in viral infections may be diagnostic of a concurrent bacterial infection and have been used to help decide whether infected patients should be placed on antibiotic therapy. –

### Stroke as an atypical initial presentation of giant cell arteritis [^115x5TA9]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion although there is a set of typical symptoms associated with giant cell arteritis, such as headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances, atypical symptoms in patients older than 50-years should also be considered for GCA. These atypical symptoms may include chronic cough, fever of unknown origin, and stroke symptoms especially if the patient's ESR levels are elevated. Clinical decision-making should be driven by a high index of suspicion since no single test has perfect sensitivity. Whether a combination of ESR, CRP and temporal artery biopsy results can improve the diagnostic accuracy of GCA would need further study. As with all conditions, prompt diagnosis and the timely initiation of targeted treatment improves the chances of optimal outcomes.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112Xv2Rw]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis — diagnosis and management include characteristic pain radiating to the ears, jaw, or throat with malaise, low-grade fever, and fatigue; laboratory markers show that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein is elevated, mild anemia is common, RAIU is low, and ultrasonography shows diffuse heterogeneity with decreased or normal color-flow Doppler. Patients with mild symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and those failing to respond or with moderate-to-severe symptoms should be treated with corticosteroids. 1/+00 NSAIDs should be considered first-line therapy; if full doses over several days fail, use corticosteroids such as prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer depending upon clinical response. During the hypothyroid stage, levothyroxine may be employed but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months with recovery of normal function verified by thyroid function testing.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^112fuswT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The incubation period for COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.1 days, and 97.5% became symptomatic within 11.5 days. The main clinical symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath and myalgia/arthralgia. Other minor symptoms include headache or dizziness, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Major complications of patients with COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and some also progress to multi-organ failure. The severity of patients with COVID-19 runs on a spectrum from mild, severe to critical.

Given the wide spectrum of severity that can be found in a patient with COVID-19, it is important to identify potential clinical characteristics that would help predict the clinical outcome early. This in turn could guide management in terms of resource allocation. Thus far, several potential predictors of outcome have been suggested to help monitor patients which may develop severe complications. Lymphopenia has been shown to be a prominent laboratory finding in severe COVID-19 patients and is important in predicting the prognosis. Liu et al. has also reported that neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality of patients. Other potential haematological predictors of outcome that have been proposed included C-reactive proteins (CRP) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, cardiac troponin-I, low-density lipoproteins. In a recently published study, Liang et al. proposed a new clinical risk score to predict the occurrence of critical illness in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The risk score included many of the above-mentioned laboratory markers as well as chest radiographic abnormality. It may also be fruitful to look at the temporal progression of blood and radiological results whilst comparing between patient groups with a mild disease course and those with a severe outcome or even death. Insights drawn can demonstrate typical progressions of blood and radiological results which may help to identify patients at high risk of severe outcomes.

### High-dose steroids in high pain responders undergoing total knee arthroplasty: a randomised double-blind trial [^116udaTA]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

A pain dairy was completed by the patient on Days 2–7 reporting VAS pain at rest, night, and 5 m walk test, along with quality of sleep, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness all on NRS (0–10; 0 = no problem and 10 = worst possible). Analgesics and anti-emetics use and overall satisfaction (NRS 0–10; 0 = best possible score and 10 = worst possible score) were also reported. Follow-up was performed at 14, 30, and 90 days using the electronic patient record or by phone. The Clavien–Dindoclassification was used to grade complications, and all complications were evaluated in relation to index surgery. All data were registered in case-report forms and entered into the REDCapelectronic data capture tool (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA).

The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects reporting moderate-to-severe pain (defined as VAS > 30) on a 5 m walk test 24 h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were proportion of patients reporting moderate-to-severe pain (VAS > 30) at passive leg raise, at rest, and at night; cumulated pain (cumulated pain was reported VAS scores added from Days 0–2 and 2–7); use of rescue opioids and anti-emetics; quality of sleep 0–48 h and Days 0–7; CRP before and at 24 and 48 h postoperative; QoR-15 and OR-SDS at 0–48 h; quality of sleep, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness on Days 2–7; and overall satisfaction with analgesic treatment. Also included was hospital LOS, readmissions, medical events and complications, and 90 day mortality.

### Crowned dens syndrome: a rare form of acute neck pain and headache that can be misdiagnosed or missed [^111m3UVM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Crowned dens syndrome (CDS) occurs due to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) in the ligament tissue around the odontoid process of the axis. CDS is characterized by acute neck pain, stiffness, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers. It is a rare cause of neck pain among older people. We report a 71-year-old female patient who presented with acute neck pain, headache, with dizziness. Body temperature showed normal, with elevated C-reactive protein and ESR in the blood. Over the past 5 years, the patient has experienced neck and head pain several times.MRI of the head and CT scan of the neck showed calcification of the transverse atlantoaxial and cruciate ligament in combination with mild compression of the medulla oblongata. The patient was given non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine for 10 days, with significant symptom improvement and no recurrence at 10 months of follow-up.

### Age modification of the relationship between C-reactive protein and fatigue: findings from understanding society (UKHLS) [^111GA8jc]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Longitudinal associations

In men and women aged 61–98, high CRP (3–10 mg/L) predicted higher fatigue and increased odds of binary fatigue onset 7, 19, and 31 months later. Results in this group are therefore consistent with previous longitudinal studies reporting robust predictive associations at single outcome points 3 or 5 years later (Cho et al.), and indicate that predictive associations are visible earlier than previously shown. Building on those studies, we do not see declining CRP–fatigue associations after the first outcome measurement at 7 months, a pattern which would suggest reverse causation, that is, influence of fatigue on CRP. CRP–fatigue associations in the 61–98 group were robust to adjustment for GHQ, and hence do not appear to simply reflect a broader connection between inflammation and psychological distress. We were able to show that CRP–fatigue associations in this group are independent of chronic disease diagnoses during follow-up as well as at baseline, with sensitivity analyses indicating they are independent of smoking, and various aspects of sub-clinical health. Since participants excluded due to missing data were older and in poorer health than those retained, with higher CRP and greater fatigue, any bias from their exclusion is likely to have underestimated associations in that group, such that estimates are conservative.

Age modification

An unexpected result was the lack of longitudinal CRP–fatigue associations for participants aged 60 or younger. This contrasts with previous studies using similar fatigue measures, reporting associations in participants aged 33–45 (Cho et al.) and 39–63 (Cho et al.). A crucial difference is that unlike those studies, we excluded participants with CRP values indicative of acute inflammation in order to focus on chronic processes. We also adjusted for chronic illness diagnosed during follow-up. Including CRP between 10 and 20 mg/L, high CRP predicted fatigue only at the second outcome point for those aged 44–60. Only with no upper limit for CRP, and diagnoses during follow-up ignored, did high CRP in the 44–60 group predict elevated fatigue at all outcome points. Our results therefore suggest previously reported longitudinal CRP–fatigue associations in middle age, interpreted as evidence for a role of systemic inflammation itself in fatigue development, may have been inflated by infection-related sickness behaviour and/or chronic illness soon to be diagnosed.

Clinical introduction

A retired 59-year-old woman presented to the cardiology clinic concerned with cardiac pulsations that were visible on her chest wall. These were not associated with dyspnoea, syncope or chest discomfort.

Of note, 8 years previously, she complained of recurrent nocturnal diaphoresis and 5 kg weight loss. Blood sampling at that time revealed a microcytic anaemia, reactive thrombocytosis and raised inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 99 mm/hour, C-reactive protein 161 mg/L). Following an episode of transient diplopia, ophthalmoscopy demonstrated a cotton wool spot in the left inferotemporal retinal arcade. She commenced a 2-year tapering course of 1 mg/kg prednisolone.

On examination, she had a lean physique with a supine blood pressure of 162/60 mm Hg and palpable Corrigan's pulse. She had a prominent apical pulsation and a loud early diastolic murmur was present at the left sternal edge radiating to the apex. Echocardiography showed severe central aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root (see online supplementary figure 1). Cardiac CT was performed to clarify the diagnosis (figure 1).

### Long-term peritoneal dialysis followed by kidney transplantation for Takayasu arteritis: a case report [^113cdb55]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old female was diagnosed with TA at the age of 19 years, and steroid therapy controlled the diseases; however, her renal function declined gradually with renovascular hypertension developing as a complication of TA. At the age of 61, PD was initiated because hemodialysis was inappropriate because of severe aortic regurgitation and peripheral arteriosteogenesis that precluded the creation of an arteriovenous fistula.

The patient remained stable on PD for more than 5 years, with well-preserved residual renal function (RRF) and peritoneal function and only one episode of peritonitis, without any cardiocerebrovascular events. However, a gradual decline in RRF was accompanied by a concomitant increase in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The patient was evaluated for other inflammatory diseases, such as malignancies, infections, and autoimmune diseases including TA reactivation; however, nothing abnormal was detected. She also suffered from fatigue and vomiting; therefore, the increase in CRP indicating inflammation was considered to be due to malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome resulting from inadequate renal replacement therapy with PD, evident from the RRF decline, leading to the accumulation of uremic solutes. Transition to hemodialysis or combination therapy with hemodialysis and PD were considered to improve her clinical condition; however, hemodialysis was challenging to the limitations associated with TA. Seven and a half years after the initiation of PD, she received a living-related KTx from her husband (Fig. 1).

### Canakinumab (Ilaris) [^116kNvnZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1

	Mechanism of Action

Canakinumab is a human monoclonal anti-human IL-1β antibody of the IgG1/κ isotype. Canakinumab binds to human IL-1β and neutralizes its activity by blocking its interaction with IL-1 receptors, but it does not bind IL-1α or IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra).

CAPS refer to rare genetic syndromes generally caused by mutations in the NLRP-3 [nucleotide-binding domain, leucine rich family (NLR), pyrin domain containing 3] gene (also known as Cold-Induced Autoinflammatory Syndrome-1 [CIAS1]). CAPS disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with male and female offspring equally affected. Features common to all disorders include fever, urticaria-like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis.

The NLRP3 protein is an important component of the inflammasome and regulates the protease caspase-1 and controls the activation of IL-1β. Mutations in NLRP3 result in an overactive inflammasome resulting in excessive release of activated IL-1β that drives inflammation. Still's disease is a severe autoinflammatory disease, driven by innate immunity by means of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β.

Gout flares are characterized by activation of resident macrophages and infiltrating neutrophils in the joint, and concomitant overproduction of IL-1β resulting in an acute painful inflammatory response. IL-1β production by macrophages is triggered by uric acid (monosodium urate monohydrate) crystals in the joint and surrounding tissue through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex.

12.2

	Pharmacodynamics

C-reactive protein and Serum Amyloid A (SAA) are indicators of inflammatory disease activity that are elevated in patients with CAPS and gout flares. Elevated SAA has been associated with the development of systemic amyloidosis in patients with CAPS. Following ILARIS treatment, CRP, and SAA levels normalize within 8 days.

In patients with gout flares, CRP and SAA were rapidly reduced following ILARIS treatment. Reductions in CRP and SAA were sustained throughout the 24-week observation period. Improvement in pharmacodynamic markers may not be representative of clinical response.

In SJIA the median percent reduction in CRP from baseline to Day 15 was 91%. Improvement in pharmacodynamic markers may not be representative of clinical response.

### Clinical considerations and key issues in the management of patients with Erdheim-Chester disease: a seven case series [^117WSPrp]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Seven patients (five men and two women) with biopsy proven ECD were recruited from six medical centers in Israel. The median age at the time of presentation was 53 years (range: 39 to 62 years). The median follow-up time was 36 months (range: 1 to 72 months). Six of the seven patients (86%) suffered from diabetes insipidus that preceded the onset of investigation eliciting symptoms by a median time of 87 months (range: 9 to 144 months).

The different presenting symptoms included bone pain in 43% (three of seven) of the patients. This pain ranged from mild (one patient) to severe (two patients). The patient who presented with mild bone pain originally sought medical attention for relapsing remitting skin lesions in outpatient settings. An atypical, painless presentation characterized 43% (three of seven) of the patients, who presented with worsening neurological symptoms primarily of cerebellar nature (two patients) or with renovascular hypertension (one patient). One patient (14%) presented in the setting of an acute abdomen due to perforation of his appendix by histiocytic infiltrate. These different symptoms were accompanied by constitutional symptoms, such as fever, malaise and fatigue in all of the patients. Episodes of increased intracranial pressure notable by papilledema were evident in 57% (four of seven) of the patients. Preliminary complete blood counts identified a microcytic anemia in 57% (four of seven) of the patients, elevated levels of CRP in 43% (three of seven) and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate in 28.5% (two of seven).

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^113qjJC5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — Polymyalgia-like syndrome with ICPI therapy: Workup includes "Complete rheumatologic history regarding differential diagnosis and examination of all joints and skin", screen for "symptoms of temporal arteritis, such as headache, visual disturbances, or jaw claudication", and arrange "Urgent referral to ophthalmologist if present and consider temporal artery biopsy as permanent visual loss can occur within days of symptom onset"; obtain "ANA, RF, and anti-CCP", "CK", and "Inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP)", with "Monitoring: ESR and CRP". For G1 mild stiffness and pain — "Continue ICPI" and "Initiate analgesia with acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs if there are no contraindications". For G2 moderate stiffness and pain limiting instrumental ADL — "Consider holding ICPI and resuming upon symptom control, prednisone < 10 mg"; "Initiate prednisone 20 mg/d or equivalent", taper "after 3–4 weeks" if improved, and "If no improvement or need for higher dosages after 4 weeks, escalate to G3", with rheumatology referral. For G3–4 severe stiffness and pain limiting self-care ADL — "Hold ICPI and may resume, in consultation with rheumatology, if recover to ≤ G2", refer to rheumatology, and "Should initiate prednisone 40 mg/d or equivalent"; if insufficient response or prolonged higher dosing, "may offer a steroid sparing agent such as synthetic drugs (eg, methotrexate) or biologic agents (eg, IL-6 antagonists)", noting "IL-6 inhibition can cause intestinal perforation" and "it should not be used in patients with immune-related colitis", and "Consider admission of patients with severe symptoms". Additional considerations state "IL-6 antagonists may be the preferred steroid-sparing agents for management of polymyalgia-like syndrome as they are already approved for use in patients with GCA".

### How to use: C-reactive protein [^112AcW7J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that increases 4–6 h after an inflammatory trigger and peaks at 36–50 h. Levels decrease rapidly with the resolution of inflammation. CRP is generally highly elevated in invasive bacterial infections and is often used as a marker of inflammation. A single CRP level is neither sensitive nor specific enough to identify all children with serious bacterial infection. However, a raised CRP does suggest serious bacterial infection and should suggest further assessment is needed. CRP levels that fail to decrease, or continue to rise, after 48 h of antibiotic therapy suggest treatment failure. In infants with suspected neonatal sepsis, two CRP measurements 24 h apart that are < 10 mg/l are useful in excluding sepsis.

### ME / CFS symptoms… [^1148nXot]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary symptoms ME/CFS has five core symptoms. You must have three main ME/CFS symptoms and at least one of the other two symptoms to be diagnosed with ME/CFS. Less ability to do activities and fatigue People with ME/CFS have a much lower ability to do activities they could do before they got sick. This limitation comes with fatigue and lasts six months or longer. The fatigue:

- Can be severe
- Isn't caused by an unusually difficult activity
- Isn't relieved by sleep or rest. Worse symptoms after activity People with ME/CFS experience a worsening of their symptoms after any type of activity
- physical or mental. These activities wouldn't have been a problem before they became ill. This is called Post-Exertional Malaise. PEM can lead to a cycle of "pushing" to do more, followed by "crashing. " During a crash, people with ME/CFS may have a variety of symptoms.

These can include difficulty thinking, problems sleeping, sore throat, headaches, feeling dizzy, or severe tiredness. It may take days, weeks, or longer to recover from a crash. Some people may be confined to bed or the house. As examples:

- Attending a school event may leave someone house-bound for days.
- Grocery shopping may require a nap in the car before driving home.
- Doing errands may require getting a ride home.
- Showering may leave someone bed-bound for days.
- Working may mean spending nights and weekends recovering. Sleep Problems People with ME/CFS may not feel better or less tired, even after a full night's sleep. Some may have problems falling asleep or staying asleep. Problems being upright People with ME/CFS often report their symptoms get worse when they are standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. People with ME/CFS may be lightheaded, dizzy, weak, or faint while standing or sitting up.

They may have vision changes like blurring or seeing spots.
- Muscle pain and aches
- Joint pain without swelling or redness
- **Headaches, either new or worsening Some people with ME/CFS may also have**:

- Tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits
- Frequent sore throat
- Digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome
- Chills and night sweats
- Allergies or sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light and noise
- Muscle weakness
- Shortness of breath
- Irregular heartbeat.

### Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of incomplete Kawasaki disease in children in China [^112WuWkC]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Most febrile viral infections do not show CRP > 30 mg/L or ESR > 40 mm/h, and most febrile bacterial infections respond to antibiotics. Platelet levels > 450 × 10⁹/L after 7 days of fever suggest that they begin to increase at the peak stage of KD, but some severely affected KD cases can be elevated after 7 days. Albumin levels < 30 g/L may be too low to detect KD; however, most patients with KD have lower albumin levels than age-matched healthy children. In the early presentation of KD, haemoglobin, albumin, and CRP levels change the day before the peak stage of KD, which is helpful for early diagnosis.

Early diagnosis of IKD is challenging due to the absence of a consistent pattern or standardisation in the onset of the disease, significant variations among children, and incomplete manifestation of clinical symptoms during the initial phase. Precautions for diagnosing IKD: IKD has fewer clinical symptoms and signs, and its diagnosis needs to be combined with laboratory indices and echocardiography to make a comprehensive judgement, and sometimes it even needs to be observed dynamically during the course of the disease to make a diagnosis. In the event of a negative echocardiogram for the child, it is necessary to monitor the child's temperature fluctuations. If the child no longer experiences a fever, KD can be ruled out. However, if a child continues to have persistent fever, it is advisable to recheck the echocardiogram and seek consultation from a KD specialist to determine the subsequent steps for diagnosis and treatment, with a special focus on alterations in laboratory values in children with KD who experience symptoms beyond the typical age of onset. These changes may include heightened levels of white blood cells, primarily neutrophils; reduced levels of haemoglobin; elevated platelet counts; aseptic pyuria; increased levels of C-reactive protein; heightened erythrocyte sedimentation rate; raised liver enzymes and total bilirubin; diminished albumin and sodium. In addition, elevated levels of interleukin (IL)6, IL-1, and tumour necrosis factor alpha have been observed. Insufficient validation studies have been conducted to support the use of elevated plasma brain natriuretic peptide (B-type natriuretic peptide, BNP) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP) as a reliable indicator for diagnosing IKD. Echocardiography is of great value in the diagnosis of IKD, and examination should be performed with careful observation of the presence of coronary artery lesions (CAL), evaluation of myocardial function, valvular regurgitation, and pericardial effusion.
