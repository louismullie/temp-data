## Question

A 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer is receiving palliative chemotherapy. She presents to clinic with increasing fatigue. Laboratory studies reveal a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL. Her oncologist confirms that her cancer treatment is not curative in intent. She has no history of thromboembolic disease, and her renal function is normal. The patient asks about options to improve her anemia-related symptoms.

Based on current guidelines, should erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) be offered to this patient? Justify your answer according to the recommendations.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) should be offered to a 68-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer, palliative chemotherapy, and hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, and how to justify that decision with current guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether she meets guideline criteria for ESA use. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and the balance of benefits versus harms. Next, I will review alternatives like transfusion and iron, and confirm dosing and monitoring details. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and counseling points, ensuring I double-check any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the eligibility criteria. The ASCO/ASH 2019 guideline update states that ESAs may be offered to patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia whose cancer treatment is not curative in intent and whose hemoglobin has declined to less than 10 g/dL, with red cell transfusion as an alternative depending on severity and clinical context, which fits this patient's palliative intent and Hb of 8.7 g/dL [^416937ff] [^80c25343] [^aea4c8e7]. I should also confirm that ESAs are not indicated when treatment is curative, which is not the case here, and that the FDA label restricts use to anemia due to myelosuppressive chemotherapy expected to continue for at least 2 additional months, which is reasonable in metastatic disease on ongoing therapy [^203e199d] [^416937ff].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence and the benefit–risk balance. The recommendation is evidence-based with high-quality evidence that ESAs increase hemoglobin and reduce transfusions, but there is also consistent evidence of increased thromboembolic events and signals for worse survival in some oncology settings, which is why guidelines limit use to palliative-intent chemotherapy and require shared decision-making about risks and goals of care [^6115f53d] [^68eea9de]. I should double-check the magnitude of thrombotic risk; in a large metastatic breast cancer trial, thrombotic vascular events were higher with epoetin alfa versus best supportive care, reinforcing the need to individualize and minimize exposure [^5b0c00ac] [^edd31484].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about survival. I initially thought the large metastatic breast cancer study proved worse progression-free survival with ESAs, but wait, I should verify the noninferiority framing. The open-label phase III trial in 2,098 women with metastatic breast cancer did not meet its noninferiority criterion for investigator-assessed progression-free survival, with an HR around 1.09 and more thrombotic events in the ESA arm, though an independent review suggested noninferiority by a narrow margin; importantly, there was no improvement in overall survival, so the net clinical benefit remains uncertain outside transfusion reduction [^5b0c00ac] [^edd31484]. Let me reconsider: this means I should not claim a proven survival harm, but I should emphasize the lack of survival benefit and the increased thrombotic risk when counseling the patient [^5b0c00ac] [^edd31484].

> Next, I should review alternatives and adjuncts. Red cell transfusion remains appropriate for rapid symptom relief, particularly when hemoglobin is below about 8 g/dL or when symptoms are severe, and should be considered alongside ESAs in shared decision-making for this patient with Hb 8.7 g/dL and fatigue [^6e6b58a0]. I need to ensure iron status is optimized because functional iron deficiency is common and impairs ESA response; baseline and periodic iron studies are recommended, and IV iron can improve hemoglobin response and reduce transfusions when iron deficiency is present or functional, with ESMO suggesting IV iron for absolute iron deficiency during chemotherapy and ASCO/ASH supporting iron to enhance ESA response [^2c41ece6] [^195ab369] [^e807ff44].

> I will now examine dosing and monitoring details if an ESA is used. I should confirm that dosing should follow FDA labeling, start low, and be titrated to the lowest hemoglobin needed to avoid transfusion, typically not exceeding 12 g/dL, with dose reduction if hemoglobin rises by more than 1 g/dL in 2 weeks; if there is no response after 6 to 8 weeks, ESAs should be discontinued and the patient re-evaluated for iron deficiency, tumor progression, or other causes of anemia [^593bac24] [^af2730c1] [^a058445b] [^d8212f11]. Let me verify agent selection: epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, darbepoetin, and biosimilar epoetin alfa are considered equivalent in efficacy and safety for this indication, so choice can be guided by access and convenience [^5c2ca73d].

> But wait, what if the patient prioritizes avoiding transfusions and accepts some thrombotic risk? I should confirm that shared decision-making is essential here, documenting discussion of potential benefits (fewer transfusions, possible symptom improvement) versus harms (increased thromboembolism, uncertain survival impact), and aligning with her values and goals in palliative care [^68eea9de] [^6115f53d]. I need to ensure we also address reversible contributors to fatigue beyond anemia, since cancer-related fatigue is multifactorial and may persist despite correcting hemoglobin [^e96f86a9].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Yes, ESAs can be offered to this patient because she meets guideline criteria: palliative-intent chemotherapy, hemoglobin less than 10 g/dL, and no curative intent, with the understanding that benefits are limited to transfusion reduction and symptom potential, while risks include thromboembolism and possible adverse survival signals in some studies; transfusion remains an appropriate alternative, and iron optimization should precede or accompany ESA therapy to maximize response and minimize exposure [^416937ff] [^80c25343] [^6115f53d] [^2c41ece6]. I should double-check that we plan to reassess at 6 to 8 weeks and stop if ineffective, and that we will monitor hemoglobin every 2 to 4 weeks to avoid overshooting targets, which aligns with best practice and safety considerations [^a058445b] [^af2730c1].

---

Based on current ASCO/ASH guidelines, **ESAs may be offered** to this patient with metastatic breast cancer, palliative chemotherapy, and hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, because her treatment is non-curative and her hemoglobin is below 10 g/dL [^416937ff] [^80c25343]. ESAs can **reduce transfusions** [^6115f53d] but increase thromboembolic risk [^6115f53d]; therefore, use the lowest effective dose, monitor hemoglobin every 2–4 weeks, and stop if there is no response in 6–8 weeks [^a058445b] [^d8212f11]. Iron deficiency should be corrected before or during ESA therapy to optimize response [^2c41ece6] [^e807ff44]. Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with the patient's goals and risk tolerance [^68eea9de].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The ASCO/ASH 2019 guideline update provides **clear recommendations** on ESA use in cancer patients:

- **Indication**: ESAs may be offered to patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia whose cancer treatment is not curative in intent and whose hemoglobin has declined to < 10 g/dL [^416937ff] [^80c25343].

- **Contraindication**: ESAs should not be offered to patients whose cancer treatment is curative in intent [^416937ff] [^80c25343].

- **Goal**: The goal of ESA therapy is to reduce the need for RBC transfusions, not to improve quality of life or survival [^6115f53d] [^cdc310db].

- **Monitoring**: Hemoglobin should be monitored every 2–4 weeks, and ESA therapy should be discontinued if there is no response within 6–8 weeks [^a058445b] [^d8212f11].

---

## Benefits and risks of ESAs

### Benefits

ESAs can **reduce RBC transfusions** [^6115f53d] and may improve anemia-related symptoms, such as fatigue, in some patients [^d31d29c5] [^8108f44a].

---

### Risks

- **Thromboembolic events**: ESAs increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which can be serious or life-threatening [^6115f53d] [^edd4dad5].

- **Potential tumor growth**: ESAs may promote tumor growth in some cancers, although evidence in metastatic breast cancer is mixed [^6115f53d] [^5b0c00ac].

- **Mortality**: Some studies have reported increased mortality with ESAs, particularly when used outside current guidelines or at high hemoglobin targets [^6115f53d] [^a2bcf025].

---

## Evidence specific to metastatic breast cancer

Evidence in metastatic breast cancer is mixed. The **BRAVE study** found no survival benefit but fewer transfusions with epoetin beta, with more thromboembolic events (13% vs 6%) [^76c0e959]. The **Leyland-Jones study** likewise found no survival benefit, more thrombotic events, and did not meet noninferiority for progression-free survival, prompting caution and a preference for transfusion in some analyses [^5b0c00ac] [^edd31484].

---

## Role of iron supplementation

Iron deficiency is common in cancer-related anemia and can blunt ESA response. ASCO/ASH recommends correcting iron deficiency — preferably with **intravenous iron** — to improve hemoglobin response and reduce transfusions [^2c41ece6] [^e807ff44].

---

## Alternative treatments

Red blood cell transfusion is an alternative for rapid symptom relief, particularly when hemoglobin is **< 8 g/dL** or when symptoms are severe [^6e6b58a0]. Transfusion avoids ESA-related thromboembolic risks but carries risks of infection, alloimmunization, and iron overload with repeated use.

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age**: Older adults have higher thromboembolic risk, which must be weighed against potential benefits.

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease increases thromboembolic risk with ESAs.

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with goals and risk tolerance [^68eea9de].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| ESAs may be offered | - Non-curative intent <br/> - Hemoglobin < 10 g/dL [^416937ff] [^80c25343] |
| Use lowest effective dose | Reduce transfusion need; avoid high hemoglobin targets [^af2730c1] [^f54c1da3] |
| Monitor hemoglobin | Every 2–4 weeks; stop if no response in 6–8 weeks [^a058445b] [^d8212f11] |
| Correct iron deficiency | Prefer IV iron to optimize response [^2c41ece6] [^e807ff44] |
| Consider transfusion | For rapid relief or if ESAs contraindicated [^6e6b58a0] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given non-curative intent, hemoglobin 8.7 g/dL, and symptomatic anemia, **ESAs may be offered** with careful monitoring and shared decision-making [^416937ff] [^68eea9de]. Use the lowest effective dose, correct iron deficiency, and monitor hemoglobin closely; discontinue if there is no response in 6–8 weeks [^af2730c1] [^2c41ece6] [^a058445b]. Transfusion remains an alternative for rapid symptom relief or if ESAs are contraindicated [^6e6b58a0].

ASCO/ASH clinical practice guideline update — erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for cancer-associated anemia: Use of ESAs increases hemoglobin levels and reduces the need for RBC transfusions but increases the risk of thromboembolic events, and studies have reported decreased survival, increased on-study mortality, and/or increased risk of cancer progression or recurrence. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took multiple regulatory actions between 2004 and 2009 and in 2010 approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, which the FDA determined in 2017 was no longer necessary. ESAs are indicated in patients with cancer who are receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with noncurative intent and anemia that can be adequately managed with transfusion support. Since the 2010 update, new information has emerged on safety and efficacy in metastatic breast cancer and on the role of iron with ESAs, and treatment options expanded with the 2018 FDA approval of a biosimilar of epoetin alfa.

Anemia is frequently experienced by cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and can negatively impact the patient's prognosis. Blood transfusions, iron supplementation (in absolute or functionally iron-deficient anemias), and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are among the treatment options for anemia. Treatment options for anemia management should be selected based on the best benefit-to-risk ratio for each individual patient. In September 2007, the working party of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) updated their guidelines on the use of ESAs, which are summarized in this paper. ESAs reduce the number of transfusions required and significantly improve quality of life in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. A sustained hemoglobin level of about 12 g/dl should be the target for treatment with ESAs. ESAs should be used according to the EORTC guidelines and within label with carefully considered exceptions.

### Breast cancer treatment | AAFP… [^267a8a89]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

24 Patients with estrogen receptor–positive DCIS and residual breast tissue should receive five years of endocrine therapy. This treatment includes tamoxifen if the patient is premenopausal and tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor if postmenopausal. 24 Lobular carcinoma in situ was previously considered a malignancy. However, despite its name, it is not a carcinoma and is a proliferative disease that confers an increased risk of future breast cancer. It is no longer included in breast cancer staging guidelines.
23. Stages I–III, Early Invasive and Locally Advanced, Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer Nonmetastatic breast cancer is treated with preoperative and postoperative systemic therapies that include chemotherapy, endocrine therapies, immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies directed at tumor receptors, and surgery and radiation. Molecular testing helps guide whether chemotherapy needs to be added to a treatment regimen.

For patients with hormone receptor–positive, node-negative breast cancer, including males, a 21-gene expression assay is the preferred assay for disease prognostication and decisions about the addition of chemotherapy. 24 When chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are administered postoperatively, chemotherapy always precedes endocrine therapy.
24. Preoperative chemotherapy is used for patients with large primary tumors in relation to breast size who want breast-conserving surgery. It is also used for patients with inoperable disease. Chemotherapeutic drugs are the only systemic therapy available for patients with triple-negative breast cancer. 24 Preoperative therapy with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab, which are monoclonal antibodies directed against ERBB2, is used in addition to chemotherapy when the cancer is ERBB2 positive.

Patients with low-risk estrogen receptor–positive disease, or older adults, may be eligible for preoperative systemic therapy alone, without proceeding to surgery. A complete response to preoperative systemic therapies is associated with favorable outcomes for disease-free survival and overall survival. 24 The degree of tumor response to preoperative systemic therapies helps determine the need for and response to any postoperative systemic therapies. 28 Some tumors may be too large to allow for good cosmesis with lumpectomy and will require a mastectomy. Some women may choose mastectomy over lumpectomy for many other reasons, including family history, gene mutations, peace of mind, or lack of access to health care centers offering radiation therapy.

30 The removal of more lymph nodes and adipose tissue of the axilla by ALND is reserved for patients who have positive nodes on SLN biopsy and will have a mastectomy, patients with inflammatory breast cancer, and patients with positive nodes after preoperative chemotherapy. SLN biopsy does not confer an increased risk of death compared with ALND.
31. Endocrine. Approximately two-thirds of breast cancers are hormone receptor–positive and are amenable to treatment with endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. 36 The mechanism of action and adverse effects for these therapies are summarized in Table 1. 8–18.

Nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy — Recommendation 3 states that in patients with myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, clinicians should observe the hematologic response to cancer treatment before considering an ESA, and particular caution should be exercised where thromboembolic risk is increased; in all cases, blood transfusion is a treatment option that should be considered. The FDA label now limits ESA indication to patients receiving chemotherapy for noncurative intent, and in palliative-intent cases with reasonably short expected survival, use of ESAs can be considered if anemia does not improve with treatment and transfusions are not feasible; given little to no information on concurrent use with newer agents, no recommendations can be issued.

ASCO/ASH ESA target hemoglobin — Among adults receiving ESAs for chemotherapy-associated anemia, HbG may be increased to the lowest concentration needed to avoid or reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, which may vary by patient and condition. An optimal target HbG concentration cannot be definitively determined from the available literature. Dose modification to reduce ESA exposure is appropriate when HbG reaches a level sufficient to avoid transfusion or the increase exceeds 1 g/dL in any 2-week period.

### Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in oncology [^550d9e16]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2008). Low credibility.

Patients who have cancer, particularly those undergoing chemotherapy, frequently become anemic. Therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is associated with an increase in hemoglobin levels, a reduction in transfusion requirements, and, according to many clinical trialists and experienced clinicians, an improvement in functional status, productivity, and quality of life. Several randomized trials of ESAs in patients who have cancer have recently reported inferior outcomes in tumor progression or survival, raising appropriate concerns about the safety of ESAs in oncology. However, 3 important caveats to these reports exist. First, these clinical trials did not reflect the common use of ESAs in oncology practice (i.e., to treat, rather than prevent, anemia in patients undergoing chemotherapy). Second, the trials were seriously flawed and did not meet reasonable standards for cancer progression or survival trials. Third, during the same period, randomized trials were presented or published that showed no negative impact on tumor progression or survival; these trials have approximately the same shortcomings as trials that suggest a safety issue exists. The lack of definitive answers about the safety of ESAs for treating chemotherapy-related anemia has placed physicians, regulators, and most importantly patients in a difficult position that can only be addressed with additional data. This article reviews relevant preclinical and clinical available data to help improve understanding and guide decision making.

### Effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on fatigue-and anaemia-related symptoms in cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analyses of published and unpublished data [^8108f44a]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

These observations on the harmful effects of ESAs in cancer patients led to different recommendations of medical societies and authorities in the USA and Europe. The FDA and the American Societies of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Hematology (ASH) recommend the use of ESAs only in anaemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with palliative treatment intent up to Hb level 12 g dL –1 with the goal of avoiding red blood cell transfusions. The FDA and ASCO/ASH explicitly do not recommend the use of ESAs to improve QoL because they consider the evidence inconclusive. Similarly, in 2007, the FDA removed the claim for ESA-related QoL improvements in patients with chronic kidney disease from the product labels because of a lack of evidence from well-conducted trials. In contrast, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the European Society of Medical Oncology recommend the use of ESAs to improve QoL in cancer patients.

Our overall analyses showed a small yet clinically important improvement for FACT-An, which was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to placebo-controlled RCTs in patients receiving chemotherapy. Of 100 patients treated, approximately 10 to 13 patients will have a clinically important improvement of anaemia-related symptoms, which can be attributed to ESA treatment. However, in patients treated with a curative approach it is unlikely that the observed benefits will outweigh the negative effects of ESAs on short-term mortality and thromboembolic events. Studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with a palliative intent and receiving ESAs in accordance to current guideline recommendations (i.e. starting ESAs at Hb < 10 g dL –1 and stopping at 12 g dL –1) and reporting QoL outcomes were not available. In this setting, the impact of ESAs on QoL remains unclear.

ASCO/ASH guideline — ESA risk communication and scope of use emphasizes that the FDA has indicated that ESAs should not be given to patients who are being treated for cancer when the goal is to cure the patients of cancer; ESAs have been found to shorten overall survival and/or speed tumor growth in some patients with cancer and have risks of adverse events, such as thromboembolism (ie, blood clots), so individual risk factors need to be considered; ESAs are not recommended for patients with cancer who are not receiving chemotherapy, except in the case of patients with lower risk MDS; and when used, the goal of ESA therapy for patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia is to reduce RBC transfusion requirements.

- ER utilization and hospitalization in elderly patients with metastatic breast cancer.
- To explore how frequently older adults with metastatic breast cancer are hospitalized or visit the ER as a result of their breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers for women in the United States, with an estimated 246, 660 cases of invasive breast cancer and 61, 000 cases of in situ breast cancer to be diagnosed in 2016. It is also the second leading cause of cancer death for women, with an estimated 40, 450 deaths to occur this year. The therapeutic environment for the treatment of MBC is evolving rapidly. Clinicians are challenged with understanding new molecular targets, and identifying ongoing clinical trial opportunities for this patient population. Healthcare providers are required to be aware of the mechanisms of action, safety, and efficacy of promising novel agents and regimens on the horizon for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.

Furthermore, central to individualizing therapy is an assessment of patients' goals of treatment prior to developing a plan of care. It is nearly impossible for the modern-day oncologist to remain current regarding the clinical tsunami of research to personalize MBC treatment. The tremendous pressures cancer centers and their oncology providers face in quantifiably demonstrating value in the care delivered compounds this problem. Almost instantly, government and commercial payers are demanding a change from pay for quantity to pay for value. These payment programs are transforming oncology care so that it is more pro-active, coordinated, vigilant and patient focused. At the center of this payment reform is the patient, as the ultimate consumer of health care services. Until recently, patients have been relatively blind to the actual cost and quality of the care they receive.

Now, out-of-pocket costs are rising steeply and patients have instant access to a trove of health information as they are forced to become better-educated consumers regarding the costs and likely outcomes of their treatment. A recent JAMA Op-Ed piece receiving significant attention highlights that delivering value-based care requires an understanding of what the patient values. To that end, all the current cancer valued-based models require that oncology providers document their patient's goals of care and that the treatment course is evidence-based and commensurate with patient goals. Another significant component of value is ensuring that a patient is "fit" enough for the treatment selected. The priorities of frail patients, whose care is the costliest, are often not noticed nor met. The issue of fit/frailty status in breast cancer is highly relevant, given that the median age at diagnosis is 62 with 57% cases of invasive breast cancer in females being diagnosed at age 60 or older.

### Safety update on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: trials within and outside the accepted indications [^2a8e7800]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Certain studies in which erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been given not with the aim of correcting anemia but to achieve higher target levels of hemoglobin have shown significantly poorer survival among treated patients. However, studies in which ESAs were administered with the aim of reducing the need for RBC transfusions in patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia demonstrate that the use of these agents is not associated with any adverse effect on survival when compared with placebo controls. We can therefore be reassured that using ESAs within the labeled indications will not adversely affect patient outcome.

### Management of cancer-associated anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: ASCO / ASH clinical practice guideline update [^e5007cda]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Society of Hematology (ASH) recommendations for use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with cancer.

Methods

PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs in patients with cancer published from January 31, 2010, through May 14, 2018. For biosimilar ESAs, the literature search was expanded to include meta-analyses and RCTs in patients with cancer or chronic kidney disease and cohort studies in patients with cancer due to limited RCT evidence in the cancer setting. ASCO and ASH convened an Expert Panel to review the evidence and revise previous recommendations as needed.

Results

The primary literature review included 15 meta-analyses of RCTs and two RCTs. A growing body of evidence suggests that adding iron to treatment with an ESA may improve hematopoietic response and reduce the likelihood of RBC transfusion. The biosimilar literature review suggested that biosimilars of epoetin alfa have similar efficacy and safety to reference products, although evidence in cancer remains limited.

Recommendations

ESAs (including biosimilars) may be offered to patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia whose cancer treatment is not curative in intent and whose hemoglobin has declined to < 10 g/dL. RBC transfusion is also an option. With the exception of selected patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, ESAs should not be offered to most patients with nonchemotherapy-associated anemia. During ESA treatment, hemoglobin may be increased to the lowest concentration needed to avoid transfusions. Iron replacement may be used to improve hemoglobin response and reduce RBC transfusions for patients receiving ESA with or without iron deficiency. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.hematology.org/guidelines.

### Safety and efficacy outcomes with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with breast cancer: a meta-analysis [^0fede95e]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

New data on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) regarding overall survival and disease progression-related outcomes in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy are presented in a meta-analysis of controlled trials of ESA use (epoetin α, epoetin β, darbepoetin α, biosimilars).

Patients and Methods

A literature search identified reports from January 1997 through March 2014. We used company databases for Amgen, Inc, or Janssen studies and published data for other studies. Random-effects odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to compare results for patients randomized to ESA with those randomized to control.

Results

Deaths were reported for 571 of 2346 patients (24%) in the ESA groups and 523 of 2367 patients (22%) in the control groups [OR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.40]. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the effects of individual studies and exclusion of one study (BEST) resulted in an OR for death of 1.12 (95% CI 0.94–1.34). In seven studies reporting progression-related end points (N = 4197; ESA n = 2088; control n = 2109), the OR was 1.01 (95% CI 0.87–1.16) for ESA compared with control.

Conclusions

After incorporating recent results of ESA use in patients with breast cancer, risks of survival and progression-free survival remain consistent with previously published data.

### A randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III study of epoetin alfa versus best standard of care in anemic patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving standard chemotherapy [^5b0c00ac]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

An open-label, noninferiority study to evaluate the impact of epoetin alfa (EPO) on tumor outcomes when used to treat anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

Methods

Women with hemoglobin ≤ 11.0 g/dL, receiving first- or second-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, were randomly assigned to EPO 40,000 IU subcutaneously once a week or best standard of care. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, time to tumor progression, overall response rate, RBC transfusions, and thrombotic vascular events.

Results

In 2,098 patients randomly assigned, median PFS (based on investigator-determined disease progression [PD]) was 7.4 months in both groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.089; 95% CI, 0.988 to 1.200); upper bound exceeded prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.15. Median PFS per independent review committee-determined PD was 7.6 months in both groups (HR, 1.028; 95% CI, 0.922 to 1.146); upper bound did not exceed prespecified noninferiority margin. Median overall survival at clinical cutoff (1,337 deaths) was 17.2 months in the EPO and 17.4 months in the best standard of care group (HR, 1.057; 95% CI, 0.949 to 1.177), median time to tumor progression was 7.5 months in both groups (HR, 1.094; 95% CI, 0.991 to 1.209), and overall response rate was 50% versus 51% (odds ratio, 0.950; 95% CI, 0.799 to 1.130). RBC transfusions were 5.8% versus 11.4% (P < .001), and thrombotic vascular events were 2.8% versus 1.4% (P = 0.038), respectively.

Conclusion

The primary end point, PFS based on investigator-determined PD, did not meet noninferiority criteria. As a consistency assessment with the primary finding, PFS based on independent review committee-determined PD met noninferiority criteria. Overall, this study did not achieve noninferiority objective in ruling out a 15% increased risk in PD/death. RBC transfusion should be the preferred approach for the management of anemia in this population.

### How to summarize the safety profile of epoetin alfa versus best standard of care in anemic patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving standard chemotherapy? [^3c624aa3]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

An alternative is to use the restricted mean survival time (RMST) as the summary measure to quantify the group difference. - For the present case, survival means PFS. Although the patient-level observations from the study by Leyland-Jones et alare not publicly available, we used a well-established computer algorithm to scan the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves presented in their Figure 2A and reconstructed the observed individual times to progression and/or death. The resulting KM curves and HR estimates with these reconstructed observations are closely matched with the original counterparts reported in the article. With these data, an estimated RMST for PFS ≤ 48 months for EPO is the area under the KM curve in Figure 2A by 48 months, which is 9.9 months. That is, future patients who receive EPO with 48 months of follow-up would achieve a PFS of an average of 9.9 months. For BSC, the RMST estimate is 11.4 months. The difference (BSC − EPO) is 1.5 months (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.6; P < .004) in favor of BSC. This difference, coupled with an RMST of 11.4 months for BSC, provides a clinically meaningful interpretation. In any event, when quantifying a group difference with a summary measure, it is informative to have a reference value from the control arm for decision making to assess the benefit and safety profile of a treatment strategy.

There is an ongoing randomized phase III study of darbepoetin versus BSC (NT00858364), for anemia secondary to platinum-based treatment of stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer. We hope that the investigators of the study would consider a sensitivity analysis using the RMST summary measure to further inform the benefit–risk profile of erythropoietin-stimulating agents in the oncology setting.

For future patients' treatment, we may need more information beyond presenting an overall summary measure for the treatment difference. For such a relatively large study as the present one by Leyland-Jones et al, it would be important to use information from the patient's baseline variables to identify a subgroup, if any, of patients who would not have safety concerns, but would benefit from EPO.

Abstract Accompanying ArticleFree accessCLINICAL REVIEWReflection on Supportive Care Elements During the Metastatic Breast Cancer Journey Introduction 1However, the guidelines include a large amount of information through which to sort and prioritize. A summarized and prioritized checklist is needed for MBC care. The purpose of this review is to provide a practical guide for oncologists to understand when and how to provide supportive care for patients with MBC, prioritized by phase of disease progression, in an individualized comprehensive manner. MBC Clinical Progression Patterns and Phases Comprehensive Assessment of Performance Status 2However, the current performance status assessment tools are focused on physical activity status and do not evaluate nonphysical conditions. For the optimal care of patients with MBC, we also need to assess the psychosocial status and cognitive condition.

The well-known tendency of clinicians to focus on physical status more than psychosocial issues can lead to patient preferences and needs going unnoticed. Besides, psychosocial status has been reported to have an impact on the mortality risk for patients in palliative care. 3 4Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 5, 6Patient Health Questionnaire, 7Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener, 8, 9Brief Symptom Inventory, 10Impact of Cancer, 11Cancer Worry Scale, 12, 13and Cancer and Treatment Distress. 14, 15A limitation of these tools is a lack of evidence that supports which screening approach is optimal in clinical practice. A meta-analysis of studies of these and other short screening tools suggested that many have a similar accuracy. 16 17It should be noted that cognitive impairment may be a symptom of a depressive syndrome or fatigue.

Incorporating evaluation of psychosocial and cognitive conditions into performance status assessment enables clinicians, as well as caregivers, to provide optimal care to patients. Recommended Supportive Care and Assessment by Progression Phase 18the most common symptoms experienced by patients receiving palliative care included pain, fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. 19A symptom assessment checklist for use with all patients with MBC is summarized in the Data Supplement, online only. 20and the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Adult Cancer Pain. 21Fatigue management is described in NCCN Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue 22and the ASCO guidelines.
23.

Distress and Psychosocial Support 24According to the NCCN Guidelines, 24screening for distress should be a standard feature of every medical visit, using an NCCN tool, the Distress Thermometer, which asks patients to rate their extent of distress in the past week, and a list from which to identify practical, family, emotional, physical problems, and spiritual or religious concerns experienced in the past week. 24For both acute and stable phases of MBC, clinicians should assess risk factors for these issues. If applicable, patients should be referred to mental health professionals, social workers, or chaplains. Patients and caregivers may benefit from NCCN guidelines for patients. 24counseling, and support groups. For patients with acute-phase disease, coping strategies and improvement in comforting measures are useful. For patients with stable-phase disease, exercise, rehabilitation, meditation, and creative therapies might be helpful.

### Is intravenous iron supplementation with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents beneficial in cancer patients with anemia? [^f9e2435d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

Chemotherapy-induced anemia is often an important problem for cancer patients, and this complication can be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). This commentary discusses the findings of a study by Bastit et al., in which 396 patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and chemotherapy-induced anemia were treated with darbepoetin alfa with or without intravenous iron. This phase III trial showed that intravenous iron supplementation increases the hematopoietic response rates to ESAs in cancer patients; however, this study provides no information as to whether all cancer patients with anemia should receive intravenous iron as well as treatment with ESAs. Further data are needed to identify those patients who might benefit from intravenous iron supplementation in addition to ESAs, in order to avoid overtreatment of patients who are unlikely to benefit from the additional iron. As both ESAs and intravenous iron have known short-term and long-term risks, identification of reliable predictors of response that can guide these treatments is necessary before this strategy can be implemented into practice.

### Maintaining normal hemoglobin levels with epoetin alfa in mainly nonanemic patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy: a survival study [^a2bcf025]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effect on survival and quality of life of maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of 12 to 14 g/dL with epoetin alfa versus placebo in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) receiving first-line chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U once weekly or placebo for 12 months. Study drug was initiated if baseline Hb was ≤ 13 g/dL or when Hb decreased to ≤ 13g/dL during the study. The primary end point was 12-month overall survival (OS).

Results

The study drug administration was stopped early in accordance with a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee because of higher mortality in the group treated with epoetin alfa. Enrollment had been completed, with 939 patients enrolled (epoetin alfa, n = 469; placebo, n = 470). Most patients had Hb more than 12 g/dL at baseline (median Hb, 12.8 g/dL) or during the study. From the final analysis, 12-month OS was 70% for epoetin alfa recipients and 76% for placebo recipients (P = 0.01). Optimal tumor response and time to disease progression were similar between groups. The reason for the difference in mortality between groups could not be determined from additional subsequent analyses involving both study data and chart review.

Conclusion

In this trial, the use of epoetin alfa to maintain high Hb targets in women with MBC, most of whom did not have anemia at the start of treatment, was associated with decreased survival. Additional research is required to clarify the potential impact of erythropoietic agents on survival when the Hb target range is 10 to 12 g/dL.

Results

Baseline characteristics

The current analysis included 540 patients treated in 44 clinical centers, of whom 420 were initiated on EPO 40,000 U and 120 were initiated on DARB 500 mcg (Fig. 1). Observed baseline characteristics were similar between the EPO and DARB cohorts except for iron supplementation (Table 1). Mean patient age at treatment initiation was approximately 64 years, and more than 60% of patients were female. Mean patient weight was close to 75 kg, and mean baseline Hb level approximated 10 g/dL. Breast and lung cancer were the most commonly reported cancer types. Most patients were undergoing chemotherapy-only regimens with a similar distribution of platinum and non-platinum-based chemotherapy. Only 3% of patients had a transfusion within 28 days of initiating an ESA, and a significantly lower proportion of EPO patients had received iron supplementation (11.4% EPO vs. 20.0% DARB, p = 0.015).

### How to summarize the safety profile of epoetin alfa versus best standard of care in anemic patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving standard chemotherapy? [^6e4d54ca]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

Leyland-Jones et alconducted an open-label, noninferiority study to evaluate the impact of epoetin alfa (EPO) on tumor outcomes when used to treat anemia in patients who received chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) on the basis of the investigators' assessments. The study was designed on the basis of the difference between groups as measured by the hazard ratio (HR; EPO v best standard care [BSC]), with a noninferiority margin of 1.15. A total of 1,650 PFS events would provide > 80% power with a one-sided type I error of 0.025 to rule out a 15% HR increase. The study was conducted from March 2006 to July 2014, and at the end of study, 1,659 events had been observed. Estimated HR was 1.089, with a 95% CI of 0.988 to 1.200. The observed upper bound exceeded the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.15. The authors concluded that "Overall, this study did not achieve the noninferiority objective in ruling out a 15% increased risk in PD or death".

HR is a ratio of two hazard functions over time. Hazard, which is not a probability measure, is commonly misinterpreted as a risk of an event of interest. The observed upper bound, 1.20, of the above 95% CI does not mean that EPO has a 20% risk of increase versus BSC. In fact, it is difficult to interpret the HR in clinically meaningful terms without a hazard function estimate available from BSC. The hazard function, by itself, is difficult to estimate well without a model and difficult to interpret clinically. This issue has been extensively discussed in the clinical and statistical literature, especially for evaluating the safety of a drug or device. - The summary measure using HR for this rather lengthy study does not help us to assess the value of EPO under a risk–benefit perspective.

As anaemia is an independent-risk factor for mortality in many cancer types, one question of interest was whether treating anaemia with ESAs improves cancer-patient survival. Higher haemoglobin levels were postulated to enhance tumour-tissue oxygenation, leading to increased chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy efficacy. Though some preclinical and early clinical data suggested an ESA-associated survival benefit, other trials suggested that ESAs increased disease progression and/or mortality. Currently, the ESA-product labelling describes eight clinical trials of concern that suggest ESA use increases disease progression and/or mortality in cancer patients (Table 1). Two studies were performed in the non-indicated setting of radiotherapy treatment only, two in the non-indicated anaemia-of-cancer setting (patients received neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy) and four in the indicated chemotherapy setting. As these eight studies are a focus for concerns regarding ESAs, they are described in more detail below according to their oncology setting.

### Update on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and clinical trials in oncology [^10bfa3dd]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia commonly occurs among cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. In these patients, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are effective in managing anemia but there is an increased risk for thrombovascular events. In more recent randomized clinical trials, there have been differing results regarding the impact of ESAs on overall survival and mortality. The balance between studies that show higher ESA-associated mortality and those that don't show ESA-associated mortality is examined in this review. This review discusses where we stand today on anemia management in cancer patients. Preliminary results from a recent independent patient data meta-analysis for on-study deaths and overall survival in patients receiving chemotherapy (the only oncology population for which ESA treatment is currently indicated) showed no statistically significant difference between the ESA and control groups (on-study deaths hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–1.24; overall survival HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97–1.11, compared with controls). Possible factors that could influence study results are discussed in this review. There are no convincing data to support ESA-induced tumor stimulation in patients. ESAs decrease RBC transfusion needs and sustain targeted hemoglobin levels, and this ESA response does not significantly impact overall survival or mortality when ESAs are used within guidelines and labeling. However, based on the currently available data and meta-analysis, the use of ESAs has to be carefully balanced against any possible risk for higher mortality.

### Hemoglobin decline in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy without an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent [^9a19d657]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is common in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Chemotherapy-induced anemia can be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, or both. According to current ESA labels, treatment with ESAs in patients receiving chemotherapy should not be considered until hemoglobin levels are less than 10 g/dL in the USA or at or below 10 g/dL in the EU. However, ESAs take time to induce a hemoglobin response and therefore are not suitable for patients who require immediate correction of anemia. Studies have suggested that initiating an ESA when hemoglobin is between 9 g/dL and 10 g/dL results in fewer transfusions compared with initiating an ESA when hemoglobin is < 9 g/dL. However, not all patients whose hemoglobin is in the 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL range will continue to fall to levels of < 9 g/dL, and because ESAs have risks, the decision of when to initiate an ESA is partially informed by the rate of hemoglobin decline and the likelihood that the patient will require a transfusion if they do not receive the ESA. Few data are available regarding the proportion of patients with hemoglobin in the range of 9 g/dL to < 10 g/dL who will experience a hemoglobin decline to < 9 g/dL or the rate at which the decline occurs. A better understanding of factors that influence the rate of hemoglobin decline from 10 g/dL to 9 g/dL may assist oncologists in optimizing the use of ESAs in patients receiving chemotherapy.

Patients and methods

Search strategy

The 2006 Cochrane Collaborative report (specifically Analysis 05.05) was used as the basis for the present, updated meta-analysis. To identify studies published since the 2006 Cochrane report (i.e. from April 2005 to March 2008), we carried out a literature search of the BIOSIS Previews, Current Contents, EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE databases using the following Boolean search string – 'erythropoiesis stimulating proteins (including all synonymous terms)' and 'cancer (including 'neoplasm' and 'malignancy')'. A search was also carried out for relevant abstracts and associated poster presentations delivered from 1995 to 2007 at conferences for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Hematology (ASH), San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO). Studies were selected if they were randomised, controlled trials of cancer patients treated with an ESA (Epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa) plus transfusions compared with control patients who either received placebo or best standard of care for prophylaxis or treatment of anaemia (e.g. transfusions without ESAs). Studies had to report on death or percentage of death in each treatment group or to have collected mortality data that were available for analysis. Interim analyses of ESA trials were included, as well as ESA studies that examined iron use in cancer patients. One study was rejected from the 2006 Cochrane analysis because oral iron was used in the ESA group and not the control group. This study was included in our analysis as it reported survival data, no evidence exists to suggest that oral iron supplementation affects mortality, and many ESA studies recommend iron supplementation to maintain adequate iron availability for erythropoiesis.

### Management of anaemia in patients with breast cancer: role of epoetin [^f5364eda]. Annals of Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients with breast cancer suffer from anaemia, as a consequence of the disease itself or its treatment. Anaemia has a negative impact on treatment outcome and overall survival, and affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients with cancer. Previously, cancer-related anaemia was treated with blood transfusion, but this is inconvenient, offers only temporary improvement in haemoglobin (Hb) level and is associated with several risks. Consequently, blood transfusion is usually reserved for patients with severe anaemia (Hb levels < 8 g/dl). Recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) is an effective and convenient treatment for cancer-related anaemia without the risks associated with red blood cell transfusion. Epoetin therapy effectively increases Hb levels, thereby reducing the need for emergency blood transfusion and improving the QoL of patients with anaemia and breast cancer. Epoetin beta is also effective for the prevention of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in patients with a high risk of developing anaemia during chemotherapy. With the increased use of dose-intensified chemotherapy in an attempt to improve response rates, administration of epoetin to prevent anaemia could potentially benefit many patients with breast cancer.

### Managing anemia in the cancer patient: old problems, future solutions [^a5efcf50]. The Oncologist (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia and associated symptoms commonly manifest in cancer patients and may have a considerable impact on outcomes. Preliminary studies suggest that overall survival and locoregional control following radiation therapy may be compromised by anemia, and recent preliminary data also suggest that anemia may be related to poorer outcomes following chemotherapy. Health-related quality of life of cancer patients is also significantly reduced by anemia. Treatment of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin can improve these health-related quality-of-life outcomes. However, despite this knowledge, anemia remains under-recognized and under-treated in the cancer patient population. A number of issues may be determinants of this suboptimal management of anemia. These include limitations of current therapies for anemia, varying practice strategies, and the lack of guidelines on how to treat anemia. Additionally, clinicians may underestimate the importance of health-related quality of life for their patients. It is vital that these issues are addressed, which, together with the development of novel erythropoietic agents, a review of the guidelines for anemia management, and consideration of further outcomes such as survival and cognitive function, may help to ensure that the cancer patient receives the best possible course of supportive care.

### Prognostic impact of the combination of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to cancer treatment: literature review [^3fc9f75b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Cancer patients commonly develop anaemia. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are frequently used in cancer treatment. Numerous controlled studies indicate that ESAs can raise haemoglobin levels, reduce transfusion requirements and improve quality of life in anaemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. They were previously used to enhance response to radiation therapy, via increasing tumour cell oxygenation. Since the 2002 guideline, there has been increasing attention to the safety of ESA treatment in patients with cancer. Two placebo-controlled phase III randomised clinical trials published in 2003 showed evidence of harmful effects of ESAs on survival and/or tumour outcomes. Subsequently, recent trials and several large meta-analyses have confirmed negative impact on survival and/or disease progression. To comprehensively examine whether ESA use affects safety outcomes in cancer patients in different settings (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies), we conducted a literature review of all clinical trials, small and large meta-analyses from 1990 to 2012.

### Fatigue (PDQ ®)-NCI-national cancer institute… [^e96f86a9]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Fatigue –Health Professional Version Overview Cancer-related fatigue is a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning. Fatigue is the most common side effect of cancer treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplantation, or selected biologic response modifiers. Clinically significant levels of fatigue may also negatively impact survival. The specific mechanisms underlying a common pathophysiology for CRF are unknown. Cancer treatment–related fatigue is a commonly reported symptom, with 80% of patients reporting fatigue while receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The condition generally improves after therapy is completed, but some level of fatigue may persist for months or years after treatment.

For a subset of patients, fatigue may be a significant issue long into survivorship. and in 19% to 82% of patients posttreatment. The pattern of fatigue associated with cancer treatment varies according to the type and schedule of treatment. For example, people treated with cyclic chemotherapy regimens generally exhibit peak fatigue in the days following treatment, then lower levels of fatigue until the next treatment. However, patients undergoing external-beam radiation therapy report gradually increasing fatigue over the course of therapy of the largest treatment field. Growing evidence, particularly for women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer, suggests that fatigue is associated with markers of increased immune inflammatory activity.

When fatigued individuals with a history of breast cancer are compared with breast cancer survivors without fatigue, different patterns emerge with respect to interleukin-6, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, C-reactive protein, neopterin, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-II. Another study has shown that fatigued breast cancer survivors have flattened cortisol slopes, having higher levels of cortisol at the end of the day than do nonfatigued survivors. It is the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that may account for the prolonged inflammatory cytokine milieu. Understanding the body's response to numerous chronic stressors in cancer may help in managing fatigue.

Cancer Treatment The association of fatigue with the major cancer treatment modalities of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, endocrine therapy, and biologic response modifier therapy caused speculation that fatigue resulted from tissue damage or accumulation of the products of cell death. Interest in the effects of cancer treatment on the production of proinflammatory cytokines is based on recognition of the strong fatigue-inducing effect of some biologic response modifiers such as interferon-alpha and the finding of elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in people experiencing persistent fatigue after cancer treatment. Some of these studies suggest, however, that not all patients return to pretreatment energy levels.

### Intersecting guidelines: administering erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to chronic kidney disease patients with cancer [^ba544124]. Seminars in Dialysis (2008). Low credibility.

There has been a dramatic sea change in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for anemic persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. An important area that has not been addressed previously is a CKD patient who also has a malignancy. Clinical guidelines exist that outline recommended treatments for each disease, but the intersection of the two disease processes presents difficult decisions for patients and physicians. Herein, we review the background underlying recent revisions in clinical alerts and guidelines for ESAs, and provide guidance for treating anemia among CKD patients who are receiving no therapy, chemotherapy with curative intent, or chemotherapy with palliative intent. The guiding principle is that comprehensive assessment of risks and benefits in the relevant clinical setting is imperative.

### Epoetin alfa improves anemia and anemia-related, patient-reported outcomes in patients with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy: results of a European, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial [^d31d29c5]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effects of epoetin alfa on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods

Women with hemoglobin concentrations ≤ 12.0 g/dl and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of 0–3 were randomized 1:1 to receive epoetin alfa (10,000 IU 3 times weekly) or best standard care (BSC) during chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the total anemia subscale assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire after 12 weeks of treatment. The fatigue and nonfatigue subscales from the FACT-An, the Cancer Linear Analog Scale (CLAS), hemoglobin changes, ECOG PS score, tumor response, overall survival, and safety also were evaluated.

Results

Of 223 patients randomized, 216 constituted the modified intent-to-treat population. Percentage changes in the total anemia subscale of the FACT-An were significantly different between epoetin alfa treatment (14.2%) and BSC (-0.5%; p = .002), favoring epoetin alfa; so were changes in the FACT-An fatigue subscale (epoetin alfa, 17.5%; BSC, -0.9%; p = .003) and nonfatigue subscale (epoetin alfa, 8.8%; BSC, 0.2%; p = .008). Similar results were observed with the CLAS. Hemoglobin concentrations > 12 g/dl were more common with epoetin alfa (62.0%) than with BSC (27.6%). Tumor response, ECOG PS score, 12-month survival rate, and the incidence of serious treatment-emergent adverse events were similar between groups.

Conclusion

Early intervention with epoetin alfa was well tolerated and improved anemia-related PROs in patients with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy.

### Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use in cancer: preclinical and clinical perspectives [^1b06d092]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in cancer patients have been associated with adverse outcomes of enhanced tumor progression and impaired survival in a series of recent clinical trials. As clinical practice guidelines for ESA administration in cancer patients have evolved to improve safety, the mechanisms underlying the adverse outcomes and whether ESAs exert direct and/or indirect effects in primary tumors to modulate tumor cell growth, survival, and chemoradiotherapy responses remain uncertain. Erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) expression in tumor cells has raised the simplistic possibility that Epo signaling mediated via a functional cellular receptor may contribute to tumor progression in a direct manner. However, Epo biology in cancer is likely to be complex and an interplay of multiple factors is potentially involved in the overall tumor response to exogenous Epo. Optimization of ESA use as an important supportive therapy modality in cancer patients, and further investigation of the role of Epo-EpoR in cancer biology will require a combination of carefully designed preclinical and clinical studies designed to ascertain not only the effect of ESA therapy on clinical outcomes such as tumor response, progression-free, and overall survival but also to investigate the potential effects of Epo on biomarkers of EpoR activation and factors related to tumor biology and chemoradiation responsiveness.

### Treatment strategies for myeloid growth factors and intravenous iron: when, what, and how? [^d4af4c2a]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloid growth factors can reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) and thus impact the survival of patients with cancer. Patients should be assessed for risk, taking into consideration patient-related risk factors and chemotherapy regimens. Patients stratified as having at least a 20% risk for CIN should be considered for prophylactic growth factors. The NCCN Guidelines for Myeloid Growth Factors provide category 1 recommendations for the daily use of filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim, and pegfilgrastim. Cancer-related anemia can be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, red blood cell transfusion, or intravenous iron.

### Diagnosis and treatment of cancer-related anemia [^79d69032]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Cancer-related anemia (CRA) is due to multiple etiologies, including chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, blood loss, functional iron deficiency, erythropoietin deficiency due to renal disease, marrow involvement with tumor as well as other factors. The most common treatment options for CRA include iron therapy, erythropoietic-stimulating agents (ESAs), and red cell transfusion. Safety concerns as well as restrictions and reimbursement issues surrounding ESA therapy for CRA have resulted in suboptimal treatment. Similarly, many clinicians are not familiar or comfortable using intravenous iron products to treat functional iron deficiency associated with CRA. This article summarizes our approach to treating CRA and discusses commonly encountered clinical scenarios for which current clinical guidelines do not apply.

### Effect of once-weekly epoetin beta on survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving anthracycline-and / or taxane-based chemotherapy: results of the breast cancer-anemia and the value of erythropoietin (BRAVE) study [^76c0e959]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Breast Cancer-Anemia and the Value of Erythropoietin (BRAVE) study evaluated whether epoetin beta would improve survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

Patients and Methods

BRAVE was an open-label, randomized, multicenter study in patients with MBC treated with anthracycline- and/or taxane-based chemotherapy. Patients (hemoglobin [Hb] < 12.9 g/dL) were randomly assigned (1:1) to epoetin beta 30,000 U subcutaneously once weekly or control for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was overall survival. Secondary efficacy outcomes included progression-free survival, transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival, Hb response, safety, and quality of life (QoL).

Results

After 18 months of follow-up, 62 (27%) of 231 patients survived with epoetin beta therapy and 63 (27%) of 232 with control. No difference was detected in overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.33, P = 0.522) or progression-free survival (HR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.30, P = 0.448). There was a statistically significant benefit on transfusion- and severe anemia-free survival compared with control (HR = 0.59; P = 0.0097). Median Hb level increased with epoetin beta (11.7 g/dL at baseline to 13.3 g/dL at 24 weeks) but did not change with control (11.5 v 11.4 g/dL). Patients receiving epoetin beta experienced more thromboembolic events (TEEs) compared with controls (13% v 6%; P = 0.012) with no difference in serious TEEs (4% v 3%). Epoetin beta did not significantly improve QoL in this study where patients had a high baseline Hb value.

Conclusion

In patients with MBC receiving chemotherapy and initial Hb less than 12.9 g/dL, epoetin beta increased Hb. No difference was detected in overall survival. Because of its superiority design, this study cannot, however, exclude clinically important differences in survival with absolute certainty.

Decreased Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival

Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 2,098 anemic women with metastatic breast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a noninferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumor progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the median progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%). At the final analysis, 1653 deaths were reported (79.8% subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77.8% subjects in the SOC group). Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18).

### Critical role of iron in epoetin alfa treatment of chemotherapy-associated anemia [^7ee0fa37]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Underuse of intravenous iron may have contributed to the higher rate of thrombotic vascular events (TVEs) in the EPO group. EPO can cause functional iron deficiency. Failure to use intravenous iron when administering EPO results in an increased rate of nonresponders and a requirement for higher doses of EPO. Iron deficiency as well as functional iron deficiency is associated with thrombocytosis and increased rates of arterial and venous thrombosis. Higher target hemoglobin levels are also associated with an increased risk of TVE. Red cell transfusion is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. All patients in the EPO group were treated with EPO to a target hemoglobin of 12 g/dL. Had the BSC group been treated with transfusion to the same hemoglobin target, a higher percentage of patients would have been exposed to the thrombotic risk of red cell transfusion. Risk of TVE in the BSC group is underestimated because a lower target hemoglobin was used. In this study, we think the target hemoglobin in the EPO and BSC groups should have been the same to compare TVE as an adverse outcome in the two groups.

We disagree with the authors' conclusions that RBC transfusion should be the preferred approach for the management of anemia during first- or second-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. This recommendation does not take into account the risks of allogeneic red cell transfusion that may be missed in a small study. The independent review committee–determined primary outcome of progression-free survival met the study criteria of noninferiority. Finally, the difference in TVE as a secondary outcome is likely explained by the higher target hemoglobin in the EPO group, combined with suboptimal iron replacement and EPO-induced functional iron deficiency.

WARNING: ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS AND TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE

Chronic Kidney Disease:

In controlled trials, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, E SA dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Use the lowest Epogen dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Cancer:

ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
To decrease these risks, as well as the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic reactions, use the lowest dose needed to avoid RBC transfusions [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy [see Indications and Usage (1.3)].
ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure [see Indications and Usage (1.5)].

Patients with Cancer

An increased incidence of thromboembolic reactions, some serious and life-threatening, occurred in patients with cancer treated with ESAs.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled study (Study 2 in Table 4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]) of 939 women with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, patients received either weekly epoetin alfa or placebo for up to a year. This study was designed to show that survival was superior when epoetin alfa was administered to prevent anemia (maintain hemoglobin levels between 12 and 14 g/dL or hematocrit between 36% and 42%). This study was terminated prematurely when interim results demonstrated a higher mortality at 4 months (8.7% vs. 3.4%) and a higher rate of fatal thrombotic reactions (1.1% vs. 0.2%) in the first 4 months of the study among patients treated with epoetin alfa. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, at the time of study termination, the 12-month survival was lower in the epoetin alfa group than in the placebo group (70% vs. 76%; HR 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75; p = 0.012).

### Randomized trial of intravenous iron supplementation in patients with chemotherapy-related anemia without iron deficiency treated with darbepoetin alpha [^8cb4a6bf]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Unresponsiveness to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, occurring in 30% to 50% of patients, is a major limitation to the treatment of chemotherapy-related anemia. We have prospectively evaluated whether intravenous iron can increase the proportion of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia who respond to darbepoetin.

Patients and Methods

Between December 2004 and February 2006, 149 patients with lung, gynecologic, breast, and colorectal cancers and ≥ 12 weeks of planned chemotherapy were enrolled from 33 institutions. Patients were required to have hemoglobin ≤ 11 g/L and no absolute or functional iron deficiency. All patients received darbepoetin 150 microg subcutaneously once weekly for 12 weeks and were randomly assigned to sodium ferric gluconate 125 mg intravenously (IV) weekly for the first 6 weeks (n = 73) or no iron (n = 76). Primary end point of the study was the percentage of patients achieving hematopoietic response (hemoglobin ≥ 12 g/dL or ≥ 2 g/dL increase).

Results

Hematopoietic response by intention-to-treat analysis was 76.7% (95%CI, 65.4% to 85.8%) in the darbepoetin/iron group and 61.8% (95%CI, 50.0% to 72.7%) in the darbepoetin group (P = 0.0495). Among patients fulfilling eligibility criteria and having received at least four darbepoetin administrations, hematopoietic responses in the darbepoetin/iron group (n = 53) and in the darbepoetin-only group (n = 50) were 92.5% (95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%) and 70% (95% CI, 55.4% to 82.1%), respectively (P = 0.0033). Increase of hemoglobin during treatment period showed a time profile favoring darbepoetin/iron with statistically significant effect from week 5 on. The safety profile was comparable in the two arms.

Conclusion

In patients with chemotherapy-related anemia and no iron deficiency, IV iron supplementation significantly reduces treatment failures to darbepoetin without additional toxicity.

To update American Society of Hematology/American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations for use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in patients with cancer.

Methods

An Update Committee reviewed data published between January 2007 and January 2010. MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were searched.

Results

The literature search yielded one new individual patient data analysis and four literature-based meta-analyses, two systematic reviews, and 13 publications reporting new results from randomized controlled trials not included in prior or new reviews.

Recommendations

For patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy who have a hemoglobin (Hb) level less than 10 g/dL, the Update Committee recommends that clinicians discuss potential harms (eg, thromboembolism, shorter survival) and benefits (eg, decreased transfusions) of ESAs and compare these with potential harms (eg, serious infections, immune-mediated adverse reactions) and benefits (eg, rapid Hb improvement) of RBC transfusions. Individual preferences for assumed risk should contribute to shared decisions on managing chemotherapy-induced anemia. The Committee cautions against ESA use under other circumstances. If used, ESAs should be administered at the lowest dose possible and should increase Hb to the lowest concentration possible to avoid transfusions. Available evidence does not identify Hb levels ≥ 10 g/dL either as thresholds for initiating treatment or as targets for ESA therapy. Starting doses and dose modifications after response or nonresponse should follow US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling. ESAs should be discontinued after 6 to 8 weeks in nonresponders. ESAs should be avoided in patients with cancer not receiving concurrent chemotherapy, except for those with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Caution should be exercised when using ESAs with chemotherapeutic agents in diseases associated with increased risk of thromboembolic complications. Table 1 lists detailed recommendations.

### Adding epoetin alfa to intense dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: randomized clinical trial [^06fcda12]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Anemia is frequent in cancer patients, especially in those receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy and has a negative impact on the patient′s quality of life.

Established adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens of breast cancer patients lead to a clinically significant degree of anemia. Even a standard anthracycline-containing regimen such as the French FEC regimen (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) induces anemia grades 1 to 3 in 42.4% of patients. Dose-dense combination regimens with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in 13% of the patients and intense dose-dense regimens such as intense dose-dense (IDD) sequential chemotherapy with epirubicin (E), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) (IDD-ETC) or doxorubicin (A), paclitaxel (T), and cyclophosphamide (C) (IDD-ATC) require RBC transfusions in 25% to 67% of patients.

The erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) epoetin alfa had shown efficacy in treatment and prevention of chemotherapy-induced anemia in breast cancer patients. However, individual studies and meta-analyses reported an increased risk of death and serious adverse events. Whereas three meta-analyses have indicated an increased risk of mortality with the use of ESAs, two other meta-analyses did not indicate that ESA use statistically significantly affected disease progression or mortality. In addition, there is strong evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials that therapy with epoetin and darbepoetin increases the risk of thromboembolic events.

As a consequence, the revised US Food and Drug Administration label states that ESAs should only be used to treat chemotherapy-induced anemia and they should not be used in malignancies such as early-stage breast cancer when the anticipated treatment outcome is cure.

WARNING: ESAs INCREASE THE RISK OF DEATH, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, STROKE, VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM, THROMBOSIS OF VASCULAR ACCESS AND TUMOR PROGRESSION OR RECURRENCE

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Chronic Kidney Disease:

In controlled trials, patients experienced greater risks for death, serious adverse cardiovascular reactions, and stroke when administered erythropoiesis - stimulating agents (ESAs) to target a hemoglobin level of greater than 11 g/dL (5.1).
No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level, Aranesp dose, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks (2.2).
Use the lowest Aranesp dose sufficient to reduce the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (5.1).

Cancer:

ESAs shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence in clinical studies of patients with breast, non - small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers (5.2).
Use the lowest dose to avoid RBC transfusions (2.3).
Use ESAs only for anemia from myelosuppressive chemotherapy (1.2).
ESAs are not indicated for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy when the anticipated outcome is cure (1.3).
Discontinue following the completion of a chemotherapy course (2.3).

### Critical role of iron in epoetin alfa treatment of chemotherapy-associated anemia [^0b414586]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

In the study by Leyland-Jones et al, we question whether the protocol resulted in adequate iron supplementation in both the epoetin alfa (EPO) group and the best standard of care (BSC) group, but especially in the group that was randomly assigned to receive EPO 40,000 IU once per week. The study design recognized that the availability of iron is a limiting factor in the response to EPO and suggested that, "Patients with transferrin saturation value of less than 20% were to receive iron supplementation". There did not seem to be a requirement for iron supplementation after enrollment. We feel the evaluation for functional iron deficiency was inadequate. For patients treated with iron because of baseline transferrin < 20%, iron parameters were remeasured in 3 weeks, which delayed initialization of intravenous iron therapy unnecessarily in patients for whom enteric iron was prescribed. For patients with transferrin > 20%, iron parameters were not remeasured for 6 weeks after random assignment. The authors do not provide the results of iron studies at baseline or during and at the end of study; therefore, we are unable to judge the degree of iron deficiency and functional iron deficiency in the two groups.

That iron and especially intravenous iron was underused in the EPO group is clear from the rate of both enteric and intravenous iron therapy. Oral iron therapy, rather than intravenous iron, was used most frequently (49% of the EPO group and 56% of the BSC group). Intravenous iron use was nearly identical in the two groups (8% in the EPO group and 9% in the BSC group), yet the increased frequency of functional iron deficiency with use of EPO is well known. The benefit of iron administration in patients with metastatic breast cancer, even when done primarily via oral administration, may explain why, despite chemotherapy, the hemoglobin in both groups rose during the duration of the study from approximately 10.2 g/dL to a median achieved hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL in the EPO group and 10.9 g/dL in the BSC group. One should also acknowledge that transfusion in the BSC group provides intravenous iron, as donor cells are broken down and heme iron is recycled and used.

### Adding epoetin alfa to intense dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: randomized clinical trial [^06a3f46a]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

In contrast with these recommendations, which were not defined at the start of our trial, we evaluated epoetin alfa for prevention of chemotherapy-induced anemia in a curative indication. In a preceding phase I/II dose-escalation study with 102 patients, 26% of these patients required RBC transfusions. This high percentage of RBC transfusion is not acceptable in the adjuvant setting and was the rationale for performing a second randomization of epoetin alfa vs control in the intense dose-dense ETC arm only. Comparing the effectiveness of IDD-ETC and conventionally scheduled epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel, the 5-year event free survival rates (70% vs 62%) and overall survival rates (82% vs 77%) were statistically significantly improved by IDD-ETC.

We report data from the second randomization of epoetin alfa vs control in the IDD-ETC arm. Results of our study will contribute to the still ongoing discussion about the benefit and safety of ESAs in the treatment of cancer patients.

Decreased Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival

Study 1 was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study in 2,098 anemic women with metastatic breast cancer, who received first line or second line chemotherapy. This was a non-inferiority study designed to rule out a 15% risk increase in tumor progression or death of epoetin alfa plus standard of care (SOC) as compared with SOC alone. At the time of clinical data cutoff, the median progression free survival (PFS) per investigator assessment of disease progression was 7.4 months in each arm (HR 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20), indicating the study objective was not met. There were more deaths from disease progression in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (59% vs. 56%) and more thrombotic vascular events in the epoetin alfa plus SOC arm (3% vs. 1%). At the final analysis, 1653 deaths were reported (79.8% subjects in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group and 77.8% subjects in the SOC group). Median overall survival in the epoetin alfa plus SOC group was 17.8 months compared with 18.0 months in the SOC alone group (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.18).

### Fatigue and cancer-side effects-NCI… [^f7371e63]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

What is cancer fatigue. Cancer fatigue is a condition caused by cancer or cancer treatment in which you feel exhausted or extremely tired. Some people with cancer have extreme fatigue most of the time and are unable to carry out day-to-day tasks. Others feel only very tired. Cancer fatigue may also be called cancer-related fatigue or cancer treatment–related fatigue. Cancer fatigue is different from fatigue you may have felt in the past. When a healthy person is tired, fatigue is usually caused by activity and goes away after resting or sleeping. However, cancer fatigue is not completely relieved by sleep or rest and may happen after no or minimal activity. Cancer fatigue is common Cancer fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer treatment. More than 80% of people with cancer experience fatigue while receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Cancer fatigue can occur at any time Fatigue can begin at any time — before, during, or after cancer treatment.

Sometimes it's an early symptom of cancer, or it can be brought on by the stress of a cancer diagnosis. Fatigue may worsen gradually as you go through treatment, or it may come on suddenly. Fatigue usually decreases after cancer treatment ends, but some people may still feel fatigue for months or years. Whether and how you experience fatigue depends on factors such as the type of cancer, stage of cancer, cancer treatment you are receiving, and your overall physical and emotional health, nutrition, and sleep patterns. Symptoms of cancer fatigue include:

- having no energy; feeling extremely tired, drained, or lethargic
- having difficulty moving; feeling heavy or slow
- having difficulty thinking, remembering, or paying attention
- having a sense of physical, emotional, and/or mental exhaustion
- not feeling rested, even after sleeping. Causes of cancer fatigue Cancer itself, cancer treatments, and the side effects of treatment can cause fatigue.

Additional sources of fatigue may be stress, changes to your schedule, and other medical conditions. Fatigue from cancer Sometimes the source of fatigue in someone with cancer is the cancer itself. Cancer cells use calories and nutrients that your body needs for energy, making you feel fatigued. Cancer can also cause your body to release cytokines, naturally produced substances that help your body to fight infections and cancer but that can cause fatigue when released at high levels. Cachexia, a wasting syndrome that causes muscle and weight loss in some people with cancer, can also lead to fatigue. Certain types of cancer are more likely to cause fatigue than others.
- Blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma affect the bone marrow, making it difficult for your body to produce healthy blood cells. If your red blood cell count is low, your body's tissues can't get enough oxygen, resulting in fatigue.
- Breast cancer and prostate cancer can affect your hormone levels, which can lead to fatigue.
- Gastrointestinal system cancers such as stomach cancer and colorectal cancer can affect the way your body processes and uses food. Fatigue from cancer treatments Many cancer treatments can reduce your energy level. Each treatment may affect fatigue differently, and the treatment's schedule and dose can influence how fatigued you are and when you feel most tired. Receiving more than one treatment can increase fatigue. Fatigue after surgery. Fatigue is common following surgery while your body is using energy to heal. Pain medicine given after surgery can also cause fatigue. Fatigue from surgery usually improves with time, but when surgery is combined with other treatments, fatigue may last longer. Fatigue from chemotherapy. Chemotherapy destroys healthy cells while treating cancer cells, causing you to feel fatigued.

### Effects of erythropoietin receptors and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on disease progression in cancer [^3e638044]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Recent randomised, controlled ESA studies also suggest no significant impact of ESAs on disease progression in chemotherapy patients. Of note, a retrospective study in 323 multiple myeloma patients receiving chemotherapy reported that median progression-free survival was significantly shorter (P < 0.001) in ESA-treated patients compared with non-ESA-treated patients. In contrast, a retrospective study of chemotherapy patient data from the SEER-Medicare database (from 1991 to 2002) indicated that overall survival was similar between patients receiving ESAs (N = 12 522) or not receiving ESAs (N = 34 820). In recently reported preliminary final results, the ARA Plus study (N = 1234) prospectively evaluated event-free survival and overall survival in a randomised controlled study of adjuvant chemotherapy with or without darbepoetin in node-positive breast cancer patients. After a median follow-up of 40 months, there were no significant differences in 3-year event-free survival (89.2% vs 87.6%, P = 0.97) or overall survival (95.4% vs 95.1%, P = 0.85) between patients receiving darbepoetin vs standard of care, respectively.

Meta-analyses of ESA trials

Several recent meta-analyses have examined ESA use and safety outcomes in cancer patients. The large meta-analyses byandreported a negative ESA impact risk on mortality but not on how ESAs affect disease progression. A recent meta-analysis byanalysed 52 controlled ESA-oncology trials; this meta-analysis was unique in that it did not include the BEST trial and included studies examining preoperative-ESA therapy. This meta-analysis did summarise two trials (N = 247) that reported numbers of complete and partial tumour responses. These numbers did not differ significantly between ESA-treated and control patients (risk ratio for complete response = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.69–1.12; risk ratio for partial response = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.44–1.11).

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) — erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) response predictors include baseline erythropoietin (EPO) and transfusion needs: patients with elevated baseline EPO levels (> 500 IU/L) are unlikely to respond, and ESAs should be avoided when EPO is elevated (> 500 IU/L), whereas an even lower EPO level (< 200 IU/L) is associated with a better Hb response; lower pretreatment red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence (< 2 units per month) has been associated with higher ESA response, and potential benefits include avoidance of secondary hemochromatosis in lower risk patients with years of expected survival.

### Reply to T. hasegawa et al and I. gross et al [^bdc4a8b4]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

We have several responses to the correspondence by Gross et alon the critical role of iron in our study. In contrast to what the authors stated, iron parameters at baseline and iron use during the study were provided in the Data Supplement, and use of iron during the study is adequately described in the protocol (NT00338286 and EudraCT Number 005-001817-17). Patients in both treatment arms with transferrin < 20% were to be considered to have functional iron deficiency and were to receive iron therapy, preferably by intravenous administration. The recommended iron therapy was in agreement with the European guidelines for treatment of renal anemia at the start of the studyand aligned with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer guidelines on iron supplementation in patients with cancer who received chemotherapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).

The recommendation of iron use in this study is the same as in another metastatic breast cancer study with ESAs, the Breast Cancer-Anemia and the Value of Erythropoietin study. This study reported concomitant iron supplementation of 85% in the epoetin beta group and 80% in the control group. Of note, in the Breast Cancer Erythropoietin Survival Trial (BEST) study, a daily dose of elemental iron (oral) 200 mg was recommended when transferrin was < 20%; only 1.8% of the total population received iron supplementation.

Iron therapy in patients with cancer has often been contentious because of its potential contribution to tumor initiation and tumor growth, its role in the tumor microenvironment and metastasis, and the changes in the uptake and management of iron in patients with cancer. Particularly in breast cancer, almost 50% of all genes that are involved in the regulation or maintenance of iron metabolism were significantly associated with clinical outcome. We believe these findings may contribute to the cautious use of iron supplementation in patients with cancer.

### Management of cancer-related anemia in patients with breast or gynecologic cancer: new insights based on results from the European cancer anemia survey [^7480abff]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

The incidence, prevalence, and treatment of anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] < 12 g/dl) in women with breast cancer and gynecologic cancer were evaluated using data from the European Cancer Anemia Survey (ECAS). Adult patients with newly diagnosed treated or untreated disease, persistent/recurrent disease, and disease in remission were enrolled and followed for up to six chemotherapy cycles or six evaluation points within a 6-month period. At enrollment, 30.4% of breast cancer patients and 49.1% of gynecologic cancer patients were anemic. A significant correlation was shown between low Hb level and poor performance status (World Health Organization criteria) at enrollment for both breast cancer and gynecologic cancer patients. In all, 62.4% of breast cancer patients and 81.4% of gynecologic cancer patients were anemic at some time during the survey. The incidence of anemia, determined in a carefully defined population, was 59.8% for breast cancer patients and 74.8% for gynecologic cancer patients. Despite the high prevalence and incidence of anemia, only 26.3% and 42.7% of patients in the respective groups received anemia treatment. In breast cancer patients, the mean Hb trigger was 10 g/dl for epoetin treatment and 8.6 g/dl for transfusion; corresponding values for gynecologic cancer patients were 10.1 g/dl and 9.1 g/dl. Logistic regression analyses in the overall ECAS population identified five factors as significant and suitable predictors of anemia: lower initial Hb, having lung or gynecologic cancer versus gastrointestinal/colorectal cancer, any other cancer versus gastrointestinal/colorectal cancer, treatment with platinum chemotherapy, and being female. The ECAS data highlight the need for greater awareness of the adverse impact of anemia on cancer patients and for optimal anemia management to ensure maximal patient quality of life.

### The risk for anemia with targeted therapies for solid tumors [^fb3cb57f]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is a common manifestation in patients with cancer. Little is known about the frequency of and risk for anemia with targeted therapies used to treat solid tumors.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of solid tumors by comparing targeted therapy (alone or in combination) with standard therapy alone to calculate the incidence and relative risk (RR) for anemia events associated with these agents. Overall, 24,310 patients were included in the analysis.

Results

The addition of targeted therapies to standard treatment (chemotherapy or placebo/best supportive care) increased the risk for all grades of anemia by 7%. The RR for all grades (incidence, 44%) and grades 1–2 (incidence, 38.9%) of anemia was higher with biological therapies alone but not when combined with chemotherapy. The risk was significant for erlotinib, trastuzumab, and sunitinib. Bevacizumab was associated with a lower risk for anemia. Anti-epidermal growth factor receptor, anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors predicted RRs of 1.24, 1.20, 0.82, and 1.33, respectively, and all of these values were significant.

Conclusion

Grade 1–2 anemia is frequently associated with biological agents. The risk is particularly associated with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), breast cancer, and lung cancer. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are not labeled for use with targeted therapies (without chemotherapy) and the treatment is supportive only.
