## Question

A rectangle has a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters. A similar smaller rectangle has half the length and width of the big rectangle. What's the area of the smaller rectangle?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the area of a smaller rectangle that is similar to a larger rectangle with a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters, where the smaller rectangle has half the length and half the width of the larger rectangle. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the dimensions of the larger rectangle. Then, I should calculate the dimensions of the smaller rectangle by halving each side. Next, I will compute the area of the smaller rectangle. Finally, I will verify the result and consider the scaling relationship to ensure consistency with geometric similarity principles.

> Let me first confirm the given dimensions of the larger rectangle: length is 40 meters and width is 20 meters, so its area is 40 × 20 = 800 square meters, which I can use as a sanity check later [^notfound].

> Now, I need to calculate the dimensions of the smaller rectangle. Half of 40 meters is 20 meters for the length, and half of 20 meters is 10 meters for the width, so the smaller rectangle is 20 meters by 10 meters. Wait, let me verify that I'm applying the "half" scaling to both dimensions correctly — yes, the problem states half the length and half the width, so 20 m and 10 m are correct [^notfound].

> Next, I should compute the area of the smaller rectangle. Area equals length times width, so 20 meters × 10 meters equals 200 square meters. Hold on, I should double-check the arithmetic: 20 × 10 is indeed 200, so the area is 200 square meters [^notfound].

> I will now examine the scaling relationship to ensure this makes geometric sense. When both linear dimensions are scaled by a factor of 1/2, the area scales by the square of that factor, which is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. One quarter of 800 square meters is 200 square meters, which matches my calculation, confirming consistency with similarity and area scaling laws [^notfound].

> Final answer: The area of the smaller rectangle is 200 square meters.

---

The area of the smaller rectangle is **200 square meters**. This is because when both the length and width of a rectangle are halved, the area becomes one-fourth of the original. The original area is 40 m × 20 m = 800 m², so the smaller area is 800 m² ÷ 4 = **200 m²**.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

- **Original rectangle dimensions**: length = 40 m, width = 20 m.
- **Original area**: 40 m × 20 m = 800 m².
- **Smaller rectangle dimensions**: length = 40 m ÷ 2 = 20 m, width = 20 m ÷ 2 = 10 m.
- **Smaller rectangle area**: 20 m × 10 m = 200 m².

---

## Geometric explanation

When a rectangle is scaled by a factor of 1/2 in both dimensions, the area scales by the square of that factor: (1/2)² = 1/4. Thus, the smaller rectangle's area is **1/4 of the original area**, which is 800 m² ÷ 4 = 200 m².

---

## Final answer

The area of the smaller rectangle is **200 square meters**.

### Spontaneous perception of numerosity in humans [^bd8afc3b]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

The general procedure was to measure discrimination thresholds for stimuli that varied over two dimensions, area and density. Figure 1 shows an example of the stimulus space, on logarithmic axes, with the origin depicting the standard area and density of a particular condition, and the ticks on the axes showing octave changes (doubling or halving of that dimension). As numerosity is the product of area and density, it can be depicted in this logarithmic space as the +45° diagonal. We then measure discrimination thresholds in all directions within the space to determine the direction of maximum sensitivity, and relate that to the directions of area, density and number. The logic is similar to that of measuring Macadam ellipses in color-space. Indeed the thresholds of experiment 1 are well described by ellipses, with short radii corresponding to the most sensitive direction in this space.

Clarification of hook length measurement — The rescue or shepherd's hook must be long enough to touch the bottom center of the deepest portion of the RWF plus 2 feet (0.6 meters) as measured from the closest edge without an obstruction, and this edge can only be used for measurement if someone could freely walk down both sides without an obstruction such as a waterfall, fountain, statue, etc. For a rectangular pool, the shorter distance would be from the long side of the rectangle as long as there are no obstructions, and the 2 feet (0.6 meters) is measured from where the shepherd's hook crosses the fill line of the RWF.

### Boundaries steer the contraction of active gels [^779cd01a]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Temporal asymmetric contraction of rectangles

The necessity of force imbalance for the contribution of material to the contraction speed implies that the contraction process depends on the exact asymmetry of the activated areas. For asymmetric patterns, for example, rectangles of initial aspect ratio α init ≡ X init / Y init > 1 (see Supplementary Movie 2), the distance of the centre region to the boundary is different for the two principal axes. Consequently, the maximum contraction velocity for the long axis, should be reached later than for the shorter axis,(Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2). There will exist regions in space that have the ability to contract in y -direction while still being unable to contract in x -direction. Yet the initial contraction velocity around the perimeter of the pattern should be uniform, independent of the geometry. Which is indeed what we see (inset of Fig. 3b). As we observed identical aspect ratios before and after contraction (red squares in Fig. 3b), this implies a temporal asymmetric contraction, where the short side contracts before the long side, followed by the contraction of the long side. This asymmetry in time gets captured in a transient increase of the aspect ratio to its maximum α max (blue circles in Fig. 3b).

As we have seen for symmetric patterns the maximum contraction speed is proportional to the initial distance between the boundaries. For asymmetric patterns with identical areas, this would predict that the ratioof the maximal velocities of the principal axes equals the initial aspect ratio. However, experimentally we findwith γ = 0.4 ± 0.1 (Fig. 3c). This non-trivial dependence indicates an intricate dynamic coupling of the principal axes, resulting in either a hampered contraction along the length or an enhanced contraction along the width.

To shed light on this issue we activate a series of rectangles with constant half-length X init and variable half-width Y init. The maximal velocity of the width increases linearly with increasing width as expected for the symmetric, undisturbed contraction, whereas the maximum contraction speed along the length gets increased nonlinearly as the initial width gets larger (Fig. 3d). If there was no coupling, the maximal contraction speed of the length should be independent of the other dimension's size. Yet, the shortest side of an asymmetrically shaped, isotropic, contracting gel determines the overall dynamics of contraction.

### Technique of area measurement of epithelial defects [^65394279]. Cornea (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare two commonly used methods of area measurement of corneal epithelial defects, namely, estimation of the area of an equivalent rectangle and use of image analysis software, the gold standard.

Methods

Thirty-eight patients with corneal epithelial defects were evaluated. The largest linear dimension of the epithelial defect and its largest possible perpendicular within the confines of the epithelial defect were measured using a slit lamp. The area was then measured using digital photographs and image analysis software. A paired sample t test was used to compare the results.

Results

The two measurements of area correlated well (P = 0.84); their difference was insignificant (P = 0.063) and a linear regression relation between the two could be derived with an r2 value of 0.71, which was significant.

Conclusions

Accurate slit-lamp measurements with estimation of the area of an equivalent rectangle can safely be used as a measure of the epithelial defect size when sophisticated image analysis software is not available.

### Precision medicine and the cursed dimensions [^491a5da5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our intuition regarding "average" is rooted in one-dimensional thinking, such as the distribution of height across a population. This intuition breaks down in higher dimensions when multiple measurements are combined: fewer individuals are close to average for many measurements simultaneously than for any single measurement alone. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality. In medicine, diagnostic sophistication generally increases through the addition of more predictive factors. Disease classes themselves become more dissimilar as a result, increasing the difficulty of incorporating (i.e. averaging) multiple patients into a single class for guiding treatment of new patients. Failure to consider the curse of dimensionality will ultimately lead to inherent limits on the degree to which precision medicine can extend the advances of evidence-based medicine for selecting suitable treatments. One strategy to compensate for the curse of dimensionality involves incorporating predictive observation models into the patient workup.

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^59af4302]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Gridness in trapezoid environments

To simulate the effect of asymmetric boundaries in a trapezoid enclosure on gridness, we took cluster positions from simulations after learning in square environments, and ran an additional learning phase for 250,000 trials. In this new learning phase, the shape of the environment was now a trapezoid (the agent could only move to those locations), and the annealed learning rate schedule continued (starting at 0.0025, reducing to 0.002 at the end). The trapezoid dimensions were 5 × 24 × 50 pixels, closely matching the proportions in(0.2 × 0.9 × 1.9 meters; multiplied by (50/1.9) equals to 5.26, 23.7, and 50).

In order to test whether the asymmetric boundaries of the trapezoid affected gridness, the trapezoid was split into two halves and we computed the grid score for the spatial autocorrelogram on the left (wide) and right (narrow) side of the shape. Due to discretization, we split it as close to equal as possible. The wide half extended from the leftmost pixels to the 17th pixel (338 pixels), and the narrow side extended from the 18th pixel to the 50th pixel (339 pixels).

### Patency of the lenticulostriate and pontine arteries after stenting of the intracranial arteries [^d71c12cf]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The next step is to multiply the green figure area by 4 and introduce the trigonometric function of theangle.

Thus, the area of the part of the ellipse uncovered by the rectangle is as follows:

Obviously, the formula can be used only when the stent strut width is no greater than the perforating artery ostium width, i.e.

In the case of Model 2, the coverage of the perforating artery ostium by two parallel stent struts can be calculated similarly. The area of the ellipse covered by two rectangles amounts to four times the area of dark blue figure minus four times the area of light blue figure. The areas of blue figures are calculated in the same way as the area of the green figure in Model 1. Finally, the formula is as follows:

Again, the formula can be used only when the stent strut width is no greater than half of the perforating artery ostium width, i.e.

### Revealing key dimensions underlying the recognition of dynamic human actions [^2cb526d8]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

The dimensions revealed in the current study provide the basis for a promising direction for future research regarding the behavioral and neural correlates of these dimensions. First, it will be important to determine which of the dimensions are most relevant to recognize and distinguish between actions. Second, we expect important insights into the computational goals of different brain regions by examining the degree to which, where and when the multidimensional action space model and individual dimensions underlying this model can explain neuronal activity (see also refs.), and how this activity contributes to the ability to recognize actions. Third, it will be interesting to determine whether some of the dimensions reflect large-scale organizing principles along the ventral, dorsal and lateral visual pathway (but see ref.), as recently proposed for dimensions such as object size, sociality and transitivity, and input modality(see also ref.). Fourth, examining the stability of dimensions within and between participants is appealing, as it will give insights into the roles of expertise, knowledge, and personal development. Fifth, it will be interesting to determine the degree to which the multidimensional action space model changes over time (both short- and long-term), e.g. as a function of the task, experience, or training. To address this latter question, we expect important insights from examining the dynamics — at different temporal scales — underlying the representation of individual dimensions. As an example, visualizing an action's dimension profile through the petals of a rose plot (see Fig. 5), would the petal sizes of dimensions vary for certain frames of an action video, highlighting different aspects of an action at individual time points? Finally, another important direction for future research will be to integrate the dimensions revealed in the current study into models explaining causal relationships, like scripts, or action and knowledge frames.

### Quantifying ethnic segregation in cities through random walks [^a7e14864]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Note that the profile of μ (c) for the null-model (dashed black line in Fig. 3 b) behaves as expected, i.e. the mean coverage times increase steadily as a function of c up to 0.8 (four classes), mainly due to the uniform abundance and displacement of the four large clusters. We notice a sharp increase for c ≈ 1, which accounts for the time needed to find nodes belonging to the fifth class, i.e. the smaller one. We provide additional distributions and heat-maps in Supplementary Fig. 1 where the values for c = 1 are removed to isolate this effect.

Effect of domain shape and cluster size

In Fig. 4 a we considered four different random tilings of the same 16 × 16 square lattice considered in Fig. 3, with the aim of isolating the role of the size and shape of local clusters. The tiling consist of 32 classes, respectively organised (from top to bottom) in (i) 32 rectangular clusters of size 2 × 4 (cluster-8), (ii) 64 square clusters of size 2 × 2 (cluster-4), (iii) 64 rectangular clusters of size 1 × 4 (stripe-4) and (iv) 128 rectangular clusters of size 1 × 2 (stripe-2). Notice that configuration (i) (cluster-8) corresponds to the largest possible value of spatial diversity and spatial heterogeneity. On the other hand, configuration (iv) (stripe-2), which is indeed the most similar to the null-model (d-f), yields the smallest values of spatial diversity and spatial heterogeneity (b), as expected. The relative positions of intermediate configurations (ii) and (iii) in the Δ σ /Δ ϱ plane (c) can be explained by the fact that a tiling with square clusters provides comparatively lower values of spatial diversity and spatial variance than clusters of four nodes arranged in a line, mainly because a square of size N has a smaller perimeter than a rectangle of the same size, hence more neighbours pointing to clusters of different colour. However, on average the walker needs slightly more time to leave a cluster (ii) than a stripe (iii) of same size (See the relative positions of the two configurations in the Δ μ /Δ ϱ plane (b)).

### Are grid cells used for navigation? On local metrics, subjective spaces, and black holes [^ba0fa718]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

The symmetric, lattice-like spatial pattern of grid-cell activity is thought to provide a neuronal global metric for space. This view is compatible with grid cells recorded in empty boxes but inconsistent with data from more naturalistic settings. We review evidence arguing against the global-metric notion, including the distortion and disintegration of the grid pattern in complex and three-dimensional environments. We argue that deviations from lattice symmetry are key for understanding grid-cell function. We propose three possible functions for grid cells, which treat real-world grid distortions as a feature rather than a bug. First, grid cells may constitute a local metric for proximal space rather than a global metric for all space. Second, grid cells could form a metric for subjective action-relevant space rather than physical space. Third, distortions may represent salient locations. Finally, we discuss mechanisms that can underlie these functions. These ideas may transform our thinking about grid cells.

### Human V4 size predicts crowding distance [^103a1c66]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Visual recognition is limited by both object size (acuity) and spacing. The spacing limit, called "crowding", is the failure to recognize an object in the presence of other objects. Here, we take advantage of individual differences in crowding to investigate its biological basis. Crowding distance, the minimum object spacing needed for recognition, varies 2-fold among healthy adults. We test the conjecture that this variation in psychophysical crowding distance is due to variation in cortical map size. To test this, we make paired measurements of brain and behavior in 49 observers. We use psychophysics to measure crowding distance and calculate λ, the number of letters that fit into each observer's visual field without crowding. In the same observers, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the surface area A of retinotopic maps V1, V2, V3, and V4. Across observers, λ is proportional to the surface area of V4 but is uncorrelated with the surface area of V1 to V3. The proportional relationship of λ to area of V4 indicates conservation of cortical crowding distance across individuals: letters can be recognized if they are spaced by at least 1.4mm on the V4 map, irrespective of map size and psychophysical crowding distance. We conclude that the size of V4 predicts the spacing limit of visual perception.

### Diagnostic accuracy of the tsiogkaSpaeth grid test for detecting visual field defects in patients with glaucoma [^7eea2fc1]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

The TS grid

As it has been previously described, the TS grid is a new optotype, designed to detect defects in both the central and mid-peripheral VFs. It is designed to be printed on a typical A4 non-glossy paper sheet in a horizontal orientation (22.5 cm width and 17.8 cm height). The grid consists of 54 rectangles of a side length of 2.4 cm, 32 rectangles of side length of 1.2 cm and 16 rectangles of side length of 0.6 cm, arranged to fit precisely on the A4 paper. The smaller rectangles are placed at the centre of the grid, surrounded by the medium-sized rectangles, and then by the larger ones. This gradual increase in the size of the rectangles was employed in order to compensate for the decreased sensitivity when detecting defects in the periphery. In this way, a table is formed, in the shape of a rectangle. These rectangles alternately contain arrows of 3.15:1 (grey:white) contrast ratio, pointing in horizontal or vertical directions separated by empty rectangles in order to facilitate the patient and communication with the examiner. The direction of each arrow varies. Recognition of the direction in which each arrow is pointing does not require literacy in any language, does not require recognition of an object and has only one right answer. It is, also, easily incorporated into a forced-choice paradigm. In addition, the direction of each arrow does not follow a pattern in order to avoid memorisation. A small black circle is positioned at the centre of the optotype and uses the fixation point. Following the Amsler's grid configuration and design, each 5 mm rectangle on the TS grid subtends a visual angle of 1°e when the chart is held at 30 cm. Therefore, the central area of the TS grid subtends 4.8° horizontally and vertically, the paracentral area 15.4° horizontally and vertically and the entire TS grid 43.2° horizontally and 33.6° vertically. The TS grid is printed in two different forms. One has the arrows occupying one half of the sites, while the other has the arrows in the other half on the test's sites. Each eye is tested using both versions of the TS grid: the first TS grid is complementary to the second grid as shown in online supplemental figure 1a, b. So a total of four rounds is examined per patient. After correcting for near refractive error and leaning on a desk, each participant is asked to view the TS grid monocularly at a distance of 30 cm. To ensure the TS Grid is held face-on during testing, the person administering the test should place the test paper on a rigid, flat surface to keep the grid straight and prevent any bends or folds. The test should be conducted so that reflections from surrounding light are minimised, and patients are positioned so as to avoid glare. To maintain a consistent 30 cm distance from the patient's face, a ruler or a marked reference on the clinician's arm or desk is used. The patient may hold the grid themselves, but if the patient struggles, the clinician should help in holding the grid at the proper distance and position. The fellow eye is occluded with an eye patch. The examinee is instructed to fixate on the central black spot and to try to perceive the direction of the arrows with his/her peripheral vision. If the patient turns his/her eyes to the arrow, he/she is advised to return to the central area and to try to perceive if he/she finally can recognise it or not. During the first examination, the arrows are presented by the examiner to the patient so that the patient learns to recognise them. Patients are instructed to fixate at the central point of the grid at all times and asked to answer if she/he can see the direction of each arrow that is pointed to by the examiner with a pen or a laser pointer for improving focus and minimising distractions, in settings where such equipment is accessible, starting from the central area to the periphery. It is necessary for the person administering the test to return to each tested area once if he believes that the response was not accurate, in order to verify the first answer. Correct and incorrect responses are recorded by circling (indicating a correct response) or deleting (indicating a false response) on the main reference chart (online supplemental figure c) held by the examiner. If the patient cannot see an arrow, the procedure is repeated, and if she/he is still not able to see the arrow, the arrow is deleted from the chart. Ideally, testing with the TS grid test should be done at the beginning of the examination in order to avoid potential fatigue that could affect performance. A total TS score is summated from correctly answered rectangles, with 102 the perfect summed score from all rectangles.

### Anomalous photoelectrochemical etching of undoped semiconductor surfaces [^82200d4c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The lateral diffusion of carriers plays an important role in forming surface topography during the etching process. We designed four patterns shown in Fig. 4g, each featuring a square area with uniformly distributed light intensity. The dimensions of the squares differ among the patterns, while the total illumination area is the same. The etching results are presented in Fig. 4h. The etched profile across different pattern sizes presents significant variations. Specifically, the smaller rectangles are etching suppressed, and there was minimal height difference between each rectangle's edge and central area. However, in the case of larger rectangles, suppression of etching was observed only at the edges, while the central area was etching-accelerated. According to our theory, the lateral migration of carriers affected by the light gradient causes apparent etching and inhibition of etching at the edge, after which the carriers spread laterally between the edge region and the center region until equilibrium is reached. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that a flat surface is obtained after etching for patterns of uniform light intensity with small dimensions (here, it is less than ≈50 μm). For uniform patterns with large dimensions (here, > 200 μm), the middle area is a plane, while a curved outline appears at the edge after etching. The situation between these two sizes will produce a concave. From these results, we can see that the rate of structure formation is related to the structure's light intensity, gradient, and size, all of which are fixed for a given etching solution. Per our experiments, the maximum rate does not exceed the chemical etching rate (100 nm min −1). Additionally, we verified that the etching topography does not exhibit significant changes over time, as the light field remains consistent when the etching depth is small. Furthermore, our findings indicate that polarization does not influence the etching topography. Detailed information regarding these experiments is provided in the Supplementary Note 3.

The experiments above demonstrate that we can achieve precise 3D nanofabrication on undoped semiconductor wafers by controlling both the gradient and intensity of the incoming light (see Fig. 4 for an explanation of how the gradient and intensity of light could control the 3D nanofabrication process).

### Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry [^b4e91865]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

Grid cells represent an animal's location by firing in multiple fields arranged in a striking hexagonal array. Such an impressive and constant regularity prompted suggestions that grid cells represent a universal and environmental-invariant metric for navigation. Originally the properties of grid patterns were believed to be independent of the shape of the environment and this notion has dominated almost all theoretical grid cell models. However, several studies indicate that environmental boundaries influence grid firing, though the strength, nature and longevity of this effect is unclear. Here we show that grid orientation, scale, symmetry and homogeneity are strongly and permanently affected by environmental geometry. We found that grid patterns orient to the walls of polarized enclosures such as squares, but not circles. Furthermore, the hexagonal grid symmetry is permanently broken in highly polarized environments such as trapezoids, the pattern being more elliptical and less homogeneous. Our results provide compelling evidence for the idea that environmental boundaries compete with the internal organization of the grid cell system to drive grid firing. Notably, grid cell activity is more local than previously thought and as a consequence cannot provide a universal spatial metric in all environments.

### Fast and slow intraplate ruptures during the 19 October 2020 magnitude 7.6 shumagin earthquake [^24fcde31]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Observed (black) and predicted 3-fault (red) tsunami surface elevation time series (left column) and spectra (right column) for DART and tide gauge stations for the model in Fig. 7. a DART stations. b Alaska tide gauges. c Hawaii tide gauges. The computed time series at the tide gauges have been shifted by the indicated time to align with the recorded arrivals.

The specific geometry of the inferred slow thrust faulting, with along-trench compression in the upper plate, is surprising, and if this model is correct, it comprises an unexpected tsunami hazard in the region. The presence of weak sediments near the shelf break may have influenced slow-slip rupture with 15 m of slip over ~300 s, as found for this successful model, which has fault dimensions of 20 km × 20 km. Such large slip over localized area has been observed in shallow megathrusts environments, typically involving a tsunami earthquakeor aseismic transient slip. Transpressional environments have been observed to have large slow thrust faulting along with dominant strike-slip faulting as well. Models with a larger fault area (30 km × 30 km; 40 km × 40 km) and lower slip (7 m, 4 m) that have similar total moment may be viable, but it is challenging to fit all of the tsunami data as well as in Fig. 8 (e.g. Supplementary Figs. 16, 17). While lower slip is appealing, larger fault dimensions imply more observable faulting in the wedge, for which available bathymetry and reflection profiling now provide independent evidence. The non-unique modeling suggests slow slip of from 4 to 15 m on the westward-dipping upper plate thrust fault.

### Faunal engineering stimulates landscape-scale accretion in southeastern US salt marshes [^7007d023]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Field experiment 3: creekshed mussel manipulation

To assess the effects of mussel presence and population size on marsh accretion at the creekshed scale, we first selected a marsh creekshed with three adjacent tidal creeks of similar length, structure, associated mussel populations, and marsh platform characteristics (i.e. size, elevation, and cordgrass characteristics). For each of the three tidal creeks, we first delineated a 50 m by 50 m creekhead area, oriented perpendicular to the direction of the tidal creek entry into the marsh, and located with midpoint of the front edge positioned at the point of tidal creek entry into the marsh. We then delineated a larger creekshed area associated with each creek of ≥ 10,000 m 2 within which we would deploy our experimental treatments. To quantify initial mussel and cordgrass cover, we set up three 50 m 2 transects (50 m long, 1 m wide) within the creekhead area, located at 0 m, 20 m, and 40 m distance from the tidal creek point of entry (and oriented perpendicular to the direction of flow). Within each transect, we counted each mussel aggregation, scoring each individual mussel as well as the length, width, and height from marsh platform of each mussel aggregation structure.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^29f660d7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports ("basins"). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a "Star of David" pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^08aae061]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) linear and area measurements — the most widely used linear dimension is the anteroposterior (AP) measurement in the parasternal long-axis using M-mode or, preferably, two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), but the AP linear dimension should not be used as the sole measure of LA size; LA area can be planimetered in apical four- and two-chamber views, and optimal contours should be obtained while avoiding foreshortening.

Dedicated cardiac SPECT systems — smaller area detectors in a fixed 90° configuration reduce cost, weight, and space, but patient positioning is more critical to avoid truncation; these designs combine improvement in spatial resolution and sensitivity, and QA may differ from standard Anger cameras. Many cameras emerged with smaller area detectors in a fixed 90° configuration that had significantly reduced cost, weight, and space requirements. Care in patient positioning, however, is more critical when using these dedicated cardiac SPECT systems, compared to multipurpose SPECT systems with large-area detectors, to avoid truncating the heart and the associated artifacts. Otherwise, QA is similar to the multipurpose SPECT systems. These systems combine an improvement in spatial resolution and sensitivity. Because of the wide variety of designs and their novelty, their QA requirements may differ from the standard Anger camera with parallel-hole collimation.

Fig. 5
Point and intersection counting for estimation of volume and surface area. In case volume and surface area should be estimated on the same fields of view, test points and test lines can be combined into test line segments. These test line segments contain two test points, one on each end. Test point counts (large black arrows) may fall on alveolar airspace, alveolar duct airspace or alveolar septum, thus differentiating the parenchyma into compartment volume fractions (compare Fig. 1). Intersections of test lines with alveolar surface (small red arrows) are counted for surface area estimation. From Schneider and Ochs

Fig. 6
Physical disector for counting of alveolar openings to estimate alveolar number. Counting event is the presence of an alveolar opening in one section (left, indicated by arrowheads at the free septal edges that belong to the entrance ring) but not the other (right) where the alveolus is closed by a bridge (arrow). The disector volume is defined by the area of the unbiased counting frame multiplied with the distance between the two sections (here 9 µm). The unbiased counting frame has inclusion lines (green) and exclusion lines with extensions (red). The counting rule allows disector counts of particles inside the counting frame, where they may touch the inclusion line, but not the exclusion line.

Airway comparative analysis — matching approaches and caveats: Table 5 outlines selection criteria with example metrics and considerations, including designation of "Terminal bronchiole", designating a generation number for each airway, path distance (e.g., 5 cm from carina or pleura), lumen size (e.g., 2-mm-diameter airways), and airways at a stipulated inner perimeter with wall thickness of airways with inner perimeter of 10 mm (Pi10); considerations note pathology may alter airway status, anatomical variations in branching pattern, body and lung size variations, risk of bias when pathology alters airway dimension (e.g. COPD may narrow airway lumens; therefore, 2-mm airways may occur at a different generation compared with subjects without COPD), and that regression assumptions should be confirmed with potential effects of outliers assessed.

### Is the middle between both halves? midpoint location and segment size estimation in neglect [^b7e5475a]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Line bisection errors in neglect are attributed to perceptual size distortions. In order to compare the two segments of the line to determine if they are equal, one might first estimate the location of a midpoint that defines the two line segments to be compared.

Objectives

The authors attempted to determine whether estimating a line's midpoint can be dissociated from comparing the two segments of this line, and if so, what the relative contribution of each of these tasks is to the perceptual bias in neglect.

Methods

The authors studied two patients with hemispatial neglect from right hemisphere lesions by asking them where bisection marks were placed on prebisected lines and whether the two adjacent line segments were equal.

Results

There was a stronger bias judging the position of the bisecting marks ("where" determination) than comparing the size of two adjacent line segments.

Conclusions

These results suggest that perceptual size distortion of line segments alone cannot explain the subjects' line bisection bias, but postperceptual deficits in "where" computations may better account for their errors locating the midpoint. "Where" determinations might require more attentional capacity, depend more heavily on viewer-centered allocation of attention, and be mediated by the right hemisphere's "where" dorsal stream. In contrast, comparing the length of two segments might be mediated by the left hemisphere's "what" ventral stream.

Best blood pressure (BP) measurement practices — Table 7 — specify standardized technique and numeric parameters: seat the child quietly for 3–5 min with back supported and feet uncrossed; measure in the right arm at heart level; use correct cuff size with bladder length 80%–100% of arm circumference and width at least 40%; deflate at 2–3 mm Hg per second; read to the nearest 2 mm Hg; and for leg measurements, systolic BP is usually 10%–20% higher than brachial pressure.

### Males prefer a larger bust size in women than females themselves: an experimental study on female bodily attractiveness with varying weight, bust size, waist width, hip width, and leg length independently [^c03d464c]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

What determines a female figure as attractive and is there a consensus of both sexes in judging female bodily attractiveness? To answer these questions, an extensive experiment was conducted using high-quality photographic stimulus material, several systematically varied figure parameters (weight, hip width, waist width, bust size, and leg length), and a large sample of 34,000 participants. The results showed that women prefer slightly wider hips, a narrower waist, and longer legs than men (highly significant but small effects). A clear difference was found with regard to the ideal bust size: 40% of men but only 25% of women preferred a large bust. The findings are discussed with respect to the changed role of women in Western industrialized countries who tend to concentrate on their career rather than on reproduction, and the effect of a curvaceous body with a large-sized bust on social perception.

### Natural switches in behaviour rapidly modulate hippocampal coding [^4aaf17a6]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

We further divided the data to distinct behavioural modes on the basis of the localization data of the two bats and their flight direction:
Solo flights: the recorded bat was flying while the other bat was resting, or both bats were flying and the interbat distance was > 40 m. The 40 m threshold was taken because bats are probably not attentive to the other bat at large distances of > 40 m (see the next paragraph), and we therefore considered such large distances as if the bat was flying alone. Short solo flights that lasted less than 2 s (corresponding to around 14 m) were discarded from the analysis.
Cross-overs: the bats flew in opposite directions and passed each other. The cross-over event was defined as the point of interbat distance = 0, with the distance measured along the long axis of the tunnel. As cross-overs are momentary events, we considered a distance-window of ± 40 m around each cross-over event, which we defined as a cross-over flight. The bats increased their echolocation rate at distances between −20 m and 0 m (Fig. 1d–f and Extended Data Fig. 2), which suggests that they are attending to the other bat at these distances.; to enable the analysis of an extra baseline, we considered a larger and symmetrical distance window of ± 40 m, which enabled us to detect neuronal modulations and their return to baseline activity. Cross-overs that occurred less than 8 m from the landing balls were excluded from the analysis to avoid effects of landing and take-off (see the light grey vertical rectangles in Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b, e). Furthermore, we excluded cross-over flights in which the two bats did not fly in opposite directions for at least 5 m before and 5 m after the cross-over event. Most of the valid cross-over flights were long (median, 80 m, which is also the maximum possible length of a cross-over flight, given our ± 40 m analysis window); however, cross-over events that were close to landing balls or U-turns resulted in cross-over flights that were shorter than 80 m (mean cross-over flight length: 74.84 ± 11.36 m (mean ± s.d.); minimal length 20.77 m).
Tracking: the two bats flew in the same direction with an interbat distance of less than ± 20 m. We further divided the tracking epochs to flights in which the recorded bat was following the other bat (interbat distance between −20 m and 0 m) and when the recoded bat was leading (interbat distance between 0 m and 20 m). Tracking behaviour was analysed only in bat no. 30, which was trained to perform many tracking flights: these analyses are shown in Extended Data Fig. 9. In all of the other bats we had only a few or no tracking flights during the session, and they were therefore not analysed.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

Step 4: Sampling

Tightly interrelated with the measurement of the reference space and processing of lung tissue is the sampling of tissue blocks for microscopy. Actually, stereology is all about rigorous unbiased (and thus, truely representative equal opportunity) sampling. A bad sample will inevitably result in bad data and thus bad science. In general, sampling must be randomized for location, i.e. each part of the lung has the same chance for being selected for analysis. For anisotropic structures with a preferential orientation in space (e.g. major conducting airways), some parameters (e.g. surface area and length) also require randomization for spatial orientation.

Various stereological sampling designs have been developed. The basic principle for randomization of location is systematic uniform random sampling (SURS). The first sample is chosen randomly but determines the position of all other samples which are selected by a predefined constant sampling interval (Fig. 3). Depending on the target compartment you are interested in, you may have to follow this SURS principle along a cascade of microscopic magnifications (e.g. distinguishing parenchyma vs. non-parenchyma at a low light microscopic magnification, but distinguishing alveolar septum, alveolar airspace and alveolar duct airspace within parenchyma at a higher light microscopic magnification). This principle, where the phase of interest at a lower magnification becomes the reference phase at a higher magnification, has been termed cascade sampling (Fig. 1). Along this cascade, you must not break the SURS chain at any point. Also keep in mind that the microscopic resolution influences the data. This is of particular relevance for alveolar surface area estimation where the well-known "coast of Britain effect" leads to higher values with higher resolution because finer irregularities become visible. Selective targeting of subcompartments within the lung, which can either be defined by anatomy (e.g. individual lung lobes) or by pathology (e.g. lesioned regions), is addressed by stratified sampling where those subcompartments are sampled seperately. The basic concept of fractionator sampling is to keep track of the sampling fraction throughout the cascade of sampling stages (e.g. slices, slabs, blocks, sections, fields of view). Fractionator sampling can easily be combined with SURS (Fig. 3). Its great advantage is that particle number can be estimated without bias independent of tissue deformation by multiplying the total counts at the final sampling step by the inverse of the sampling fraction along all sampling stages.

Figure 1
Trial structure and exemplar stimuli. Examples of (a) a valid trial, in which a right‐sided target is cued by a large numerical array, and (b) the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays used as numerical cues.

The numerical cue consisted of two‐item or a nine‐item arrays, that were matched for the cumulative area occupied by the items (~8 cm 2) and their total contour length (~34.5 cm), as well as for the size of the virtual square subtended by the items (~52 cm 2). The rectangular‐shaped items composing the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays measured, respectively, 0.5 × 8.1 cm and 0.73 × 1.2 cm; they were arranged randomly within the virtual square, with their shorter side aligned with the horizontal plane. Each numerosity (i.e. 2 or 9) could appear in three different colors (yellow, green, and pink) and four orientations (two leftward, and two rightward), created by rotating the array to the right by 90° three times, which resulted in 12 different arrays per numerosity (Figure 1). On each trial, the displayed numerical cue was selected randomly from the pool of 12 arrays, and the displayed target stimulus was selected randomly from a pool of sixteen different images of a static colorful ball (1.75 cm in radius) varying in color (Figure 1). Trials were administered in blocks, each block composed of eight valid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue) and eight invalid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue). Valid and invalid trials appeared randomly, and cue numerosity and target position were equally distributed within each block. There was no restriction on the number of trial blocks presented to each participant: The experimental session terminated when the infant had looked away from the screen during five consecutive trials.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

### The development of memory for location: what role do spatial prototypes play? [^a8a4d8d6]. Child Development (2001). Low credibility.

Two experiments investigated the role of spatial prototypes in estimates of location. In Experiment 1 (N = 144), children and adults learned the locations of 20 objects in an open, square box designed to look like a model house. In two conditions, opaque lines or walls divided the house into four regions, and in the other condition, no boundaries were present. Following learning, the dots marking the locations were removed, and participants attempted to replace the objects. Children and adults overestimated distances between target locations in different regions. Contrary to Huttenlocher, Hedges, and Duncan's hierarchical theory of spatial memory, none of the groups displaced the objects toward the region centers. In Experiment 2 (N = 96), boundaries were removed during testing to determine whether children and adults were more likely to displace objects toward region centers when uncertainty about location increased. Again, all age groups overestimated distances between target objects in different regions. In addition, adults and 11-year-olds in the most salient boundary condition displaced objects toward the region centers. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding how children and adults estimate location.

As an example, a normal BSA-indexed LV EDV measured from the four-chamber view in a 40-year-old woman would fall between approximately 30 and 78 mL/m^2.

### Learning naturalistic driving environment with statistical realism [^fe3f70c3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

As a proof-of-concept, we build a "network", as shown in Fig. 7, that involves two scenarios, i.e. a four-way stop sign-controlled intersection and a two-lane roundabout. We use SUMOsimulator to generate vehicle trajectory data and use it as the ground truth of the NDE. We assume the traffic network is not fully perceptional and we only have vehicle trajectory data in the intersection and roundabout areas. Therefore, these two areas are controlled by trained NeuralNDE models, and the transition areas between the two scenarios are controlled by rule-based IDM car-following modeland SL2015 lane-changing model. The proposed method can generate high-fidelity simulation, as shown in Supplementary Movie 4. More details about experiment settings can be found in Supplementary Section 1f.

Fig. 7
Proof-of-concept for modeling a road network.

It involves two scenarios, i.e. a four-way intersection and a two-lane roundabout, The areas denoted by red rectangles are controlled by NeuralNDE methods, and the areas denoted by yellow rectangles are controlled by model-based methods.

We simulate the network and collect the data in the intersection and roundabout areas to quantitively evaluate the performance. The simulated network can still achieve statistical realism and the results are discussed below. We run around 100 hours of simulation to collect the data. For the intersection area, we evaluate vehicle instantaneous speed and distance distributions to demonstrate the performance of normal driving behavior, as shown in Fig. 8a, b, respectively. From the results, we can find that the simulated distribution is consistent with the ground truth. We further validate the statistical realism of the safety-critical driving behavior. The results of vehicle distance in near-miss situations (smaller than 10 meters) and PET are shown in Fig. 8c, d, respectively. We can find that the proposed method can replicate the ground-truth with high accuracy.

It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

Left ventricular mass (LV mass) quantification in adults by echocardiography — measurement timing, methods, and calculation considerations — includes that measurements should be performed at the end of diastole (the frame before mitral valve closure or the frame in the cardiac cycle in which the ventricular dimension or volume is largest). Methods include M‑mode, two‑dimensional echocardiography (2DE), and three‑dimensional echocardiography (3DE); M‑mode and 2D linear dimensions use geometric formulas to estimate myocardial volume while 3DE can measure it directly, and all methods convert volume to mass using myocardial density (approximately 1.05 g/mL). When using 2D images of the entire ventricle, either the area‑length or truncated ellipsoid technique is used. Proper technique requires wall thickness and LV dimensions be perpendicular to the long axis, and 2D‑guided M‑mode or 2D image measurements are preferred over blind M‑mode imaging. The commonly used formula includes a correction for the 20% overestimation from original M‑mode validation and raises the linear dimensions to the power of 3, so small dimensional errors can significantly affect calculated LV mass; moreover, because direct 2D wall thickness measures may be smaller than M‑mode, LV mass values derived with this formula may not be directly interchangeable. For serial assessment in individual patients, 2D echocardiographic methods have advantages over linear dimensions, whereas for screening or studying large populations, the M‑mode method has advantages because it is simple, quick, and subject to less measurement variability. Because 3DE directly measures myocardial volume, it is an appropriate approach, but it is the consensus of this committee that available 3D echocardiographic LV mass data in normal subjects are not sufficient to recommend normal reference values. In patients with upper septal hypertrophy, linear dimension methods using basal measurements result in overestimation of the true mass.

### Tear resistance of soft collagenous tissues [^c0252236]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Sample preparation

For fracture tests, rectangular specimens were excised from GC and CCC, and a lateral cut of length c was introduced with a scalpel. The dimensions (i.e. the total length × width before clamping), free sample lengths L 0 after clamping and c were 42 mm × 12 mm (L 0 = 2 mm, c = 3 mm), 45 mm × 60 mm (L 0 = 15 mm, c = 15 mm) and 60 mm × 60 mm (L 0 = 30 mm, c = 15 mm). An additional set of experiments was performed with 40.5 mm × 6 mm CCC specimens (L 0 = 0.7 mm to 1.1 mm, and c = 1 mm). Note that the total length is up to 4 times larger than L 0 in order to provide sufficient clamping area. The adaption of c for each specific L 0 was due to material availability considerations. For instance, with c = 15 mm for all samples, the required width for L 0 = 2 mm would have been w 0 = 60 mm, instead of the currently used 12 mm, thus leading to significantly larger testpieces and consequently a lower number of samples obtained from each liver. For uniaxial tension to failure tests (UA), dog bone specimens (ISO 37 Type 4, 2 mm width, L 0 = 20 mm) were used. For inflation (EB) tests (GC, Sy184) circular samples with diameter 70 mm (free diameter D 0 = 50 mm) were prepared, and central defects of dimensions of approximately 0.2 mm, 1 mm and 5 mm were created. For suture retention (SRS) tests, 30 mm × 10 mm specimens were prepared (L 0 = 20 mm), perforated and sutured by a needle and 5–0 monofilament suture (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany), with a bite depth of 2 mm away from the front edge. To allow for image-based analysis of in-plane deformation fields black markers were painted on specimen surfaces with a waterproof black pen (GeoCollege Pigment Liner 0.005). For in-situ testing in the multiphoton microscope, samples with free lengths of 10 mm × 40 mm (fracture, c = 10 mm) and 20 mm × 10 mm (SRS, bite depth 2 mm) were prepared and stained with DNA binding dye DAPI (40, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride, Invitrogen) prior to testing to visualize cell nuclei using fluorescence.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Age-related changes in skin wrinkles assessed by a novel three-dimensional morphometric analysis [^509af4e9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A system has been developed whereby the morphology of the skin surface can be evaluated directly in three dimensions. This system employs a non-invasive device that utilizes white light of halogen origin, and which allows the computation of wrinkle depth and width, and other parameters of skin surface morphology. Using innovative engineering, an optical system has been devised so that light is transmitted via a slit and can be used to measure not only replicas of the skin but also the skin surface directly. The measurement area is 6.4 x 6.4 mm, and the theoretical resolution with a x 50 magnification lens is within 12.5 micro m.

Objectives

To use this system to study age-related changes in the morphology of wrinkles at the eye corner areas of women of varying ages.

Methods

One hundred and one healthy women (age range 20–80 years) residing in the Tokyo area were the subjects used in this study.

Results

Wrinkles demonstrated a rapid increase in depth in women aged 40 years or older, and plateaued at the age of 60 years. Surface morphology parameters yielded results similar to those of age-related changes in wrinkles.

Conclusions

This new analytical system provides a rapid and convenient non-invasive method to evaluate skin surface morphology in three dimensions, especially with respect to wrinkle formation. The results obtained using this system provide a deeper insight into the mechanistic relationship between wrinkles and skin elasticity.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Recommendations for measuring pulmonary nodules at CT: a statement from the Fleischner society [^cb0b6423]. Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Part-solid lesions with several solid components — measurement approach and recommendation specify that one possible approach is to determine the single largest focus and measure it while reporting but not measuring the remaining foci; an alternative approach measured all components on pathology slides and expressed their sum as a percentage of the overall tumor volume to derive a linear estimate (for example, a 25% solid component in a 20-mm nodule corresponds to a 5-mm diameter), but this approach has not been used or tested in the context of CT images; currently, the practice in pathology is to measure only the greatest dimension of the largest solid component, and the authors recommend measuring the long axis of the largest solid component on images reconstructed with a high-frequency algorithm and displayed on a lung window, noting that if the result is greater than 5 mm, invasion may be considered more likely.

### Are levator hiatal dimensions in mid-pregnancy associated with mode of delivery? [^19213a68]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that a shorter levator hiatal anteroposterior diameter at rest measured with 2D ultrasound and a smaller 3D hiatal area at 20 weeks gestation were associated with operative delivery. The 2D anteroposterior diameter had similar predictive performance for operative delivery as 3D hiatal area with AUC 0.75 and 0.83, respectively. Smaller hiatal dimensions were associated with longer duration of second stage of labour.

Previous studies are scarce and inconsistent but indicate a possible association between antenatal hiatal dimensions and mode of delivery. Lanzarone et al. examined 60 nullipara at 36–40 weeks gestation and found no association between levator hiatal area, anteroposterior or transverse diameter, measured in the 3D volume and delivery mode. Similar to our study, they found a weak inverse correlation between antenatal hiatal dimensions and length of second stage of labour. In a study including 231 women, Siafarikas et al. demonstrated an association between larger transverse levator hiatal diameter and hiatal area measured with 3D ultrasound at 37 weeks gestation and operative delivery. They also found a correlation between larger levator hiatus and shorter second stage of labour. Van Veelen et al. used 3D ultrasound and found that women who delivered by caesarean section because of failure to progress had a significantly shorter transverse diameter and smaller area on contraction at 12 weeks gestation, and a shorter anteroposterior diameter on contraction at 37 weeks, than those with a normal vaginal delivery.

The correlation between duration of second stage of labour and hiatal dimensions provides a possible explanation for the association between hiatal dimensions and mode of delivery by mediation. Maternal height was not associated with hiatal dimensions or mode of delivery.

All previous studies used 3D ultrasound, requiring post-processing of the ultrasound volumes. Unique for our study is that we measured the 2D anteroposterior diameter in the midsagittal plane at rest and found a strong association to mode of delivery; 2D anteroposterior diameter had similar predictive performance for operative delivery as 3D hiatal area, but 2D ultrasound is more convenient in a clinical setting since it requires no post-processing of the ultrasound volume. In our study, the mean difference in 2D anteroposterior diameter between groups of normal vaginal delivery and operative delivery was 0.7 cm. The above-mentioned studies have found mean differences of 0.2–0.5 cm for 3D measurements. Whether the larger diameter difference between the groups in our study population is linked to the use of 2D and not 3D ultrasound remains hypothetical.

### Infants show ratio-dependent number discrimination regardless of set size [^563942da]. Infancy (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence for approximate number system (ANS) representations in infancy is robust but has typically only been found when infants are presented with arrays of four or more elements. In addition, several studies have found that infants fail to discriminate between small numbers when continuous variables such as surface area and contour length are controlled. These findings suggest that under some circumstances, infants fail to recruit either the ANS or object file representations for small sets. Here, we used a numerical change detection paradigm to assess 6-month-old infants' ability to represent small values. In Experiment 1, infants were tested with 1 versus 3, 1 versus 2, and 2 versus 3 dots. Infants successfully discriminated 1 versus 3 and 1 versus 2, but failed with 2 versus 3. In Experiment 2, we tested whether infants could compare small and large values with a 2 versus 4 condition. Across both experiments, infants' performance exhibited ratio dependence, the hallmark of the ANS. Our results indicate that infants can attend to the purely numerical attributes of small sets and that the numerical change detection paradigm accesses ANS representations in infancy regardless of set size.

Color Doppler imaging — region of interest (ROI) and sector size and gain optimization: Before initiating color Doppler, the 2D sector size should be adjusted to the lowest depth and width necessary to accurately depict the anatomic region to be imaged, and the color box ROI should be sized to include all of the flow information being evaluated. The color-flow Doppler gain should be adjusted by slowly increasing the color until there is random color-flow speckling beyond the borders of the anatomic area of interest, followed by slowly decreasing the gain until the speckling disappears, and color gain settings should be frequently adjusted during the examination.

2.8 Confocal microscopy and image analysis

Confocal micrographs were acquired using an Olympus FV 3000 confocal microscope and analyzed using ImageJ. We utilized several different objective lenses, including ×10 (air), ×20 (air), ×40 (air), ×60 (oil), or ×100 (oil) with a range of optical zoom as needed by the experiment. We tuned the acquisition parameters including laser power, photomultiplier tube (PMT) gain, and offset, to accommodate the full range of signal as reflected by a few under‐saturated and a few saturated pixels in the images. Subsequently, we acquired 12‐bit images and minimally adjusted the acquisition settings.

We analyzed CA2 PNNs with a modified image analysis protocol as described previously. In brief, we used the WFA‐covered area and intensity of the WFA‐covered area in the PCP4‐stained CA2 area as analysis metrics for assessing PNN in various experimental groups. To assess the PNN‐covered area, we used single‐plane confocal micrographs of the hippocampus containing the entire CA2 area. To delineate the CA2 area, we drew a large, rotated rectangular region of interest (ROI) covering all PCP4‐expressing neurons in the CA2 and saved it for reference and further analysis. Subsequently, we generated binary representations of PCP4, NeuN, and WFA signals using inbuilt auto thresholding functions (OTSU or Triangle) in ImageJ. Using Boolean operations in ImageJ, we computed the binary areas of WFA, PCP4, and NeuN within the rectangle area covering the CA2. The expression of PCP4 remained unaltered in all studied age groups (Figure S2); therefore, we used PCP4 area as an internal control, and normalized the WFA area with the PCP4 area within the CA2 area rectangle and used data points to plot in graphs. Similarly, we computed the WFA intensity within the CA2 area rectangle.

To assess the neuronal density in the CA2 area, we drew an ROI encompassing the PCP4‐covered area and counted the total number of NeuN‐expressing neurons in single‐plane images. Next, we normalized the cell count with the CA2 area ROI to obtain cell density in CA2. To assess PV cell density in the CA2 area, we used ∼20 µm‐thick z‐stacks and counted the total number of PV‐expressing neurons followed by normalizing it with the PCP4‐covered CA2 volume.

### High-speed, scanned laser structuring of multi-layered eco / bioresorbable materials for advanced electronic systems [^7a440c4f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Si-based MOSFETs and diodes are essential elements of advanced eco/bioresorbable electronic systems. Previous publications describe their fabrication based on multiple cycles of photolithography, anisotropic substrate etching, passivation, and transfer printing, with an overall scheme designed specifically to avoid degradation of the bioresorbable constituent materials due to thermal and chemical exposures associated with the processing steps. As an alternative, ablation enables highly simplified routes to similar devices, without compromising their performance parameters. Figure 5g illustrates the procedures for a bioresorbable n-channel MOSFET as a representative example, formed by three cycles of material preparation-patterning in a sequence similar to that for the ECoG systems mentioned above. The patterned materials are monocrystalline doped Si (thickness: 2 µm), SiO 2 (thickness: 100 nm), and Mg (thickness: 50 nm). Supplementary Fig. 28 presents schematic illustrations and an optical micrograph of the resulting device. The bottom Si MM (dimension: 505 × 515 µm) includes two highly n-doped areas (dimension: 100 × 248.5 µm), with the other areas lightly p-doped (channel dimension: 18 × 100 µm). The middle SiO 2 film covers the underlying Si MM, with two openings (dimensions: 40 × 40 µm and 40 × 100 µm, respectively) to allow for connection between the Si and Mg pads for electrodes on top. The dimensions for the source, drain, and gate pads are 125 × 205 µm, 100 × 135 µm, and 65 × 180 µm, respectively. Figure 5h–i shows transfer and output characteristics of devices formed by laser ablation (solid line) and by previously reported schemes (dashed line), with the same materials and dimensions. The effective mobility (µ eff), on-off current ratio (I on/off), threshold voltage (V th), and subthreshold slope (SS) values for MOSFETs by laser ablation are 610 ± 20 cm 2 S −1 V −1, 700 ± 120, −0.35 ± 0.05 V, and 330 ± 60 mV decade −1, respectively; those for devices fabricated by microfabrication are 620 ± 30 cm 2 S −1 V −1, 3100 ± 2600, −0.30 ± 0.05 V, and 280 ± 50 mV decade −1, respectively.

### Closed-loop neurostimulation: the clinical experience [^d476c752]. Neurotherapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Detection

The detection algorithms in the neurostimulator are computationally efficient and optimized in order to perform real-time detection within the constraints of currently available implantable technology, such as limited power and processing capabilities. Three detection tools (bandpass, line-length, and area) are provided. The detection parameters are highly configurable and are selected by the physician to adjust the sensitivity, specificity, and latency of the detection.

The bandpass tool is similar to that described by Gotman, and is used to detect spikes and rhythmic activity occurring in specific frequency ranges. This tool uses "half-waves", which are segments of the electrographic signal partitioned at local minima and maxima. The amplitude and duration of the half-waves are representative of the amplitude and frequency components of the electrographic signal.

The line-length algorithm, described by D'Alessandro et al. and Esteller et al. identifies changes in both amplitude and frequency. The line-length is defined as the average of absolute sample-to-sample amplitude differences within a window. A short-term sliding window average (128 ms–4 s) is compared with a long-term sliding window average (4 s–16 min). Detection occurs when the short-term measurement crosses an absolute or relative threshold derived from the long-term measurement.

The area feature is similar to an energy or power measurement and identifies changes in overall signal energy without regard for frequency. Area is defined as the average absolute area-under-the-curve of the electrographic signal. As with line-length, a short-term window average is compared with a long-term background window average, and detection occurs when a previously defined threshold is crossed.

These 3 detection algorithms are efficient (requiring low computational power), and can be configured to detect electrographic events within a fraction of a second or to detect more subtle changes in amplitude, frequency, and/or power that occur over several seconds.

Stimulation

The neurostimulator delivers current-controlled, charge-balanced biphasic pulses, and is programmed by the physician to deliver stimulation frequencies ranging from 1 to 333 Hz, current amplitudes from 0.5 to 12.0 mA, and pulse-widths from 40 to 1000 μs. The stimulation montage can be configured to deliver current between any combination of electrodes, including the neurostimulator case.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

### On the influence of density and morphology on the urban heat island intensity [^c0c24b97]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

UCP data from different urbanisation scenarios of Berlin

To illustrate how our findings can be used in for real-world cities, we create a series of UCP data based on different hypothetical urbanisation scenarios for Berlin. This is done by modifying the real UCP data taken for the reference run. Assuming that the change of living space only happens in vertical direction, we increased (or decreased) the average building height proportionally by −50%, −25%, +25%, +50%, and +100%. Thus, we get five UCP scenarios with a gross building volume increment of −50%, −25%, 25%, 50%, and 100% relative to the real UCP data.

Similarly, we can also allocate the change by altering the urban fraction. For the scenarios of decreasing gross building volume by 50% and 25%, we simply decrease the urban fraction of each grid cell by 50% and 25%. However, for increasing gross building volume scenarios, we decrease the vegetation surface of each grid cell by the same percentages to get three scenarios with gross building volume increased by 25%, 50%, and 100%. Similar method has been used by Schubert and Grossman-Clarke.

It has to be noted that both vertical changes and horizontal changes are constrained within already urbanised grid cells, that is, without changing the shape of the urban cluster. In the third scenario the change of gross building volume is achieved by modifying the extent of the urban cluster. This is implemented by randomly adding or removing urban grid cells. For decreased gross building volume scenarios, we simply repeated the process of randomly removing an urban grid cell from the edge of the cluster. For increased gross building scenarios, the following steps are repeated until the gross building volume of the expanded urban cluster approximately agrees with the desired size. Step 1: randomly pick a grid cell from the urban cluster; step 2: randomly select a non-urban grid cell that is adjacent to an urban grid cell; and step 3: replace this non-urban cell with the urban cell selected by step 1. At the end, we get ten scenario UCP datasets with gross building volume changed by −50%, −25%, −10%, +10%, +25%, +40%, +50%, +60%, +75%, and 100% respectively.

### Additive benefits of pravastatin and aspirin to decrease risks of cardiovascular disease… [^5215d89e]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Relative risk reduction for pravastatin sodium plus aspirin in meta-analysis. The rectangle represent 2-sided 95% confidence interval and the vertical line, the relative risk reduction. MI indicates myocardial infarction; CHD, coronary heart disease; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; and PTCA, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In the meta-analyses, the larger trials were given proportionately greater weight. We first used a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model in which the trial effect is a fixed covariate. 26 To evaluate whether any observed additive benefits of pravastatin and aspirin remain present under different assumptions, we used 2 other multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, one to allow for trial heterogeneity and the other to allow for nonproportionality of treatment hazards. Finally, we used this latter model to calculate the probability of synergy.
26.

In additional analyses of individual trials and meta-analyses, we also included coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and β-blockers. All these potential confounders were collected uniformly in the individual trials. Nonetheless, the inclusion or exclusion of any potential confounders had no material effect on the results. For each comparison, we used relative risk reduction as a measure of association and then calculated 2-sided P values and 95% confidence intervals. Among aspirin users randomized to placebo, the RRR in CHD death or nonfatal MI was 28. 2%. For the other prespecified end points, aspirin use was associated with a nonsignificant RRR of 17. 6% in fatal or nonfatal MI, but with significant RRRs of
51. 3% in ischemic stroke and 22. 5% in the composite end point.

Bias also seems unlikely, because the data are prospective and there were virtually no losses to follow-up. Furthermore, the possibility of bias is lessened by the uniformly high and equal rates of aspirin use in the pravastatin and placebo groups. Despite the fact that all the trials were randomized for pravastatin use, residual confounding is plausible because the analyses were observational for aspirin use.

B, Sample 5 x 5 matrix showing variation of spectra across voxels. An individual voxel selected for fitting is shown in D. Structural imaging comprised a whole-brain fast spoiled-gradient recall sequence and an anterior commissure–posterior commissure parallel 4-slice localizer, coaligned with MPCSI.

The lowest slab sat on the anterior commissure–posterior commissure plane, with the others being 12, 14, and 36 mm above. Extracranial lipids were suppressed with 8 saturation bands. Each participant's FSPGR was radiologically reviewed to rule out clinical or magnetic-field abnormalities. Each FSPGR was segmented37 into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid and parcellated38 into neuroanatomic regions. 39 Because labels were too sparse for MPCSI sampling, multiple contiguous labels were combined to form each target ROI, except for subcortical nuclei, which consisted of 1 label each. The volume percentage of gray matter, white matter, and ROI in each MPCSI voxel was calculated. Within each ROI, values of NAA: Cr and Cho: Cr ratios were averaged for all voxels passing spectral quality control33 and with 30% or more content of the ROI in question to yield end point values.

As seen here, voxel-based findings obtained this way were consistent with prior neuroimaging and present ROI-based findings, which used no interpolation.

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12–14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.

### Creating a library of generalized fourier sampling patterns for irregular 2D regions of support [^ad8490e3]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Multiple-region MRI (mrMRI) represents a generalization of the Shannon sampling theorem to permit sparse k-space sampling whenever the scanned object or its high-contrast edges are confined to multiple known regions. Use of an optimal mrMRI sampling pattern produces an image with root-mean-squared (RMS) noise over the supporting regions equal to the RMS noise in a conventional Fourier image with the same total area of support. Analytical solutions for such sampling patterns have been described previously for all arrangements of two or three (noncollinear) supporting regions. This work describes a robust numerical method for creating a library of optimal and near-optimal mrMRI sampling patterns for more complicated geometries. The average noise amplification over all sampling patterns in the demonstration library was only 4%, with 30% of the sampling patterns resulting in no noise amplification whatsoever.

### Guidelines in electrodiagnostic medicine. consensus criteria for the diagnosis of partial conduction block [^a223a200]. Muscle & Nerve: Supplement (1999). Medium credibility.

Partial conduction block — reference normal limits over distance and study thresholds indicate the magnitude of change compatible with normal variability and with block claims. For the median and ulnar nerves with comparison of elbow to wrist stimulation, the normal range at least extends to an increase in duration of 25%, a decrease in amplitude of 25%, and a decrease in area of 20%. For the peroneal nerve with comparison of knee to ankle stimulation, the limits of normal at least permit an increase in duration of 30%, a decrease in amplitude of 30%, and a decrease in area of 25%. For the tibial nerve with comparison of knee to ankle stimulation, the normal range at least extends to an increase in duration of 30%, a decrease in amplitude of 50%, and a decrease in area of 30%. With older patients the increase in duration and decrease in amplitude (and, to a lesser extent, decrease in area) are more prominent than in young patients. The degree of amplitude and area reduction that has been required to support partial conduction block in clinical studies has ranged from 20% to 50% for amplitude and 20% to 40% for area, and in a computer simulation study amplitude reduction of 65% and area reduction of 50% was achieved with temporal dispersion as conduction distance approached 50 cm.

Interventional radiology preparatory and recovery rooms — counts and bay sizes are specified as follows: the minimum recommendation is 1.5 preparatory and 1.5 recovery bays per IR suite, and the consensus panel generally supports 2.5–3.2 prep/recovery rooms per IR suite. For patient bays and rooms, a minimum of 60 square feet of clear floor space should be provided for each patient in a lounge chair or stretcher; for individual patient cubicles, a minimum of 80 square feet should be provided; and for single-bed rooms, a minimum of 100 square feet should be provided. Per IR suite, 3–4 preparatory and recovery rooms are recommended, and if additional space is unavailable for patients needing recovery for 6–36 hours, additional preparatory and/or recovery rooms may be necessary.

### A hypergraph model shows the carbon reduction potential of effective space use in housing [^8f19f3ce]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hypergraphs allow the characterization and comparison of floor plans

To show the spatial analysis potential of the hypergraph framework, we created a dataset of residential floor plans from around the globe (see "Methods", Residential building floor plan repository). In order to characterize differences between cities, we compared a representative subset of floor plans from three different cities: Zurich, New York, and Singapore. Contrary to explicit representations with Euclidean geometry or pixel-based representations, the hypergraph encodes relative spatial relationships in addition to geometric properties. This allows the mapping of spatial and typological similarities between floor plans that have different boundary conditions. Based on the number of rooms, subdivision graphs have a variety of sizes which require comparison functions to work with matrices of different dimensions. For a comparison of different hypergraphs, we compare the subdivision matrix (derived from the spatial subdivision graph) separately from the access matrix (derived from the room access graph).

We can describe the overall configuration and complexity of a hypergraph through the number and degree of access and subdivision edges, normalized by the number of rooms. Using a principal component analysis (PCA) of key attributes (see Supplementary Fig. 9), we can demonstrate that the hypergraph method can be used to distinguish and group similar floor plans according to size and occupancy, as well as compactness (Fig. 3a). Hypergraphs with lower graph complexity, corresponding to smaller size and occupancy, are grouped in the left around the x -axis, while more complex configurations are grouped towards the right. This creates opportunities to quantify spatial differences of apartments across cities, such as simpler spatial properties of apartments in New York, when compared to small-scale, more complex floor plans with higher hypergraph subdivisions in Singapore. The hypergraph allows us to show and encapsulate architectural differences and investigate spatial configurations that are encoded in local architectural practices, prevalent construction techniques, building codes, and climate.

a Similar activities inferred by 96-channel (96c) and 80-channel (80c) signatures in most PCAWG samples. We show the signatures that are active in at least 20 cancer samples. We use an inconsistency rate to measure the dissimilarity of the inferred activities, which is calculated using log 10 (activity_80c/activity_96c). The three panels in a share the same y-axis and the labels are shown in the right panel. Left panel: sum of mutational probabilities of T > C channels of the signatures. Middle panel: violin plot of absolute inconsistency rate for each signature. The white dot represents the median value. The thick grey bar in the centre represents the interquartile range and the thin grey line represents the rest of the distribution. Right panel: heatmap of mean inconsistency rate for all signatures in different cancer types. Orange rectangle marks signatures with the average activity ratio (activity_80c/activity_96c) above 1.5, which indicates that 80c activity is larger than 1.5 times of 96c activity. The purple rectangle marks the averaged activity ratio below 0.5, which indicates 80c activity is smaller than 50% of 96c activity.

### Resolving hyperelasticity-adhesiveness conflict in polymer networks by in situ constructing mechanical heterogeneities [^4d068774]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

90° peeling test

The specimens were cut into a rectangle shape with dimensions of width × length = 20 × 50 mm. For HEAs, the surface of the in situ polymerized hyperelastic layer was in situ polymerized on a layer of 25-μm-thick PET backing, and the adhesive surface was attached to an acrylate plate. For the homogeneous polymer networks, one side was in situ polymerized on a 25-μm-thick PET backing, and the other side on a piece of release film. The samples were adhered to an acrylic sheet substrate and fixed horizontally on the platform. The PET backing was clamped by the gripper of the testing machine (Instron 5966, 100 N load cell). After 10 min, the PET backing was pulled vertically. For samples of different thicknesses, the loading speed was tuned such that the ratio of loading speed over the sample thickness was fixed at 0.6/s. For repeated adhesion tests, the HEA samples were cut into a rectangle with dimensions of width × length × thickness = 20 × 50 × 0.5 mm. The samples were peeled at a velocity/thickness ratio of 0.6/s, re-attached to the substrate, and re-peeled. This process was repeated 20 times.

Multiple tensile tests

Samples of the (ionic) HEA samples were cyclically stretched and released by a tensile machine (Instron SC-68, 250 N load cell) at 2.5 mm/s, corresponding to a strain rate of 0.1/s. In the meantime, the force-displacement curves were recorded, and the resistance of the samples was measured by a multi-meter Keysight E4990A.

Stress relaxation

Stress relaxation tests were performed on Instron 5966 with a 100 N load cell. Samples were cut into a rectangle with dimensions of width × length × thickness = 5 × 25 × 0.5 mm. The samples were stretched to a prescribed strain at a velocity of 30 mm/min and held for 12 h, during which the force was recorded.

Distribution of analysed vascular bifurcations. An example of analysed temporal retinal arteriolar and venular vascular bifurcations of different sizes and orientations evenly spread at variable distances from the optic disc across the fundus image.

Figure 2
Semi-manual technique for vascular analysis. The semi-manual technique: Vascular segment width estimated with aligned rectangles across the vessel longitudinal central axis. The bifurcation angles measured at the intersection point of vascular segments centrelines.

For each analysed vascular bifurcation, the estimated structural and geometrical parameters were: the absolute width measurements of the parent, larger branch and smaller branch vessel segments (d 0, d 1 and d 2 respectively); and the branching angles of the larger and smaller vessel segments, and the overall bifurcation angle (θ 1, θ 2 and θ = θ 1 + θ 2 respectively).

The precision of the custom-designed technique was compared to other semi-manual techniques used for vascular width detection, namely the "Kick points", "Full width half maximum", "Gregson's technique", "Single Gaussian algorithm", and the "Two dimensional Gaussian model" techniques. The developed rectangle technique' results were more precise than other techniques as reflected by lower standard deviation and coefficient of variations values and tighter confidence intervals. Further details were presented in the author's thesis.

A single trained observer, masked to the subjects' demographic and clinical data, performed all the measurements in the study. The intra-observer repeatability was evaluated on a set of eight images (total of 117 bifurcations) marked three times on separate occasions over a period of one month. The resultant Intra-observer repeatability was assessed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The average coefficients of variation were 4.2% and 3.8% for the vascular width and angular measurements respectively.

### Revealing key dimensions underlying the recognition of dynamic human actions [^087c35b5]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

How do we understand actions performed by others? Recent studies suggest that actions can be represented as points in a multidimensional space, where the perceived similarity of two actions is thought to be related to their proximity within this space. Here we present a data-driven approach to reveal key dimensions underlying this space using a carefully selected stimulus database of 768 one-second video clips spanning 256 action categories. We gathered similarity ratings for these videos from 6,036 participants and used a computational modeling procedure to identify key dimensions underlying these ratings. This approach revealed 28 meaningful dimensions (e.g. interaction, sport and craft) which capture information concerning human actions as well as a broad range of related domains (e.g. living and non-living things). Explicit ratings of actions along these dimensions gathered in a separate group of participants revealed a high correlation between ratings and weights along these dimensions, demonstrating that these dimensions are interpretable and can be used by participants. The multidimensional action space established in the current study enables the quantification of the similarity between different actions, which will be useful for the generation of hypotheses and future experimental manipulations. Together, our results provide a window into the nature of the representations underlying the ability to interpret other people's actions and pave the way for future lines of research.

### Multi-scale symbolic entropy analysis provides prognostic prediction in patients receiving extracorporeal life support [^ceaa9ed9]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In order to compute the entropy of a binary sequence, the sequence should be divided into subsets consisting of L consecutive binary bits. The detailed procedure for calculating the entropy of the coarse-grained binary sequences can be found in the caption of Figure 1. We plotted the entropy as a function of scale, which provided the quantitation of structure richness embedded in heartbeat fluctuations over different timescales. This symbolic dynamics approach, now termed multiscale symbolic entropy analysis (MSsE), can provide similar information as the original MSE in quantifying the complexity of the signal while being far less sensitive to the unpredictable yet frequent appearance of ectopic beats. According to previous results that applied MSE to the heartbeat recordings of healthy young subjects, the sample entropies of heartbeat fluctuations in individuals resembles those of Brownian motions over short timescales (< 5 heartbeats) while they behave more like those of pink (1/f) noise over longer timescales. Such a crossover phenomenon is believed to be related to different physiological processes influencing cardiac dynamics over different timescale regions, that is, over short timescales respirations dominantly entrain heartbeat fluctuations (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) via its influence on the parasympathetic nervous system; and over longer timescales (> 5 heartbeats), heartbeat fluctuations are influenced by many different physiological functions such as baroreflex and circadian rhythm that lead to complex fluctuation patterns similar to 1/f noise. These findings suggest that we should select Slope 5 (slope 5), Area 6–20 (area 6 to 20), and Area 6–40 (area 6 to 40) as the indices with physiological meaning to profile the MSsE curve (see Figure 2).

### Quantifying the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on hospital admissions forecasts: COVID-19 in england, September 2020-April 2021 [^2082faf1]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Defining healthcare facility catchment areas is a key step in predicting future healthcare demand in epidemic settings. Forecasts of hospitalisations can be informed by leading indicators measured at the community level. However, this relies on the definition of so-called catchment areas or the geographies whose populations make up the patients admitted to a given hospital, which are often not well-defined. Little work has been done to quantify the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on healthcare demand forecasting.

Methods

We made forecasts of local-level hospital admissions using a scaled convolution of local cases (as defined by the hospital catchment area) and delay distribution. Hospital catchment area definitions were derived from either simple heuristics (in which people are admitted to their nearest hospital or any nearby hospital) or historical admissions data (all emergency or elective admissions in 2019, or COVID-19 admissions), plus a marginal baseline definition based on the distribution of all hospital admissions. We evaluated predictive performance using each hospital catchment area definition using the weighted interval score and considered how this changed by the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location. We also considered the change, if any, in the relative performance of each definition in retrospective vs. real-time settings, or at different spatial scales.

Results

The choice of hospital catchment area definition affected the accuracy of hospital admission forecasts. The definition based on COVID-19 admissions data resulted in the most accurate forecasts at both a 7- and 14-day horizon and was one of the top two best-performing definitions across forecast dates and locations. The "nearby" heuristic also performed well, but less consistently than the COVID-19 data definition. The marginal distribution baseline, which did not include any spatial information, was the lowest-ranked definition. The relative performance of the definitions was larger when using case forecasts compared to future observed cases. All results were consistent across spatial scales of the catchment area definitions.

Conclusions

Using catchment area definitions derived from context-specific data can improve local-level hospital admission forecasts. Where context-specific data is not available, using catchment areas defined by carefully chosen heuristics is a sufficiently good substitute. There is clear value in understanding what drives local admissions patterns, and further research is needed to understand the impact of different catchment area definitions on forecast performance where case trends are more heterogeneous.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9ba2d0a0]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) size — internal linear dimensions are described for echocardiography. The anteroposterior diameter of the left atrium can be measured in the parasternal long-axis view perpendicular to the aortic root long axis, and measured at the level of the aortic sinuses by using the leading-edge to leading-edge convention. Advantages listed include high temporal resolution and a wealth of published data, while limitations include that a single dimension is not representative of actual LA size (particularly in dilated atria), lower frame rates than in M-mode, and single dimension only; facilitative features include orientation perpendicular to the LA posterior wall.

### Predicting visual function by interpreting a neuronal wiring diagram [^10e54a65]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Ellipse approximation to 'receptive fields'

Suppose that an image has hexel valuesat Cartesian coordinates, where i runs from 1 to N points of a hexagonal lattice. Normalizing the image yields a probability distribution. Then compute the coordinates of the image centroid byand the covariance matrix byin which I denotes the 2 × 2 identity matrix and s denotes the length of a hexagon side. The length and width of the hexel image are defined asand, in whichandare the larger and smaller eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The approximating ellipse is centred at the image centroid, and oriented along the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix.

The first term of the covariance matrix C effectively regards the probability distribution as a weighted combination of Dirac delta functions located at the lattice points. The second term is a correction that arises if each delta function is replaced by a uniform distribution over the corresponding hexagon. This replacement makes biological sense because a column receives visual input from a non-zero solid angle. Without the correction, the length and width would vanish if the image consists of a single hexel concentrated at a single delta function. With the correction, the length and width of an image with a single non-zero hexel become, in whichis the lattice constant. The correction becomes relatively minor when the length and width of the image are large.

The above has implicitly definedas the width of a 1D Gaussian distribution, for whichis the variance. This is the full-width atof the maximum. Alternatively, the width could be estimated by the full-width at half-maximum. For either estimate, the width is proportional to. I stick with the simpler estimate, which can be readily scaled by any multiplicative factor of the reader's preference.

### Topographic numerosity maps cover subitizing and estimation ranges [^634bee91]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Stimuli and experiment design

Visual stimuli were presented on a 69.84 × 39.29 cm LCD screen (Cambridge Research Systems) behind the MRI bore. Participant was required to lie still and view the display through a mirror attached to the head coil. The total distance from the attached mirror to the display screen was 220 cm. The display resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels. Visual stimuli were generated in Matlab using PsychToolbox. A large diagonal cross composed of thin red lines was displayed consistently across the entire screen, which allows accurate fixation. Participants were asked to fixate the intersection of the cross. Stimuli consisted of a group of dots with a constant total surface area presented in the central 4° (diameter) of the visual field. Dots were randomly positioned at each presentation so that each dot fell entirely within this area, to distribute contrast energy equally across the stimulus area for all numerosities (Fig. 5). Each numerosity presentation that contained the same number of dots was placed in a new, random position, so no specific visual position was associated with any numerosity. To prevent perceptual grouping, individual items were distributed roughly homogeneously across the stimulus area. All of the numerosity presentations were displayed as black or white dots on a grey background. Dot patterns were presented briefly (300 ms) to ensure participants did not have time to count. A new random pattern was presented every 650 ms, with 350 ms presentation of a uniform grey background between dot pattern presentations. This was repeated six times, over 3900 ms, corresponding to two fMRI volume acquisitions (TRs), before the numerosity changed. On 10% of numerosity presentations, the dots were shown in white instead of black. Participants were instructed to press a button when white dots were shown to ensure they were paying attention to the stimulus during the fMRI acquisition and responded to 90–100% of white dot presentations within each functional run. No numerosity judgements were required. Main stimuli in the small numerosity range consisted of 1 to 7 dots, with 20 dots as the baseline, while large numerosities consisted of 1 to 64 dots and a baseline of 512 dots. To test neural populations responses to larger numerosities, a third numerosity range consisted of only large numerosities from 8 to 64 dots and a baseline line of 512 dots was introduced, namely, the large-control range (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The main numerosity stimuli were first presented in ascending order, followed by a longer period (15.6 seconds) where presented with the baseline stimuli (20 or 512 dots in the small or large range respectively), then followed by the main numerosities in descending order, followed by another identical baseline period. This sequence was repeated four times (4 cycles) for each functional run. The long baseline period had a similar function to the blank periods used in visual field mapping stimuli in population receptive field experiments. During this period, little neural response was expected from numerosity-selective neurons preferring the main numerosities of interest, as such a relatively large numerosity should be well outside of the numerosity range that elicits strong responses. This long period also allows hemodynamic responses to return to baseline between blocks of changing numerosity.

### Allometry reveals trade-offs between bergmann's and allen's rules, and different avian adaptive strategies for thermoregulation [^a8007c6f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

the normalized formulas of which give us the logarithmic equations:

Because these allometric plots (Figs. 2a and 3a) relate the length of the appendage (one dimensional linear measure) to the body mass (three-dimensional volumetric measure) it means that the size of appendages would scale isometrically (proportionally) with the body size if the allometric coefficient was 0.3333. Thus, beak length equals to body mass to a power of 0.3362 means that the beak elongates almost exactly proportionally with body size. However, tarsus length equals to body mass to a power of 0.2883 means that the extent to which tarsus elongates with body size is slightly more pronounced in smaller species and weaker in larger species.

These allometric relationships have implications for how we interpret subsequent patterns. For example, consider a species that experience a temporal increase in temperature, or invades a warmer climate. Then, if only Bergmann's rule is operating (and in the absence of other confounds), a gradual decrease in body size should result in a proportional decrease in absolute beak length, and a gradually larger decrease in absolute tarsus length. Conversely, if species follow only Allen's rule (and not follow Bergmann's rule), then the increase in beak length should be similar between larger and smaller species, while the increase in tarsus length should be weaker in larger species and stronger in smaller species. Thus, Allen's assumption that the increase in the ratio of body width to body length is steeper in larger species, should not be a direct effect of the allometric rules, as appendages tend to increase proportionally with body size (beak) or increase milder at larger body sizes (tarsus).

Two spinal needles (or spinal needle trocars) can be used by placing them through the skin, hernia sac, and/or abdominal wall on opposite sides and viewing the tips laparoscopically, and the measurement tool can then be placed adjacent to the needle tip to ensure a proper angle. Alternatively, the instrument tip (with or without the jaws open) can be useful for measuring the defect, especially when the defects are small, since the stainless steel portion of the jaws of the instrument tip usually has a known length and width, but for defects larger than 4–5 cm in diameter this technique may be inaccurate and, because there is a fixed fulcrum and an angled approach, is more error prone as the defect becomes larger and more elliptical. Reducing insufflation pressure may reduce but will not eliminate overestimation of defect size. Overestimating the defect size will result in the choice of a larger prosthetic size, which may be more difficult to handle and may have more laxity, allowing it to bulge into the defect, and the difficulty in prosthetic handling may lead to errors in fixation with sway between fixation points; on the other hand, a larger prosthetic is generally associated with a lower chance for hernia recurrence. Underestimating the defect size may lead to choosing a prosthetic that is too small, increasing the risk of hernia recurrence, and because none of the current techniques are highly precise, knowledge of measurement flaws will allow surgeons to choose as appropriately sized prosthetic as possible to minimize recurrence and maximize the ease of operation.

### Geographic atrophy growth is strongly related to lesion perimeter: unifying effects of lesion area, number, and circularity on growth [^00c837ce]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the underlying reason for the previously observed impact of baseline lesion size, number, and circularity on geographic atrophy (GA) growth rate.

Design

Retrospective analysis of a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study participants with GA secondary to nonexudative age-related macular degeneration.

Methods

We manually delineated atrophic lesions on color fundus photographs of 318 eyes with GA followed up over at least 2 visits (mean follow-up duration, 5.1 ± 3.0 years). We calculated GA area growth rate for each eye based on the first and last visit. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was defined as the ratio between GA area growth rate and mean GA perimeter between the first and last visit for each eye.

Main Outcome Measures

GA area growth rate, growth rate of the square root of GA area, and GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate.

Results

GA area growth rate was correlated strongly with mean GA perimeter (r 2 = 0.66). GA area growth rate was associated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.39; P < 0.001), lesion number (r 2 = 0.10; P < 0.001), and circularity index (r 2 = 0.28; P < 0.001). The use of the square root of GA area reduced the influence of baseline GA area (but not lesion number or circularity) on GA growth rate. In comparison, GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate (0.098 ± 0.062 mm/year) was not correlated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.005; P = 0.20), lesion number (r 2 = 0.00009; P = 0.86), or circularity index (r 2 = 0.007; P = 0.14). GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was 50.0% higher in eyes whose fellow eyes showed GA at any visit (0.102 ± 0.062 mm/year) than in eyes whose fellow eyes never demonstrated GA during follow-up (0.068 ± 0.049 mm/year).

Conclusions

The growth rate of GA area is associated strongly with lesion perimeter. This relationship explains the previously observed influences of baseline GA size, lesion number, and circularity on GA growth rate. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate is uncorrelated with the 3 morphologic factors and may serve as a surrogate outcome measure to monitor GA progression in future studies.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Random laser ablated tags for anticounterfeiting purposes and towards physically unclonable functions [^088ded5d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Laser ablation was executed on a Si/SiO 2 substrate with a set of scanning lines rotated through 360° in equal-angle steps, for a defined H t D and working area (Fig. 2a, b). The average laser power (P avg) required to ablate the surface was first optimized. P avg depends on the peak power, repetition rate, and pulse width, such that if any one of these increases, the average power increases. Sample random craters patterns obtained for different powers (40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%) are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1a. A 100% power is associated with a maximum power of 20 W. With a peak power of 10 W, repetition frequency 20 kHz, and pulse width of 20 ns, P avg is 40 mW, corresponding to a laser fluence of 0.25 J/cm 2. The higher the average power, the larger the ablated radius. To enable high data capacity within a defined area, many craters are required. Therefore, ablated patterns with smaller radii were considered to correspond to a P avg of 40 mW, which is just above the threshold laser fluence of 0.2 J/cm 2. The random craters patterns obtained for different frequencies (5 kHz, 10 kHz, 15 kHz, 20 kHz, and 25 kHz) are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1b. With an increase in the repetition frequency, the density of the randomly ablated patterns increases. To obtain a distinguishable group of ablated patterns that enable easy image processing, crater patterns corresponding to a frequency of 20 kHz were selected. H t D and RA parameters are tuned as per the laser-ablated pattern size. A smaller pattern size requires a smaller H t D and RA for a high density of patterns in a unit area.

### Aortic root dimensions among patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^82064049]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to characterize aortic root dimensions of patients with aortic valve stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and to evaluate sex differences.

Background

The advent of TAVR makes a precise delineation of the aortic root anatomy mandatory and requires a profound anatomic understanding.

Methods

Patients planned to undergo TAVR underwent screening imaging with use of a 64-slice or dual-source electrocardiogram-gated contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Anatomic dimensions were assessed at the level of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), annulus, sinus of Valsalva, and ascending aorta.

Results

The study population comprised 80 men and 97 women (age: 82 ± 6 years) with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. Multislice computed tomography aortic root assessment revealed larger annular and LVOT dimensions in men than women (area annulus: 483.1 ± 75.6 mm(2) vs. 386.9 ± 58.5 mm(2), p = 0.0002; area LVOT: 478.2 ± 131.0 mm(2) vs. 374.0 ± 94.2 mm(2), p = 0.0024), whereas dimensions of the ascending aorta were comparable. Both LVOT and annulus were predominantly oval without sex differences, with a higher mean ellipticity index for the LVOT compared with the annulus (1.49 ± 0.2 vs. 1.29 ± 0.1); the ascending aorta was primarily circular (1.07 ± 0.1). Although similar in mean surface area, an area mismatch of annulus and LVOT of more than 10%, 20%, and 40% was detected in 42, 9, and 2 patients, respectively. The mean distance from annulus to the left coronary ostium was smaller than the mean distance of the right coronary ostium (14.4 ± 3.6 mm vs. 16.7 ± 3.6 mm), and distances were lower among women than men.

Conclusions

The aortic root has specific anatomic characteristics, which affect device design, selection, and clinical outcome in patients undergoing TAVR. Female sex is associated with smaller annular and LVOT but not aortic dimensions. The degree of ellipticity as well as a significant mismatch between annular and LVOT dimensions in selected patients deserve careful evaluation.

### Ocean submesoscales as a key component of the global heat budget [^cc86fafe]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Global patterns of submesoscale vertical heat transport

The enhancement of the near-surface vertical heat transport by submesoscales is ubiquitous over the global ocean (Fig. 3). This heat transport is systematically upward (upgradient): it acts to produce a surface warming and a deeper cooling, intensified in winter. In the wintertime Southern Hemisphere, large submesoscale heat fluxes at 40-m depth cover most of the region between 20°S and 60°S (Fig. 3b), where 66% and 5% of ocean area has amplitudes larger than 20 W/m 2 and 100 W/m 2, respectively. At 200-m depth, submesoscale fluxes retain their large amplitudes and mostly cover the 35°–60°S latitude band (Fig. 3d), where 48% and 10% of ocean area here has amplitudes larger than 20 W/m 2 and 100 W/m 2, respectively. Large submesoscale heat fluxes also occur in the wintertime Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 3a, c). These are strongest in the 20°–40°N band, where 65% and 11% of ocean area has amplitudes larger than 20 W/m 2 and 100 W/m 2, respectively, at 40 m depth. Similar amplitudes also occur in the Atlantic subpolar and polar gyres (40°–60°N), where 61% and 19% of ocean area has amplitudes larger than 20 W/m 2 and 100 W/m 2, respectively, at 200 m depth. During the summer, submesoscale fluxes are still positive but have a smaller amplitude and more limited spatial coverage. Only the region between 40°–60°S, as well as 40°–60°N in the Atlantic, still have significant submesoscale fluxes, where 32% and 46% of the area in these respective latitude bands have amplitudes larger than 10 W/m 2 at 200 m depth (Fig. 3c, d).

### Recommendations for measuring pulmonary nodules at CT: a statement from the Fleischner society [^fec2f01b]. Radiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Fleischner Society pulmonary nodule CT measurement — method and size thresholds: For purposes of risk estimation, the dimension of small pulmonary nodules (< 10 mm) should be expressed as the average of maximal long-axis and perpendicular maximal short-axis measurements in the same plane. For larger nodules and masses (≥ 10 mm), long- and short-axis measurements should be recorded. In practical terms, we recommend that the long-axis diameter of a nodule be determined first and that thereafter, on the same CT section, the short axis be measured perpendicular to the long axis. As illustrated, the maximal long-axis diameter is measured (16 mm) and the maximum short-axis diameter is measured (14 mm), yielding an average diameter of 15 mm.

### Delineation of two intracranial areas and the perpendicular intracranial width is sufficient for intracranial volume estimation [^39269428]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the present study is to determine if the delineation of one or two optimally chosen intracranial areas (ICA) is enough to achieve adequate estimates of intracranial volume (ICV) in magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods

The correlations of 62 fully delineated ICVs with four types of ICV estimates were calculated. The estimate types were: (1) a single midsagittal ICA, (2) single ICA multiplied by the intracranial width perpendicular to the ICA, (3) sum of two ICAs multiplied by the perpendicular intracranial width and (4) shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation using two ICAs. For methods 2–4, the fully delineated ICVs were randomly separated into an evaluation and a validation set of equal size. Method 1 was validated against all of the fully delineated ICVs.

Results

Estimates from method 1 had a Pearson correlation of 0.904 with fully delineated ICV. For method 2, the correlation was 0.986 when delineating the sagittal ICA at 31% of the sagittal intracranial width. For methods 3 and 4, the correlations were both 0.997 when delineating the sagittal ICAs at 17.5 and 64% and at 12 and 64% respectively.

Conclusions

Delineation of two specific intracranial areas is sufficient for intracranial volume estimation.

Main Messages

- Delineation of two specific intracranial areas is sufficient for intracranial volume estimation.
- The estimates had a Pearson correlation of 0.997 with intracranial volume.
- The estimation should take no more than 5 min.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Tuned exchange imaging: can the filter exchange imaging pulse sequence be adapted for applications with thin slices and restricted diffusion? [^b3fc6e25]. NMR in Biomedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

3.3 | Monte Carlo simulations

To explore the effects of crusher gradients and the efficiency of mitigating the bias they cause in estimating exchange rates, we used Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in substrates of equally sized and hexagonally packed spheres and cylinders with diameters in the range 1–11 μm. Spheres with radii drawn from the Gamma distribution were also considered. All substrates were defined using periodic boundary conditions and the repeating unit of the Gamma-distributed spheres contained at least 1000 cells to reduce variability due to randomness. The intracellular and extracellular spaces were populated with equal numbers of particles.

The diffusion process was simulated as a random walk with fixed step lengthsin random directionssuch that the particle trajectory was generated bywhereis the position of the particle at timeandis the temporal resolution related to the step length viawhereis the bulk diffusivity andis the number of spatial dimensions. Particle–boundary intersections were detected by — at each step — computing the Euclidian distance between the center of the closest cell (sphere or cylinder) and the current particle position. The closest cell was determined using a predefined lookup table. Exchange was implemented by allowing particles to occasionally cross the boundaries with a probability given by – whereis the membrane permeability. A relationship betweenand the desired exchange rate was obtained by, for a given value of, performing a unique simulation in which all particles were initialized in the intracellular compartment and allowed to exit without return. The intra-to-extracellular exchange ratewas obtained by fitting the following function to the intracellular population

This procedure was repeated with all particles initialized in the extracellular compartment to yield. The exchange rate at the current value ofwas then given by. The outcome was a calibration curve relatingto. Note that this way of relating an input permeability to the resulting exchange rate is equivalent to the more commonly usedwhereis the surface-to-volume ratio. However, the calibration approach is more versatile because it can be used in complex geometries where the surface-to-volume ratio is difficult to determine. The membrane permeabilitywas varied to yield exchange rates in the range 0–20 s -1. For each combination of cell size and exchange rate, the diffusion-weighted signal was evaluated usingwhereis the total number of particles andis the accumulated phase over timegiven bywhere "·" denotes inner product, is the gyromagnetic ratio, andis the diffusion encoding gradient waveform with total duration.
