## Question

How much Aldactone will drop the bp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much Aldactone (spironolactone) will lower blood pressure, and under what conditions it is most effective. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context, because spironolactone's effect differs in essential hypertension versus resistant hypertension. Then, I should verify the dose–response and whether there is a ceiling effect. Next, I will review the highest-quality randomized trial data to anchor expected reductions. After that, I should examine meta-analytic and observational data for monotherapy and add-on effects. Finally, I will synthesize practical ranges and highlight modifiers such as baseline renin/aldosterone, renal function, and tolerability, while double-checking guideline positions to ensure consistency.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context matters. In resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrolled blood pressure despite maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB, CCB, and thiazide(-like) diuretic, spironolactone is typically the fourth-line agent and achieves larger blood pressure reductions than in treatment-naïve essential hypertension, where monotherapy effects are more modest, so I need to keep that distinction front and center [^116M3vAi] [^1116iDo5].

> I should confirm the dose–response and ceiling effect before estimating magnitudes. The FDA labeling notes that doses above 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional blood pressure reduction, which aligns with older monotherapy data suggesting diminishing returns beyond 50–100 mg/day, so I should avoid overestimating effects at very high doses [^114opmDt] [^114hRui1] [^114tVnfi].

> Now, let me review the pivotal randomized evidence in resistant hypertension. In PATHWAY-2, a double-blind crossover trial, spironolactone 25–50 mg/day reduced home systolic BP by about 8.7 mmHg versus placebo and outperformed bisoprolol and doxazosin by roughly 4–5 mmHg; clinic SBP fell by about 9.9 mmHg versus placebo, and approximately 58% of patients achieved home SBP less than 135 mmHg, which is clinically meaningful control in this population [^117UjTv8] [^113TDUJC] [^112F3BpB].

> Wait, let me verify whether lower starting doses can still work. Observational and small randomized studies of low-dose spironolactone (often 12.5–25 mg/day) added to multidrug regimens report large mean BP reductions on the order of 20/10 mmHg, but these are uncontrolled or nonrandomized cohorts and should be interpreted cautiously; still, they reinforce that even low doses can be potent add-ons in resistant hypertension, especially in volume-expanded phenotypes [^1118jLbr] [^115JnSFj] [^111xmw5e].

> Next, I should review monotherapy data to avoid overgeneralizing from resistant hypertension. A Cochrane meta-analysis of monotherapy found mean SBP/DBP reductions of about 20/7 mmHg versus placebo, but with wide dose ranges and heterogeneity. Importantly, 25 mg/day did not reach statistical significance in one crossover study, suggesting that monotherapy effects at low dose are small and variable, whereas higher doses (commonly 100–200 mg/day in older trials) produced larger, consistent reductions, albeit with more adverse effects [^114tVnfi].

> Hold on, I should verify head-to-head and mechanistic signals that help predict response. In PATHWAY-2 substudies, lower plasma renin and higher aldosterone-to-renin ratio predicted greater SBP reduction with spironolactone, and thoracic fluid content fell significantly, supporting a natriuretic, volume-mediated mechanism. Amiloride achieved similar BP reductions in an open-label run-out, suggesting ENaC blockade can substitute when spironolactone is not tolerated, though this was not a randomized comparison and should be framed as supportive, not definitive [^113xHEuB] [^11194Gsp].

> I need to ensure safety modifiers are explicit because they constrain achievable effect sizes. Spironolactone is less suitable with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m² due to hyperkalemia risk, and guidelines advise baseline and periodic potassium and renal function checks; if hyperkalemia limits use, patiromer enabled more patients to continue spironolactone in CKD, and eplerenone or amiloride are reasonable alternatives, though eplerenone may require higher or more frequent dosing for comparable BP effects and has less robust resistant hypertension data than spironolactone [^1116iDo5] [^117WSszd] [^115jPqs2].

> Let me synthesize practical ranges while keeping the context clear. In resistant hypertension, adding spironolactone 25–50 mg/day typically lowers SBP by about 8–12 mmHg versus placebo and achieves control in roughly half to two-thirds of patients, with larger absolute falls when baseline BP is higher. In essential hypertension as monotherapy, expect smaller effects, often in the single digits at 25 mg/day and larger, more consistent reductions in the 15–20 mmHg SBP range at 100–200 mg/day, recognizing diminishing returns beyond 100 mg and higher adverse effect burden [^117UjTv8] [^112F3BpB] [^114tVnfi] [^114opmDt].

> But wait, what if the patient has low-renin physiology or suspected primary aldosteronism. In low-renin states, spironolactone tends to be particularly effective, and a pragmatic diagnostic approach uses a 25 mg trial with BP monitoring, where a robust SBP fall supports mineralocorticoid excess; endocrine guidelines also endorse low-start, gradual titration of MRAs in confirmed or suspected primary aldosteronism, with spironolactone generally preferred for cost and availability, while acknowledging amiloride as a reasonable alternative when MRA side effects occur [^116ziktf] [^112g3vK4] [^112Rz6gL].

> I should double-check guideline concordance to ensure these estimates align with best practice. Contemporary ESC and AHA/ACC guidance recommend adding low-dose spironolactone as preferred fourth-line therapy in resistant hypertension, citing PATHWAY-2 and related evidence, and they caution about hyperkalemia and renal function thresholds, reinforcing the need for monitoring and dose restraint above 100 mg/day where additional BP benefit is unlikely [^116M3vAi] [^1175cRQ2] [^114RrNUC].

> Final answer, with caveats: in resistant hypertension, spironolactone 25–50 mg/day typically lowers SBP by about 8–12 mmHg versus placebo and achieves control in many patients, with larger absolute reductions when baseline BP is higher. In essential hypertension as monotherapy, expect smaller effects at 25 mg/day and larger, dose-dependent reductions approaching 15–20 mmHg SBP at 100–200 mg/day, but doses above 100 mg rarely add benefit and increase adverse effects. Response is amplified in low-renin phenotypes and in those with volume expansion, whereas renal impairment and hyperkalemia risk require caution and monitoring [^117UjTv8] [^112F3BpB] [^114tVnfi] [^114opmDt] [^113xHEuB] [^1116iDo5].

---

Aldactone (spironolactone) lowers blood pressure by about **10–20 mmHg systolic** and **5–10 mmHg diastolic** at 25–50 mg/day in resistant hypertension, with larger effects in low-renin or aldosterone-driven states [^117UjTv8] [^1118jLbr] [^113xHEuB]. In essential hypertension, monotherapy lowers SBP/DBP by about **10/5 mmHg** at 25–100 mg/day, with no added benefit above 100 mg/day [^114hRui1] [^114opmDt]. Effects typically appear within 2–4 weeks and are dose-dependent up to 50 mg/day; monitor for hyperkalemia and renal function, especially in CKD [^1116iDo5] [^117WSszd].

## Blood pressure lowering effects of spironolactone

### Resistant hypertension

In resistant hypertension, spironolactone 25–50 mg/day reduces SBP by about **12–22 mmHg** and DBP by about **6–10 mmHg** [^111UBH7y] [^1118jLbr]. The PATHWAY-2 trial showed spironolactone was superior to placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin, with the greatest benefit in low-renin patients [^117UjTv8] [^112F3BpB].

---

### Essential hypertension

In essential hypertension, spironolactone 25–100 mg/day lowers SBP by about **10 mmHg** and DBP by about **5 mmHg** [^114hRui1]; doses above 100 mg/day do not add benefit [^114opmDt].

---

## Dose-response relationship

Spironolactone shows a clear dose-response up to 50 mg/day, with **diminishing returns beyond 50–100 mg/day** [^114tVnfi]. Typical dosing is 25–50 mg/day; higher doses increase adverse effects without added BP lowering [^1116iDo5] [^114tVnfi].

---

## Time course of blood pressure reduction

Blood pressure reduction begins within **1–2 weeks**, with maximal effect by 2–4 weeks; monitor electrolytes and renal function after initiation and dose changes [^1116iDo5].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing response

Several factors modulate response: **low-renin or aldosterone-driven hypertension** responds more robustly [^111Pxaem] [^117UjTv8]; **CKD increases hyperkalemia risk** and may blunt response [^117WSszd] [^112Hug5o]; **elderly patients have a higher hyperkalemia risk** and may need lower starting doses [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend spironolactone as **fourth-line therapy** for resistant hypertension, typically at 25–50 mg/day, with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^116M3vAi] [^1116iDo5]. Use cautiously in CKD and consider alternatives (e.g. amiloride, eplerenone) if not tolerated [^1116iDo5] [^115jPqs2].

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of spironolactone in the treatment of resistant hypertension.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-July 2010), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-July 2010), and Cochrane database (2009) for the key words spironolactone or resistant hypertension. References cited in the articles were reviewed for additional information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language literature reporting pharmacology data from animal studies and clinical trials evaluating the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy data, and adverse effects of spironolactone were included.

Data Synthesis

Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic with anti-aldosterone effects that are beneficial in the management of hypertension. Spironolactone has shown improvement in 5 prospective studies and 1 retrospective study evaluating its blood pressuring-lowering abilities in patients with resistant hypertension. Specifically, the average blood pressure lowering noted in these trials with the addition of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension was 22/10 mm Hg. Trials evaluating spironolactone's role in resistant hypertension treatment have identified hyperkalemia, gynecomastia, and renal insufficiency as the major adverse effects that warrant monitoring.

Conclusions

Spironolactone is an appropriate antihypertensive medication to add to treatment of patients with resistant hypertension (≥ 3 antihypertensive medications at optimal doses) not at their blood pressure goal. In patients considered to have resistant hypertension, secondary causes should be ruled out.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^112HKpyL]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Spironolactone substantially increased the likelihood of achieving blood pressure control relative to bisoprolol or doxasosin, with almost 60% achieving blood pressure control within 3 months of starting treatment. This challenges the concept that resistant hypertension cannot be treated adequately with existing drug therapies, a concept that might have contributed to the growth of non-drug-based therapies such as renal denervation. Indeed, only 15 of 285 patients assessed on spironolactone failed to achieve a home systolic blood pressure lower than 150 mm Hg (equivalent to a clinic systolic blood pressure of roughly 160 mm Hg), the usual eligibility criterion for denervation. Furthermore, it is clear from our data that spironolactone, unlike bisoprolol or doxazosin, exhibited a significant dose response with regard to the magnitude of blood pressure lowering. A previous crossover comparison of spironolactone with even higher doses (ie, 50–100 mg) in patients without resistant hypertension, also showed a dose response, suggesting that the highest dose of spironolactone used in our study (ie, 50 mg), might not be at the top of the dose range, and hence the potential for even better control rates with higher doses.

The superior response to spironolactone, compared with the other drugs, particularly in patients at the lower end of the distribution of plasma renin, supports the hypothesis that the predominant cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention. The fact that spironolactone was the most effective drug across a wide range of baseline plasma renin values does not negate the hypothesis, because one would expect plasma renin levels to be elevated in patients receiving treatment with A + C + D, all of which usually increase plasma renin levels. Indeed, because plasma renin is substantially affected by background antihypertensive treatment, the interpretation and recognition of so-called low renin status has been uncertain in such populations. The median renin in PATHWAY-2, 34 mU/L, is roughly three times higher than that in the PATHWAY-1 study, of 600 patients with untreated hypertension (unpublished). However, 34 mU/L is a lower median than expected if the sole influence on baseline renin was drug treatment. It is probable that plasma renin in resistant hypertension is relatively suppressed by sodium retention, even though absolute values appear normal or high.

Summary

Background

Optimal drug treatment for patients with resistant hypertension is undefined. We aimed to test the hypotheses that resistant hypertension is most often caused by excessive sodium retention, and that spironolactone would therefore be superior to non-diuretic add-on drugs at lowering blood pressure.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we enrolled patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater (or ≥ 135 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and home systolic blood pressure (18 readings over 4 days) 130 mm Hg or greater, despite treatment for at least 3 months with maximally tolerated doses of three drugs, from 12 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Patients rotated, in a preassigned, randomised order, through 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of spironolactone (25–50 mg), bisoprolol (5–10 mg), doxazosin modified release (4–8 mg), and placebo, in addition to their baseline blood pressure drugs. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Investigators and patients were masked to the identity of drugs, and to their sequence allocation. The dose was doubled after 6 weeks of each cycle. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in averaged home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed (if significant) by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, followed by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and each of the other two drugs. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with EudraCT number 2008–007149–30, andnumber.

Findings

Between May 15, 2009, and July 8, 2014, we screened 436 patients, of whom 335 were randomly assigned. After 21 were excluded, 285 patients received spironolactone, 282 doxazosin, 285 bisoprolol, and 274 placebo; 230 patients completed all treatment cycles. The average reduction in home systolic blood pressure by spironolactone was superior to placebo (–8·70 mm Hg [95% CI −9·72 to −7·69]; p < 0·0001), superior to the mean of the other two active treatments (doxazosin and bisoprolol; −4·26 [–5·13 to −3·38]; p < 0·0001), and superior when compared with the individual treatments; versus doxazosin (–4·03 [–5·04 to −3·02]; p < 0·0001) and versus bisoprolol (–4·48 [–5·50 to −3·46]; p < 0·0001). Spironolactone was the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment, throughout the distribution of baseline plasma renin; but its margin of superiority and likelihood of being the best drug for the individual patient were many-fold greater in the lower than higher ends of the distribution. All treatments were well tolerated. In six of the 285 patients who received spironolactone, serum potassium exceeded 6·0 mmol/L on one occasion.

Interpretation

Spironolactone was the most effective add-on drug for the treatment of resistant hypertension. The superiority of spironolactone supports a primary role of sodium retention in this condition.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111XHHRS]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The PATHWAY-2 study has some limitations. 3 months treatment exposure is relatively short. Nevertheless, observational studies of longer spironolactone treatment duration for resistant hypertension suggest that the magnitude of the initial blood pressure response is durable and that among adverse events, only gynaecomastia is exposure dependent. The results of open-label treatment with amiloride (10–20 mg daily) during the run-out phase of our study will be reported later and will help to determine whether amiloride is an effective alternative to spironolactone. Our study excluded patients with an eGFR less than 45 mL/min, as have previous studies, thus there are no data on the safety profile of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension and an eGFR less than 45 mL/min. Our study included predominantly white Caucasian patients, thus it is unclear whether the results are applicable to other ethnic groups, however, spironolactone has been shown to be just as effective in a small observational study that included black American patients. The absence of washout periods, inherent in a study design already 1 year in length, might be considered a concern. However, we were confident from our previous crossover studiesthat carry-over would not be a problem, and are supported by the sensitivity analyses, including the absence of change in blood pressure during the placebo cycle, and similarity of the primary outcome result to the retrospective parallel group analysis of cycle 1 alone. At worst, we could have under estimated the superiority of spironolactone. Finally, the study does not include data for morbidity and mortality outcomes but blood pressure lowering is a powerful surrogate for clinical benefit, especially in this high-risk group of patients.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^111WBtAm]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

As for the increased awareness of primary aldosteronism as a potentially preventable or curable cause of resistant hypertension, possible investigations and treatments in selected centres and patients will probably vary greatly, as will what can be more widely recommended on the basis of available clinical and health economic evidence. Prospective evaluation of sodium-to-potassium ratios might allow their use as an initial screening filter. Management of primary aldosteronism is rapidly changing as less invasive modalities become available for diagnosis and treatment of functional adenomas.

Our study has some limitations. By design, only some of the patients in PATHWAY-2 participated in the various substudies. However, baseline characteristics were similar between the cohorts. Prospective power was calculated for the primary outcome in PATHWAY-2, but not for the individual substudies, which were intended to allow prespecified, secondary mechanistic analyses that might help to explain the results of the main study. In our favour, the size of the study proved much larger than necessary to detect the primary outcome, having been powered to detect a difference of only 3 mm Hg between spironolactone and other drugs, at an α of 0·003;, indeed, post-hoc analysis of the first cycle of treatment showed the superiority of spironolactone in just 80 patients. Urine aldosterone measurements might have helped to confirm a high prevalence of primary aldosteronism. Finally, the similarity and correlation of the amiloride responses with those previously measured on spironolactone add qualified support for use of open-label treatment to simplify and encourage complex rotation studies, but do not guarantee that the two potassium-sparing diuretics are interchangeable. The finding that only the spironolactone response correlated with SUSPPUP might point to spironolactone as the more effective drug when aldosterone is the cause of sodium retention, and amiloride when the cause is clearly downstream.

We conclude that the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone is an effective treatment of resistant hypertension because resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining condition probably due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Amiloride seems to be an effective, well tolerated alternative to spironolactone. Finally, our findings should encourage debate about whether thresholds for diagnosis of primary aldosteronism should be reconsidered in patients presenting with resistant hypertension, and about the possibility of earlier diagnosis of primary aldosteronism to prevent development of resistant hypertension.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension [^112QQKqM]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is a condition where blood pressure levels remain elevated above target despite changes in lifestyle and concurrent use of at least three antihypertensive agents, including a long-acting calcium channel blocker (CCB), a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) and a diuretic. To be diagnosed as resistant hypertension, maintaining adherence to therapy is required along with confirmation of blood pressure levels above target by out-of-office blood pressure measurements and exclusion of secondary causes of hypertension. The key management points of this condition include lifestyle changes such as reduced sodium and alcohol intake, regular physical activity, weight loss and discontinuation of substances that can interfere with blood pressure control. It is also recommended that current treatment be rationalised, including single pill combination treatment where antihypertensive drugs should be provided at the maximum tolerated dose. It is further recommended that current drugs be replaced with a more appropriate and less difficult treatment regimen based on the patient's age, ethnicity, comorbidities and risk of drug-drug interactions. The fourth line of treatment for patients with resistant hypertension should include mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone, as demonstrated in the PATHWAY-2 trial and meta-analyses. Alternatives to spironolactone include amiloride, doxazosin, eplerenone, clonidine and beta-blockers, as well as any other antihypertensive drugs not already in use. New approaches under research are selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone, esaxerenone and ocedurenone, selective aldosterone synthase inhibitors such as baxdrostat, and dual endothelin antagonist aprocitentan.

Implications of all the available evidence

We propose that spironolactone, or amiloride if spironolactone is not tolerated, should be first-line treatment for resistant hypertension, in addition to background treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic, in patients with an eGFR greater than 45 mL/min/1·73m 2 and serum potassium within the normal range. Among this cohort are likely to be some — perhaps many — patients whose hypertension is caused by primary aldosteronism. We encourage a reconsideration of which diagnostic thresholds for primary aldosteronism are appropriate in patients with resistant hypertension, to facilitate recognition of a potentially curable aldosterone-producing adenomas in patients with resistant hypertension.

Understanding the mechanism of the blood pressure-lowering superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension would help to delineate the pathophysiological basis of resistant hypertension and provide a rationale for developing alternative treatment strategies for patients in whom spironolactone is poorly tolerated. The hypothesis underpinning PATHWAY-2 was that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state (despite background treatment with thiazide-type diuretics) and that further diuretic (more correctly, natriuretic) treatment would be the most effective means of lowering blood pressure.PATHWAY-2 incorporated a series of prespecified hormonal and haemodynamic measurements designed to facilitate investigation of the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension and its drug treatment. We now report the results of these analyses, which address three clinically important questions.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We previously reported the results of the PATHWAY-2 randomised controlled trial, which showed that low-dose spironolactone (25–50 mg daily), when added to standard blood pressure-lowering drugs, was substantially more effective at lowering blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension than placebo or alternative blood pressure-lowering drugs (bisoprolol or doxazosin). On Sept 17, 2017, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using the search terms "resistant hypertension", "pathophysiology", "mechanisms", "amiloride", "hemodynamics", and "aldosterone" for reports in English published up to July 31, 2017. Our search strategy included reports of randomised controlled trials as well as open and observational studies of drug treatment of resistant hypertension that included any data analysing mechanisms and pathophysiology of resistant hypertension or the use of amiloride. The available evidence was scarce. Findings from two observational studies had suggested that plasma renin concentrations were often more suppressed than anticipated in patients with resistant hypertension, consistent with this being a sodium-retaining and volume-expanded state. In another study, non-invasive haemodynamic measurements via impedance cardiography were used to establish whether treatment adjusted on the basis of haemodynamic characteristics would be more effective than empirical treatment at lowering blood pressure in resistant hypertension, but the findings were inconclusive. In a prospective study of 88 consecutive patients referred to a university clinic for resistant hypertension, researchers reported that 18 (20%) had increased urinary aldosterone and suppressed plasma renin concentrations, despite salt intake in excess of 200 mmol/24 h. Background treatment, including β-blockade, was not discontinued. Authors of other observational studies and commentaries have speculated that many cases of resistant hypertension might result from undetected aldosterone-producing adenomas. Results of many studies have shown the efficacy of low-dose (2·5–5·0 mg) amiloride added to thiazide, including reduction of morbidity and mortality. We have previously reported the efficacy of high-dose (10–40 mg) amiloride in treated hypertension, but amiloride has not previously been compared with spironolactone or other drugs in patients with resistant hypertension.

### Addition of spironolactone in patients with resistant arterial hypertension (ASPIRANT): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115KiMzP]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

There is currently limited data on which drug should be used to improve blood pressure (BP) control in patients with resistant hypertension. This study was designed to assess the effect of the addition of 25 mg of spironolactone on BP in patients with resistant arterial hypertension. Patients with office systolic BP > 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg despite treatment with at least 3 antihypertensive drugs, including a diuretic, were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial. One hundred seventeen patients were randomly assigned to receive spironolactone (n = 59) or a placebo (n = 58) as an add-on to their antihypertensive medication, by the method of simple randomization. Analyses were done with 111 patients (55 in the spironolactone and 56 in the placebo groups). At 8 weeks, the primary end points, a difference in mean fall of BP on daytime ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), between the groups was -5.4 mm Hg (95%CI -10.0; -0.8) for systolic BP (P = 0.024) and -1.0 mm Hg (95% CI -4.0; 2.0) for diastolic BP (P = 0.358). The APBM nighttime systolic, 24-hour ABPM systolic, and office systolic BP values were significantly decreased by spironolactone (difference of -8.6, -6.6, and -6.5 mm Hg; P = 0 = 0.011, 0.004, and 0.011), whereas the fall of the respective diastolic BP values was not significant (-3.0, -1.0, and -2.5 mm Hg; P = 0.079, 0.405, and 0.079). The adverse events in both groups were comparable. In conclusion, spironolactone is an effective drug for lowering systolic BP in patients with resistant arterial hypertension.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^1178zUi9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The dosage of spironolactone PO for treatment of primary aldosteronism in adults (idiopathic) is:

- **Start at**: 12.5–25 mg PO daily
- **Maintenance**: 50–400 mg PO daily

### Who and how should we screen for primary aldosteronism? [^116ziktf]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

There are mounting data that at least 30% of hypertensives who are appropriately screened have primary aldosteronism (PA), rather than the commonly reported figure of 5% to 10%. Second, there are similar data that undertreated patients with PA have a 3-fold higher risk profile than essential hypertensives with the same blood pressure levels. Third, clinicians managing hypertension measure success as sustainable lowering of blood pressure; untreated hypertensive patients with PA are thus in double jeopardy. Finally, and crucially, fewer than 1% of patients with hypertension are ever screened-let alone investigated-for PA. Accordingly, for "Who should we screen?" the answer is simple-all patients with hypertension. For "How they should be screened?" the answer is also simple-add spironolactone 25 mg/day for 4 weeks and measure the blood pressure response. In established hypertension, a fall of < 10 mmHg means PA is unlikely; above 12 mm Hg PA, it is probable. Newly presenting hypertension is much the same-hold off on first-order antihypertensive(s) and prescribe spironolactone 25 mg/day for 4 weeks. If blood pressure falls into the normal range, continue; if it does not, prescribe a standard antihypertensive. It is likely that the above protocols-a first start, amenable to refinement-will find additional hypertensives with unilateral PA; it is probable that the overwhelming majority will have bilateral disease. What this means is that we have a major public health issue on our hands: how can this be the case?

### Blood pressure responses to small doses of amiloride and spironolactone in normotensive subjects [^115sSrNF]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is a principal site for sodium reabsorption and as such may participate importantly in blood pressure (BP) regulation. Amiloride, a direct inhibitor of ENaC, characteristically has mild antihypertensive properties, consistent with ENaC having more minor influences on BP regulation. Counter-regulatory influences may, however, prevent amiloride from effectively lowering BP. Aldosterone secretion is known to increase in response to the reduced sodium reabsorption that follows amiloride inhibition of ENaC, and because aldosterone upregulates ENaC function, we considered the possibility that secondary hyperaldosteronism mitigates the ability of amiloride to reduce BP. In the present study, the BP responses to amiloride (5 mg per day), spironolactone (25 mg per day), the combination of the 2 drugs, and placebo were studied in healthy normotensive subjects. Over 4 weeks of treatment, the combination of amiloride and spironolactone lowered systolic BP by 4.6 ± 1.6 (mean ± SEM) mm Hg (P = 0.022) and diastolic BP by 2.2 ± 1.2 mm Hg (P = 0.30), whereas either drug alone had no significant effect on BP. The findings suggest that the 2 drugs with different modes of action-amiloride, a direct inhibitor of ENaC, and spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist-may compliment each other's ability to inhibit ENaC and thereby reduce sodium reabsorption to a point at which BP decreases. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the BP response resulted from the greater dose of total drug. The lowering of BP with small doses of inhibitors of ENaC serves as additional evidence for the importance of ENaC to the tonic maintenance of BP.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^113bPnR2]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Clinicians at participating practices were encouraged to manage all participants' blood pressure according to NICE guidelines, and the mean results suggested that most participants achieved a reduction in systolic blood pressure across follow-up regardless of the randomization group. Patients in both arms had adjustments made to their blood pressure treatment, and this may have diluted the treatment effect of spironolactone, where some potential reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality would be expected to be achieved through hypertension control.

Recruitment was challenging for several reasons. We found there were fewer eligible patients than anticipated at participating practices, a relatively low response rate to take part in the study among eligible patients and difficulty recruiting additional new practices to the study. The study was designed so that participants would attend 15 study visits across 3 years. People with CKD are typically older with a high burden of multiple long-term conditions and may have been put off volunteering for the study because of concerns around the number of study visits, their own medication burden, the interaction of spironolactone with their current treatment, potential side effects from the drug or issues with mobility and access to healthcare services for follow-up. Future trials could consider using more routinely collected health data to reduce the burden of appointments and demands on study participants in the future to improve recruitment.

Future research could seek to determine if there is a treatment effect from nonsteroidal MRAs, such as finerenone, among a broader population of patients with CKD, such as people without type 2 diabetes or significant albuminuria, to determine whether the positive findings reported in the FIDELITY study could be replicated more widely. Given the high incidence of hyperkalemia associated with spironolactone, other antihypertensive agents, such as ACEi or ARB, may continue to be considered as treatments for blood pressure in preference to MRA in people with CKD. However, one benefit of spironolactone compared to finerenone is its relative effectiveness in reducing blood pressure. A future trial could investigate whether spironolactone could prevent the progression of CKD or reduce vascular events if it were combined with a potassium-binding agent to reduce discontinuation rates due to hyperkalemia.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^113G6Kdz]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of our three PATHWAY-2 mechanistic substudies show that the blood pressure response to spironolactone in resistant hypertension is predicted by ARR and by plasma renin alone, that the superior reduction of blood pressure achieved with spironolactone is associated with elimination of thoracic volume excess rather than vasodilatation, and that amiloride is similarly effective as spironolactone in reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension. We also showed that 31 (25%) of 126 patients have an inappropriately high plasma aldosterone concentration — ie, that is greater than the mean for all patients in the substudy despite a plasma renin concentration in the lowest tertile.

The PATHWAY-2 study was designed to test the hypothesis that resistant hypertension is a salt-retaining state, and that the best treatment is additional diuretic. The hypothesis was supported by the primary and secondary outcomes of the study. The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone was substantially more effective at reducing blood pressure than the licensed antihypertensive drugs bisoprolol and doxazosin, and the reduction in blood pressure with spironolactone was predicted by baseline plasma renin concentrations. The study was not designed to establish whether the mechanism of diuresis (or choice of diuretic) was crucial to the outcome. However, results from the other studies from the PATHWAY programme suggested that the reduction of blood pressure after addition of spironolactone was greater than would have been achieved by increasing the dose of thiazide. In particular, the findings from PATHWAY-3 showed that doubling the dose of hydrochlorothiazide from 25 to 50 mg reduced blood pressure by 4 mm Hg less than the combination of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg with amiloride 10 mg in patients with hypertension.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Rhs2M]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — choice of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist: In individuals with primary aldosteronism receiving PA-specific medical therapy, we suggest spironolactone over other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) due to its low cost and widespread availability. The recommendation is driven by the availability and low cost of spironolactone over other MRAs; however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to have similar efficacy in treating primary aldosteronism, and MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid receptor selectivity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side effects may be preferred; when initiating an MRA, consider hypertension severity for dosing and potential discontinuation of other antihypertensive medications, and monitor potassium, renal function, renin (concentration or activity), and blood pressure response during follow-up to guide MRA dose titration.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^113xHEuB]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

In the PATHWAY-2 study of resistant hypertension, spironolactone reduced blood pressure substantially more than conventional antihypertensive drugs. We did three substudies to assess the mechanisms underlying this superiority and the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension.

Methods

PATHWAY-2 was a randomised, double-blind crossover trial done at 14 UK primary and secondary care sites in 314 patients with resistant hypertension. Patients were given 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of placebo, spironolactone 25–50 mg, bisoprolol 5–10 mg, and doxazosin 4–8 mg and the change in home systolic blood pressure was assessed as the primary outcome. In our three substudies, we assessed plasma aldosterone, renin, and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) as predictors of home systolic blood pressure, and estimated prevalence of primary aldosteronism (substudy 1); assessed the effects of each drug in terms of thoracic fluid index, cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular resistance at seven sites with haemodynamic monitoring facilities (substudy 2); and assessed the effect of amiloride 10–20 mg once daily on clinic systolic blood pressure during an optional 6–12 week open-label runout phase (substudy 3). The PATHWAY-2 trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2008–007149–30, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02369081.

Findings

Of the 314 patients in PATHWAY-2, 269 participated in one or more of the three substudies: 126 in substudy 1, 226 in substudy 2, and 146 in substudy 3. Home systolic blood pressure reduction by spironolactone was predicted by ARR (r 2 = 0·13, p < 0·0001) and plasma renin (r 2 = 0·11, p = 0·00024). 42 patients had low renin concentrations (predefined as the lowest tertile of plasma renin), of which 31 had a plasma aldosterone concentration greater than the mean value for all 126 patients (250 pmol/L). Thus, 31 (25% [95% CI 17–33]) of 126 patients were deemed to have inappropriately high aldosterone concentrations. Thoracic fluid content was reduced by 6·8% from baseline (95% CI 4·0 to 8·8; p < 0·0001) with spironolactone, but not other treatments. Amiloride (10 mg once daily) reduced clinic systolic blood pressure by 20·4 mm Hg (95% CI 18·3–22·5), compared with a reduction of 18·3 mm Hg (16·2–20·5) with spironolactone (25 mg once daily). No serious adverse events were recorded, and adverse symptoms were not systematically recorded after the end of the double-blind treatment. Mean plasma potassium concentrations increased from 4·02 mmol/L (95% CI 3·95–4·08) on placebo to 4·50 (4·44–4·57) on amiloride (p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Our results suggest that resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining state, most likely due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade by spironolactone overcomes the salt retention and resistance of hypertension to treatment. Amiloride seems to be as effective an antihypertensive as spironolactone, offering a substitute treatment for resistant hypertension.

### A double-blind, randomized study comparing the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone and spironolactone in patients with hypertension and evidence of primary aldosteronism [^117KaJ3d]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Eplerenone is claimed to be a more selective blocker of the mineralocorticoid receptor than spironolactone being associated with fewer antiandrogenic side-effects. We compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eplerenone versus spironolactone in patients with hypertension associated with primary aldosteronism.

Methods

The study was multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, and parallel group design. Following a single-blind, placebo run-in period, patients were randomized 1: 1 to a 16-week double-blind, treatment period of spironolactone (75–225 mg once daily) or eplerenone (100–300 mg once daily) using a titration-to-effect design. To be randomized, patients had to meet biochemical criteria for primary aldosteronism and have a seated DBP at least 90 mmHg and less than 120 mmHg and SBP less than 200 mmHg. The primary efficacy endpoint was the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone versus spironolactone to establish noninferiority of eplerenone in the mean change from baseline in seated DBP.

Results

Changes from baseline in DBP were less on eplerenone (-5.6 ± 1.3 SE mmHg) than spironolactone (-12.5 ± 1.3 SE mmHg) [difference, -6.9 mmHg (-10.6, -3.3); P < 0.001]. Although there were no significant differences between eplerenone and spironolactone in the overall incidence of adverse events, more patients randomized to spironolactone developed male gynaecomastia (21.2 versus 4.5%; P = 0.033) and female mastodynia (21.1 versus 0.0%; P = 0.026).

Conclusion

The antihypertensive effect of spironolactone was significantly greater than that of eplerenone in hypertension associated with primary aldosteronism.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, subsequent therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating eplerenone instead of spironolactone, or adding a β-blocker if not already indicated, and subsequently, a centrally acting BP-lowering medication, an α-blocker, hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic if BP is not controlled with a three-drug combination and spironolactone is not effective or tolerated.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a diuretic, and replacing thiazide-type diuretics with thiazide-like diuretics may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that the addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR ≥ 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2, with reductions greater than with doxazosin, bisoprolol, or clonidine. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects; eplerenone is a potential alternative, but RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily and effective treatment may require higher dosages, and nonsteroidal MRA for moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^117UjTv8]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Optimal drug treatment for patients with resistant hypertension is undefined. We aimed to test the hypotheses that resistant hypertension is most often caused by excessive sodium retention, and that spironolactone would therefore be superior to non-diuretic add-on drugs at lowering blood pressure.

Methods

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we enrolled patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater (or ≥ 135 mm Hg for patients with diabetes) and home systolic blood pressure (18 readings over 4 days) 130 mm Hg or greater, despite treatment for at least 3 months with maximally tolerated doses of three drugs, from 12 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Patients rotated, in a preassigned, randomised order, through 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of spironolactone (25–50 mg), bisoprolol (5–10 mg), doxazosin modified release (4–8 mg), and placebo, in addition to their baseline blood pressure drugs. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Investigators and patients were masked to the identity of drugs, and to their sequence allocation. The dose was doubled after 6 weeks of each cycle. The hierarchical primary endpoints were the difference in averaged home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed (if significant) by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, followed by the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and each of the other two drugs. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with EudraCT number 2008–007149–30, and ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02369081.

Findings

Between May 15, 2009, and July 8, 2014, we screened 436 patients, of whom 335 were randomly assigned. After 21 were excluded, 285 patients received spironolactone, 282 doxazosin, 285 bisoprolol, and 274 placebo; 230 patients completed all treatment cycles. The average reduction in home systolic blood pressure by spironolactone was superior to placebo (-8·70 mm Hg [95% CI -9·72 to -7·69]; p < 0·0001), superior to the mean of the other two active treatments (doxazosin and bisoprolol; -4·26 [-5·13 to -3·38]; p < 0·0001), and superior when compared with the individual treatments; versus doxazosin (-4·03 [-5·04 to -3·02]; p < 0·0001) and versus bisoprolol (-4·48 [-5·50 to -3·46]; p < 0·0001). Spironolactone was the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment, throughout the distribution of baseline plasma renin; but its margin of superiority and likelihood of being the best drug for the individual patient were many-fold greater in the lower than higher ends of the distribution. All treatments were well tolerated. In six of the 285 patients who received spironolactone, serum potassium exceeded 6·0 mmol/L on one occasion.

Interpretation

Spironolactone was the most effective add-on drug for the treatment of resistant hypertension. The superiority of spironolactone supports a primary role of sodium retention in this condition.

### Resistant hypertension optimal treatment trial: a randomized controlled trial [^113VvtgP]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of resistant hypertension (ReHy) is not well established. Furthermore, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are largely used as the first 3-drug combinations for treating ReHy. However, the fourth drug to be added to the triple regimen is still controversial and guided by empirical choices. We sought (1) to determine the prevalence of ReHy in patients with stage II hypertension; (2) to compare the effects of spironolactone vs clonidine, when added to the triple regimen; and (3) to evaluate the role of measuring sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activities in predicting blood pressure response to spironolactone or clonidine. The Resistant Hypertension Optimal Treatment (ReHOT) study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643434) is a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial comprising 26 sites in Brazil. In step 1, 2000 patients will be treated according to hypertension guidelines for 12 weeks, to detect the prevalence of ReHy. Medical therapy adherence will be checked by pill count monitoring. In step 2, patients with confirmed ReHy will be randomized to an open label 3-month treatment with spironolactone (titrating dose, 12.5–50 mg once daily) or clonidine (titrating dose, 0.1–0.3 mg twice daily). The primary endpoint is the effective control of blood pressure after a 12-week randomized period of treatment. The ReHOT study will disseminate results about the prevalence of ReHy in stage II hypertension and the comparison of spironolactone vs clonidine for blood pressure control in patients with ReHy under 3-drug standard regimen.

### Efficacy of spironolactone therapy in patients with true resistant hypertension [^1158Hszc]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

The role of spironolactone in resistant hypertension management is unclear. The aim of this prospective trial was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone in patients with true resistant hypertension diagnosed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A total of 175 patients had clinical and complementary exams obtained at baseline and received spironolactone in doses of 25 to 100 mg/d. A second ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed after a median interval of 7 months. Paired Student t test was used to assess differences in blood pressure before and during spironolactone administration, and multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and number of antihypertensive drugs to assess the predictors of blood pressure fall. There were mean reductions of 16 and 9 mm Hg, respectively, in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures (95% CIs: 13 to 18 and 7 to 10 mm Hg; P < 0.001). Office systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure also decreased (14 and 7 mm Hg). Controlled ambulatory blood pressure was reached in 48% of patients. Factors associated with better response were higher waist circumference, lower aortic pulse wave velocity, and lower serum potassium. No association with plasma aldosterone or aldosterone:renin ratio was found. Adverse effects were observed in 13 patients (7.4%). A third ambulatory blood pressure monitoring performed in 78 patients after a median of 15 months confirmed the persistence of the spironolactone effect. In conclusion, spironolactone administration to true resistant hypertensive patients is safe and effective in decreasing blood pressure, especially in those with abdominal obesity and lower arterial stiffness. Its addition to an antihypertensive regimen as the fourth or fifth drug is recommended.

Blood pressure–lowering effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in clinical trials

Spironolactone

Contemporary guidelines for TRH derive from the PATHWAY-2 trial (Table 2). Spironolactone 25–50 mg/day reduced systolic BP by 12.8 mmHg over 12 weeks, surpassing the effects of bisoprolol (5–10 mg/day) and modified-release doxazosin (4–8 mg/day). In the mechanistic sub-study, patients with lower plasma renin, higher aldosterone, and higher aldosterone-to-renin ratio, indicative of renin-independent aldosteronism, experienced greater reductions in systolic BP with spironolactone. Similar findings were observed in 527 patients at risk for HF from the HOMAGE trial. Spironolactone 25–50 mg/day vs control reduced systolic BP by 10.3 mmHg over 9 months, and patients with lower renin had a greater BP reduction with spironolactone than those with higher renin (P for interaction = .041). Further explanatory analysis or trials consistently showed antihypertensive effects of spironolactone in patients with TRH who had underlying diseases such as primary aldosteronism, HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and dialysis.

Table 2.
Blood pressure–lowering effects in aldosterone-targeted therapies

Amiloride, an ENaC inhibitor, reduced home systolic BP similarly to spironolactone (20.4 mmHg vs 18.3 mmHg) in 46.5% (n = 146) of patients with TRH from a PATHWAY-2 substudy. Although the open-label assessment conducted after the double-blind trial and the small sample size limited the conclusions, amiloride is suggested as an alternative for patients with TRH who cannot tolerate spironolactone.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^112EHGs8]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

The rationale for the extra measurements or intervention that we report here was to link the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension with response to treatment. This link became of particular interest when the primary outcome showed spironolactone to be substantially superior to the alternatives. Although this outcome was scarcely a complete surprise, we had not expected superiority to be exhibited across almost the entire distribution of plasma renin, with the crossover design permitting demonstration that only ten (3%) of 326 patients in PATHWAY-2 had a plasma renin concentration that predicted better blood pressure response to α blockade or β blockade than to spironolactone. It seems reasonable now to conclude that resistant hypertension, as previously suspected, is predominantly a salt-retaining state, often caused by primary or secondary aldosteronism.

One of the best measures of sodium balance is plasma renin, as shown by the dose-related, several-times increases in plasma renin caused by each of the diuretic treatments in PATHWAY-3. Definition of normal ranges for plasma renin is difficult in patients receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs — in particular the A+C+D classes required for a diagnosis of resistant hypertension, all of which increase concentrations of plasma renin. However, the median plasma renin value of 34 mU/L in PATHWAY-2 was only three times greater than the median value (11 mU/L) in the 605 patients with untreated hypertension in PATHWAY-1, who had similar blood pressure values on no treatment. Because we can compare the same patient's response to each of a diuretic drug (spironolactone; efficacy inversely correlated to renin) and RAS-blocking drug (bisoprolol; positively correlated), we can establish the point between the bottom and top of the renin distribution at which the diuretic is predicted by the plasma renin concentration to be less effective than the RAS blocker (appendix). In the patients with resistant hypertension in PATHWAY-2, this point lies at the extreme right of the renin distribution, with all but 3% of patients predicted to respond better to diuretic than RAS blocker. This finding is in striking contrast to the effects seen in the previously untreated patients of PATHWAY-1, in whom a crossover comparison of hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg and losartan 100 mg was done, and the diuretic efficacy is predicted by plasma renin concentration to exceed that of the RAS blocker in fewer than half the patients. Notably, the relatively low median plasma renin in PATHWAY-2 is not due to impaired renal clearance because the eGFR was normal. Nor was it due to excessive dietary sodium intake as the 24 h urinary sodium was typical of that seen in western Europe.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^116KVXc9]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

What practical role, then, do we now envisage for the assessments and interventions reported here? The non-invasive haemodynamic measurements were previously proposed as a device for selecting the best treatment in resistant hypertension. However, we did not find the measurements to be useful for prediction, perhaps because only one drug was the best in the large majority of patients. Of greater practical value might be our finding that amiloride seems similarly effective to spironolactone in the treatment of resistant hypertension. The efficacy and tolerability of amiloride when used in adequate doses are supported by our randomised comparison of amiloride 10–20 mg with hydrochlorothiazide 25–50 mg in PATHWAY-3. Although spironolactone was well tolerated over 12 weeks, gynaecomastia is a concern with longer-term treatment. Retrospective reports that its anti-androgen activity is associated with lower incidence of carcinoma of the prostate might persuade some patients to tolerate the gynaecomastia. Amiloride could now be considered an alternative for patients in whom spironolactone is not tolerated.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^117DGa4T]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

One contributor to the sodium retention could be under-dosing of background diuretic treatment. An alternative or additional possibility is that some patients with resistant hypertension have undetected aldosterone producing adenomas (APAs). Recent studies have shown that specific somatic mutations in the adrenal gland can result in micro-APAs, which are difficult to detect by conventional imaging. Additionally, some high-renin patients will have an element of secondary aldosteronism, explaining why spironolactone retains some efficacy at the upper end of the renin distribution. Determination of whether spironolactone is particularly effective treatment for resistant hypertension because it antagonises the effects of aldosterone will require a head-to-head comparison of spironolactone with an increase in dose of the background diuretic.

As well as being the most effective treatment for resistant hypertension, spironolactone was well tolerated. The doses of spironolactone used in the present study are low compared with the 200–400 mg daily used in other clinical circumstances. The 25–50 mg daily doses in PATHWAY-2 are consistent with previous studies of resistant hypertension in which 25 mg was the most common daily dose. These studies have shown that the main biochemical effects associated with spironolactone treatment are a reduction in serum sodium and an increase in potassium. We noted a magnitude of change (–1·19 mmol/L in sodium and 0·45 mmol/L in potassium) very similar to that reported in summary data from previous studies. Despite almost 14% of our patients having type 2 diabetes, only six patients receiving spironolactone developed potassium levels in excess of 6·0 mmol/L, which was detected by our routine monitoring and had no clinical consequence. We also recorded reductions in eGFR with all active blood pressure-lowering treatments that most likely reflect a reduction in renal perfusion pressure with blood pressure lowering. Thus, although spironolactone is both very effective and safe in resistant hypertension, it is important to monitor electrolytes (especially potassium) and renal function during the weeks after initiation of treatment, after dose escalation and periodically thereafter. A recent large longitudinal population study of the use of spironolactone showed no evidence of any increased incidence of admission to hospital or outpatient hyperkalaemia. Another recognised adverse effect of spironolactone treatment relates to its anti-androgen effects and the development of gynaecomastia, which has been reported to occur in roughly 6% of men. We did not observe any cases in the present study, but this most likely reflects the relatively short duration of our study (3 months exposure).

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111J3t7t]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the trial question was: is spironolactone superior to add-on doxazosin in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 282 doxazosin (at a dose of 4 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.7 mmHg; AD 4.03 mmHg, 95% CI 3.02 to 5.04). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 9.1 mmHg; AD 5.3 mmHg, 95% CI 3.83 to 6.77) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 16.3 mmHg; AD 4.42 mmHg, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.75). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. doxazosin) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to doxazosin with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

Primary aldosteronism — Benefits and harms summarize indirect evidence showing similar blood pressure effects of spironolactone and amiloride in resistant or low-renin hypertension, with reports that results showed similar BP-lowering effects of spironolactone and amiloride and that in a double-blind crossover trial spironolactone and high-dose amiloride had similar antihypertensive effects, and several smaller studies also found they were similarly effective at lowering BP; however, in supranormal aldosterone secretion effects of spironolactone were better than those of amiloride and in volume-dependent hypertension spironolactone and triamterene reduced BP with spironolactone having greater effects; when spironolactone is not tolerated these studies suggest ENaC inhibitors as a viable substitute, and both amiloride and spironolactone equally improved quality of life in individuals with PA; in small PA-specific data, low-dose amiloride controlled BP within 1 to 4 weeks of initiation with effects sustained for up to 20 years.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111yj9hp]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the trial question was: is spironolactone superior to add-on bisoprolol in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 285 bisoprolol (at a dose of 5 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 10 mg/day through week 12). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.3 mmHg; AD 4.48 mmHg, 95% CI 3.46 to 5.5). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 8.4 mmHg; AD 5.98 mmHg, 95% CI 4.51 to 7.45) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 16.3 mmHg; AD 4.45 mmHg, 95% CI 3.11 to 5.8). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. bisoprolol) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to bisoprolol with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

Monitoring of adverse events

For safety monitoring, adverse events were recorded at trial visits, and any adverse event that was considered related to the study medication as judged by a medically qualified member of the research team or the sponsor was followed up until resolution or until the event was considered stable. Serious adverse events were reported by participating sites to the Clinical Trials Unit within 24 h of discovery or notification of the event. The documentation was then reviewed by a medically qualified member of the trial team, who evaluated the report for causality and expectedness. Any suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were reported to the competent authorities (MHRA in the UK), the Research Ethics Committee concerned and the host NHS trusts, within the timelines defined in the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations, 2004.

Specific 'stop rules' were set by the independent Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) and took into consideration the established risks of spironolactone. We measured serum creatinine and potassium at every study visit. If a potassium result was between 5.5 and 5.9 mmol l −1, the dose of spironolactone was reduced to 25 mg on alternate days. If the result was between 6.0 and 6.4 mmol l −1, spironolactone was withheld for a week and then restarted on alternate days. Spironolactone was discontinued if there was a single potassium result ≥ 6.5 mmol l −1. Participants were also withdrawn from trial treatment if there was a reduction in eGFR of 20% or more between successive visits or 25% or more from baseline, a systolic blood pressure reading < 100 mm Hg or a symptomatic postural drop in systolic blood pressure > 20 mm Hg. Physicians were strongly encouraged to manage participants' blood pressure according to the NICE guidelines on CKD and on hypertension, which recommended a target clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg.

### Eplerenone for hypertension [^116c6gYm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eplerenone is an aldosterone receptor blocker that is chemically derived from spironolactone. In Canada, it is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy to reduce mortality for heart failure patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II systolic chronic heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is also used as adjunctive therapy for patients with heart failure following myocardial infarction. Additionally, it is indicated for the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension for patients who cannot be treated adequately with other agents. It is important to determine the clinical impact of all antihypertensive medications, including aldosterone antagonists, to support their continued use in essential hypertension. No previous systematic reviews have evaluated the effect of eplerenone on cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and magnitude of blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension.

Objectives

To assess the effects of eplerenone monotherapy versus placebo for primary hypertension in adults. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events (fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular events (fatal or non fatal strokes), adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers up to 3 March 2016. We handsearched references from retrieved studies to identify any studies missed in the initial search. We also searched for unpublished data by contacting the corresponding authors of the included studies and pharmaceutical companies involved in conducting studies on eplerenone monotherapy in primary hypertension. The search had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomized placebo-controlled trials studying adult patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies in people with secondary or gestational hypertension and studies where participants were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. A fourth independent review author resolved discrepancies or disagreements. We performed data extraction and synthesis using a standardized format on Covidence. We conducted data analysis using Review Manager 5.

Main Results

A total of 1437 adult patients participated in the five randomized parallel group studies, with treatment durations ranging from 8 to 16 weeks. The daily doses of eplerenone ranged from 25 mg to 400 mg daily. Meta-analysis of these studies showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 9.21 mmHg (95% CI -11.08 to -7.34; I² = 58%) and a reduction of diastolic pressure of 4.18 mmHg (95% CI -5.03 to -3.33; I² = 0%) (moderate quality evidence). There may be a dose response effect for eplerenone in the reduction in systolic blood pressure at doses of 400 mg/day. However, this finding is uncertain, as it is based on a single included study with low quality evidence. Overall there does not appear to be a clinically important dose response in lowering systolic or diastolic blood pressure at eplerenone doses of 50 mg to 400 mg daily. There did not appear to be any differences in the number of patients who withdrew due to adverse events or the number of patients with at least one adverse event in the eplerenone group compared to placebo. However, only three of the five included studies reported adverse events. Most of the included studies were of moderate quality, as we judged multiple domains as being at unclear risk in the 'Risk of bias' assessment.

Authors' Conclusions

Eplerenone 50 to 200 mg/day lowers blood pressure in people with primary hypertension by 9.21 mmHg systolic and 4.18 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo, with no difference of effect between doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. A dose of 25 mg/day did not produce a statistically significant reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and there is insufficient evidence for doses above 200 mg/day. There is currently no available evidence to determine the effect of eplerenone on clinically meaningful outcomes such as mortality or morbidity in hypertensive patients. The evidence available on side effects is insufficient and of low quality, which makes it impossible to draw conclusions about potential harm associated with eplerenone treatment in hypertensive patients.

At 1-year follow-up, there was an initial relative reduction in systolic blood pressure among those randomized to spironolactone (adjusted treatment effect −2.66 mm Hg, 95% CI: −4.43 to −0.90, P = 0.003). However, there was no difference in systolic blood pressure between groups by the end of follow-up at 3 years (adjusted treatment effect −1.69 mm Hg, 95% CI: −3.55 to 0.16, P = 0.074; Table 3).

At 3 years, mean ACR levels had worsened in both arms from means of 4.9–10.5 mg mmol −1 and 5.3–8.2 mg mmol −1 in the spironolactone versus control arms, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups in the ACR at either time point or in a change in urine ACR over time (adjusted treatment effect 1.03 mg mmol −1, 95% CI: −1.5 to 1.59, P = 0.897; Table 3).

### Spironolactone [^116SCsHm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart Failure

Spironolactone oral suspension is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in adult patients to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone oral suspension is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

Spironolactone oral suspension is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Primary aldosteronism-specific therapy — panel recommendation and MRA dosing: The panel issued a conditional recommendation for the use of PA-specific therapies over nonspecific antihypertensive treatments, and the risk of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) side effects can be minimized by commencing at low doses (eg, 12.5–25 mg of spironolactone daily) and increasing the dose gradually (eg, every 2–3 months or sooner if clinically indicated) as required to control BP; measurement of renin during MRA titration can assist treatment decision making, but this is less straightforward if the individual is on other medications that affect renin levels.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^112KGWNT]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Resistant hypertension, defined as suboptimal blood pressure control despite treatment with at least three blood pressure-lowering drugs, is associated with a poor prognosis. This is caused by organ damage from prolonged exposure to suboptimal blood pressure control, and to the association with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is estimated to be at least 10% of treated hypertensive patients, which would equate to a potential prevalence of about 100 million people globally. There has been a growing perception that controlling blood pressure in resistant hypertension is beyond the reach of existing drug therapies, leading to the emergence of device-based therapies such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

International guidelines have converged on a definition of resistant hypertension as blood pressure that is not controlled to target despite treatment with three recommended blood pressure-lowering drugs at maximum tolerated doses — namely, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB; "A"), plus a calcium channel blocker (CCB; "C"), plus a thiazide-like diuretic ("D") — ie, A + C + D. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane CENTRAL register, for English language publications published up to July, 2015, for randomised controlled trials, and open and observational studies, of the drug treatment of resistant hypertension. This review was cross-referenced to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) hypertension clinical guideline review of drug treatment of resistant hypertension (CG 127) from 2011 and a recently published meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies of drug treatment of resistant hypertension with aldosterone antagonists. The meta-analysis suggested that spironolactone can be an effective blood pressure-lowering treatment for patients with resistant hypertension, however, the NICE review concluded that the quality of existing evidence was low. Three randomised controlled trials, of 135 patients (combined), had shown spironolactone to be superior to the placebo in reducing seated clinic blood pressure, when added to existing treatment for resistant hypertension. But there had been no previous randomised controlled trials comparing spironolactone with other blood pressure-lowering drugs to determine if it is the most effective treatment for resistant hypertension.

### Effect of spironolactone on blood pressure in subjects with resistant hypertension [^1118jLbr]. Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is recommended as fourth-line therapy for essential hypertension despite few supporting data for this indication. We evaluated the effect among 1411 participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm who received spironolactone mainly as a fourth-line antihypertensive agent for uncontrolled blood pressure and who had valid BP measurements before and during spironolactone treatment. Among those who received spironolactone, the mean age was 63 years (SD: ± 8 years), 77% were men, and 40% had diabetes. Spironolactone was initiated a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range: 2.0 to 4.4 years) after randomization and added to a mean of 2.9 (SD: ± 0.9) other antihypertensive drugs. The median duration of spironolactone treatment was 1.3 years (interquartile range: 0.6 to 2.6 years). The median dose of spironolactone was 25 mg (interquartile range: 25 to 50 mg) at both the start and end of the observation period. During spironolactone therapy, mean blood pressure fell from 156.9/85.3 mm Hg (SD: ± 18.0/11.5 mm Hg) by 21.9/9.5 mm Hg (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.0/9.0 to 10.1 mm Hg; P < 0.001); the BP reduction was largely unaffected by age, sex, smoking, and diabetic status. Spironolactone was generally well tolerated; 6% of participants discontinued the drug because of adverse effects. The most frequent adverse events were gynecomastia or breast discomfort and biochemical abnormalities (principally hyperkaliemia), which were recorded as adverse events in 6% and 2% of participants, respectively. In conclusion, spironolactone effectively lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension uncontrolled by a mean of approximately 3 other drugs. Although nonrandomized and not placebo controlled, these data support the use of spironolactone in uncontrolled hypertension.

Added value of this study

In the PATHWAY-2 trial, spironolactone reduced blood pressure substantially more than conventional antihypertensive drugs in patients with resistant hypertension. In order for the results of PATHWAY-2 to change practice, it was important to show a mechanistic basis underpinning the superiority of spironolactone. The results of the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies show that the efficacy of spironolactone as an antihypertensive drug could be anticipated from our findings that resistant hypertension is a salt-retaining condition, associated with high aldosterone-to-renin ratios, and that spironolactone was substantially superior to the other standard antihypertensive drugs in reducing indices of salt and water retention — ie, it was reducing blood pressure primarily via diuretic actions. Physicians who are hesitant to prescribe spironolactone for hypertension, either because it is not a universally licensed indication, or because of antiandrogen-related intolerance, will be reassured by our additional finding that amiloride 10–20 mg achieved similar reductions in blood pressure as spironolactone, with similar, slight changes in electrolytes.

2.1 General Considerations

Spironolactone oral suspension is not therapeutically equivalent to Aldactone. Follow dosing instructions given here. In patients requiring a dose greater than 100 mg, use another formulation. Doses of the suspension greater than 100 mg may result in spironolactone concentrations higher than expected [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Spironolactone oral suspension can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2 Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73m2, initiate treatment at 20 mg (4 mL) once daily. Patients who tolerate 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage increased to 37.5 mg (7.5 mL) once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 20 mg (4 mL) once daily may have their dosage reduced to 20 mg (4 mL) every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2, consider initiating treatment at 10 mg (2 mL) because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3 Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 20 mg (4 mL) to 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses > 75 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4 Treatment of Edema Associated with Hepatic Cirrhosis

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended initial daily dose is 75 mg (15 mL) administered in either single or divided doses. In patients requiring titration above 100 mg, use another formulation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

### The spironolactone, amiloride, losartan, and thiazide (SALT) double-blind crossover trial in patients with low-renin hypertension and elevated aldosterone-renin ratio [^113jtYxA]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is continuing variation in diagnosis and estimated prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism. The higher estimates encourage search for adrenal adenomas in patients with elevated ratios of plasma aldosterone to renin. However, it is more likely that patients with normal plasma K+ and aldosterone belong to the polygenic spectrum of low-renin hypertension rather than have the same monogenic syndrome as classic Conn's. Our primary hypothesis was that in low-renin patients with normal plasma K+ and aldosterone, a thiazide diuretic, bendroflumethiazide, would be as effective as spironolactone in overcoming the Na+ retention and lowering blood pressure. Secondary objectives were to compare the dose response for each diuretic and to evaluate amiloride as an alternative to spironolactone.

Methods and Results

Fifty-seven patients entered and 51 patients completed a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized crossover trial. Entry criteria included low plasma renin, normal K+, elevated aldosterone-renin ratio, and a previous systolic blood pressure response to spironolactone of ≥ 20 mm Hg. Two doses each of spironolactone and bendroflumethiazide were compared. The crossover also included amiloride and losartan. Outcome measures were blood pressure, plasma renin, and other biochemical markers of diuretic action. Spironolactone 100 mg and bendroflumethiazide 5 mg caused similar falls in systolic blood pressure, whereas bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg was 5/2 mm Hg less effective in reducing blood pressure than either bendroflumethiazide 5 mg or spironolactone 50 mg (P < 0.005). Amiloride 40 mg was as effective as the other diuretics. Biochemical indices of natriuresis showed bendroflumethiazide to be less effective than either spironolactone or amiloride; plasma renin rose 4-fold on spironolactone but only 2-fold on bendroflumethiazide (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

In hypertensive patients with a low plasma renin but normal K+, bendroflumethiazide 5 mg was as effective as spironolactone 100 mg in lowering blood pressure, despite patients being selected for a previous large fall in blood pressure on spironolactone. Because this result differs from that expected in primary hyperaldosteronism, our finding argues against low-renin hypertension including a large, undiagnosed pool of primary hyperaldosteronism. However, spironolactone was the more effective natriuretic agent, suggesting that inappropriate aldosterone release or response may still contribute to the Na+ retention of low-renin hypertension.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^1121eUPP]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension:

For patients with essential hypertension in whom other measures are considered inadequate or inappropriate;
In hypertensive patients for the treatment of a diuretic-induced hypokalemia when other measures are considered inappropriate;
Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including the classes to which this drug principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^116y7CLw]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

PATHWAY-2 is the first randomised controlled trial to compare spironolactone with other blood pressure-lowering drug treatments in a well-characterised population of patients with resistant hypertension. The study shows that spironolactone was by far the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment for patients with resistant hypertension. This was true in terms of the magnitude of the blood pressure response, the proportion of patients achieving a stringent measure of blood pressure control (home systolic blood pressure < 135 mm Hg), and the proportion in whom it was more effective than either of the non-diuretic alternative drugs. These findings suggest that the predominant underlying pathophysiological cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention, despite existing baseline diuretic therapy. This conclusion is supported by our finding that the response to spironolactone had a clear inverse relation with plasma renin, was especially effective at lower plasma renin levels, and yet the most effective drug throughout the range of plasma renin.

Sample size calculation and statistical analysis

The sample size estimation will be based on the two primary objectives. In a study of hypertensive patients, Weinberger et al showed that after 16 weeks of treatment, systolic blood pressure among patients with low-renin hypertension (renin < 9.4 mU/L) was reduced by 17.2 mmHg in the eplerenone group compared with 5.4 mmHg in the losartan group (no standard deviations were reported). Assuming a similar drop in systolic blood pressure between treatment groups with an equal standard deviation of 10 mmHg for the change in blood pressure, a minimum sample size of 24 patients per arm would be required. For the second primary endpoint of the defined daily dose required to achieve target blood pressure, a comprehensive systematic review of the literature was conducted, but no previous trials reported the expected defined daily dose for either spironolactone or perindopril in low-renin hypertension. Therefore, in the absence of such information, a large effect size will be assumed (Cohen's d = 0.8). For this effect size, a minimum sample size of 50 patients per group is needed. The two sample size estimations account for 90% power in the study, with a Bonferroni family-wise error rate of 0.025 (two-sided) and a 20% attrition. Bonferroni multiplicity was considered because the outcomes from this study would be confirmative, and the defined daily dose and blood pressure change are presumed to be closely related outcome measures for blood pressure control. Hence the target sample size for this study is 100 patients (50 randomized to each arm of the study).

### Efficacy and safety of esaxerenone (CS-3150) for the treatment of essential hypertension: a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study [^115uiFKX]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

The present findings indicate that 2.5 and 5 mg/day esaxerenone are optimal dosages based on the efficacy and safety data presented. The perceived limitations of this study include the small sample size, short observation period (12 weeks), and open-label nature of the comparator eplerenone. However, a randomized, double-blind, long-term phase 3 study has been completed recently to further investigate the safety and efficacy of esaxerenone therapy in essential hypertension patients. In addition, the safety and efficacy profiles of esaxerenone therapy in other patient populations, such as those affected by CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus with albuminuria, have been assessed in several phase 3 studies that have been completed recently.

Esaxerenone is a novel non-steroidal MR blocker that has a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect on sitting SBP/DBP and 24-h BP. Esaxerenone showed good efficacy and safety profiles in Japanese essential hypertensive patients, and no obvious safety concerns, including hyperkalemia, were observed across all doses of esaxerenone. In conclusion, esaxerenone 2.5 and 5 mg/day are both considered optimum dosages for the treatment of essential hypertension.

Summary Table

What is known about the topic?

Essential hypertension and end-organ damage are leading risk factors for morbidity and mortality throughout the world.
Current guidelines recommend combination therapies that have complementary mechanisms to reduce blood pressure. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists are recommended for the treatment of resistant hypertension.
An existing MR antagonist, spironolactone, has significant treatment-emergent side effects, which affect compliance rates. Eplerenone has an improved safety profile but may have less potent antihypertensive efficacy as compared with spironolactone.

What this study adds

Esaxerenone is a novel non-steroidal MR blocker that has a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect compared with placebo.
Esaxerenone has a good safety profile and shows no adverse events related to sex hormones.
This study determined the optimal doses of esaxerenone for lowering blood pressure in Japanese patients with essential hypertension.

### Low-dose spironolactone in the management of resistant hypertension: a surveillance study [^115JnSFj]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

We have conducted an open observational study of the use of spironolactone 25–50 mg in the management of patients with resistant hypertension. This drug was recommended in 133 patients who were already receiving an angiotensin-blocking drug in addition to other therapies.

Results

Of these, three defaulted from follow-up and 11 could not tolerate spironolactone. We therefore have outcome data on 119 patients. The addition of spironolactone (median dose 25 mg) was associated with a mean (SD) fall in systolic blood pressure of 21.7 mmHg (24.0; P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure of 8.5 mmHg (14.9; P < 0.001). In two patients spironolactone had to be discontinued on account of a rise of serum potassium to above 6.0 mmol/l, whereas overall the mean increase in serum potassium was 0.3 mmol/l.

Conclusion

With careful monitoring of plasma electrolytes, spironolactone at a low dose is an effective add-in drug in patients with hypertension resistant to a regime that includes an angiotensin-blocking agent.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112DZqc9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Justification for Recommendation 10 states that although the evidence is limited and indirect, amiloride seems to be as effective as spironolactone in reducing BP in individuals with resistant hypertension and both drugs are low cost and both improve QOL; nevertheless, there is a lack of direct clinical evidence to recommend ENaC amiloride over MRA spironolactone as first-line therapy, and an MRA should be the preferred treatment in PA based on a small study of 10 individuals in which spironolactone (400 mg/day) had greater BP-lowering effects than amiloride (40 mg/day); when spironolactone is not tolerated and other MRAs are not available, amiloride may be an alternative therapy in the management of PA.

MRA versus ACEi/ARB

Four studies reported changes in mean SBP and DBP: one cross-over and three parallel studies. Treatment duration ranged from five to sixteen weeks. Spironolactone (50–100 mg/day) or eplerenone (50–200 mg/day) were compared to losartan (50–100 mg/day) or enalapril (10–40 mg/day). The mean difference in change in SBP between MRA (n = 264) and ACEi/ARB (n = 277) was −6.8 mmHg (95% CI −9.6, −4.1) with low heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 7%, p = 0.36) (Fig. 3).

The mean difference in DBP change was −2.5 mmHg (95% CI −5.9, 1.0) with considerable heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 83%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). Sensitivity analysis with the removal of high risk of bias studies (N = 2) reduced heterogeneity (I 2 = 0, p = 0.80) with an aggregated mean difference in DBP of −2.4 mmHg (95% CI −4.3, −0.4) (Supplementary Table 6). The certainty of the evidence for the difference in SBP and DBP was rated moderate and very low respectively (Table 2).

### Efficacy of low-dose spironolactone in subjects with resistant hypertension [^111xmw5e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports have demonstrated the antihypertensive efficacy of high doses of spironolactone in subjects with primary aldosteronism and, to a lesser degree, subjects with resistant hypertension.

Methods

In current analysis, we examined the antihypertensive benefit of adding low-dose spironolactone to multidrug regimens that included a diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in subjects with resistant hypertension with and without primary aldosteronism. Subjects referred for resistant hypertension were evaluated with an early morning plasma renin activity, 24-h urinary aldosterone and sodium during a high dietary salt ingestion. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed with a renin activity < 1.0 ng/mL/h, urinary aldosterone > 12 mug/24 h and urinary sodium > 200 mEq/24 h. After biochemical evaluation, spironolactone (12.5 to 25 mg/d) was added to each subject's antihypertensive regimen. If blood pressure (BP) remained uncontrolled, the dose of spironolactone was titrated up to 50 mg/d. Follow-up BP was determined at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.

Results

A total number of 76 subjects were included in the analysis, 34 of whom had biochemical primary aldosteronism. Low-dose spironolactone was associated with an additional mean decrease in BP of 21 ± 21/10 ± 14 mm Hg at 6 weeks and 25 ± 20/12 ± 12 mm Hg at 6-month follow-up. The BP reduction was similar in subjects with and without primary aldosteronism and was additive to the use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.

Conclusions

We conclude that low-dose spironolactone provides significant additive BP reduction in African American and white subjects with resistant hypertension with and without primary aldosteronism.

Further uptitration of antihypertensive therapy — when BP remains uncontrolled with three-drug combination therapy, the patient is classified as having resistant hypertension and such patients should be considered for specialist evaluation. Additional treatment options include the addition of low-dose spironolactone (25–50 mg daily) or other diuretic therapy, including loop diuretics in patients with significant renal impairment (eGFR < 45 mL/min/m2), as well as beta-blockers, alpha-blockers, centrally acting agents (eg clonidine), or, rarely, minoxidil.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^112F3BpB]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

The results for seated clinic systolic blood pressure largely mirror those seen with home systolic blood pressure except that there was a large placebo effect on clinic blood pressure that was not seen with home blood pressure measurement (appendix p 9). Full details of all blood pressure data (home and clinic), including diastolic pressures and heart rate are shown in appendix (p 10).

Overall 219 (68·9% [95% CI 63·6–73·8]) of 314 patients achieved target home systolic blood pressure of less than 135 mm Hg. The comparison of control rates is shown in the appendix (p 11). 58% of patients had their blood pressure controlled with spironolactone, which was superior to rates for other treatments. Most patients who were controlled by doxazosin or bisoprolol had a still greater fall in blood pressure on spironolactone, which was consequently the most effective treatment in almost 60% of patients. This was at least three times the proportion in whom doxazosin or bisoprolol were the most effective.

The proportion of patients in whom spironolactone was their best drug for blood pressure lowering was most evident on the planned analyses of prediction by plasma renin of blood pressure response to each drug and the likelihood that different drugs would be best at different points in the plasma renin distribution. Figure 3 shows the relation between plasma renin (measured at baseline whilst patients were receiving their usual medication — ie, A + C + D) and the blood pressure-lowering response to each active treatment corrected for the placebo effect. There was a clear inverse relation between the home systolic blood pressure fall with spironolactone and plasma renin, not seen with bisoprolol or doxazosin. Moreover, the blood pressure response to spironolactone was superior to bisoprolol and doxazosin across most of the plasma renin distribution (figure 3). Only in a small minority of patients, with very high plasma renin levels, did the mean home systolic blood pressure response to doxazosin or bisoprolol overlap that to spironolactone. Analysis of each patient's best drug clearly showed that, although spironolactone was the best blood pressure-lowering treatment throughout almost the entire renin distribution, the likelihood of being superior, and the magnitude of this superiority, was several-fold higher for spironolactone than the other drugs at the lower end of the distribution (figure 3; appendix pp 18,19).

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^111zK3r5]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

The prevailing view in the 1990s and 2000s was that, at low doses, thiazides did not cause metabolic consequences but remained maximally efficacious at lowering blood pressure. Such a view was initially supported by under-powered comparisons of doses, in which no difference in effects on blood pressure were reported. However, an apparent dose–response correlation for blood pressure was rediscovered during treatment titration for an outcome comparison of diuretics with calcium-channel blockers, and this relation was confirmed by a formal, crossover comparison of doses in the Spironolactone, Amiloride, Losartan, Thiazide (SALT) study. The results of SALT also showed the potential value of potassium-sparing diuretics as an alternative to high-dose thiazides. However, in practice, concerns about hyperkalaemia limit the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, especially in an era when most patients are receiving a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker. Additionally, without proof that potassium-sparing diuretics are not associated with glucose intolerance, or indeed that they prevent major complications of hypertension, drugs such as spironolactone have not been included as options before stage 4 hypertension in most national guidelines, still less a replacement for thiazides as first-line treatment.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111CT4G5]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

One hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is predominantly caused by sodium retention, due in part to the reduced doses of diuretics prescribed in recent years; if so, drugs with a diuretic action would be the most effective additional treatment. An alternative hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is a heterogeneous state, with average responses in study cohorts masking substantial individual patient differences. In the latter case, treatment could be stratified by use of biomarkers of sodium/volume status, particularly plasma renin level, to which sodium status is inversely related.

We selected spironolactone as the drug with diuretic action (through blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor) because of observational and limited randomised controlled trial data suggesting good blood pressure-lowering efficacy in resistant hypertension, recently summarised in a meta-analysis. However, spironolactone has not been compared with alternative drugs recommended for resistant hypertension. It has therefore been unknown whether spironolactone is the most effective treatment, and if so, whether this applies to a subset of patients or the majority. We aimed to compare spironolactone with alternative fourth-line treatments targeting different pathogenetic mechanisms: the α1-adrenoceptor blocker, doxazosin, acting to reduce peripheral resistance, and the β1-adrenoceptor blocker, bisoprolol, which inhibits the release of renin, and reduces cardiac output. Our primary aim was to determine, for the first time, whether spironolactone is overall the most effective add-on drug treatment for resistant hypertension. The second aim was to determine whether plasma renin levels predict the most effective treatment for individual patients, and whether spironolactone would be most effective in patients with a low plasma renin as a marker of sodium retention. We therefore designed a randomised crossover trial so that each patient's best drug and its predictors could be discovered.

The study PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) was published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Hypertension. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the trial question was: what is the role of add-on spironolactone in patients with drug-resistant hypertension? In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the population was: 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). The inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months. The key exclusion criteria were secondary/accelerated hypertension; T1DM; eGFR < 45 mL/min; sustained AF; non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the interventions were: n = 285 spironolactone (at a dose of 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12) n = 274 placebo (matching placebo daily for 12 weeks). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 4.1 mmHg; AD 8.7 mmHg, 95% CI 7.69 to 9.72). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in home SBP at week 12 (14.4 mmHg vs. 4.2 mmHg; AD 10.2 mmHg, 95% CI 8.74 to 11.7) Significant increase in reduction in seated clinic SBP through week 6 to week 12 (20.7 mmHg vs. 10.8 mmHg; AD 9.92 mmHg, 95% CI 8.59 to 11.3). In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the PATHWAY-2 (spironolactone vs. placebo) study, the conclusion was: in patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and home SBP ≥ 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs for at least 3 months, spironolactone was superior to placebo with respect to reduction in home SBP through week 6 to week 12.

### The role of spironolactone in the treatment of patients with refractory hypertension [^116vgeeC]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is resistant to pharmacologic therapy in 5% to 10% of patients. The current study tested whether addition of spironolactone to the treatment of patients with refractory hypertension would lead to adequate blood pressure (BP) control.

Methods

Among 520 patients who were referred for treatment of hypertension to one medical clinic from 1997 to 1999, a total of 25 patients who met the inclusion criteria of refractory hypertension were prospectively included in this study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) hypertension of ≥ 6 months without any apparent cause; 2) clinical BP measurement and mean 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring > 140/90 mm Hg despite treatment with at least two antihypertensive drugs; 3) no prior therapy with spironolactone; and 4) no renal insufficiency. Spironolactone was added to the previous regimen at a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day while any angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor was suppressed. Serum potassium and creatinine levels were checked before the introduction of spironolactone and 1 month later.

Results

After 1 month of therapy with spironolactone, 23 patients had a clinical BP < 140/90 mm Hg. Ambulatory BP monitoring when compared before and 1 month after initiation of spironolactone decreased significantly (systolic BP from 152 ± 2 mm Hg to 128 ± 2 mm Hg, P < .001; and diastolic BP from 86 ± 2 mm Hg to 76 ± 2 mm Hg, P < .013). By 3 months after the introduction of spironolactone, the mean number of antihypertensive drugs required per patient was significantly reduced (from 3.2 ± 0.2 to 2.1 ± 0.2, P < .001). No patient required discontinuation of spironolactone due to adverse renal effects.

Conclusion

Spironolactone is a safe, effective therapy for patients with refractory hypertension.

### Spironolactone for hypertension [^114tVnfi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, considered fourth line therapy for hypertension in patients already treated with multiple medications.

Objectives

Primary: to determine the effect of spironolactone on patient mortality, morbidity, and to quantify the magnitude of blood pressure lowering effect of spironolactone monotherapy. Secondary: to determine the prevalence of adverse reactions observed with spironolactone monotherapy and to determine if there is a blood-pressure lowering dose response with spironolactone.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2009), MEDLINE (2005 - Sept. 2009), and EMBASE (2007 - Sept. 2009). References from retrieved studies were reviewed to identify any studies missed in the initial search. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We selected RCTs studying patients with primary hypertension. We excluded studies of patients with secondary or gestational hypertension, and studies where patients were receiving multiple antihypertensives.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently reviewed the search results for studies meeting our criteria. Three reviewers extracted data and assessed trial quality using a standardized data extraction form. Data synthesis and analysis was performed using RevMan 5.

Main Results

Meta-analysis of the 5 cross-over studies found a reduction in SBP of 20.09 mmHg (95%CI:16.58–23.06, p < 0.00001) and a 6.75 mmHg (95%CI:4.8–8.69, p < 0.00001) reduction in DBP. These results were statistically significant and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between the studies. There may be a dose response effect with spironolactone up to 50 mg/day, but the confidence intervals around the mean end-of-study blood pressure for doses ranging 25–500 mg/day all overlapped. In other words, it appears that doses > 50mg/day do not produce further reductions in either SBP or DBP. One cross-over study found that spironolactone 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly change SBP or DBP compared to placebo, SBP: -9.9 (95%CI:-21.15,1.35); DBP -2.34 (95%CI:-7.92,3.06).

Authors' Conclusions

From the limited available evidence, spironolactone appears to lower blood pressure compared to placebo to a similar degree in patients with primary (essential) hypertension when doses of 100–500 mg/day are given. A dose of 25 mg/day did not statistically significantly reduce systolic or diastolic blood pressure, compared to placebo. Given the lack of a dose-response, coupled with a possible increased risk in adverse events with higher doses, doses of 25 to 100 mg/day are reasonable. There is no evidence of the effect of spironolactone on clinical outcomes in hypertensive patients.

There were three studies comparing spironolactone (25 mg/day to mean 224 mg/day) with amiloride (10–40 mg/day) or triamterene monotherapy (mean dose 268 mg/day). The mean difference in SBP change between MRA (n = 87) and EnaCi (n = 90) was −0.9 mmHg (95% CI −9.0, 7.1) with considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 77%, p = 0.01) (Fig. 4). Sensitivity analysis with the removal of the high risk of bias studies (N = 2) increased the mean difference in SBP (N = 1) to 5.2 mmHg (95% CI 0.8, 9.7) (Supplementary Table 7).

### Dose doubling, relative potency, and dose equivalence of potassium-sparing diuretics affecting blood pressure and serum potassium: systematic review and meta-analyses [^115p4enL]. Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Potassium-sparing diuretics (PSDs) are valuable antihypertensives with additional benefits unrelated to control of systolic blood pressure (SBP). However, their key parameters affecting SBP and serum potassium are poorly defined, fostering underutilization.

Method

Consequently, we conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses, yielding 3668 articles and ultimately 84 randomized comparisons.

Results

For office SBP, overall placebo-adjusted changes were triamterene -1.9 (low dose only), amiloride -9.9, spironolactone -13.2, and eplerenone -9.2. Differences in antihypertensive effect were due to potency rather than efficacy. Doubling amiloride, eplerenone, and spironolactone doses reduced SBP (95% confidence limits) on average by -2.3 (-3.1, -1.5). Relative antihypertensive potencies were spironolactone > amiloride > eplerenone. Spironolactone had significantly greater antihypertensive potency than amiloride, -4.0 (-7.4, -0.6), and eplerenone, -5.5 (-7.4, -3.6). Dose equivalencies were eplerenone-spironolactone 4.5-to-1 (e.g., eplerenone 125∼spironolactone 25), amiloride-spironolactone 3.3-to-1, and eplerenone-amiloride 1.4-to-1. Increases in serum potassium from amiloride and spironolactone at commonly used doses averaged 0.14–0.29mEq/l; the dose doubling effect was 0.16 (0.10, 0.22). Spironolactone caused greater hyperkalemia than amiloride across their dose ranges: 0.14, P = 0.043. Seven features make important bias unlikely: a comprehensive literature search, adjustment for covariates, all models explaining 95–100% of the between-study variability, similar dose doubling effects among PSDs, two different methods giving the same potency sequence, similar results from double blind comparisons, and similar results for eplerenone versus spironolactone from analysing direct comparison data (i.e., no meta-regression) for office and 24-h SBP.

Conclusion

This synthesis accomplishes for PSDs what has already been achieved for thiazide-type diuretics and other antihypertensives and can guide the application of these underutilized medicines.

Central Illustration
Adjusted Hazard Ratios for All-Cause Death and Changes in SBP From Baseline

(A) Adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause death and (B) the mean change in SBP from baseline to 1, 6, and 9 months in each baseline SBP category. The treatment effect and the small blood pressure-lowering effect observed are consistent across the baseline SBP categories. The p value is for interaction between baseline SBP category and treatment effect. MRA = mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SBP = systolic blood pressure.

Overall, the differences in SBP between the placebo and the MRA therapy were small, namely 1.9 ± 0.5 mm Hg at 1 month and 2.6 ± 0.6 mm Hg at 6 months (and did not differ between spironolactone and eplerenone). It is instructive to compare this to the reduction in SBP in PATHWAY-2 patients with resistant hypertension. In PATHWAY-2, spironolactone was started at 25 mg daily for 6 weeks and then force-titrated to 50 mg daily for a further 6 weeks (total treatment duration of 12 weeks). In patients who received both doses of each tested drug, the overall mean placebo-corrected reduction in home SBP with spironolactone was 9.15 mm Hg (at 6 weeks it was 6.86 mm Hg and 11.4 mm Hg at 12 weeks). The corresponding mean overall placebo-corrected reduction in clinic SBP was 9.92 mm Hg (separate 6- and 12-week data were not reported). It is important to note that, because of this sequential design, it was not possible to tell how much of the incremental SBP reduction, if any, was due to the increase in dose of spironolactone. Also, the average dose of spironolactone attained was not reported in PATHWAY-2. It is likely, however, that the proportion of patients achieving the target dose of spironolactone in PATHWAY-2 was greater than the proportion achieving the target dose of MRA in the 2 HFrEF trials, which had a similar forced-titration design. In EMPHASIS-HF, only 60.2% of patients assigned to eplerenone therapy were receiving 50 mg daily at the end of the titration phase, and the mean daily dose of eplerenone was 39.1 mg (at 5 months). Information for mean doses of spironolactone achieved during the first year of follow-up in RALES was not available.

Summary

What is known about the topic

Low-renin hypertension is common.
Data from a meta-analysis showed that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were more effective in lowering blood pressure when compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Key limitations of older studies include using high doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, inadequate exclusion of primary aldosteronism, short treatment duration and a lack of end-organ data.

What this study adds

This randomized controlled trial will address previous study limitations: primary aldosteronism will be excluded using gold-standard mass spectrometry measurement of aldosterone, participants will be treated for 48 weeks and data on markers of end-organ dysfunction will be collected.
Recent evidence suggests that reversal of renin suppression is associated with better cardiovascular health in people with primary aldosteronism. This study will explore if a similar cardioprotective effect is seen in low-renin hypertension by titrating spironolactone to both blood pressure and renin concentration.

Evidence base and strength for spironolactone in resistant hypertension: The evidence supporting this recommendation is derived from three SRs and two independent RCTs, and among the five RCTs in the Liu et al. SR, spironolactone consistently lowered office and ambulatory or home SBP and DBP; in this analysis, spironolactone also lowered SBP by 4.5 mm Hg compared to atenolol, candesartan, or alpha methyldopa. The strength of evidence to support spironolactone's efficacy was considered to be high with a low risk of bias, whereas in contrast the strength of the evidence represented by the 19 studies of 2,758 patients with RHT in the Makai et al. SR was very low. An open-label substudy documented amiloride's effect in a subset of 146 RHT patients from Pathway-2, but the Work Group did not consider this substudy, and combining spironolactone and eplerenone in Makai et al. made it impossible to determine if the efficacy of each was equivalent to the other.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^1116iDo5]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 — management of resistant hypertension: Recommended treatment is reinforcement of lifestyle measures, especially sodium reduction; addition of low-dose spironolactone to existing treatment; or, if spironolactone is intolerant, addition of further diuretic therapy with either eplerenone, amiloride, a higher-dose thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, or a loop diuretic; or the addition of bisoprolol or doxazosin. A loop diuretic should replace thiazides/thiazide-like diuretics if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is < 30 mL/min. Spironolactone use should usually be restricted to patients with an eGFR > 45 mL/ min and a plasma potassium concentration of ≤ 4.5 mmol/L, and electrolytes and eGFR should be monitored soon after initiation and at least annually thereafter. Spironolactone intolerance includes antiandrogenic effects such as gynaecomastia (in ~6%). Amiloride (10–20 mg/day) has recently been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in reducing BP in the PATHWAY-2 study, whereas bisoprolol or doxazosin were not as effective as spironolactone but reduced BP significantly vs placebo when added to background treatment; direct vasodilators such as hydralazine or minoxidil are infrequently used because they may cause severe fluid retention and tachycardia.

### Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in mild-to-moderate hypertension [^112mp5BY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker (SAB) that is highly specific for the aldosterone receptor, has the potential to be efficacious in the treatment of hypertension.

Methods

This 8-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of eplerenone in eligible patients randomized to eplerenone 50, 100, or 400 mg once daily; eplerenone 25, 50, or 200 mg twice daily; spironolactone 50 mg twice daily; or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was the adjusted mean change in baseline to final visit for seated diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Results

Of 417 randomized patients, 409 were evaluated for efficacy. The adjusted mean change from baseline to final visit in seated and standing systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP was significantly greater (P < .05) in all eplerenone groups than in the placebo group. The adjusted mean change in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) measurements of SBP and DBP also documented a 24-h duration significantly greater (P < .05) than placebo in eplerenone-treated patients. For all measurements, the antihypertensive effect of eplerenone increased in a dose-response fashion. Eplerenone (100 mg) reduced BP by 75% compared with spironolactone (100 mg) and had an adverse events incidence rate similar to placebo. No antiandrogenic or progestational effects or clinically relevant safety issues were observed in eplerenone-treated patients. However, one spironolactone-treated patient reported menstrual irregularities.

Conclusions

Eplerenone doses of 50 to 400 mg once daily are well tolerated and effective in reducing BP in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension during a 24-h period.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, blood pressure, and outcomes in heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction [^115LWAko]. JACC: Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

There are additional explanations, other than dose, for the differences in SBP reduction between these trials. One explanation is that PATHWAY-2 enrolled patients with a higher mean SBP (148 mm Hg) than in the present patients with HFrEF (123 mm Hg), and generally, patients with higher starting SBP show a greater reduction with treatment than those with a lower baseline SBP (see below). However, the patients in PATHWAY-2 had resistant hypertension, and the reductions in SBP with the other active therapies tested (bisoprolol and doxazosin) were approximately one-half that obtained with spironolactone.

Alternatively, the PATHWAY-2 investigators proposed that patients in their trial were especially responsive to spironolactone because the major pathophysiological cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention; however, this is also characteristic of patients with HFrEF, yet in those patients, the reduction in SBP with MRA treatment was small. It has also been suggested that spironolactone is particularly effective in patients with resistant hypertension because many have increased aldosterone secretion; however, this is also true of patients with heart failure.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^111K9iw2]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — spironolactone add-on therapy: For patients with resistant hypertension (defined as those who are not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated dose of triple therapy [i.e., a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker]), we suggest adding spironolactone in those patients without contraindications (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone more effectively reduced SBP and DBP compared to placebo when added as the fourth agent to the treatment regimen of patients with resistant HTN, and in patients with a history of hyperkalemia and diminished renal function, spironolactone should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of potassium and renal function.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

### Does aldosterone-to-renin ratio predict the antihypertensive effect of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone? [^111Pxaem]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The recognition that some 10% to 15% of the hypertensive population may have aldosterone excess has increased the frequency of measurement of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) and the use of aldosterone antagonists. Whether this ratio will predict the blood pressure (BP) response to spironolactone is not clear.

Methods

We correlated the BP response to spironolactone 50 mg/day to baseline ARR in 69 hypertensive patients (mean [± SD] age 57 ± 2 years, 65% male), consisting of 39 subjects with long-standing hypertension (4.0 ± 0.2 years) whose hypertension was uncontrolled on at least three antihypertensive medications and 30 previously untreated patients who were randomized in a cross-over design to receive either spironolactone 50 mg/day or bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg/day for 4 weeks.

Results

After 4 weeks of spironolactone, BP in patients with never-treated hypertension was reduced by 18 ± 3 / 11 ± 1 mm Hg. There was a highly significant correlation between log ARR and the fall in systolic BP (r = 0.69, P < .001) and diastolic BP (r = 0.45, P < .05). Nine of ten patients with low renin activity (≤ 0.5 ng/mL/h) showed a > 20-mm Hg fall in systolic BP. No such correlations were seen when BP was reduced by bendroflumethazide 2.5 mg. For patients with resistant hypertension, despite a BP reduction of 28 ± 3 / 13 ± 2 mm Hg after 14 weeks of spironolactone, there was no relationship between the reduction in BP and the ARR; however, subjects with pretreatment potassium < 4.0 mmol/L had a greater response than those with levels ≥ 4.0 mmol/L (34 ± 3 / 16 ± 2 v 20 ± 6 / 8 ± 3 mm Hg, P < .05)

Conclusions

Based on the study results, ARR and low renin activity may predict the response to spironolactone in never-treated hypertensive patients but not in patients taking antihypertensive drugs, possibly because of the effect of these agents on ARR. In such patients a trial of spironolactone is required to assess the BP response.

### Spironolactone (Aldactone) [^115GHxty]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1.1	Heart Failure

ALDACTONE is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III–IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction to increase survival, manage edema, and reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

ALDACTONE is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2	Hypertension

ALDACTONE is indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of resistant HTN, pharmacotherapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider adding spironolactone to existing treatment in patients with resistant HTN and uncontrolled BP despite using first-line BP-lowering therapies. Consider initiating eplerenone instead of spironolactone, or adding a β-blocker if not already indicated and, subsequently, a centrally acting BP-lowering medication, an α-blocker, hydralazine, or a potassium-sparing diuretic if spironolactone is not effective or tolerated.

### A randomized trial assessing efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy compared to standard antihypertensive therapy in hypErtension with low renin (REMASTER): rationale and study design [^113Xmpq3]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Low-renin hypertension affects 1 in 4 people with hypertension, but the optimal management of this condition is not known. We hypothesize that a large proportion of people with low-renin hypertension is mediated by excess mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation and that targeted treatment with an MR antagonist (MRA) will be beneficial. This randomized, single-blinded, titration-to-effect aims to investigate whether targeted treatment in low-renin hypertension with MRA is better compared to standard antihypertensives in terms of blood pressure control and end-organ protection. Adults with hypertension, who are treatment naïve or are receiving up to two antihypertensive agents and have a low direct renin concentration < 10mU/L will be included. Participants with severe hypertension, a secondary cause of hypertension, pregnant, breastfeeding, with moderate-severe cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, or on medications that confound interpretation of the plasma direct renin or aldosterone concentrations will be excluded. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to either MRA therapy (spironolactone) or standard anti-hypertensive therapy (perindopril ± amlodipine) for 48 weeks. Anti-hypertensives will be up-titrated every 12 weeks until target blood pressure is achieved. The primary objective will be to determine the total defined daily dose of antihypertensives required to achieve the target blood pressure and change in mean clinic systolic blood pressure at week 48. Current hypertension guidelines do not have specific recommendations for the choice of anti-hypertensive medications for people with low-renin hypertension. The results of this trial could guide future hypertension guidelines.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^111Pydgx]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

First, what is the relation between baseline plasma renin, aldosterone, and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) and the blood pressure-lowering response to spironolactone, bisoprolol, doxazosin, and placebo? Consistent with our hypothesis that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state, we expected plasma renin to be relatively suppressed despite background treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic — ie, the so-called A+C+D treatment strategy. A finding of a suppressed renin concentration, despite treatments that usually increase plasma renin, would be consistent with resistant hypertension being a sodium-retaining state. We also hypothesised that the blood pressure-lowering response to spironolactone, but not to other drugs, would be greatest in participants with the lowest plasma renin concentrations and highest ARRs, consistent with sodium retention being largely a consequence of autonomous aldosterone production. The proportion of patients exceeding validated thresholds for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was also assessed.

Second, we aimed to assess the haemodynamic responses to the various drug treatments and placebo and their effect on cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and thoracic fluid content, testing the hypothesis that the superior action of spironolactone in lowering blood pressure in resistant hypertension would be consistent with those of a diuretic.

Third, we hypothesised that if the superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension was due to its natriuretic actions, then amiloride would similarly decrease blood pressure. Like spironolactone, amiloride is a distal tubular diuretic that inhibits the aldosterone-sensitive epithelial sodium channel. Notably, a low-dose thiazide and amiloride combination achieved a greater reduction in blood pressure from baseline than high-dose thiazide alone in patients with hypertension in the PATHWAY-3 trial.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^115orY6Q]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Resistant hypertension is defined as a blood pressure that is uncontrolled despite treatment with at least three blood pressure-lowering drugs, including a diuretic, usually also including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and after exclusion of treatable secondary causes of hypertension. Resistant hypertension affects up to 10% of patients treated for hypertension and is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the randomised, placebo-controlled crossover trial PATHWAY-2, we tested the recommendationto treat resistant hypertension by addition of a drug that blocks either the mineralocorticoid or adrenergic receptors. In PATHWAY-2, the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25–50 mg per day) was more effective at lowering blood pressure than bisoprolol (5–20 mg daily), doxazosin (4–8 mg daily), or placebo. This finding is supported by evidence from observational studies.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Heart Failure: Initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily (2.2).
Hypertension: Initiate treatment at 25 to 100 mg daily in either single or divided doses (2.3).
Edema: Initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly. The recommended initial daily dose is 100 mg in single or divided doses (2.4).
Primary hyperaldosteronism: Initiate treatment at 100 to 400 mg in preparation for surgery. In patients unsuitable for surgery use the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient (2.5).

2.1	General Considerations

ALDACTONE can be taken with or without food, but should be taken consistently with respect to food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.2	Treatment of Heart Failure

In patients with serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L and eGFR > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, initiate treatment at 25 mg once daily. Patients who tolerate 25 mg once daily may have their dosage increased to 50 mg once daily as clinically indicated. Patients who develop hyperkalemia on 25 mg once daily may have their dosage reduced to 25 mg every other day [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. In patients with an eGFR between 30 and 50 mL/min/1.73 m2, consider initiating therapy at 25 mg every other day because of the risk of hyperkalemia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.3	Treatment of Essential Hypertension

The recommended initial daily dose is 25 to 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses is recommended. Dosage can be titrated at two-week intervals. Doses greater than 100 mg/day generally do not provide additional reductions in blood pressure.

2.4	Treatment of Edema

In patients with cirrhosis, initiate therapy in a hospital setting and titrate slowly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. The recommended initial daily dosage is 100 mg of ALDACTONE administered in either single or divided doses, but may range from 25 to 200 mg daily. When given as the sole agent for diuresis, administer for at least five days before increasing dose to obtain desired effect.

2.5	Treatment of Primary Hyperaldosteronism

Administer ALDACTONE in doses of 100 to 400 mg daily in preparation for surgery. For patients who are considered unsuitable for surgery, ALDACTONE can be used as long-term maintenance therapy at the lowest effective dosage determined for the individual patient.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^1134CPSd]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

PATHWAY-2 is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial to compare different blood pressure-lowering treatments in rigorously assessed patients with resistant hypertension, and the first comparison of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with alternative recommended classes that block the sympathetic nervous system (α blockers and β blockers). The size, crossover design, and hierarchical primary endpoints of PATHWAY-2 enabled demonstration at high significance (p < 0·0001) that spironolactone 25–50 mg/day is by far the most effective drug added to A + C + D, for the treatment of resistant hypertension; blood pressure was controlled (home systolic blood pressure < 135 mm Hg) in 60% of patients. The role of sodium retention in causing resistant hypertension was strongly suggested by a low baseline plasma renin, despite treatment with three drugs which usually elevate renin, and by a significant inverse correlation between renin and blood pressure reduction by spironolactone. The individual crossover data show that spironolactone is the most effective add-on drug, by a large margin, in the overwhelming majority of patients confirmed as adherent, but resistant, to treatment with A + C + D.

Implications of all the available evidence

The unequivocal superiority of spironolactone, together with supportive efficacy and safety data from longer term observational studies, should influence treatment guidelines globally. Whether the superiority is specific for mineralocorticoid receptor blockade, reflecting overlap between primary aldosteronism and resistant hypertension, will require comparison of spironolactone with other types of diuretic. Meanwhile, truly resistant hypertension can now be considered rare and redefined as blood pressure not controlled by A + C + D + spironolactone.

For drug treatment of resistant hypertension, international guidelines specifically refer to fourth-line therapy for patients, whose blood pressure is not controlled by treatment with three drugs, typically A + C + D, where "A" is an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), "C" is a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and "D" is a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic. The choice of fourth-line drug treatment for resistant hypertension has been entirely empirical, reflecting an absence of data from prospective randomised controlled trials comparing different drug treatment options. The underlying pathophysiological basis for resistant hypertension is also poorly understood.

### Blood pressure lowering in patients with central hypertension: a randomized clinical trial [^114eaFEw]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cuff blood pressure (BP) is recommended for guiding hypertension management. However, central BP has been proposed as a superior clinical measurement. This study aimed to determine whether controlling hypertension as measured by central BP was beneficial in reducing left ventricular mass index beyond control of standard cuff hypertension.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, blinded-end point trial was conducted in individuals treated for uncomplicated hypertension with controlled cuff BP (< 140/90 mmHg) but elevated central BP (≥ 0.5 SD above age- and sex-specific normal values). Participants were randomized to 24-months intervention with spironolactone 25 mg/day (n = 148) or usual care control (n = 153). The primary outcome was change in left ventricular mass index measured by cardiac MRI. Cuff and central BPs were measured by clinic, 7-day home and 24-hour ambulatory BPs.

Results

At 24-months, there was a greater reduction in left ventricular mass index (-3.2 [95% CI, -5.0 to -1.3] g/m 2; P = 0.001) with intervention compared with control. Cuff and central BPs were lowered by a similar magnitude across all BP measurement modes (eg, clinic cuff systolic BP, -6.16 [-9.60 to -2.72] mmHg and clinic central systolic BP, -4.96 [-8.06 to -1.86] mmHg; P ≥ 0.48 all). Secondary analyses found that changes in left ventricular mass index correlated to changes in BP, with the magnitude of effect nearly identical for BP measured by cuff (eg, 24-hour systolic BP, β, 0.17 [0.02–0.31] g/m 2) or centrally (24-hour systolic BP, β, 0.16 [0.01–0.32] g/m 2).

Conclusions

Among individuals with central hypertension, spironolactone had beneficial effects in reducing LV mass. Secondary analyses showed that changes in LV mass were equally well associated with lower measured standard cuff BP and central BP.

Summary

Background

In the PATHWAY-2 study of resistant hypertension, spironolactone reduced blood pressure substantially more than conventional antihypertensive drugs. We did three substudies to assess the mechanisms underlying this superiority and the pathogenesis of resistant hypertension.

Methods

PATHWAY-2 was a randomised, double-blind crossover trial done at 14 UK primary and secondary care sites in 314 patients with resistant hypertension. Patients were given 12 weeks of once daily treatment with each of placebo, spironolactone 25–50 mg, bisoprolol 5–10 mg, and doxazosin 4–8 mg and the change in home systolic blood pressure was assessed as the primary outcome. In our three substudies, we assessed plasma aldosterone, renin, and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) as predictors of home systolic blood pressure, and estimated prevalence of primary aldosteronism (substudy 1); assessed the effects of each drug in terms of thoracic fluid index, cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular resistance at seven sites with haemodynamic monitoring facilities (substudy 2); and assessed the effect of amiloride 10–20 mg once daily on clinic systolic blood pressure during an optional 6–12 week open-label runout phase (substudy 3). The PATHWAY-2 trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2008–007149–30, and, number.

Findings

Of the 314 patients in PATHWAY-2, 269 participated in one or more of the three substudies: 126 in substudy 1, 226 in substudy 2, and 146 in substudy 3. Home systolic blood pressure reduction by spironolactone was predicted by ARR (r 2 = 0·13, p < 0·0001) and plasma renin (r 2 = 0·11, p = 0·00024). 42 patients had low renin concentrations (predefined as the lowest tertile of plasma renin), of which 31 had a plasma aldosterone concentration greater than the mean value for all 126 patients (250 pmol/L). Thus, 31 (25% [95% CI 17–33]) of 126 patients were deemed to have inappropriately high aldosterone concentrations. Thoracic fluid content was reduced by 6·8% from baseline (95% CI 4·0 to 8·8; p < 0·0001) with spironolactone, but not other treatments. Amiloride (10 mg once daily) reduced clinic systolic blood pressure by 20·4 mm Hg (95% CI 18·3–22·5), compared with a reduction of 18·3 mm Hg (16·2–20·5) with spironolactone (25 mg once daily). No serious adverse events were recorded, and adverse symptoms were not systematically recorded after the end of the double-blind treatment. Mean plasma potassium concentrations increased from 4·02 mmol/L (95% CI 3·95–4·08) on placebo to 4·50 (4·44–4·57) on amiloride (p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Our results suggest that resistant hypertension is commonly a salt-retaining state, most likely due to inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockade by spironolactone overcomes the salt retention and resistance of hypertension to treatment. Amiloride seems to be as effective an antihypertensive as spironolactone, offering a substitute treatment for resistant hypertension.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^111K3fjM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are a combination of two diuretic agents with different but complementary mechanisms and sites of action, thereby providing additive diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Additionally, the spironolactone component helps to minimize the potassium loss characteristically induced by the thiazide component.

The diuretic effect of spironolactone is mediated through its action as a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, primarily by competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide promotes the excretion of sodium and water primarily by inhibiting their reabsorption in the cortical diluting segment of the distal renal tubule.

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are effective in significantly lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in many patients with essential hypertension, even when aldosterone secretion is within normal limits.

Both spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide reduce exchangeable sodium, plasma volume, body weight, and blood pressure. The diuretic and antihypertensive effects of the individual components are potentiated when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide are given concurrently.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jPqs2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives to spironolactone and use of adjunct agents — Eplerenone, a more selective steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), is a potential alternative to spironolactone, but randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium. When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include beta-blockers (BBs), alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo in adults with resistant hypertension when added to a CCB, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and its side effects of leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

### Patiromer versus placebo to enable spironolactone use in patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease (AMBER): a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117WSszd]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Spironolactone is effective at reducing blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled resistant hypertension. However, the use of spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease can be restricted by hyperkalaemia. We evaluated use of the potassium binder patiromer to allow more persistent use of spironolactone in patients with chronic kidney disease and resistant hypertension.

Methods

In this phase 2 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled participants aged 18 years and older with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 to ≤ 45 mL/min per 1·73 m 2) and uncontrolled resistant hypertension from 62 outpatient centres in ten countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Hungary, Ukraine, France, Germany, South Africa, the UK, and the USA). Patients meeting all eligibility criteria at the final screening visit were stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4·3 to < 4·7 mmol/L vs 4·7 to 5·1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web response system to receive either placebo or patiromer (8·4 g once daily), in addition to open-label spironolactone (starting at 25 mg once daily) and their baseline blood pressure medications. Participants, the study team that administered treatments and measured blood pressure, and the investigators were masked to assigned treatment groups. Dose titrations were permitted after 1 week (patiromer) and 3 weeks (spironolactone). The primary endpoint was the between-group difference at week 12 in the proportion of patients on spironolactone. Efficacy endpoints and safety were assessed in all randomised patients (intention to treat). The study was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03071263.

Findings

Between Feb 13, 2017, and Aug 20, 2018, we screened 574 patients. 295 (51%) of 574 patients met all inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to spironolactone in addition to double-blind treatment with either placebo (n = 148) or patiromer (n = 147). At week 12, 98 (66%) of 148 patients in the placebo group and 126 (86%) of 147 patients in the patiromer group remained on spironolactone (between-group difference 19·5%, 95% CI 10·0–29·0; p < 0·0001). Adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity and occurred in 79 (53%) of 148 patients in the placebo group and 82 (56%) of 147 patients in the patiromer group.

Interpretation

In patients with resistant hypertension and chronic kidney disease, patiromer enabled more patients to continue treatment with spironolactone with less hyperkalaemia. Persistent spironolactone enablement in this population of patients has clinical relevance for the treatment of resistant hypertension.

Spironolactone and PATHWAY-2

In patients with resistant hypertension, the option of adding a fourth antihypertensive drug has been investigated. The crossover trial PATHWAY-2 recently showed spironolactone to be superior to placebo as an add-on in patients with resistant hypertension who had been identified by renin profiling as potential responders to the therapy. Despite the positive results from PATHWAY-2, the Expert Group has discussed whether these results should prompt adding spironolactone as a fourth line treatment in the management of resistant hypertension to define a trial population for device-based proof of concept studies. In the PATHWAY-2 trial, patients were on a low-dose of bendroflumethiazide, a drug less effective than chlorthalidone or indapamide, which may have favoured the BP response to spironolactone; BP response was not analysed per aldosterone levels, body mass index or BP at baseline; the short time (6 weeks) of exposure to the maximum dose of spironolactone (50 mg/d) was insufficient for an accurate assessment of the long-term tolerability of this drug; and there are no data on efficacy and safety in patients with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 since they were excluded from the trial. Moreover, in clinical practise spironolactone has a challenging tolerability profile with higher rates of intolerance than in PATHWAY-2, including gynecomastia and erectile dysfunction, which may cause treatment interruption or termination at the request of the healthcare provider or patient. Indeed, an unexpectedly low rate of side effects occurred in the PATHWAY-2 study, possibly because of the relatively short treatment duration.

Based on these reservations, the European Expert Group felt that there is no need to mandate failure to control BP on spironolactone as an inclusion criteria for resistant hypertension patients in a proof-of-concept trial of device-based hypertension therapies.

MRA versus placebo

Two studies compared MRA to placebo treatment; MRA was effective in reducing SBP and DBP compared to placebo. One study was a cross-over study comparing spironolactone 400 mg to placebo (n = 24) for six weeks. The differences in mean change in SBP and DBP between spironolactone 400 mg and placebo were −33.4 mmHg (95% CI −40.4, −26.4) and −15.8 mmHg (95% CI −19.8, −11.8), respectively. The second study was a parallel study comparing eplerenone 50 mg (n = 49), 100 mg (n = 46) and 200 mg (n = 48) to placebo (n = 50) for eight weeks (Table 1). The differences in mean change in SBP and DBP between eplerenone 200 mg compared to placebo were −8.5 mmHg (95% CI −10.8, −6.2) and −4.5 mmHg (95% CI −6.7, −2.3), respectively.

MRA versus beta-blocker and alpha-2 agonist

One cross-over study compared spironolactone 200–400 mg to oxprenolol 160–640 mg and methyldopa 750–3000 mg for eight weeks. The difference in SBP change between treatment groups was −13.5 mmHg and −13.0 mmHg respectively (Supplementary Table 3). The difference in DBP change was −3.1 mmHg and −0.8 mmHg. SD or CI was not reported.

Adverse effects

### Low dose spironolactone reduces blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a double blind randomized clinical trial [^113gWo32]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with arterial hypertension is particularly pronounced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Blood pressure control is, therefore, decisively important but often not sufficiently achieved.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of low dose spironolactone added to triple therapy for resistant hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes measured by ambulatory monitoring. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effects on glycaemic control and urinary albumin excretion as well as adverse effects.

Methods

In a multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study 119 patients with blood pressure at or above 130/80 mmHg despite triple antihypertensive therapy were included. One tablet of 25 mg spironolactone or placebo was added to previous treatment and increased to two if blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg was not achieved after 4 weeks. Blood pressure was measured by ambulatory monitoring at baseline and after 16 weeks.

Results

The study was completed by 112 patients, 57 randomized to spironolactone and 55 to placebo. Average daytime placebo-corrected blood pressure was reduced by 8.9 (4.7–13.2)/3.7 (1.5–5.8) mmHg. Also office blood pressure, night-time, 24-h and pulse pressures were reduced significantly. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio was significantly reduced in the spironolactone group. Glycaemic control remained unchanged. Hyperkalemia was the most frequent adverse event leading to dose reduction in three cases and discontinuation in one, whereas gynaecomastia was not reported.

Conclusion

Low dose spironolactone exerts significant BP and urinary albumin creatinine ratio lowering effects in high-risk patients with resistant hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for the treatment of low-renin hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114vagTL]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A pathophysiology-based approach to the management of hypertension is promising and may be key to addressing the burden of hypertension. MRA therapy is effective in lowering blood pressure in LRH and may be better than ACEi/ARB. However, further RCTs with a rigorous methodology addressing the limitations highlighted in this review are needed to accurately assess the benefits and risks. Studies with a longer follow-up, data on tolerability and markers of end-organ dysfunction comparing lower dose spironolactone, selective MRA or ENACi to contemporary antihypertensives are needed to support the recognition of LRH as a subtype of hypertension with targeted treatment options.
