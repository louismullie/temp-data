## Question

do you need further work up for subclinical hypothryoidsim

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether further workup is needed for subclinical hypothyroidism and, if so, what that workup should entail. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the biochemical diagnosis and excluding transient causes. Then, I should verify the etiology with thyroid antibodies and consider imaging only when indicated. Next, I will assess progression risk and decide on treatment thresholds. After that, I need to tailor management to special populations such as pregnancy, infertility, and older adults. Finally, I will outline monitoring intervals and summarize a practical algorithm with clear decision points anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before labeling someone with subclinical hypothyroidism, because a single elevated TSH with normal free T4 can reflect transient illness, assay variability, or non-thyroidal illness rather than true thyroid disease; I should repeat TSH and free T4 in 3 to 6 months to document persistence before making a firm diagnosis, and I need to ensure the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis is intact and that there is no recent severe illness or medication effect influencing results [^116XK1nC] [^116vHLh6] [^1129gwkb].

> Wait, let me verify the role of thyroid antibodies in the initial workup; guidelines recommend measuring anti–thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO) in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism because positivity increases the risk of progression to overt hypothyroidism to about 4.3% per year versus 2.6% per year when negative, which helps with prognosis and may influence follow-up intensity, though I should be cautious not to overinterpret antibody status as a treatment trigger in older adults where randomized data have not shown outcome benefits from treating based on antibody positivity alone [^112kECDT] [^1162aCfA] [^111RAXV8] [^113HpyZ9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; I should not order thyroid ultrasound routinely in subclinical hypothyroidism unless there is a palpable goiter, compressive symptoms, or suspicion of nodular disease, because the most common cause is autoimmune thyroiditis and imaging does not change initial management in the absence of structural concerns [^notfound].

> I need to check for secondary causes and medication effects that can elevate TSH or mimic subclinical hypothyroidism, including iodine excess, amiodarone, lithium, recent recovery from non-thyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism; if free T4 is low with inappropriately normal or low TSH, I should consider central hypothyroidism and evaluate accordingly, but otherwise routine additional hormone tests like total T3 or free T3 are not recommended for diagnosing primary hypothyroidism [^116R5pZ2] [^1152vt8m] [^114Kj5JG].

> Next, I should review progression risk and treatment thresholds; patients with TSH persistently above 10 mIU/L have a higher risk of progression and cardiovascular events and are generally considered for levothyroxine therapy, whereas those with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L are often observed unless they are symptomatic, have positive anti-TPO, or have cardiovascular risk factors, and I should remember that up to 37–44% of individuals with mild TSH elevations normalize spontaneously over time, reinforcing the need to confirm persistence before acting [^112XrBR8] [^1168sTdk] [^116e2Ezy] [^111AuoE4] [^111Rqekd].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant or planning pregnancy; I should double-check pregnancy-specific guidance because thresholds and targets differ, with many authorities recommending treatment when TSH is above 2.5 mIU/L in women who are pregnant or undergoing assisted reproduction, and monitoring every 4 weeks through mid-gestation, whereas universal screening remains controversial and case-finding in higher-risk groups is favored; outside pregnancy, age-based nonpregnant cutoffs should be used until pregnancy is achieved [^116y3PNk] [^113uC6tY] [^111wk6iG] [^112UUJgZ].

> Let me consider older adults carefully; TSH rises with age even without thyroid disease, so I should avoid overtreatment in those over 65 with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, and if treatment is initiated for TSH above 10 mIU/L, I should use conservative dosing and monitor closely for iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, given the lack of randomized evidence for benefit and potential harms in this group [^11777Vu1] [^1151QfPg].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence; for untreated subclinical hypothyroidism with TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, repeating TSH and free T4 every 6–12 months is reasonable, whereas TSH above 10 mIU/L or symptomatic patients warrant closer follow-up, and if levothyroxine is started, I should recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks and adjust the dose in small increments to avoid overtreatment [^111HEjaz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said that positive anti-TPO alone mandates treatment in all adults; let me reconsider because contemporary randomized data in older adults did not show improved outcomes when treating antibody-positive subclinical hypothyroidism, so I should not use antibody positivity alone to trigger therapy in older patients, even though it remains a risk marker for progression and may justify closer surveillance [^113HpyZ9] [^111RAXV8].

> Putting this together, yes, further workup is needed for subclinical hypothyroidism, but it is targeted: confirm persistence with repeat TSH and free T4 in 3–6 months, measure anti-TPO antibodies for etiologic and prognostic context, avoid routine imaging unless structural disease is suspected, evaluate for secondary causes and central hypothyroidism when clinically indicated, and then stratify management by TSH magnitude, symptoms, cardiovascular risk, antibody status, age, and pregnancy plans, reserving treatment primarily for TSH above 10 mIU/L or carefully selected symptomatic or higher-risk patients with milder TSH elevations [^116XK1nC] [^112kECDT] [^112XrBR8] [^1168sTdk] [^11777Vu1].

---

Not necessarily. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) **do not need extensive workup** beyond confirming persistent TSH elevation with normal free T4 and assessing thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) [^112kECDT] [^11797df1]. Additional testing is reserved for specific scenarios: **TSH > 10 mIU/L** (higher risk of progression) [^112XrBR8], **symptoms or cardiovascular risk factors** [^1168sTdk], **goiter or nodules** (ultrasound) [^117KaLMs], or **suspicion of secondary/central hypothyroidism** (pituitary imaging) [^114Kj5JG]. Routine lipid panels, cardiac imaging, or other tests are not indicated unless clinically justified. Management is individualized: observe if TSH is 4.5–10 mIU/L and asymptomatic [^113WMKg9]; consider treatment if TSH > 10 mIU/L, symptoms, or cardiovascular risk [^112XrBR8] [^1168sTdk].

---

## Essential diagnostic workup

### Confirm persistent TSH elevation

Confirm persistent TSH elevation by **repeating TSH (and free T4) in 3–6 months** [^116XK1nC] to confirm persistence before labeling SCH, as TSH can fluctuate and ~37% normalize without intervention [^111AuoE4] [^116e2Ezy].

---

### Measure thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb)

Measuring thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) is recommended to **assess autoimmune thyroiditis risk** [^112kECDT]; positive TPOAb increases progression risk to overt hypothyroidism (~4.3%/year vs 2.6%/year if negative) [^1162aCfA] and may influence follow-up frequency and treatment decisions [^1168sTdk].

---

### Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment should include evaluating for **symptoms of hypothyroidism** (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, cognitive changes) and goiter or thyroid nodules on examination [^notfound].

---

## Additional workup: when is it indicated?

### Indications for further evaluation

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended additional workup** |
|-|-|
| TSH > 10 mIU/L | - Evaluate for progression risk [^111RAXV8] <br/> - Consider treatment [^112XrBR8] |
| Symptoms or cardiovascular risk factors | - Lipid panel [^notfound] <br/> - Consider echocardiography if cardiac symptoms [^notfound] |
| Goiter or thyroid nodules | - Thyroid ultrasound [^notfound] <br/> - Fine-needle aspiration if suspicious features [^notfound] |
| Suspicion of secondary/central hypothyroidism | - Pituitary MRI [^notfound] <br/> - Evaluate other pituitary hormones [^notfound] |
| Pregnancy or planning pregnancy | - More aggressive monitoring [^113uC6tY] <br/> - Lower treatment thresholds [^116y3PNk] |

---

### Tests not routinely recommended

Avoid routine testing — lipid panel, echocardiography, or other cardiac imaging — unless clinically indicated by symptoms or cardiovascular risk [^notfound]. Do not routinely order **thyroid ultrasound** without palpable goiter or nodules [^notfound]. Do not routinely measure **total T3 or free T3**, as they are not helpful in SCH [^116R5pZ2].

---

## Clinical implications of further workup

Further workup helps **stratify progression risk** — higher TSH, positive TPOAb, and symptoms increase the likelihood of progression to overt hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1] [^1162aCfA] — and guides treatment decisions, as TSH > 10 mIU/L, symptoms, or cardiovascular risk favor treatment, whereas TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L without symptoms often warrants observation [^112XrBR8] [^1168sTdk]. It also identifies underlying etiologies, such as autoimmune thyroiditis or central hypothyroidism, shaping management and follow-up [^111RAXV8] [^114Kj5JG].

---

## Management implications

- **Observation**: TSH 4.5–10 mIU/L, asymptomatic, no cardiovascular risk factors; reassess every 6–12 months [^11777Vu1].
- **Treatment**: TSH > 10 mIU/L, symptoms, or cardiovascular risk factors; start low-dose levothyroxine (25–75 mcg/day) and titrate to TSH 0.5–2.5 mIU/L [^112XrBR8] [^111zQiJu].
- **Individualized approach**: Consider age, comorbidities, patient preference, and clinical context [^1168sTdk] [^1151QfPg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Confirm persistent TSH elevation**: Repeat TSH and free T4 in 3–6 months [^116XK1nC].
- **Measure TPOAb**: Assess autoimmune thyroiditis risk [^1162aCfA].
- **Clinical assessment**: Evaluate symptoms and examine for goiter/nodules [^notfound].
- **Additional workup**: Only if TSH > 10 mIU/L, symptoms, cardiovascular risk, goiter/nodules, or suspicion of central hypothyroidism [^112XrBR8] [^114Kj5JG].
- **Routine tests not recommended**: Avoid lipid panels, cardiac imaging, ultrasound, or T3 unless indicated [^113XEJES] [^116R5pZ2].

---

Most patients with SCH **do not need extensive workup** beyond confirming persistent TSH elevation, measuring TPOAb, and clinical assessment. Additional testing is reserved for specific clinical scenarios, and management should be individualized based on TSH level, symptoms, and risk factors.

Subclinical thyroid diseases — subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism — are common clinical entities that encompass mild degrees of thyroid dysfunction. The clinical significance of mild thyroid overactivity and underactivity is uncertain, which has led to controversy over the appropriateness of diagnostic testing and possible treatment. In this Seminar, we discuss the definition, epidemiology, differential diagnoses, risks of progression to overt thyroid disease, potential effects on various health outcomes, and management of subclinical hyperthyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Treatment recommendations are based on the degree to which thyroid-stimulating hormone concentrations have deviated from normal and underlying comorbidities. Large-scale randomised trials are urgently needed to inform how to best care for individuals with subclinical thyroid disease.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an asymptomatic condition in which a patient has a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level exceeding the upper threshold of a specified laboratory reference interval (commonly defined as 4.5 mIU/L) but a normal thyroxine (T4) level, and patients with subclinical hypothyroidism are often further classified as having TSH levels between 4.5 and 10.0 mIU/L or greater than 10.0 mIU/L; "overt" hypothyroidism has been defined biochemically by an elevated TSH level and a low T4 level.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: clinical applications [^111trvZ4]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are diagnoses based on laboratory evaluation with few if any clinical signs or symptoms. Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) above the upper limit of the reference range (0.45–4.5 mIU/L) with normal serum FT4 concentration; subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a decrease in serum TSH below the reference range with normal serum FT4 and T3 concentrations. Though these conditions represent the earliest stages of thyroid dysfunction, the benefits of detecting and treating subclinical thyroid disease are not well established. Most persons found to have subclinical thyroid disease will have TSH values between 0.1 and 0.45 mIU/L or between 4.5 and 10 mIU/L, for which the benefits of treatment are not clearly established; treatment may be beneficial in individuals with serum TSH lower than 0.1 mIU/L or higher than 10 mIU/L. This article illustrates approaches to managing patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism through 5 case scenarios that apply the principles of evidence-based medicine. Because of the substantial uncertainty concerning the consequences of untreated subclinical hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as well as the benefit of initiating treatment, patient preferences are important in deciding on management of subclinical disease.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and can be treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have given guidance on how and when to employ thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for the detection of thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction based on a lack of proven benefit and potential harm of treating those with thyroid dysfunction, which is mostly subclinical disease. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, the appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in the practice of clinical medicine. We recommend that thyroid dysfunction should be frequently considered as a potential etiology for many of the nonspecific complaints that physicians face daily. The application and success of safe and effective interventions are dependent on an accurate diagnosis. We, therefore, advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach, based on identifying those persons most likely to have thyroid disease that will benefit from its treatment.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115nFvNi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Thyroid dysfunction definitions — subclinical hyperthyroidism involves TSH below the thyroid reference interval (usually 0.4 mIU/L) with normal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) levels, and it is further classified as low but detectable (about 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L) or undetectable (< 0.1 mIU/L) TSH levels; despite its name, overt hyperthyroidism does not require symptoms and is defined biochemically by a low or undetectable TSH level and an elevated T4 or T3 level.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111w8THM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid disease, a term applied to patients with no or minimal thyroid-related symptoms with abnormal laboratory values, is diagnosed more frequently with the use of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) screening and newer high-sensitivity assays. These are laboratory diagnoses, with subclinical hypothyroidism defined as an elevated TSH with a normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentration, and subclinical hyperthyroidism as a subnormal TSH with normal free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels. Although studies defining which patients require treatment are few, decisions should be individualized based upon laboratory values and symptoms. This article reviews the etiologies, diagnoses, treatments and indications, and monitoring of patients with subclinical thyroid disease.

### Subclinical thyroid disease: scientific review and guidelines for diagnosis and management [^111yYVBa]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels outside the reference range and levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and triiodothyronine (T3) within the reference range are common in clinical practice. The necessity for further evaluation, possible treatment, and the urgency of treatment have not been clearly established.

Objectives

To define subclinical thyroid disease, review its epidemiology, recommend an appropriate evaluation, explore the risks and benefits of treatment and consequences of nontreatment, and determine whether population-based screening is warranted.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biosis, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Guideline Clearing House, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Controlled Trials Register, and several National Health Services (UK) databases were searched for articles on subclinical thyroid disease published between 1995 and 2002. Articles published before 1995 were recommended by expert consultants.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

A total of 195 English-language or translated papers were reviewed. Editorials, individual case studies, studies enrolling fewer than 10 patients, and nonsystematic reviews were excluded. Information related to authorship, year of publication, number of subjects, study design, and results were extracted and formed the basis for an evidence report, consisting of tables and summaries of each subject area.

Data Synthesis

The strength of the evidence that untreated subclinical thyroid disease is associated with clinical symptoms and adverse clinical outcomes was assessed and recommendations for clinical practice developed. Data relating the progression of subclinical to overt hypothyroidism were rated as good, but data relating treatment to prevention of progression were inadequate to determine a treatment benefit. Data relating a serum TSH level higher than 10 mIU/L to elevations in serum cholesterol were rated as fair but data relating to benefits of treatment were rated as insufficient. All other associations of symptoms and benefit of treatment were rated as insufficient or absent. Data relating a serum TSH concentration lower than 0.1 mIU/L to the presence of atrial fibrillation and progression to overt hyperthyroidism were rated as good, but no data supported treatment to prevent these outcomes. Data relating restoration of the TSH level to within the reference range with improvements in bone mineral density were rated as fair. Data addressing all other associations of subclinical hyperthyroid disease and adverse clinical outcomes or treatment benefits were rated as insufficient or absent. Subclinical hypothyroid disease in pregnancy is a special case and aggressive case finding and treatment in pregnant women can be justified.

Conclusions

Data supporting associations of subclinical thyroid disease with symptoms or adverse clinical outcomes or benefits of treatment are few. The consequences of subclinical thyroid disease (serum TSH 0.1–0.45 mIU/L or 4.5–10.0 mIU/L) are minimal and we recommend against routine treatment of patients with TSH levels in these ranges. There is insufficient evidence to support population-based screening. Aggressive case finding is appropriate in pregnant women, women older than 60 years, and others at high risk for thyroid dysfunction.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism [^116BQ3o2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

These clinical practice guidelines summarize the recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists for the diagnostic evaluation of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and for treatment strategies in patients with these disorders. The sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) assay has become the single best screening test for hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and in most outpatient clinical situations, the serum TSH is the most sensitive test for detecting mild thyroid hormone excess or deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with Graves' disease include thyroidectomy (rarely used now in the United States), antithyroid drugs (frequently associated with relapses), and radioactive iodine (currently the treatment of choice). In clinical hypothyroidism, the standard treatment is levothyroxine replacement, which must be tailored to the individual patient. Awareness of subclinical thyroid disease, which often remains undiagnosed, is emphasized, as is a system of care that incorporates regular follow-up surveillance by one physician as well as education and involvement of the patient.

### A stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism [^115eGybG]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review a stepwise approach to the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism.

Methods

English-language articles regarding clinical management of subclinical hyperthyroidism published between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed.

Results

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is encountered on a daily basis in clinical practice. When evaluating patients with a suppressed serum thyrotropin value, it is important to exclude other potential etiologies such as overt triiodothyronine toxicosis, drug effect, nonthyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism. In younger patients with mild thyrotropin suppression, it is acceptable to perform testing again in 3 to 6 months to assess for persistence before performing further diagnostic testing. In older patients or patients with thyrotropin values less than 0.1 mIU/L, diagnostic testing should proceed without delay. Persistence of thyrotropin suppression is more typical of nodular thyroid autonomy, whereas thyroiditis and mild Graves disease frequently resolve spontaneously. The clinical consequences of subclinical hyperthyroidism, such as atrial dysrhythmia, accelerated bone loss, increased fracture rate, and higher rates of cardiovascular mortality, are dependent on age and severity. The decision to treat subclinical hyperthyroidism is directly tied to an assessment of the potential for clinical consequences in untreated disease. Definitive therapy is generally selected for patients with nodular autonomous function, whereas antithyroid drug therapy is more appropriate for mild, persistent Graves disease.

Conclusion

The presented stepwise approach to the care of patients presenting with an isolated suppression of serum thyrotropin focuses on the differential diagnosis, a prediction of the likelihood of persistence, an assessment of potential risks posed to the patient, and, finally, a personalized choice of therapy.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism [^11777Vu1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclinical hypothyroidism:

- **Definition**: Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined by elevated serum TSH levels with normal circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, indicating mild thyroid dysfunction. It is a biochemical diagnosis made through thyroid function testing and is most prevalent in women and older adults. The condition is graded as mild (TSH < 10 mU/L) or moderate (TSH ≥ 10 mU/L).
- **Pathophysiology**: Autoimmunity is the most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism.
- **Epidemiology**: Subclinical hypothyroidism affects up to 10% of adults in iodine-sufficient populations, with prevalence increasing with age and occurring more frequently in women. The condition is often transient, with many individuals reverting to normal thyroid function over time. Age-related increases in TSH levels without true thyroid disease may contribute to overestimation of its prevalence.
- **Disease course**: Subclinical hypothyroidism, particularly grade 1, is usually asymptomatic and rarely associated with classic hypothyroid or neuropsychiatric symptoms. When symptoms occur, they are generally mild and more likely in grade 2 disease, presenting as subtle memory or mood disturbances. In older adults, hypothyroid symptoms are often absent even in overt disease, and QoL is typically similar to that of euthyroid individuals. About 2.5% of patients progress to clinically overt hypothyroidism each year, with a higher rate of progression in patients with thyroid autoantibodies and higher thyroid stimulating hormone levels. Thyroid function normalizes spontaneously in up to 40% cases.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Subclinical hypothyroidism in younger patients (< 65 years of age) is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, HF and cerebrovascular accident.

Hypothyroidism epidemiology and definitions — hypothyroidism may be either subclinical or overt, defined by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) levels; subclinical hypothyroidism is characterized by a serum TSH above the upper reference limit with a normal free T4 and is only applicable when thyroid function has been stable for weeks or more, the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is normal, and there is no recent or ongoing severe illness, whereas an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, with a subnormal free T4 characterizes overt hypothyroidism.

Anti-thyroid antibody testing — subclinical hypothyroidism: Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) measurements should be considered when evaluating patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (Grade B, BEL 1), and if anti-thyroid antibodies are positive, hypothyroidism occurs at 4.3% per year versus 2.6% per year when negative; therefore, the presence of positive TPOAb may or may not influence the decision to treat.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^112UUJgZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Women attempting pregnancy — screening guidance states that universal screening of thyroid function is not recommended, whereas "aggressive case finding" with TSH screening can be considered for patients at increased risk of overt hypothyroidism, including those with autoimmune disease, psychiatric disorder, family history of thyroid disease, history of neck radiation, prior thyroid dysfunction or surgery, signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction, or palpable thyroid abnormalities. There is insufficient evidence to use pregnancy thresholds for TSH in this group, and defined age-based nonpregnant cutoffs should be used until pregnancy is achieved.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction — tests and interval: The serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is the primary screening test for thyroid dysfunction, and multiple tests should be done over a 3- to 6-month interval to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 levels) and "overt" (abnormal T4 levels) thyroid dysfunction. The optimal screening interval for thyroid dysfunction (if one exists) is unknown.

### The thyroid – too much and too little across the ages. the consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction [^112BNBRM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Mild thyroid dysfunction is common, and more prevalent than overt hyper- and hypothyroidism. Subclinical (mild) thyroid dysfunction is a biochemical entity characterized by an abnormality of serum TSH associated with normal serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is thus defined as low or suppressed serum TSH with normal serum-free T4 and T3, while subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as raised serum TSH with normal circulating T4. These biochemical abnormalities are part of the much wider spectrum of thyroid dysfunction which includes overt hyperthyroidism and overt hypothyroidism, but by no means always indicate underlying thyroid disease. There is much debate about the significance of mild abnormalities of thyroid function in terms of symptoms and potential associations with long-term morbidity and mortality and hence much debate about whether to screen for these abnormalities, and, once identified, whether to treat or monitor, and if so, how? Our knowledge base has increased significantly in recent years, principally because studies of large cohorts have begun to define the epidemiology and associations of mild thyroid dysfunction (including short-term and long-term outcomes) and a small but increasing number of randomized-controlled intervention studies have been reported. There is, however, much to learn about these disorders and, given their prevalence, their impact on health.

### Screening for subclinical thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^113M5vsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is a risk factor for developing symptomatic thyroid disease. Advocates of screening argue that early treatment can prevent serious morbidity in individuals who are found to have laboratory evidence of subclinical thyroid dysfunction.

Purpose

This article focuses on whether it is useful to order a thyroid function test for patients who have no history of thyroid disease and have few or no signs or symptoms of thyroid dysfunction.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search, supplemented by searches of EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, reference lists, and a local database of thyroid-related articles.

Study Selection

Controlled treatment studies that used thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels as an inclusion criterion and reported quality of life, symptoms, or lipid level outcomes were selected. Observational studies of the prevalence, progression, and consequences of subclinical thyroid dysfunction were also reviewed.

Data Extraction

The quality of each trial was assessed by using preset criteria, and information about setting, patients, interventions, and outcomes was abstracted.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of unsuspected thyroid disease is lowest in men and highest in older women. Evidence regarding the efficacy of treatment in patients found by screening to have subclinical thyroid dysfunction is inconclusive. No trials of treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism have been done. Several small, randomized trials of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism have been done, but the results are inconclusive except in patients who have a history of treatment of Graves disease, a subgroup that is not a target of screening in the general population. Data on the adverse effects of broader use of L-thyroxine are sparse.

Conclusion

It is uncertain whether treatment will improve quality of life in otherwise healthy patients who have abnormal TSH levels and normal free thyroxine levels.

Evidence quality and research needs in SCH — Most of the evidence advocating for screening and treatment of SCH in women with infertility or pregnancy is based on low-quality observational data and one clinical trial, which should be withdrawn because of significant concerns over data integrity. Additional clinical trials evaluating the treatment of SCH to improve offspring neurocognitive development are unlikely to change the evidence that screening and treatment do not provide benefits, whereas additional clinical trials evaluating the screening and treatment of antithyroid antibodies and pregnancy outcomes are needed, and studies in infertile patients and in patients receiving IVF therapies could result in a change in recommendations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^112s547R]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothyroidism has multiple etiologies and manifestations. Appropriate treatment requires an accurate diagnosis and is influenced by coexisting medical conditions. This paper describes evidence-based clinical guidelines for the clinical management of hypothyroidism in ambulatory patients.

Methods

The development of these guidelines was commissioned by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) in association with American Thyroid Association (ATA). AACE and the ATA assembled a task force of expert clinicians who authored this article. The authors examined relevant literature and took an evidence-based medicine approach that incorporated their knowledge and experience to develop a series of specific recommendations and the rationale for these recommendations. The strength of the recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting each was rated according to the approach outlined in the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Protocol for Standardized Production of Clinical Guidelines-2010 update.

Results

Topics addressed include the etiology, epidemiology, clinical and laboratory evaluation, management, and consequences of hypothyroidism. Screening, treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and areas for future research are also covered.

Conclusions

Fifty-two evidence-based recommendations and subrecommendations were developed to aid in the care of patients with hypothyroidism and to share what the authors believe is current, rational, and optimal medical practice for the diagnosis and care of hypothyroidism. A serum thyrotropin is the single best screening test for primary thyroid dysfunction for the vast majority of outpatient clinical situations. The standard treatment is replacement with L-thyroxine. The decision to treat subclinical hypothyroidism when the serum thyrotropin is less than 10 mIU/L should be tailored to the individual patient.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: a review of the clinical literature [^117EwFyN]. Endocrine Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCHyper) is a biochemical diagnosis characterized by a decreased serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. Because SCHyper can be resolved, it is recommended to repeat serum TSH, T3, and T4 concentrations in 3 to 6 months before confirming a diagnosis of SCHyper to consider treatment. Proposed grading systems distinguish between mild (TSH, 0.1–0.4 mIU/L) and severe SCHyper (TSH, < 0.1 mIU/L) and are used alongside patients' age and the presence of risk factors and symptoms to guide treatment. Appropriate evaluation includes an investigation of the underlying cause and assessment of an individual's risk factors to determine the necessity and type of treatment that may be recommended. SCHyper may be associated with increased risks of cardiovascular-related adverse outcomes, bone loss, and in some studies, cognitive decline. Treatment may include observation without therapy, initiation of antithyroid medications, or pursuit of radioiodine therapy or thyroid surgery. Considerations for treatment include the SCHyper etiology, anticipated long-term natural history of the condition, potential benefits of correcting the thyroid dysfunction, and risks and benefits of each treatment option. The purpose of this overview is to provide a guide for clinicians in evaluating and managing SCHyper in the routine clinical practice.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined as a normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The thyroid-stimulating hormone value is typically measured in a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU per mL (0.01 mU per L). Subclinical hyperthyroidism may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Persons with subclinical hyperthyroidism usually do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, a physical examination performed and thyroid function tests conducted as part of an assessment of patients for subclinical hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the possible deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs (e.g., heart, bone). A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to 12 months in an effort to induce a remission. Further research regarding the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

Subclinical thyroid diseases are defined by abnormal serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels associated with normal thyroid hormone concentrations. The diagnosis of these conditions depends on defining the 'normal' euthyroid TSH range; in this review, arguments for and against lowering the upper limit of TSH are summarised. Although, subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism are frequently encountered, their long-term consequences are debated due to conflicting results from many observational studies. The causes, effects and outcomes of treatment of both subclinical diseases are described, and the direction of future research in these conditions is outlined.

Screening for thyroid dysfunction before or during pregnancy: Whether to universally screen for thyroid disease either before or during pregnancy remains controversial. Untreated overt hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are associated with adverse obstetrical and fetal outcomes. However, overt thyroid dysfunction is less common than subclinical dysfunction and is frequently identified by clinical assessment at the time of presentation. Thus, the most notable impact of a universal screening mandate for thyroid dysfunction would be the identification of the large proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (mild elevations in serum TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels).

### The management of subclinical hyperthyroidism by thyroid specialists [^1126fhy5]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a relatively common condition for which prospectively derived evidenced-based management guidelines do not exist. We have conducted a case-based mail survey to solicit opinions from members of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) about various issues that arise in the management of patients with this disorder. The survey was completed and returned by 185 of 300 (62%) of the original survey recipients. Four hypothetical cases varying in age, thyrotropin (TSH) level and underlying etiology were presented. The majority of respondents recommended further evaluation of all cases, most commonly choosing a radioactive iodine uptake (42%-71%), thyroid scan (39%-68%) and antithyroid (TPO/Tg) antibodies (49%-55%) as the additional tests to be ordered. The large majority (84%) recommended observation rather than active treatment for a young patient with a low but detectable serum TSH level. A small majority also recommended observation alone for a young woman with an undetectable serum TSH level (58%) and for an older woman with a low but detectable serum TSH value (63%). However, the majority (66%) favored treating an older woman with an undetectable serum TSH. When treatment was advised in the patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, the respondents strongly favored anti-thyroid drugs when the etiology was Graves' disease and radioactive iodine when the etiology was toxic nodular thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate evidence-based guidelines, it is hoped that this survey of expert opinions may provide useful guidance for physicians providing care for patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism.

### The change in thyroid function categories with time in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ByBkX]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a form of thyroid dysfunction where the serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and/or triiodothyronine (T3) are within the reference range, while the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is slightly elevated. The etiology of SCH is complex and can be induced by autoimmune diseases, surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, iodine excess, and medication. Since SCH is often asymptomatic, it is frequently discovered incidentally during routine blood tests or other disease screenings. However, due to significant fluctuations in TSH levels, it usually requires 2–3 months to repeat measurements of TSH and free thyroxine (FT4) to confirm the diagnosis. Due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations of this disease, a considerable number of patients can maintain good physical condition even without treatment, and only a small number of SCH patients may progress to overt hypothyroidism (OH). Even if it does not progress to OH, many research suggested that the disease is also related to cardiovascular symptoms, dyslipidemia, cognitive impairment and depression. For most patients, we cannot currently determine the outcome of their disease. Therefore, it is essential to identify risk factors for disease progression and implement specific management strategies for patients with different levels of risk.

According to previous studies, patients with SCH mainly exhibit three outcomes: return to euthyroidism (EU), persistent SCH, and progression to OH or experiencing significant hypothyroidism-related symptoms. Therefore, we attempt to elucidate the occurrence of three different outcomes in SCH patients who have not been treated by L-T4 and summarize the research data in the original literature to stratify the patients as much as possible to clarify the impact of age, TSH level, thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and gender on the prognosis of patients with SCH.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism: a review [^1151QfPg]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Subclinical hypothyroidism, defined as an elevated serum thyrotropin (often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH) level with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) affects up to 10% of the adult population.

Observations

Subclinical hypothyroidism is most often caused by autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis. However, serum thyrotropin levels rise as people without thyroid disease age; serum thyrotropin concentrations may surpass the upper limit of the traditional reference range of 4 to 5 mU/L among elderly patients. This phenomenon has likely led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in persons older than 70 years. In patients who have circulating thyroid peroxidase antibodies, there is a greater risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, coronary artery disease events, and mortality from coronary heart disease. In addition, middle-aged patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may have cognitive impairment, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, and altered mood. In the absence of large randomized trials showing benefit from levothyroxine therapy, the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. However, levothyroxine therapy may be associated with iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, especially in elderly patients, and there is no evidence that it is beneficial in persons aged 65 years or older.

Conclusions and Relevance

Subclinical hypothyroidism is common and most individuals can be observed without treatment. Treatment might be indicated for patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and serum thyrotropin levels of 10 mU/L or higher or for young and middle-aged individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism and symptoms consistent with mild hypothyroidism.

### How selective are the new guidelines for treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism for patients with thyrotropin levels at or below 10 mIU / L? [^114WgkfX]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

By consensus, a thyrotropin (TSH) level persistently > 10mIU/L is an indication for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). Controversy exists regarding patients whose TSH level is elevated but < 10mIU/L. Recently, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) published their position about factors that should be considered in the decision on treating SCH. This study evaluated the frequency of these factors among adult (non-pregnant) women with SCH whose TSH levels are ≤ 10mIU/L.

Methods

The presence of the conditions that should be considered for the treatment of SCH according to ATA and AACE was evaluated in 252 women who were diagnosed with SCH and had TSH levels ≤ 10mIU/L. Pregnant women were excluded.

Results

Antithyroperoxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) were detected in 137 (54.3%) women. A high cardiovascular risk was observed in 43 (17%) women. Eighty (31.7%) women who were not at high cardiovascular risk presented at least one classical risk factor (arterial hypertension, elevated level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol or low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, smoking, or first-degree family history of premature coronary artery disease). At least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism that could not be explained by another condition was observed in 180 (71.4%) women. Two hundred thirty-two (92%) women had positive TPOAbs, or at least one classical cardiovascular risk factor, or at least one symptom or sign of hypothyroidism.

Conclusions

According to the new ATA and AACE guidelines, L-T4 therapy would be considered for 92% of women with SCH and TSH ≤ 10mIU/L.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in the infertile female population: a guideline [^114BjMn1]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) screening during pregnancy and infertility — There is moderate evidence that universal screening of thyroid function during pregnancy does not result in a decrease in adverse outcomes, and there is moderate-quality evidence to support a case-finding screening strategy targeted at specific groups of patients who are at increased risk of overt hypothyroidism. Universal screening of thyroid function during pregnancy is not recommended (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate), whereas screening with a serum thyrotropin level is recommended in patients at increased risk of overt hypothyroidism (strength of evidence: B; strength of recommendation: moderate). On the basis of current evidence, it is not recommended to screen or treat for asymptomatic SCH in women with infertility or pregnancy.

### A 2013 survey of clinical practice patterns in the management of primary hypothyroidism [^112QYPbZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

In 2012, comprehensive clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were published regarding the management of hypothyroidism.

Objective

We sought to document current practices in the management of primary hypothyroidism and compare these results with recommendations made in the 2012 American Thyroid Association (ATA)/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) hypothyroidism CPGs. In addition, we sought to examine differences in management among international members of U.S.-based endocrine societies and to compare survey results with those obtained from a survey of ATA members performed 12 years earlier.

Methods

Clinical members of The Endocrine Society (TES), the ATA, and the AACE were asked to take a web-based survey consisting of 30 questions dealing with testing, treatment, and modulating factors in the management of primary hypothyroidism.

Results

In total, 880 respondents completed the survey, including 618 members of TES, 582 AACE members, and 208 ATA members. North American respondents accounted for 67.6%, Latin American 9.7%, European 9.2%, Asia and Oceania 8.1%, and Africa and Middle East 5.5%. Overt hypothyroidism would be treated using l-T4 alone by 99.2% of respondents; 0.8% would use combination l-T4 and liothyronine (l-T3) therapy. Generic l-T4 would be used by 49.3% and a brand name by 49.9%. The rate of replacement would be gradual (38.5%); an empiric dose, adjusted to achieve target (33.6%); or a calculated full replacement dose (27.8%). A target TSH of 1.0 to 1.9 mU/L was favored in the index case, but 3.0 to 3.9 mU/L was the most commonly selected TSH target for an octogenarian. Persistent hypothyroid symptoms despite achieving a target TSH would prompt testing for other causes by 84.3% of respondents, a referral to primary care by 11.3%, and a change to l-T4 plus l-T3 therapy by 3.6%. Evaluation of persistent symptoms would include measurement of T3 levels by 21.9% of respondents. Subclinical disease with a TSH 5.0 to 10.0 mU/L would be treated without further justification by 21.3% of respondents, or in the presence of positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies (62.3%), hypothyroid symptoms (60.9%), high low-density lipoprotein (52.9%), or goiter (46.6%). The TSH target for a newly pregnant patient was < 2.5 mU/L for 96.1% of respondents, with 63.5% preferring a TSH target < 1.5 mU/L. Thyroid hormone levels would be checked every 4 weeks during pregnancy by 67.7% and every 8 weeks by an additional 21.4%. A hypothyroid patient with TSH of 0.5 mU/L who becomes pregnant would receive an immediate l-T4 dose increase by only 36.9% of respondents.

Conclusion

The current survey of clinical endocrinologists catalogs current practice patterns in the management of hypothyroidism and demonstrates 1) a nearly exclusive preference for l-T4 alone as initial therapy, 2) the widespread use of age-specific TSH targets for replacement therapy, 3) a low threshold for treating mild thyroid failure, 4) meticulous attention to TSH targets in the pregnant and prepregnant woman, and 5) a highly variable approach to both the rate and means of restoring euthyroidism for overt disease. Both alignment and focal divergence from recent CPGs are demonstrated.

### Subclinical hypothyroidism in childhood, treatment or only follow-up? [^117J3UAm]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although SH in childhood is a frequent issue and a matter of concern between primary care pediatrics, it seems to be a benign and remitting condition; based on our results and in comparison, with the literature, expectant behavior is the best option, always individualizing each patient. Perhaps repeating a second determination by the primary care pediatrician of TSH and fT4 in 1–3 months and if alteration persists refer to specialist many cases could be resolved and, therefore, save time and resources.

However, in the case of pediatric SH, prospective studies are lacking to determine a sensitive and specific level of TSH to predict the progression to hypothyroidism. It is important to determine if it is a process with negative or positive autoimmunity, since on this latter case, the probability of progression to hypothyroidism is greater. As seen in the current study, baseline TSH, female sex and the presence of thyroid autoimmunity were the best predictors of the evolution to SH over time.

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MTEEc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening for thyroid dysfunction — population is nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults; recommendation is "No recommendation. Grade: I statement (insufficient evidence)". Risk factors for an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level include female sex, advancing age, white race, type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome, family history of thyroid disease, goiter, previous hyperthyroidism, and external-beam radiation in the head and neck area; risk factors for a low TSH level include female sex; advancing age; black race; low iodine intake; personal or family history of thyroid disease; and ingestion of iodine-containing drugs, such as amiodarone. The primary screening test is serum TSH testing, and multiple tests over 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out abnormal findings; follow-up testing of serum thyroxine (T4) levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4 level) and overt (abnormal T4 level) thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is treated with oral T4 monotherapy (levothyroxine sodium); consensus is lacking on the appropriate point for clinical intervention, especially for TSH levels < 10.0 mIU/L. Hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medications (e.g., methimazole) or nonreversible thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., radioactive iodine or surgery), and treatment is generally recommended for patients with a TSH level that is undetectable or < 0.1 mIU/L, particularly those with overt Graves disease or nodular thyroid disease. The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant, asymptomatic adults.

### Changes in thyroid function and evolution of subclinical thyroid disease in older men [^114oiDsF]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

We demonstrated an exponential increase in the risk of subclinical or overt hypothyroidism over 8 years as baseline TSH increased. Whereas other authors examining this question have identified TSH break‐points above which risk seems to increase progressively, our data suggest there is no clear cut‐point and this is more in keeping with the data of Asvold et al. Our ROC analysis indicated a TSH cut‐point at 2.34 mU/L would have optimal sensitivity and specificity for predicting future hypothyroidism. This is consistent with the value of 2.3 mU/L identified as the optimal threshold from ROC analysis for risk of future hypothyroidism in men in the Busselton studyand similar to the values of 2.0 and 2.6 mU/L identified for women in the Whickham and Busselton studies. Our results also identified that euthyroid men with TSH ≥ 2.85 mU/L have > 20% chance of developing hypothyroidism over 8 years, suggesting that closer monitoring for thyroid disease should be considered in men with TSH results in this range. The probability for hypothyroidism at any given TSH value appears to be higher than for the participants in other studies, most likely because of the older age of the men in our study.

The US Preventative Services Task Force published a comprehensive evaluation of population screening for thyroid disease in 2015, finding that 'the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for thyroid dysfunction in nonpregnant asymptomatic adults'. This was based upon the lack of evidence that screening could produce clinically significant changes in BMI, blood pressure, bone mineral density or lipid profile. An evidence review in 2021 did not change this conclusion. The UK NICE guideline for assessment and management of thyroid disease also suggests that thyroid function testing be reserved in adults with a clinical suspicion of thyroid dysfunction or for patients with type 1 diabetes, atrial fibrillation or psychiatric disorders. Within Australia, recent recommendations do not specifically address the question of whether asymptomatic patients should be screened, instead focussing on diagnosing hypothyroidism appropriately in those with symptoms, which are often mild and nonspecific.

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is defined as an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level (reference range: 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL) and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is about 4 to 8.5 percent, and may be as high as 20 percent in women older than 60 years. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is found in approximately 2 percent of the population. Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, but screening is recommended for high-risk populations. There is good evidence that subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with progression to overt disease. Patients with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 microU per mL have a higher incidence of elevated serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations; however, evidence is lacking for other associations. There is insufficient evidence that treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial. A serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level of less than 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. There is little evidence that early treatment alters the clinical course.

### Association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk [^112dTyB1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the association between endogenous subclinical thyroid dysfunction and fracture risk?

Findings

In this cohort study of 10 946 adults, 93% had euthyroidism, 2.6% had subclinical hyperthyroidism, and 4.4% had subclinical hypothyroidism. Those with subclinical hyperthyroidism had a 34% higher risk of fracture compared with individuals with euthyroidism.

Meaning

This study suggests that subclinical hyperthyroidism was an independent risk factor associated with fracture, highlighting a potential role for more aggressive screening and monitoring of these patients to prevent bone mineral disease.

### The change in thyroid function categories with time in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Rqekd]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Overall, in this systematic review of 8 studies involving 1,859 participants, many patients maintained persistent SCH (45.4%) or returned to EU (44.4%) during the study period, while 10.1% of patients progressed to OH. This indicates that the natural outcome of SCH in the general population is relatively favorable and further underscores the importance of distinguishing high-risk individuals for targeted treatment.

In 1995, the Whickham survey recorded the prevalence of thyroid diseases in adult populations in the community, suggesting that elevated TSH and positive antibodies may be risk factors for the progression of hypothyroidism. Another 13-year longitudinal study also confirmed that TSH levels combined with thyroid antibodies can provide a clinically useful assessment of the long-term risk of hypothyroidism. However, considering the substantial variability in TSH levels, the controversy surrounding the use of TSH measurements for diagnosing SCH remains a significant concern. A five-year network follow-up study was conducted in 2007 and found that over 50% of patients with elevated or decreased serum TSH levels exhibited normal levels during repeated measurements. Our results verified that patients with TSH ≥ 10mU/L were more prone to disease progression. In addition, compared to TPOAb-negative patients, TPOAb-positive patients were more likely to progress to OH. Therefore, in TPOAb-negative patients with TSH ranging from 4.5 to 9.9mU/L, monitoring may not be as frequent due to the low rate of progression to OH. However, we found no association between gender and SCH outcomes, which is consistent with some studies, but further validation is needed in future research. To enhance the precision of patient management, it is recommended to engage in repeated monitoring of TSH levels before initiating treatment. Additionally, since TSH levels are influenced by diurnal rhythms, peaking between 11 PM and 4 AM and subsequently reaching low and stable serum levels after 11 in the morning, future follow-up studies should strive to ensure consistency in TSH measurement times as much as possible. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of research in this field, it is crucial to emphasize the changes in FT4 levels during disease progression. Among the studies we included, only a few mentioned this aspect, and due to data inconsistencies, we were unable to perform a categorized analysis. This stands as a significant limitation of our article. We eagerly anticipate that future research endeavors will prioritize the assessment of FT4 variations alongside TSH, thereby contributing new evidence to this area.

### Thyroid antibodies and levothyroxine effects in subclinical hypothyroidism: a pooled analysis of two randomized controlled trials [^113HpyZ9]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

In clinical practice, the utility of measuring antithyroid antibodies remains controversial, as reflected by different recommendations in international guidelines, with two guidelines suggesting treatment in the presence of positive antibodies to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism and another guideline not mentioning antibody status as an indication for treatment. Our analysis showed no clear evidence for levothyroxine treatment in older adults with SHypo and positive anti‐TPO on a large range of patient‐relevant outcomes, underlining that anti‐TPO in SHypo should not guide treatment decisions in older adults. While we could not assess the long‐term impact on progression to overt hypothyroidism due to limited follow‐up duration, the rate of progression has been described as relatively low (4.3%/year for positive antibodies vs. 2.6%/year for negative antibodies) based on studies with 10–20 years of follow‐up, and it may not be of substantial clinical relevance in an ageing population. Some studies have also shown an increase in TSH in older adults, which has not been associated with clinical outcomes in observational studies. Our study now adds interventional data that treatment of Shypo is not associated with better outcomes — also in those with elevated anti‐TPO — and underscores the interpretation that treatment threshold in older adults could be safely raised. It might be argued that therapy might also start later when overt hypothyroidism (or important symptoms) developed by following TSH values. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events differed by anti‐TPO status; this is in line with evidence from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which found no correlation of anti‐TPO with cardiovascular disease risk in SHypo, and it further adds against using anti‐TPO to guide treatment decisions.

### Changes in thyroid function and evolution of subclinical thyroid disease in older men [^114mr4hT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Overt hypothyroidism has been found to have profound effects on cardiovascular health, however, subclinical hypothyroidism has remained more controversial as a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Recent meta‐analyses of epidemiological studies have produced inconsistent results, particularly regarding the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and all‐cause mortality. This issue assumes greater importance for older men. Our study found that a third of older men who had subclinical hypothyroidism progressed to becoming overtly hypothyroid. Higher TSH values were associated with a greater risk of developing thyroid dysfunction and of those who were initially euthyroid, men with a TSH > 2.85 mU/L had more than a 20% chance of developing subclinical or overt hypothyroidism over a 9‐year period. These findings suggest that further research is required to examine the utility of systematic screening of thyroid function tests in the older male population, particularly for those with elevated baseline TSH values.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — initial L‑thyroxine dosing: With initial thyroid hormone replacement, replacement therapy requires approximately 1.6 μg/kg of L‑thyroxine daily; patients who are athyreotic and those with central hypothyroidism may require higher doses, while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism or after treatment for Graves' disease may require less. In subclinical hypothyroidism, doses of 25–75 μg daily are usually sufficient for achieving euthyroid levels. One randomized controlled trial assigned starting doses by baseline thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as 25 μg for TSH 4.0–8.0 mIU/L, 50 μg for TSH 8–12 mIU/L, and 75 μg for TSH > 12 mIU/L, and after 2 months only minimal further adjustments were required to achieve euthyroidism.

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and antibody testing — AITDs are estimated to be 5–10 times more common in women than men, and in the Whickham survey 5% of women and 1% of men had both positive antibody tests and a serum TSH value > 6; many patients with chronic autoimmune thyroiditis are biochemically euthyroid, but approximately 75% have elevated anti-thyroid antibody titers; in NHANES, thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were positive in 10.4% and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) in 11.3%, were more common in women and increased with age, and only positive TPOAb tests were significantly associated with hypothyroidism; elevated TPOAb in subclinical hypothyroidism predicts progression to overt hypothyroidism at 4.3% per year versus 2.6% per year without elevated TPOAb titers; several professional societies and many clinical endocrinologists endorse measurement of TPOAbs in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, and in patients with a diffuse, firm goiter, TPOAb should be measured to identify autoimmune thyroiditis.

### Is annual surveillance of all treated hypothyroid patients necessary? [^116uCvh4]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Treated hypothyroid patients require regular clinical and biochemical surveillance. Annual surveillance is currently recommended with no evidence to support this practice. Our study has shown that 18 monthly surveillance may be adequate in the long term follow-up of patients less than 60 years of age on a stable thyroxine dose of 100–150 μg/day. Implementing this strategy has potential for cost saving and reduction of workload in health services.
