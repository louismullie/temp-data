## Question

How should an inpatient with a new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and new-onset vision loss be managed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage an inpatient with a new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and new-onset vision loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the MS diagnosis and characterizing whether the vision loss is typical optic neuritis versus an atypical mimic. Then, I should verify the urgent imaging and ophthalmologic assessments needed. Next, I will plan acute relapse treatment and escalation if needed. After that, I must consider early disease-modifying therapy (DMT) initiation, pretreatment workup, and patient counseling. Finally, I will outline monitoring, MRI surveillance, treatment response and switching, discharge planning, and special circumstances like pregnancy, pediatrics, and progressive phenotypes to ensure comprehensive inpatient-to-outpatient continuity of care.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis framework and avoid premature closure. I need to ensure the 2017 McDonald criteria are properly applied to demonstrate dissemination in space and time or acceptable surrogates such as CSF oligoclonal bands, while keeping in mind the risk of misdiagnosis if the criteria are misapplied, especially in optic neuritis–heavy cohorts where specificity can be challenging if context is ignored [^115exA7U] [^115yeq7M]. Hold on, I should verify that earlier diagnostic formulations are not being conflated; the 2001 panel criteria emphasized MRI integration and did not use legacy terms like "probable MS", which were abandoned, so I need to anchor decisions in the current criteria and evidence base rather than older nomenclature [^113LtoZe].

> Next, I will characterize the optic neuritis phenotype because this determines both the differential and the urgency of additional testing. Typical MS-related optic neuritis is often unilateral with retrobulbar pain and mild-to-moderate vision loss, whereas atypical features such as bilateral severe loss, optic disc hemorrhages, longitudinally extensive lesions, chiasmatic or perineural involvement, or profound disc edema should prompt consideration of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or MOG antibody disease (MOGAD), not classic MS relapse; I should confirm these red flags carefully before proceeding [^111SDxEX]. I need to check the ophthalmologic examination elements: visual acuity, color vision, fields, funduscopy, and I will add optical coherence tomography to quantify retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layer damage as a structural correlate and for longitudinal prognostication [^113VZt9W].

> I will now examine the imaging plan. Brain and orbit MRI with gadolinium is essential to document active lesions, characterize optic nerve involvement, and establish dissemination in space via typical MS regions, while also noting lesion length in the optic nerve to help differentiate MS from NMOSD/MOGAD; I need to ensure the protocol includes fat-saturated orbital sequences with contrast for optimal optic nerve evaluation [^114JUvZM] [^111SDxEX]. Wait, let me verify one more nuance: detection of new or enlarging T2 lesions and contrast-enhancing lesions informs both relapse characterization and future treatment-response monitoring, so baseline imaging now also serves as the pretreatment comparator for DMT follow-up [^114JUvZM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding mimics when features are atypical or severe. I should order serum AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG promptly if any atypical optic neuritis features are present, because acute management and especially long-term immunotherapy diverge substantially from MS in NMOSD/MOGAD; missing this distinction can be harmful [^111SDxEX] [^111SCEUk]. I also need to keep a broader differential for acute vision loss in mind, including ischemic, inflammatory, infectious, compressive, and toxic etiologies, adjusting testing as indicated by the history and exam so I don't anchor prematurely on demyelination [^113zADiS].

> For acute relapse therapy, I should initiate high-dose corticosteroids promptly. Intravenous methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3–5 days is standard to accelerate visual recovery; an equivalent high-dose oral regimen may be acceptable per local protocol, but parenteral administration is customary inpatient for reliability and monitoring [^115m2jDc]. Wait, I need to correct myself: steroids do not improve the final visual outcome on average; they hasten recovery, so counseling must set expectations accordingly, while I also monitor for mood changes, insomnia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension during therapy [^115m2jDc] [^117PeKEm].

> If recovery is poor or the visual loss is severe despite steroids, I should double-check that I'm not dealing with NMOSD/MOGAD and then consider therapeutic plasma exchange as second-line escalation for steroid-refractory demyelinating optic neuritis, particularly in catastrophic presentations where time is vision [^115m2jDc]. Let me reconsider timing: PLEX is usually initiated within days of steroid nonresponse to maximize benefit, so I need to coordinate rapidly if vision is failing to improve [^115m2jDc].

> Now, regarding long-term disease control, I should confirm the indication to initiate a DMT early. A newly diagnosed relapsing disease course with a clinical relapse, especially with corroborating MRI activity, is a strong indication to start DMT during or immediately after the acute episode once infection is excluded and logistics are aligned, consistent with AAN and ECTRIMS/EAN recommendations for early initiation in active disease [^113YtwiF] [^115pjkt8] [^115XTzWh]. But wait, what if this is clinically isolated syndrome rather than definite MS? The AAN also supports initiating DMT in CIS with characteristic MRI lesions, so I should align the decision with the current diagnostic status and risk profile rather than delaying unnecessarily [^115XTzWh].

> For selection, I need to ensure the benefit–risk balance favors high-efficacy therapy in patients with early active disease, considering options such as fingolimod, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab, or cladribine while integrating patient preferences, comorbidities, and logistics; shared decision-making here is critical to adherence and outcomes [^11278RKF] [^112V9qWN]. Hold on, I should verify risk mitigation steps before finalizing choices: JCV antibody testing is essential if considering natalizumab and remains relevant for other agents with PML risk, and I must counsel explicitly on PML, infection, and potential malignancy risks associated with newer therapies [^113AXAdX].

> Next, I should review pretreatment workup. I need a high-quality baseline brain MRI for future comparison, appropriate laboratory screening including CBC, liver enzymes, and agent-specific tests, and to update vaccinations such as varicella and hepatitis B when indicated prior to immunosuppression; timing of live vaccines requires planning before starting certain DMTs to avoid unsafe administration during immunotherapy [^113AXAdX] [^114JUvZM]. I should double-check agent-specific requirements, for example thyroid monitoring with alemtuzumab, to avoid preventable adverse outcomes during follow-up [^113AXAdX].

> Counseling now needs to be precise. Let me ensure the patient understands that DMTs reduce relapses and new MRI lesion activity but do not improve existing symptoms from the current relapse, that specific agents carry PML and other serious risks, and that early reporting of new or worsening symptoms and adherence to monitoring visits and labs are essential for safety and efficacy [^113AXAdX] [^111Fw9Yx] [^114tsVj7]. Wait, I should verify comfort and feasibility with the route of administration; if injection fatigue or intolerance is likely, a switch to noninjectable or less frequently dosed options may improve adherence without sacrificing disease control [^113MBiQ2].

> I will now establish a monitoring protocol that supports a treat-to-target approach. Clinically, I will plan visits at baseline, then approximately 3, 6, and 12 months in the first year, and at least every 6 months thereafter to assess relapses, disability trajectory, and tolerability, coordinated with MRI surveillance to detect subclinical activity [^114usY3w] [^115rbv1u]. For imaging, brain MRI should be obtained around 6 months after DMT initiation in year one and at least annually thereafter, with spinal MRI guided by symptoms; these data inform timely adjustments if activity persists [^114usY3w] [^114JUvZM].

> For treatment response, I should define suboptimal control clearly to avoid therapeutic inertia. At least one clinical relapse or new/enlarging MRI lesions while adherent to therapy indicates insufficient disease control and should prompt evaluation of adherence, adverse effects, and mechanism of action with a low threshold to switch, ideally to a more efficacious agent rather than delaying escalation and risking accrual of disability [^1133HXTh] [^113ecswv] [^114usY3w]. I should double-check that adverse effects are not the primary barrier, because addressing tolerability can salvage an effective regimen when disease activity is otherwise controlled [^114tsVj7].

> Symptom management cannot be neglected while disease control is addressed. Most patients with typical demyelinating optic neuritis experience partial to full recovery over weeks to months, but I need to support visual rehabilitation as indicated and manage common MS symptoms such as fatigue, spasticity, mood disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and pain to preserve quality of life during recovery and beyond [^115m2jDc] [^116Poe47]. Hmm, wait a minute, if corticosteroid side effects cloud the clinical picture, I should differentiate steroid-induced visual complications like cataract or glaucoma from neuro-ophthalmic relapse to avoid misattribution during follow-up [^117PeKEm].

> Special circumstances require forethought. If pregnancy is contemplated, I need to counsel on teratogenic or fetotoxic risks, contraception where required, and safe periconception strategies, adjusting DMTs accordingly to minimize maternal relapse risk without compromising fetal safety [^notfound]. If the patient is an adolescent, I should recognize higher inflammatory burden and consider early high-efficacy therapy to reduce disability accrual, balancing access and safety monitoring challenges unique to pediatric populations [^112Uscr7] [^113DQqz3]. If progressive features emerge, I should confirm phenotype and pivot to agents with evidence in PPMS or active SPMS, such as ocrelizumab for PPMS and ocrelizumab or cladribine where appropriate for active SPMS, while acknowledging the distinct goals and often slower response in progressive disease [^1159oaMX] [^115QmuyB] [^115XLRYY].

> Discharge planning should be concrete and time-bound. I need to decide whether an oral steroid taper is warranted after IV therapy per local practice, arrange the first DMT administration or infusion logistics, schedule neurology and ophthalmology follow-ups within 2–4 weeks, and set laboratory monitoring aligned with the chosen agent, while ensuring the patient knows to report new or worsening symptoms promptly between visits [^114usY3w] [^111Fw9Yx]. Hold on, I should verify that baseline MRI has been archived and that the infusion center or specialty pharmacy coordination is completed before discharge to prevent avoidable delays in DMT start [^114JUvZM].

> Before I conclude, let me first confirm an emerging diagnostic nuance: the role of the optic nerve as a fifth region for dissemination in space has been proposed to improve sensitivity in optic neuritis presentations; while this is conceptually aligned with the high prevalence of optic pathway involvement in MS, I should apply this cautiously pending formal incorporation into criteria and local practice standards [^111uvpDJ]. I need to ensure that any such consideration supplements, rather than replaces, rigorous application of the current McDonald criteria and targeted exclusion of mimics [^115exA7U].

> In summary, the immediate steps are to verify typical versus atypical optic neuritis, obtain urgent MRI brain and orbits with contrast alongside targeted serologies when red flags exist, initiate IV methylprednisolone promptly with close monitoring and escalate to plasma exchange if steroid-refractory, then transition to early DMT initiation with thorough pretreatment workup, explicit counseling, and a structured follow-up plan featuring early and regular clinical and MRI surveillance; therapy should be escalated without delay if breakthrough disease occurs, and special contexts like pregnancy, pediatrics, or progressive phenotypes must shape individualized choices throughout care [^111SDxEX] [^114JUvZM] [^115m2jDc] [^113YtwiF] [^115pjkt8] [^1133HXTh] [^1159oaMX].

For an inpatient with a new MS diagnosis and acute vision loss, **immediate high-dose IV methylprednisolone** (1 g daily for 3–5 days) [^115m2jDc] is standard to accelerate visual recovery, followed by an oral prednisone taper if needed [^115m2jDc] [^117PeKEm]. MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium is essential to confirm **optic neuritis** and exclude mimics; if atypical features are present, include spinal MRI, CSF analysis, and serologic testing for NMOSD/MOGAD [^111SDxEX] [^115yeq7M]. Initiate a **disease-modifying therapy (DMT)** during hospitalization or soon after discharge [^113YtwiF] to reduce relapse risk and disability progression [^115pjkt8]. Arrange close neurology and ophthalmology follow-up [^113VZt9W] with MRI monitoring [^114JUvZM], and provide patient education on relapse recognition, DMT adherence, and lifestyle modifications [^113AXAdX].

## Immediate inpatient management

### High-dose intravenous corticosteroids

- **Indication**: Acute optic neuritis in MS to accelerate visual recovery [^115m2jDc].

- **Regimen**: IV methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3–5 days [^115m2jDc].

- **Oral taper**: Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 11 days, then taper over 4 days if needed.

- **Note**: Steroids speed recovery but do not alter long-term visual outcomes [^115m2jDc].

---

### Diagnostic evaluation

- **MRI brain and orbits with gadolinium**: Confirm optic neuritis, assess dissemination in space/time, and exclude mimics [^111SDxEX] [^115yeq7M].

- **Lumbar puncture**: If atypical features or diagnostic uncertainty, assess oligoclonal bands and IgG index [^115exA7U].

- **Serologic testing**: If atypical, test for NMOSD (AQP4-IgG) and MOGAD (MOG-IgG) [^111SDxEX] [^111SCEUk].

---

## Initiation of disease-modifying therapy (DMT)

### Timing and rationale

Early initiation of **DMT** during hospitalization or shortly after discharge [^113YtwiF] reduces relapses and disability [^115pjkt8]. Before starting DMT, discuss benefits, risks, and the importance of adherence [^113AXAdX] [^114ASCe6].

---

### Selection of DMT

First-line options include interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, and cladribine. Selection should be based on disease activity, comorbidities, safety profile, and patient preferences [^112V9qWN] [^114ASCe6].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

### Clinical monitoring

- **Neurology follow-up**: Within 2–4 weeks post-discharge, then every 3–6 months [^114usY3w].

- **Ophthalmology follow-up**: Visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and OCT [^113VZt9W].

- **Patient education**: Teach relapse recognition, adherence, and lifestyle modifications [^111Fw9Yx].

---

### Imaging surveillance

MRI monitoring should include a **baseline study** [^114usY3w] [^114JUvZM]. Repeat MRI at 6 and 12 months, then annually to detect new lesions and guide therapy [^114usY3w].

---

## Management of complications and comorbidities

### Acute complications

Monitor for **steroid-related effects**, including hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, and infections [^117PeKEm]. For persistent visual deficits, refer for low-vision aids and occupational therapy [^116Poe47].

---

### Long-term complications

Monitor **disease progression** and adjust DMT as needed [^113ecswv] [^1133HXTh]. Manage comorbidities, including cardiovascular risk, osteoporosis, and mental health conditions [^111uDZem].

---

## Patient education and support

Provide **education** on multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and treatment goals [^113AXAdX]. Connect patients to support groups and counseling resources, and encourage smoking cessation, regular exercise, and a balanced diet.

## Summary of management steps

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Immediate high-dose IV corticosteroids |
| 2 | MRI brain and orbits with gadolinium |
| 3 | Lumbar puncture and serologic testing if atypical |
| 4 | Initiate DMT during hospitalization or shortly after discharge |
| 5 | Clinical and MRI monitoring |

### Management of acute optic neuritis [^115m2jDc]. The Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Optic neuritis is a common condition that causes reversible loss of vision. It can be clinically isolated or arise as a manifestation of multiple sclerosis. Occasionally, cases are due to other causes, which can lead to significantly different management approaches. The treatment of optic neuritis has been evaluated in several trials, revealing that corticosteroids accelerate the recovery of vision without affecting the final visual outcome. However, other aspects of management remain controversial, with uncertainty about when to investigate and when to treat the condition.

This paper reviews the diagnostic features of optic neuritis, its differential diagnosis, and provides practical guidance on managing patients. The association of optic neuritis with multiple sclerosis is also considered, highlighting studies that define the risk of developing multiple sclerosis and discussing the results from trials of disease-modifying drugs in these individuals.

The EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend initiating early disease-modifying therapy in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). This is defined by clinical relapses and/or MRI activity, such as active lesions — contrast-enhancing lesions — or new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions assessed at least annually.

### Recurrent optic neuritis and perineuritis followed by an unexpected discovery: From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Case Conference Proceedings [^111SDxEX]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Our patient initially presented with several episodes of longitudinally extensive anterior optic neuritis (ON), some with chiasmatic and perineural involvement signifying perineuritis, in conjunction with evidence of optic disc hemorrhages, all red flags for typical demyelinating ON. The triggers for these reattacks were varied and most notably included the failure of MMF treatment in conjunction with CD19 hyper-repopulation while receiving treatment with rituximab. The later development of leptomeningeal enhancement seen on MRI led us to consider other disorders and widen the differential diagnosis.

- **Inflammatory and infectious considerations**: ON in multiple sclerosis is typically unilateral with mild to moderate vision loss with diffuse or central visual field loss. Ophthalmoscopy is typically unremarkable acutely (given the retrobulbar localization of the initial lesion in most), and MRI might demonstrate unilateral, retrobulbar, and/or canalicular short anterior segment lesions with optic nerve enhancement acutely in most cases.

- **Distinguishing features of optic neuritis, perineuritis, and neoplastic targeting of the anterior visual system**: NMOSD and MOG antibody disease (MOGAD) ON commonly results in severe vision loss and is frequently bilateral, with distinguishing features on MRI and on fundus examination. Both NMOSD and MOGAD may present with longitudinally extensive optic nerve and spinal cord (≥ 3 vertebral segments) lesions on MRI, with more frequent involvement of the lower cord and conus associated with MOGAD.

### Risk of new disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis who continue or discontinue disease-modifying therapies (DISCOMS): A multicentre, randomised, single-blind, phase 4, non-inferiority trial [^1143DLeZ]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis typically has onset in young adults, and new disease activity diminishes with age. Most clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis have not enrolled individuals older than 55 years. Observational studies suggest that the risk of the return of disease activity after discontinuation of a disease-modifying therapy is greatest in younger patients with recent relapses or MRI activity. We aimed to determine whether the risk of disease recurrence in older patients with no recent disease activity who discontinue disease-modifying therapy is increased compared to those who remain on disease-modifying therapy.

- **Methods**: DISCOMS was a multicentre, randomised, controlled, rater-blinded, phase 4, non-inferiority trial. Individuals with multiple sclerosis of any subtype, 55 years or older, with no relapse within the past 5 years or new MRI lesion in the past 3 years while continuously taking an approved disease-modifying therapy, were enrolled at 19 multiple sclerosis centres in the United States. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1 by site) with an interactive response technology system to either continue or discontinue disease-modifying therapy. Relapse assessors and MRI readers were masked to patient assignment; patients and treating investigators were not masked. The primary outcome was the percentage of individuals with a new disease event, defined as a multiple sclerosis relapse or a new or expanding T2 brain MRI lesion, over 2 years. We assessed whether the discontinuation of disease-modifying therapy was non-inferior to continuation using a non-inferiority margin specified in the study protocol.

### Access to therapy for children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis: Global considerations in preventing disease progression [^113DQqz3]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2025). Low credibility.

Paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis comprises approximately 1.5% of prevalent multiple sclerosis cases and is associated with a higher disease burden, early and progressive motor and cognitive disability in young adulthood, and high levels of depression and fatigue. Observational data and randomized controlled trials have shown marked effects of multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies on MRI activity and long-term outcomes, including disease progression, in the paediatric population. We present a comprehensive review of published literature focused on issues of access to therapy in children and adolescents with paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis. In this review, we identify regional variability in the availability of multiple sclerosis therapies and examine issues such as differences in access to care and time to diagnosis, criteria for regulatory approval, availability of insurance, and government supports. Finally, we outline specific future directions that should be taken to address these barriers and ensure better and equal therapy access for all children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis.

### Overview of the management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and practical recommendations [^114usY3w]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The initial phases of the clinical course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by a primarily inflammatory pathology, which transitions to a largely neurodegenerative process as the disease evolves. Since all currently available disease-modifying therapies aim to control inflammation, early intervention in the disease course is crucial, particularly at the time of a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS or during the early stages of relapsing-remitting MS.

Approximately 30% of patients treated with first-line immunomodulators, such as interferon-β or glatiramer acetate, show a suboptimal response within the first 1–2 years and may require a switch to an alternative therapy. It is recommended not to delay the switch to prevent disease progression. Patients with a poor prognosis, in particular, may need a timely transition to a second-line agent.

Regular monitoring of the disease and therapy in MS patients is essential. In the first year after diagnosis, clinical evaluations — including assessments of neurological status, symptoms, and patient well-being — should be conducted at baseline, then at 3, 6, and 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed every 6 months during the first year of treatment, and at least once yearly thereafter. For patients presenting spinal symptoms, a spinal cord MRI should be conducted annually.

### Investigating whether dissemination in time is essential to diagnose relapsing multiple sclerosis [^115jzcB1]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This study does have some limitations. First, patients with optic neuritis were over-represented. Some studies have found that patients with optic neuritis have a more favorable prognosis, including a lower risk of a second clinical attack or new lesions on MRI. This would be expected to negatively influence specificity in this cohort, whereas we found consistently high specificity for dissemination in space (DIS) criteria requiring lesions in four or more typical regions. This may reflect the recruitment of optic neuritis patients from specialist neuro-ophthalmology clinics and the high pretest probability for multiple sclerosis (MS), with over 80% of patients having abnormal brain MRI.

We repeated analyses in patients with and without optic neuritis; the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of DIS criteria requiring lesions in four or more regions remained the same. As expected, the sensitivity of criteria that included optic nerve lesions (DIS in four or five regions) was higher in patients with optic neuritis, reflecting the low frequency of asymptomatic optic nerve lesions in patients with brainstem or spinal cord syndromes. Among those who did not undergo lumbar puncture (LP), 97% already had either evidence of dissemination in time (DIT) on MRI, a second clinical attack during follow-up, no MRI evidence of DIS, or both. Thus, the low rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is unlikely to influence our findings.

Third, we analyzed two cohorts recruited over a period of three decades. Although recruitment practices might have evolved over time, the methodology consistently supported our conclusions regarding the DIS criteria's specificity and sensitivity.

### CIS case studies [^1164AwqG]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

The onset of multiple sclerosis presents in 85% of cases as a subacute clinical event, known as the clinically isolated syndrome. This event involves either focal or multifocal brain regions, most frequently the optic nerve, brainstem, or spinal cord. The initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires demonstrating the dissemination of pathology in time and space, as well as excluding other alternative diagnoses, which can be challenging. Confirming a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is a sensitive time for both patient and physician. The patient is faced with a difficult diagnosis, and the physician must consider making challenging treatment decisions regarding therapy and follow-up care. This article presents a number of case studies illustrating the diversity of presentation of clinically isolated syndrome and the challenges associated with confirming a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

### Intermediate uveitis associated with MS: Diagnosis, clinical features, pathogenic mechanisms, and recommendations for management [^117PeKEm]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Management of acute relapses of MS and IU involves the use of corticosteroids in the acute setting. Both MS relapses and sight-threatening inflammation in IU are treated with oral or IV methylprednisolone, which shortens the duration of an MS relapse but does not significantly impact long-term neurodisability. For acute relapses of IU, systemic steroids are used; however, unlike MS, intraocular inflammation can be managed with local therapy. While topical steroid drops do not penetrate the posterior segment of the eye, periocular steroid injections or intravitreal injection of a steroid implant are viable alternatives that avoid the side effects of systemic corticosteroids. Additionally, the effects of intravitreal steroid implants can last up to six months.

- **Considerations**: Important considerations include the possible complications of corticosteroid treatment and distinguishing them from relapses of MS or IU. Corticosteroids can cause systemic symptoms that may be confused with progressive neurodisability from MS. Likewise, frequent or chronic treatment with local or systemic corticosteroids can cause sight-threatening complications such as cataracts, glaucoma, and central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).

	- **Cataracts**: Cataracts cause a progressive reduction in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, night vision, and color perception, which might be confused with optic neuropathy. Nevertheless, cataracts are not a contraindication to steroid treatment, and cataract surgery will restore vision.

	- **Glaucoma**: Glaucoma causes insidious visual loss that is largely asymptomatic until advanced stages. It is a progressive optic neuropathy, which should be duly monitored during corticosteroid treatment.

### A 73-year-old woman with confusion, visual field disturbances, and edematous white matter lesions: From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society Case Conference Proceedings [^116rhNvx]. Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman presenting with headaches, confusion, and vision disturbances. Brain MRI showed a large T2-hyperintense lesion in the right temporo-occipital region with vasogenic edema and leptomeningeal enhancement. A leptomeningeal biopsy was performed, which led to a definitive diagnosis.

### Earlier and more frequent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis using the McDonald criteria [^116sg4oB]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

One potential limitation of our study is an over-representation of patients with optic neuritis, which may have a more benign prognosis than other CIS types. However, almost 80% of patients with optic neuritis had baseline MRI abnormalities, indicating a group at high risk for developing MS.

In conclusion, the McDonald criteria allow MS to be diagnosed sooner and more often in patients with CIS. While the McDonald criteria facilitate an earlier diagnosis of MS, up to a third of patients with CIS who satisfy the 2010 criteria do not have further clinical events, at least in the medium term.

### Identification and management of subclinical disease activity in early multiple sclerosis: A review [^115exA7U]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Subclinical disease activity in early multiple sclerosis is a critical area of study. The diagnosis of MS is conducted according to the most recent version of the McDonald criteria. This requires confirmation of central nervous system (CNS) disease disseminated in time and space as demonstrated by clinical attacks, examination features, MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The McDonald criteria and its subsequent revisions have helped to decrease delays in diagnosis, notably among children, adolescents, and younger adults. Clinical relapses and MRI disease activity are prioritized in the most recent criteria.

Although the 2017 updates to the McDonald criteria aimed to provide guidance to avoid the misdiagnosis of MS, it is important to acknowledge that misdiagnosis remains a concern in clinical practice. One 2019 study found that approximately 1 in 5 patients with a diagnosis of MS did not actually meet the diagnosis criteria upon reevaluation at an MS subspecialty center. The proper application of the McDonald criteria is critical for a correct diagnosis of MS, as patients receiving a misdiagnosis of MS may be exposed to unnecessary risks when incorrectly prescribed DMTs and may incur a considerable financial burden.

- **Disease activity in clinical guidelines**: Practice guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology measure disease activity by clinical relapses or new MRI lesions, and these assessments are used to guide MS monitoring and treatment. Similarly, treatment guidelines from the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS and the European Academy of Neurology describe disease activity in patients.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common cause of disability in young adults. Irreversible axonal damage occurs even in the earliest phases of disease evolution. Although some people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) have a 'benign' disease course with minimal disease activity and impairment, most patients experience increasing disability over time and eventually convert to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). There is still no curative treatment, but during the last 20 years, eight different therapies have become available, including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, fingolimod, alemtuzumab, and mitoxantrone. Several new compounds are in development. All the approved medications have mainly anti-inflammatory effects, and increasing evidence indicates that all of them are more effective in the early phases of disease development. With the development of more effective treatments, the aim of treatment has changed dramatically in the last decades, from simply reducing relapse rates and slowing disability progression to preventing all evidence of new disease activity. In this review, the mode of action and documented effect of the current immunomodulatory MS therapies are briefly discussed.

### Overview of treatment options in multiple sclerosis [^1154ECpB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system that results in inflammation, demyelination, and axonal and neuronal loss. The typical course of MS involves symptom exacerbations followed by periods of remission; however, patients will eventually accrue disability from these exacerbations. Several drugs, including interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, and fingolimod, are effective in lowering relapse rates and slowing the progression of MS. For patients with a suboptimal response to medication, switching to another first- or second-line medication can be an effective strategy.

### De-escalating and discontinuing disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis [^116X2Ezj]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

Beyond the optimal selection of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), there is a need for de-escalation algorithms that justify regular reassessment of treatment plans with the aim of reducing treatment intensity or even discontinuing treatment if the benefit-risk ratio becomes less favorable. In this context, understanding the principles, challenges, and evolving evidence surrounding de-escalation strategies is paramount to optimizing long-term outcomes, mitigating risks, and improving the quality of life for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). At the time of writing, however, there is no consensus on the strategies of de-escalation or discontinuation, while a similar concept has been discussed more extensively in other fields, such as rheumatology and oncology.

To fill this gap, the 2023 Annual Focused Workshop organized by the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) brought together a panel of international experts to review and discuss the evidence on de-escalating DMTs in MS. The aim of this workshop was to provide evidence-based practical recommendations for the management and monitoring of de-escalating DMTs.

### Acute vision loss [^113zADiS]. Primary Care (2015). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, acute vision loss can be attributed to various conditions, such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, giant cell arteritis, migraine, and vitreous hemorrhage. Other causes include pituitary apoplexy, hyphema, central retinal vein occlusion, central retinal artery occlusion, and retinal detachment. Additional potential causes are acute angle-closure glaucoma, uveitis, corneal foreign body, endophthalmitis, papillitis, keratitis, and corneal opacity. Furthermore, conditions like amaurosis fugax, acute ischemic stroke, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, methanol poisoning, acute macular neuroretinopathy, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy can be implicated. Lastly, functional visual loss, ocular migraine, retinal migraine, toxic optic neuropathy, and non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy are also known to cause this condition.

### Towards a biological view of multiple sclerosis from early subtle to clinical progression: an expert opinion [^1146g2RS]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

The earliest medical descriptions of multiple sclerosis (MS) date back to the first half of the nineteenth century, with these descriptions already highlighting the relapsing–remitting nature of the disease. In the subsequent decades, two classic clinical phenotypes of MS emerged: relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS. Classification of MS into the relapsing–remitting, primary progressive (PPMS), and secondary progressive (SPMS) phenotypes was formalized by the United States Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of New Agents in Multiple Sclerosis for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) in 1996, with revisions following in 2014. The objective of the NMSS classification was to provide clear and consistent definitions of patient groups. The NMSS classification has been used in almost all clinical trials since its creation and has become widely adopted in clinical practice; however, it is based solely on clinical course, and the authors noted at the time that there were no biomarkers for the various phenotypes.

The NMSS classification has been highly influential in shaping the management of MS. The majority of approved treatments for MS are indicated for the relapsing–remitting form of the disease, and the NMSS classification is credited with the progress that has been made in the treatment of this form of MS. However, there are few drugs that have been approved for progressive forms of MS, and despite the widespread use of the NMSS classification, accumulating evidence suggests that the nature of the underlying pathology is the same across all forms.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis [^114LvYAX]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space, i.e. occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart.

Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B12 deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g. Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g. sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis are available, which aim to alter the disease course and improve patient outcomes.

### The multiple sclerosis prodrome [^113nhJ35]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

A prodrome is an early set of signs, symptoms, or other findings that occur before the onset of typical symptoms of a disease. Prodromal phases are well recognized in several neurological and inflammatory diseases, but the possibility of a prodrome in multiple sclerosis (MS) has received relatively little attention until the past few years. In this perspective, we summarize what is currently known about the MS prodrome, including its possible duration, clinical features, and potential biomarkers. We also consider what insights and lessons can be learned from knowledge of and research into the prodromal phases of other diseases.

A better understanding of the MS prodrome could have profound clinical implications as it could enable earlier recognition of MS and earlier initiation of treatments that reduce relapse rates and long-term disability. Knowledge of the MS prodrome could also affect research into the causes of MS, and putative risk factors must be re-evaluated in light of the MS prodrome. We conclude by outlining the major knowledge gaps and propose future initiatives.

### Symptom management in patients with multiple sclerosis [^116Poe47]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease associated with a wide variety of symptoms that can affect the ability of patients to carry out normal daily activities. Although numerous symptoms can afflict these patients, the most commonly reported include fatigue, mood disorders, changes in cognitive function or memory, sensory changes (numbness, pain, vibrations), motor changes (loss of balance, poor coordination, muscle weakness or stiffness), vision changes (double vision, blurred vision, loss of vision), and bladder or bowel dysfunction. Treatments are available that can help minimize some of these symptoms and relieve patient distress.

After the diagnosis has been established and decisions have been made regarding the initiation of immunomodulatory treatments, the majority of management decisions that physicians face will concern symptom management. While some symptoms are relatively easy to treat, others are more challenging to manage. Management involves rehabilitation, pharmacological treatments, and surgical procedures. Successful symptom management is a key determinant of the patient's quality of life and serves as the foundation for improving physical and psychological function.

### Evolution of retinal degeneration and prediction of disease activity in relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis [^113VZt9W]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

All patients underwent physical, neurological, and OCT examinations at baseline and at each follow-up time point at one of the five participating MS centers. The following data were recorded: sex, date of birth, date of manifestation of patients' first symptoms, EDSS scores, episodes of ON, DMTs, occurrence of relapses, and brain and spinal MRI progression/activity (new and enlarging T2-weighted/gadolinium-enhancing lesions).

EDSS scores were always assessed by the same team of specially trained neurologists at each participating center at the same visit as OCT. Researchers and technical assistants performing the OCT analysis were masked to EDSS results; those assessing disability by EDSS were masked at the time of the examination to OCT results. Disease duration was defined as the time between the manifestation of first symptoms and the date of OCT examination. Disability worsening was defined as a documented increase in EDSS score compared to the previous measurement (≥ 1.0 point if the EDSS score was < 6.0, or ≥ 0.5 point if the EDSS score was ≥ 6.0) at a single time point. The EDSS increase did not have to be sustained. History of ON was assessed by the medical history and using the previously described OCT approach based on inter-eye GCIPL thickness difference of ≥ 4 μm.

### Comorbidity in multiple sclerosis: Implications for patient care [^111uDZem]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Most efforts aimed at understanding the notable heterogeneity of outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) have focused on disease-specific factors, such as symptoms at initial presentation, initial relapse rate, and age at symptom onset. These factors, however, explain relatively little of the heterogeneity of disease outcomes. Owing to the high prevalence of comorbidity in MS and the potential for its prevention or treatment, comorbidity is of rising interest as a factor that could explain the heterogeneity of outcomes. A rapidly growing body of evidence suggests that comorbidity adversely affects outcomes throughout the disease course in MS, including diagnostic delays from symptom onset, disability at diagnosis and subsequent progression, cognition, mortality, and health-related quality of life. Therefore, clinicians need to incorporate the prevention and management of comorbidity when treating patients with MS, but managing comorbidities in MS successfully may require the adoption of new collaborative models of care.

### Microperimetry as a diagnostic tool for the detection of early, subclinical retinal damage and visual impairment in multiple sclerosis [^11325cbt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

A majority of multiple sclerosis patients experience visual impairment, often as the initial presenting symptom of the disease. While structural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve have demonstrated correlations with brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis using magnetic resonance imaging, a non-invasive, cost-effective, and clinically efficacious modality to identify early damage and facilitate prompt therapeutic intervention to slow the progression of multiple sclerosis and its ocular manifestations is still urgently needed. In this study, we sought to determine the role of macular sensitivity measured by microperimetry in the detection of subclinical multiple sclerosis-related retinal damage and visual dysfunction.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional observational case-control study involved population-based samples of multiple sclerosis patients and age-, race-, and gender-matched healthy control subjects. Among the key criteria for the multiple sclerosis patients were diagnosis by the McDonald criteria, visual acuity greater than 20/25, and no history of optic neuritis. Macular sensitivity and average macular thickness were measured in all subjects using microperimetry and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients were measured using bivariate correlations. Sample means, mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using independent sample t-tests.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight eyes from 14 MS patients and 18 eyes from 9 control subjects were included. Mean macular sensitivity of con

### Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis [^111n7tpA]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Further research is needed to test the hypothesis that an MS-GRS, combined with existing diagnostic, demographic, and other deep phenotypic variables, can effectively stratify patients with undifferentiated ON into high, medium, or low genetic MS risk in a prospective diagnostic predictive clinical setting. Patient and public involvement regarding the acceptability of integrating genetic risk stratification into frontline care will be vital. Our study suggests the possibility of clinical translation, utilizing a genetic test at the initial ON presentation to improve acute clinical care. With up to 5 million adults in the UK soon to be recruited into the country's largest ever health research programme, including genomic medicine, 'Our Future Health', the use of GRSs could soon become part of an enhanced approach to personalized medicine.

In summary, our study reveals the potential of a composite model that integrates MS-GRS with age at ON onset and sex, offering a method to stratify patients based on their likelihood of a future MS diagnosis. This approach provides valuable insights for clinical management decisions. Future research endeavors should explore the practical application of the MS-GRS model within clinical settings. We hypothesize that knowledge of a high MS-GRS, particularly in individuals with suspected clinically isolated syndrome, would facilitate MS follow-up management and guide decisions about performing lumbar puncture to achieve an earlier MS diagnosis and potentially initiate earlier disease-modifying treatment to reduce relapse rates.

### Site-specific clinical disease onset in multiple sclerosis [^112Ea64K]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by acute episodes of neurological dysfunction, thought to reflect focal areas of demyelination occurring in clinically eloquent areas. These symptomatic relapses are generally considered to be random clinical events occurring without a discernible pattern. The hypothesis that relapses may follow a predetermined sequence and provide insights into underlying pathological processes was investigated.

- **Methods**: Employing prospective clinical database data from 1,482 patients who had experienced one or more consecutive relapses were analyzed. Using regression analysis, the site and symptom of the index event were compared with those of the first relapse.

- **Results**: It is demonstrated that following disease ignition, subsequent relapses may not be random events but are dependent on the characteristics of the index event. All anatomical sites were more likely to be affected in the first relapse if that site had been involved in the index event, with a similar association observed when comparing by symptoms.

- **Conclusion**: These findings have importance in understanding the evolution of the disease and predicting individual disease progression and may aid with patient counseling and management.

### Disease-modifying therapies in managing disability worsening in paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis: a longitudinal analysis of global and national registries [^112Uscr7]. The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health (2024). High credibility.

High-efficacy disease-modifying therapies have been proven to slow disability accrual in adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, their impact on disability worsening in paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis, particularly during the early phases, is not well understood. We evaluated how high-efficacy therapies influence transitions across five disability states, ranging from minimal disability to gait impairment and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, in people with paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis.

- **Methods**: Longitudinal data were obtained from the international MSBase registry, containing data from people with multiple sclerosis from 151 centers across 41 countries, and the Italian Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders Register, containing data from people with multiple sclerosis from 178 Italian multiple sclerosis centers. People younger than 18 years at the onset of multiple sclerosis symptoms were included, provided they had a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and at least four Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores recorded within 12-month intervals. The primary outcome was the time to change in disability state: minimal disability (EDSS scores 0, 1.0, and 1.5), mild disability (EDSS scores 2.0 and 2.5), moderate disability (EDSS scores 3.0 and 3.5), gait impairment (EDSS scores ≥ 4.0), and clinician diagnosed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. A multi-state model was constructed to simulate the natural course of multiple sclerosis, modeling the probabilities of both disability worsening.

### Maximising therapeutic outcomes in patients failing on current therapy [^113YPxKr]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

The different immunomodulatory treatments available to patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis are only partially effective. Since these treatments are most effective in the early relapsing stage of the disease, it is important to adjust therapy in a timely fashion to fall within the window of opportunity when maximal benefit can be gained from a second-line treatment. Consensus guidelines have been established to define a sub-optimal treatment response. Switching to another class of immunomodulatory therapy represents a logical treatment strategy in patients who fail to respond adequately to first-line treatments. Several observational studies have now shown such a strategy to be beneficial. Disease control can be improved following switching in patients with persistent relapse activity on first-line treatment. In patients experiencing intolerable side effects to first-line treatment, tolerability can be improved by switching without loss of disease control. In particular, a switch between different classes of immunomodulatory treatments seems to be more beneficial than switching within the same class. Formal switching algorithms need to be developed to ensure that all patients who could benefit from such an approach are managed in a timely and optimal manner.

### Association of initial disease-modifying therapy with later conversion to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis [^115EYSLs]. JAMA (2019). Low credibility.

Within two decades of onset, 80% of untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) convert to a phase of irreversible disability accrual termed secondary progressive MS. The association between disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) and this conversion has rarely been studied and never using a validated definition.

- **Objective**: To determine the association between the use, type, and timing of DMTs with the risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS diagnosed with a validated definition.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Cohort study with prospective data from 68 neurology centers in 21 countries examining patients with relapsing-remitting MS commencing DMTs (or clinical monitoring) between 1988–2012 with a minimum of four years' follow-up.

- **Exposures**: The use, type, and timing of the following DMTs: interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, natalizumab, or alemtuzumab were studied. After propensity-score matching, 1555 patients were included (last follow-up on February 14, 2017).

- **Main outcome and measure**: Conversion to objectively defined secondary progressive MS.

- **Results**: Of the 1555 patients, 1123 were female (mean baseline age, 35 years [SD, 10]). Patients initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta had a lower hazard of conversion to secondary progressive MS than matched untreated patients (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61–0.81; p < 0.001; 5-year absolute risk, 12% [49 of 407] vs 27% [58 of 213]; median follow-up, 7.6 years [IQR, 5.8–9.6]), as did fingolimod (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.22–0.62; p < 0.001; 5-year absolute risk, 7% [6 of 85] vs 32%).

### Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: progress and challenges [^115yeq7M]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on neurological symptoms and signs, alongside evidence of dissemination of CNS lesions in space and time. MRI is often sufficient to confirm the diagnosis when characteristic lesions accompany a typical clinical syndrome, but in some patients, further supportive information is obtained from cerebrospinal fluid examination and neurophysiological testing. Differentiation is important from other diseases in which demyelination is a feature (e.g. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and from non-demyelinating disorders such as chronic small vessel disease and other inflammatory, granulomatous, infective, metabolic, and genetic causes that can mimic multiple sclerosis. Advances in MRI and serological and genetic testing have greatly increased accuracy in distinguishing multiple sclerosis from these disorders, but misdiagnosis can occur. In this series paper, we explore the progress and challenges in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with reference to diagnostic criteria, important differential diagnoses, controversies and uncertainties, and future prospects.

### Clinical reasoning: A 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^113AnZ4Q]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions. The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation. MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed. This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

### Current and emerging disease-modulatory therapies and treatment targets for multiple sclerosis [^115fCNEc]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In most patients, multiple sclerosis (MS) starts as a relapsing–remitting disease (RRMS), which is termed Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) following a first bout of clinical symptoms. This phase is often preceded by a period of subclinical disease activity that can be detected with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); yellow stars in imaging denote signs of active inflammation.

In the later stages of RRMS, patients accumulate persistent disabilities. Recent evidence suggests that a progressive component may start soon after diagnosis. This underlying progressive disease component becomes more pronounced at later stages, when the disease converts to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). The reduction in inflammatory disease activity, as reflected by decreased frequency of bouts or MRI activity, suggests a shift from adaptive to innate or local disease mechanisms, which may explain the relative loss of efficacy of disease‐modulatory treatments (DMT).

### Early recognition and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^111F9WRi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder associated with inflammation and demyelination in the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. Patients with MS may present with a wide range of clinical symptoms, either monofocal or multifocal, all of which are related to the central nervous system. Although several strategies for the early recognition of MS are available, diagnostic criteria call for MRI of the brain and spinal cord due to its specificity in identifying white matter lesions disseminated in time and space. The course of MS is unpredictable, but four clinical subtypes have been described: relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive, and progressive relapsing. Prevalence rates for MS vary depending on geography, and susceptibility for MS appears to be influenced by both environmental and genetic risk factors.

### Assessing risks of multiple sclerosis therapies [^115rjsyf]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, thanks to the discovery of several pharmaceutical agents, multiple sclerosis (MS) has been transformed into a treatable disorder, although the degree of therapeutic response may vary considerably. As more medications enter the MS market, clinicians face a mounting challenge of comparing risk and benefit profiles of various agents in an attempt to find the best treatment approach for each individual patient.

In this review, we aim to summarize the available data on safety profiles of MS therapies while focusing mostly on serious medication-specific potential adverse events without discussing the teratogenic potential of each agent (unless there is a black box warning) or hypersensitivity reactions. Our goal is to provide clinicians with guidance on assuring appropriate safety monitoring for patients treated with one of the agents discussed. We also comment on the future of risk management in MS and discuss possible enhancements to the model of the drug approval process and general strategies to improve patient safety.

Magnetic resonance imaging is integrated with clinical and other paraclinical diagnostic methods. The revised criteria facilitate the diagnosis of MS in patients with a variety of presentations, including "monosymptomatic" disease suggestive of MS, disease with a typical relapsing-remitting course, and disease with insidious progression without clear attacks and remissions. Previously used terms such as "clinically definite" and "probable MS" are no longer recommended. The outcome of a diagnostic evaluation is either MS, "possible MS" (for those at risk for MS, but for whom diagnostic evaluation is equivocal), or "not MS".

### Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis, part I: natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis [^111dxJz6]. The Lancet Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

In 85% of young adults with multiple sclerosis (MS), the onset is a subacute clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) involving the optic nerves, brainstem, or spinal cord. Methods of assessing the prognosis for patients presenting with a CIS have been sought because only 30–70% of patients with a CIS develop MS. When clinically silent brain lesions are observed on MRI, the likelihood of developing MS is high. MS can be diagnosed within three months of CIS presentation with certain MRI and CSF criteria. Disability from MS is less likely in patients with a CIS of optic neuritis or sensory symptoms only, few or no MRI lesions, a long period to the first relapse, and no disability after the first five years. The development of more reliable prognostic markers will enable new treatments to be targeted for those who are most likely to benefit. We encourage continued clinical and laboratory assessment of patients with a CIS.

### Treatment of multiple sclerosis: A review [^112PkAjq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system, and the leading cause of nontraumatic neurological disability in young adults. Effective management requires a multifaceted approach to control acute attacks, manage progressive worsening, and remediate bothersome or disabling symptoms associated with this illness. Remarkable advances in the treatment of all forms of MS, especially for relapsing disease, have favorably changed the long-term outlook for many patients.

There has also been a conceptual shift in understanding the immune pathology of MS, moving away from a purely T-cell-mediated model to recognizing that B cells play a key role in pathogenesis. The emergence of higher-efficacy drugs requiring less frequent administration has made these preferred options in terms of tolerability and adherence. Many experts now recommend the use of these as first-line treatment for many patients with early disease, before permanent disability is evident.

### Recent developments in multiple sclerosis therapeutics [^117HFt53]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis, the most common neurologic disorder of young adults, is traditionally considered an inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Based on this understanding, the initial therapeutic strategies were directed at immune modulation and inflammation control. These approaches, including high-dose corticosteroids for acute relapses and long-term use of parenteral interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab for disease modification, are at best moderately effective.

Growing evidence supports that while an inflammatory pathology characterizes the early relapsing stage of multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative pathology dominates the later progressive stage of the disease. Multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapies currently in development attempt to specifically target the underlying pathology at each stage of the disease while avoiding frequent self-injection. These include a variety of oral medications and monoclonal antibodies to reduce inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis, and agents intended to promote neuroprotection and neurorepair in progressive multiple sclerosis.

Although newer therapies for relapsing multiple sclerosis have the potential to be more effective and easier to administer, they also carry greater risks. Effective treatments for progressive multiple sclerosis are still being sought.

### Defining secondary progressive multiple sclerosis [^111ynbat]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

A number of studies have been conducted with the onset of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis as an inclusion criterion or an outcome of interest. However, a standardized objective definition of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis has been lacking. The aim of this work was to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of an objective definition for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis to enable comparability of future research studies.

Using MSBase, a large, prospectively acquired global cohort study, we analyzed the accuracy of 576 data-derived onset definitions for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and first compared these to a consensus opinion of three neurologists. All definitions were then evaluated against 5-year disease outcomes post-assignment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: sustained disability, subsequent sustained progression, positive disability trajectory, and accumulation of severe disability.

The five best performing definitions were further investigated for their timeliness and overall disability burden. A total of 17,356 patients were analyzed. The best definition included a 3-strata progression magnitude in the absence of a relapse, confirmed after 3 months within the leading Functional System, and required an Expanded Disability Status Scale step ≥ 4 and pyramidal score ≥ 2. It reached an accuracy of 87% compared to the consensus diagnosis. Seventy-eight per cent of the identified patients showed a positive disability trajectory, and 70% reached significant disability after 5 years.

Regarding the medical management of multiple sclerosis, particularly concerning disease-modifying therapies, the AAN 2018 guidelines emphasize the importance of pretreatment counseling. It is recommended to ascertain and incorporate patient preferences related to safety, route of administration, lifestyle, cost, efficacy, common adverse effects, and tolerability when choosing a disease-modifying therapy for patients with MS who are eligible for such treatments.

### Investigating whether dissemination in time is essential to diagnose relapsing multiple sclerosis [^115JFRHH]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

**Performance of the DIS criteria in patients with and without optic neuritis**: The performance of the DIS criteria for a diagnosis of MS using the 2017 McDonald criteria in patients with optic neuritis and nonoptic neuritis presentations is detailed. The findings show that involvement of ≥ 4 regions in DIS displays high specificity and PPV for a diagnosis of 2017 McDonald MS in patients with and without optic neuritis. In the subgroup of patients with optic nerve evaluation, the sensitivity of ≥ 4/5 regions in DIS was lower among patients with a nonoptic neuritis presentation compared with the optic neuritis patients (47% vs. 68%) but similar to the sensitivity of the 2017 McDonald DIS and DIT criteria when applied to baseline MRI scans and CSF findings (47% for both). The results were consistent when considering a second clinical attack or new T2 lesions at follow-up, wherein sensitivity decreased with lesions affecting more DIS regions but specificity increased.

### Investigating whether dissemination in time is essential to diagnose relapsing multiple sclerosis [^114JPQ4m]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Among patients who had optic nerve evaluation (n = 112), the demographic profile was similar to the whole cohort, but there was a higher proportion of patients with a non-optic neuritis presentation (29% vs. 19%). Eighty-nine (79%) patients had optic nerve lesions; 28/42 (67%) patients had abnormal VEPs (24/25 [96%] with optic neuritis, 4/17 [24%] with non-optic neuritis presentations) in the first cohort, and 61/70 (87%) patients had abnormal orbital MRI in the second cohort. When the optic nerve was added as a fifth region, 100 (89%) patients had lesions in ≥ 2/5 regions, 82 (73%) patients had lesions in ≥ 3/5 regions, 57 (51%) patients had lesions in ≥ 4/5 regions, and 28 (25%) patients had lesions in 5/5 regions.

Over a mean follow-up of 11.2 (SD 9.3) years, 187 (77%) patients were diagnosed with MS using the 2017 McDonald criteria, 119 (49%) patients had a second clinical attack, and 170 (70%) patients had a new T2 lesion(s) at follow-up. The median number of follow-up MRI scans was 4 (range 1–5) in the first cohort and 3 (range 1–4) for the second cohort. Among the 57 (23%) patients who did not develop MS, 52 (91%) had either normal MRI or involvement of a single CNS region, including 16 patients with optic neuritis who were evaluated with either VEPs (n = 6) or orbital MRI (n = 10). After a mean follow-up of 13.3 (SD 5.2) years in this group, the diagnosis remained "clinically isolated syndrome".

Thirty-nine (16%) patients received treatment with DMTs before a second clinical attack, all of whom satisfied the 2017 McDonald criteria for a diagnosis.

### The apparently milder course of multiple sclerosis: changes in the diagnostic criteria, therapy and natural history [^116JYWyD]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

In the past decade, changes have occurred in the spectrum of multiple sclerosis courses. The natural history of multiple sclerosis appears milder from the first sign of demyelinating disease to the progressive course, probably as a result of an interplay between several factors, including changes in the diagnostic criteria, changes in the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis, the impact of early and appropriate disease-modifying treatment, and improvements in the general state of health in the population.

It has been suggested to regard incidental findings of demyelinating lesions in MRI in individuals without any history of clinical symptoms consistent with neurological dysfunction — so-called radiological isolated syndrome — as the initial course of multiple sclerosis. New diagnostic criteria have enabled the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in many patients at the first clinical demyelinating event, known as clinically isolated syndrome. The remaining patients with clinically isolated syndrome have a more benign prognosis, and for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, the prognosis has become more favorable.

Reduced disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can partly be ascribed to more efficacious new disease-modifying therapies; however, a decrease in disease activity has also been observed in placebo-treated patients in clinical trials. This may be explained by several factors: changes in the diagnostic criteria, more explicit inclusion criteria, exclusion of high-risk patients (e.g. patients with co-morbidities), and more rigorous definitions of relapses and disease progression.

### Diagnosis and treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis: A position paper [^115XLRYY]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease characterized by a highly variable disease onset and clinical course. **Three main phenotypes have been described**: (1) Relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) is defined by acute relapses interspersed with periods of full or partial recovery and stable clinical status. At disease onset, most patients have relapses with focal neurological deficits followed by complete or partial remission. RRMS is the most common phenotype, affecting 85% of all patients; (2) Primary progressive MS (PPMS), which progresses continuously from onset of clinically manifest disease, typically with no relapses but possible periods of plateauing, and affects around 15% of MS patients; and (3) Secondary progressive MS (SPMS), characterized by disease progression, with or without acute relapses, accumulating disability in ambulatory, autonomic, and cognitive functions. Up to 5% of patients may convert from RRMS to SPMS per year.

Distinguishing between progressive phenotypes of MS can be challenging for clinicians. PPMS is difficult to discern at the onset of neurological symptoms because it often requires several visits to a physician to establish the continuous worsening over time. Conversely, with SPMS it can be difficult to distinguish a permanent relapse-related deficit from bona fide progression; furthermore, patients can progress independently of relapses. This can lead to long periods of uncertainty as patients transition from RRMS to SPMS.

The pathophysiological mechanisms associated with disease progression are probably present from disease onset.

### The patient-determined disease steps scale is not interchangeable with the expanded disease status scale in mild to moderate multiple sclerosis [^111fd3jU]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The patient-determined disease steps scale is not interchangeable with the expanded disease status scale in mild to moderate multiple sclerosis. This statement is supported by recent studies indicating distinct applications for each scale in assessing disease progression.

Despite the participation of numerous researchers who have associations with various pharmaceutical companies, the integrity of the findings remains uncompromised due to the transparency of declared conflicts of interest. These affiliations include research funding, travel compensations, consultancy fees, and memberships on advisory boards with companies such as Biogen, Novartis, Roche, Merck, and others. It is important to note that, while these declarations are pertinent, they do not undermine the validity of the research findings.

### Applying a genetic risk score model to enhance prediction of future multiple sclerosis diagnosis at first presentation with optic neuritis [^114y7Dx8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

This pioneering investigation establishes a link between an individual's combined genetic susceptibility, as measured by the MS-GRS encompassing numerous MS-associated loci with common alleles, and the subsequent risk of MS development in those experiencing an initial episode of undifferentiated ON. Moreover, we unveil a stratification paradigm for individuals with undifferentiated ON, integrating the MS-GRS, age at ON onset, and sex. This paradigm delineates cohorts characterized by varying future MS risks: low (3.6%), intermediate (14.7%), higher (31.6%), and highest (41.2%).

Significantly, our study demonstrates robustness through the successful replication and validation of the composite MS-GRS model across two distinct datasets from the United States and Finland, populations also predominantly of European ancestry. While it has been long established that ON may be the first presentation of MS, the additional risk stratification outlined in this study could valuably aid management of ON and gain greater international consensus. This is especially crucial in the time-critical window before neuroimaging and serum and cerebrospinal fluid investigations are available.

In usual clinical practice, European ancestry British women aged 18 to 50 years, who present with mild-to-moderate vision impairment, would not typically be offered corticosteroid therapy. The MS-GRS would identify most of these individuals to be at enhanced MS genetic risk. Conversely, urgent corticosteroid therapy may be better targeted to the smaller number of individuals at low MS genetic risk, who are more likely to have an alternative diagnosis.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, in particular concerning disease-modifying therapies, the 2018 AAN guidelines recommend inquiring about medication adverse events in patients using a disease-modifying therapy and attempting to manage these adverse events as appropriate. It is advised to consider switching to another medication if adverse effects negatively influence adherence.

### Multiple sclerosis: Early indicators of disease and assessing future risk [^114KAv4b]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The identification of early clinical indicators for the severity of multiple sclerosis (MS) warrants close investigation due to the wide spectrum of MS disease activity. This is crucial for guiding surveillance and management, particularly concerning aggressive multiple sclerosis, where disability accumulates at an accelerated rate. This study aimed to identify early clinical markers, present within the first year of disease, which indicate an aggressive disease trajectory.

Patients were included in the study if they met the following criteria:

1. Diagnosis of clinically definite relapse-onset multiple sclerosis.
2. Age at onset ≥ 18 years.
3. First Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score recorded within 12 months of symptom onset.
4. At least two recorded EDSS scores within 10 years of symptom onset.
5. At least 10 years of observation time.

Patients were classified as having aggressive multiple sclerosis if they met all three of the following criteria:

- EDSS ≥ 6 within 10 years of symptom onset.
- EDSS ≥ 6 confirmed and sustained over ≥ 6 months.
- EDSS ≥ 6 sustained until the end of follow-up (≥ 10 years).

- **Clinical predictors**: Patient variables (such as sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, and disease duration at first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (including count, pyramidal signs, bowel–bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, and hospitalization) were analyzed.

For the initial analysis, patient data were collected from established international MS datasets.

### Treating to target in multiple sclerosis: Do we know how to measure whether we hit it [^115rbv1u]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The rapidly evolving landscape of effective treatment options in multiple sclerosis has led to a shift of treatment objectives towards a treat-to-target approach, aiming to suppress disease activity below the level of detectability early during the disease. To enable treat-to-target, a thorough reappraisal of available outcome measures with respect to their ability in this regard is required.

To that end, we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review of more than 1000 studies using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 methodology, focusing on underlying evidence as well as utility and implementability in clinical practice.

From there, we propose a set of measurable outcomes for everyday routine clinical practice, as well as advanced/aspirational measurables requiring additional resources. We also outline remaining knowledge and technology gaps that need to be overcome to enable a treat-to-target approach.

This work provides the basis for an evidence-based definition of outcome targets for relevant stakeholders and regulatory authorities.

### Retinal asymmetry in multiple sclerosis [^1172zTau]. Brain (2021). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a disease that predominantly affects a young adult population in the prime of their working life. Accurate and early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is important because of access to FDA-approved, effective disease-modifying treatments for a disease which affects more than 2 million individuals globally. In the United States, approximately 400,000 patients suffer from multiple sclerosis, and the annual economic burden is around $10 billion. There is a need to improve the diagnostic work-up by incorporating technologies that are scalable to a population level to enhance screening for this disabling condition.

The last revision of the diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis highlighted the importance of interrogating the diagnostic value of retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) for refinement of diagnostic criteria. Could the inclusion of the optic nerve as a fifth CNS location for dissemination in space or time improve the overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity levels? Many multiple sclerosis lesions, including those of the optic nerve, are asymptomatic, and detecting them earlier will allow for an earlier diagnosis.

### Adolescent-onset Krabbe disease with an initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and a novel mutation [^115bfksQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Krabbe disease is a rare autosomal recessive leucodystrophy, with less than 5% of cases exhibiting an adolescent-onset form. A 30-year-old woman with a history of a subacute episode of gait impairment at 14 years of age and mild spastic paraparesis since then was initially diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. After 10 years of slow disease progression without a response to treatment, the initial diagnosis was reconsidered. An extensive metabolic workup revealed decreased activity of galactocerebrosidase. Genetic testing of the GALC gene confirmed the diagnosis of Krabbe disease and identified a novel mutation. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a critical perspective in the initial differential diagnosis, especially when atypical findings are present.

### ECTRIMS/EAN guideline on the pharmacological treatment of people with multiple sclerosis [^114CkzBf]. Multiple Sclerosis (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of multiple sclerosis, particularly concerning disease-modifying therapies and choice of agent for secondary progressive MS, the EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of interferon-1a (SC) or interferon-1b in patients with active secondary progressive MS. This recommendation takes into account the dubious efficacy and the safety and tolerability profile of these drugs, which should be discussed with the patient.

### Multiple sclerosis with initial stroke-like clinicoradiologic features: Case report and literature review [^113sz5bJ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old male presented with the sudden onset of persistent focal neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a nonenhancing white matter lesion that appeared hyperintense on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence and diffusion-weighted imaging, while hypointense on apparent diffusion coefficient mapping corresponding to the patient's clinical features. A smaller subclinical lesion was also present. The patient's history, radiographic findings, and initial hospital course, including response to treatment, appeared supportive of a stroke diagnosis. However, a rapid recovery from his severe neurological deficits and results of subsequent serologic testing strongly indicated a demyelinating condition.

The onset of adolescent multiple sclerosis can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, especially when the initial demyelinating event resembles an acute stroke in clinical and radiographic presentation. Every effort should be made to distinguish these diagnoses as early as possible to ensure timely and appropriate management.

### Asymptomatic visual loss in multiple sclerosis [^111KGsxH]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Visual disturbances are common in multiple sclerosis (MS) and are often a result of acute demyelinating optic neuropathy. A careful examination of MS patients, who have never suffered optic neuritis, may also reveal asymptomatic visual loss. This type of silent disease activity was investigated by computerized resolution perimetry, which has the potential to reflect the percentage of functional retino-cortical neural channels. The time of onset and the evolution of asymptomatic visual loss were investigated.

One approach was to retrospectively select patients who had never suffered acute optic neuritis from a closely monitored MS population and re-examine them. Sixteen patients were identified, and vision was evaluated over a period of 5.5–9 years of follow-up and compared with that of 14 healthy controls. The mean channel percentage of the MS group was 89 ± 19% (SD) on entry into the study, compared with 110 ± 15% (SD) for controls (p < 0.003). At the termination of the study, the mean percentage was essentially unchanged in both MS patients (87 ± 21%, SD) and controls (110 ± 19%, SD).

The second approach was to test a group of 7 patients with MS or strongly suspected MS, using the same method, in close connection with their first clinical exacerbation. All cases lacked visual symptoms, and none had previously had acute visual loss. Again, virtually all performed subnormally in the vision tests, to the same degree as the first group of patients. Results were compared with those obtained from 25 MS patients who had experienced one or more attacks of optic neuritis.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: Disease-modifying therapies for adults with multiple sclerosis: Report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^113AXAdX]. Neurology (2018). High credibility.

For the medical management of multiple sclerosis, specifically in regard to disease-modifying therapies, the American Academy of Neurology 2018 guidelines recommend the following counseling for patients with MS:

- **Specific treatment options**: Disease-modifying therapies are discussed at a dedicated treatment visit.

- **Disease-modifying therapy purpose**: These therapies are prescribed to reduce relapses and new MRI lesion activity, but not for symptom improvement.

- **Risk awareness**: Patients should be informed of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with natalizumab, fingolimod, rituximab, ocrelizumab, and dimethyl fumarate.

- **Undefined risks**: There is an undefined risk of malignancy and infection associated with new disease-modifying therapies that lack long-term safety data.

- **Comorbidities and interactions**: Consider the patient's comorbidities, adverse health behaviors, and potential interactions of the disease-modifying therapy with concomitant medications.
