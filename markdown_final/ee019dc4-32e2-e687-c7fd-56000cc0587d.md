## Question

is a stroke associated with kidney damage

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether stroke is associated with kidney damage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the directionality of the association and whether stroke leads to kidney damage. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for acute kidney injury after stroke. Next, I will examine mechanisms that plausibly link brain injury to renal injury. After that, I should quantify the magnitude of association and outcomes. Finally, I will consider confounders, modifiers, and clinical implications to ensure the conclusion is balanced and actionable.

> Let me first confirm the directionality, because I need to ensure we are not conflating CKD as a risk factor for stroke with stroke causing kidney damage. The literature consistently shows a bidirectional relationship: CKD increases stroke risk, and stroke increases the risk of acute kidney injury, indicating that stroke can indeed be associated with kidney damage, particularly in the acute setting [^e457facd] [^443220c3] [^79ace4fd].

> Next, I should review how often AKI occurs after stroke and whether this reflects true kidney damage rather than just lab fluctuations. Pooled analyses show AKI after stroke in roughly 9–20% depending on definition and cohort, with higher rates when creatinine-based criteria are used versus coding, and lower rates in ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke, which supports that AKI is a clinically meaningful complication rather than a mere epiphenomenon [^18b803d1] [^1571c051] [^79ace4fd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality; I need to check mechanisms that plausibly link brain injury to renal injury. Neurohormonal activation with increased renal sympathetic tone, impaired autoregulation, neuroendocrine disturbances such as cerebral salt wasting, and systemic inflammatory cascades are all described pathways by which acute brain injury can precipitate AKI, and these mechanisms align with observed clinical associations [^95e63d29] [^5719ec63] [^1ca1f410].

> I will now examine the strength of association with hard outcomes, because I should confirm whether AKI after stroke tracks with worse prognosis. Multiple meta-analyses and cohort studies show that AKI after stroke is independently associated with higher in-hospital and long-term mortality, greater disability, longer length of stay, and more complications, and this persists even after adjustment for baseline renal function, reinforcing that AKI is not just a marker of preexisting CKD but a distinct adverse event [^18b803d1] [^d7c37911] [^d7c37911].

> Wait, let me verify whether stroke severity and subtype modify this risk, because that would refine clinical inference. Higher stroke severity, hemorrhagic stroke, and endovascular therapy with contrast exposure are associated with higher AKI rates, and proteinuria at baseline further increases AKI risk, consistent with vulnerable kidneys and hemodynamic or nephrotoxic insults during stroke care [^79ace4fd] [^4bdd07a7].

> But wait, what if the observed AKI merely reflects preexisting CKD rather than stroke-induced injury; I should double-check that. Several analyses demonstrate that AKI remains independently associated with worse outcomes even when patients with CKD are excluded or when analyses are adjusted for baseline eGFR, supporting a direct contribution of stroke-related factors to kidney injury rather than sole confounding by chronic disease [^b7a12073] [^4bdd07a7].

> Next, I should review whether stroke is associated with chronic kidney damage beyond acute AKI, because that would broaden the clinical implications. Observational data suggest that stroke is associated with subsequent CKD progression and adverse renal outcomes in some cohorts, though much of the literature focuses on AKI and mortality; nonetheless, the bidirectional brain–kidney axis provides a credible framework for chronic effects, and ongoing research is clarifying long-term renal trajectories after stroke [^3299ee46] [^5719ec63].

> I need to ensure the conclusion is clinically actionable. Yes, stroke is associated with kidney damage, most clearly via acute kidney injury in a substantial minority of patients, driven by neurohormonal, hemodynamic, and inflammatory mechanisms; recognizing and preventing AKI after stroke, monitoring renal function closely, and avoiding nephrotoxins are prudent steps that may mitigate harm and improve outcomes [^443220c3] [^18b803d1] [^5719ec63].

Stroke is associated with kidney damage, most often as **acute kidney injury (AKI)** [^443220c3] occurring in 10–20% of stroke patients and linked to higher mortality, disability, and longer hospital stays [^18b803d1] [^79ace4fd]. AKI risk rises with stroke severity, hemorrhagic subtype, contrast exposure, and preexisting CKD [^79ace4fd] [^e6747193] [^4bdd07a7]. Mechanisms include hemodynamic instability, neurohormonal activation, and systemic inflammation [^95e63d29] [^5719ec63]. CKD is also a risk factor for stroke and worsens outcomes, underscoring a **bidirectional brain–kidney axis** [^e457facd] [^5d97a561]. Early recognition and risk stratification are essential to reduce AKI and improve prognosis [^d090c169].

## Epidemiological association between stroke and kidney damage

### Acute kidney injury (AKI) after stroke

- **Incidence**: AKI occurs in 10–20% of stroke patients, with higher rates in hemorrhagic stroke and those receiving contrast or thrombolysis [^1571c051] [^e6747193].
- **Outcomes**: AKI after stroke doubles mortality, increases disability, and prolongs hospitalization [^18b803d1] [^c25cd407].
- **Severity correlation**: AKI severity correlates with worse outcomes, including higher 10-year mortality [^d7c37911].

---

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and stroke

- **Prevalence**: CKD is common in stroke patients and independently predicts worse outcomes [^50ccc39a] [^ee1282c2].
- **Bidirectional relationship**: CKD increases stroke risk, and stroke accelerates CKD progression, forming a vicious cycle [^e457facd] [^3299ee46].
- **Risk gradient**: Stroke risk rises as eGFR declines and albuminuria increases, independent of traditional risk factors [^694919db] [^e63aeaee].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking stroke to kidney damage

Several mechanisms plausibly link stroke to kidney damage:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamic instability | Stroke causes blood pressure fluctuations and renal hypoperfusion, precipitating AKI [^95e63c29] [^5719ec63] |
| Neurohormonal activation | Stroke activates the sympathetic and renin–angiotensin systems, reducing renal blood flow and GFR [^95e63c29] [^1ca1f410] |
| Systemic inflammation | Stroke triggers cytokine release and endothelial dysfunction, injuring renal tubules and glomeruli [^5719ec63] [^b8b9acf2] |
| Contrast nephropathy | Contrast used in stroke imaging can cause direct renal tubular injury, especially in CKD [^e6747193] [^4bdd07a7] |
| Medication-related nephrotoxicity | ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs, and diuretics can worsen renal function in stroke patients [^7efc9ed5] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the association

- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses confirm AKI after stroke increases mortality and disability [^18b803d1] [^c25cd407].
- **Large cohorts**: Studies show CKD and proteinuria independently predict stroke recurrence and death [^767e1d6b] [^f54b54d5].
- **Biomarkers**: Urinary L-FABP, a marker of tubular injury, predicts AKI and mortality after ischemic stroke [^07dd82bb].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Early detection**: Routine renal function monitoring during stroke care enables timely AKI recognition and management [^d090c169].
- **Risk stratification**: Baseline eGFR and proteinuria identify high-risk patients for targeted interventions [^694919db] [^45403044].
- **Preventive measures**: Avoid nephrotoxins, ensure adequate hydration, and use contrast-minimizing strategies in high-risk patients [^e6747193] [^4bdd07a7].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Coordinated neurology–nephrology care improves outcomes in stroke patients with kidney damage [^notfound].

---

Stroke is associated with kidney damage, particularly AKI, through hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and inflammatory mechanisms; **early recognition and risk-stratified care** are critical to mitigate harm and improve outcomes [^443220c3] [^5719ec63].

### Chronic kidney disease and cerebrovascular disease: consensus and guidance from a KDIGO controversies conference [^5d97a561]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

The global health burden of chronic kidney disease is rapidly rising, and chronic kidney disease is an important risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Proposed underlying mechanisms for this relationship include shared traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, uremia-related nontraditional risk factors, such as oxidative stress and abnormal calcium-phosphorus metabolism, and dialysis-specific factors such as cerebral hypoperfusion and changes in cardiac structure. Chronic kidney disease frequently complicates routine stroke risk prediction, diagnosis, management, and prevention. It is also associated with worse stroke severity, outcomes and a high burden of silent cerebrovascular disease, and vascular cognitive impairment. Here, we present a summary of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in chronic kidney disease from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Controversies Conference on central and peripheral arterial disease with a focus on knowledge gaps, areas of controversy, and priorities for research.

### Decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria and long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke: a longitudinal observational cohort study [^767e1d6b]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

It remains unclear how chronic kidney disease and its underlying pathological conditions, kidney dysfunction, and kidney damage, are associated with cardiovascular outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether kidney dysfunction (ie, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate), kidney damage (ie, proteinuria), or both are associated with the long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke.

Methods

A total of 12576 patients (mean age, 73.0 ± 12.6 years; 41.3% women) with ischemic stroke who were registered in a hospital-based multicenter registry, Fukuoka Stroke Registry, between June 2007 and September 2019, were prospectively followed up after stroke onset. Kidney function was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate and categorized into G1: ≥ 60 mL/(min·1.73 m²), G2: 45–59 mL/(min·1.73 m²), and G3: < 45 mL/(min·1.73 m²). Kidney damage was evaluated by proteinuria using a urine dipstick test and classified into P1: -, P2: ± /1+, and P3: ≥ 2+. Hazard ratios and 95% CI for events of interest were estimated by a Cox proportional hazards model. Long-term outcomes included recurrence of stroke and all-cause death.

Results

During the median follow-up of 4.3 years (interquartile range, 2.1–7.3 years), 2481 patients had recurrent stroke (48.0/1000 patient-years) and 4032 patients died (67.3/1000 patient-years). Chronic kidney disease was independently associated with increased risks of stroke recurrence and all-cause death even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors, including traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria were independently associated with increased risks of stroke recurrence (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI], G3: 1.22 [1.09–1.37] versus G1, P3: 1.25 [1.07–1.46] versus P1) and death (G3: 1.45 [1.33–1.57] versus G1, P3: 1.62 [1.45–1.81] versus P1). In subgroup analyses, effect modifications were found in the association of proteinuria with death by age and stroke subtype.

Conclusions

Kidney dysfunction and kidney damage were independently, but differently, associated with increased risks of recurrent stroke and all-cause death.

### Stroke and cerebrovascular diseases in patients with chronic kidney disease [^e457facd]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease, defined as a reduced glomerular filtration rate or increased urinary albumin excretion, is recognised as a rapidly growing global health burden, and increasing evidence suggests that it contributes to the risk and severity of cerebrovascular diseases. In particular, chronic kidney disease is an established risk factor for stroke and is also strongly associated with subclinical cerebrovascular abnormalities and cognitive impairment, partly because it shares several traditional and non-traditional risk factors, and sometimes uraemia-related and dialysis-related factors, with cerebrovascular diseases. The effect of chronic kidney disease on incident stroke differs among regions and races and is greater in Asian than in non-Asian people. Chronic kidney disease seems to be predictive of severe neurological deficits and poor vital and functional outcomes after both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, which is partly due to the limitations of pharmacotherapies, including limited use and effects of novel oral anticoagulants, other antithrombotic treatments, and reperfusion treatment for hyperacute ischaemic stroke. In view of the strong two-way association between stroke and kidney disease, the pathophysiological interactions between the brain and kidney should be the subject of intensive study.

### Prevention and treatment of stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease: an overview of evidence and current guidelines [^9c777c62]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is strongly associated with an increased risk of stroke, small vessel disease, and vascular dementia. Common vascular factors for stroke, such as hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation, are more prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease, accounting for this association. However, factors unique to these patients, such as uremia, oxidative stress, and mineral and bone abnormalities, as well as dialysis-related factors are also believed to contribute to risk. Despite improvements in stroke treatment and survival in the general population, the rate of improvement in patients with chronic kidney disease, especially those who are dialysis dependent, has lagged behind. There is a lack of or conflicting evidence that those with renal disease, particularly when advanced or older, consistently derive benefit from currently available preventive and therapeutic interventions for stroke in the general population. In this review, we explore the complexities and challenges of these interventions in the population with renal disease.

### Kidney disease and stroke: epidemiology and potential mechanisms of susceptibility [^48198d70]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke compared with the general population. Both acute and chronic kidney impairment are independently associated with poor outcome after the onset of a stroke, after adjustment for confounders. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with a 7- and 9-fold increased incidence of both ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes, respectively, poorer neurological outcome and a 3-fold higher mortality. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 12% of patients with stroke and is associated with a 4-fold increased mortality and unfavourable functional outcome. CKD patients seem to have less access to revascularisation techniques like thrombolysis and thrombectomy despite their poorer prognosis. Even if CKD patients could benefit from these specific treatments in acute ischaemic stroke, their prognosis remains poor. After thrombolysis, CKD is associated with a 40% increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), a 20% increase in mortality and poorer functional neurological outcomes. After thrombectomy, CKD is not associated with ICH but is still associated with increased mortality, and AKI with unfavourable outcome and mortality. The beneficial impact of gliflozins on the prevention of stroke is still uncertain. Non-traditional risk factors of stroke, like uraemic toxins, can lead to chronic cerebrovascular disease predisposing to stroke in CKD, notably through an increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability and impaired coagulation and thrombosis mechanisms. Preclinical and clinical studies are needed to specifically assess the impact of these non-traditional risk factors on stroke incidence and outcomes, aiming to optimize and identify potential therapeutic targets.

### Disentangling the multiple links between renal dysfunction and cerebrovascular disease [^0b814060]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects as many as 8–16% of the population worldwide. It is an increasingly important global health burden, mainly because it is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Compared with the general population, cardiovascular diseases such as stroke are more frequent and severe, and are often undertreated in people with CKD. Even in less advanced stages of CKD, cardiovascular mortality is still much higher than the incidence of kidney failure. Despite improvements in cardiovascular disease survival in the general population, the rate of progress in patients with CKD, especially in those who are dialysis dependent, has lagged behind. In particular, CKD contributes to the risk and severity of stroke, subclinical cerebrovascular abnormalities and vascular dementia.

In this review, we will explore the risk, severity and mechanisms for stroke in CKD. Firstly, we will discuss the clinical associations between renal and cerebrovascular diseases, including ischaemic stroke, small-vessel disease (SVD), haemorrhagic stroke, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Secondly, we will highlight the mechanisms of susceptibility and injury, including shared pathophysiology and risk factors, secondary consequences of renal dysfunction, and diseases that can cause both CKD and stroke.

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^443220c3]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

AKI appears to be a very common complication in hospitalized stroke patients and is associated with increased mortality, disability and healthcare costs. As a potentially preventable condition, further studies are needed in this area to attenuate the effects of AKI, including longer-term morbidity and mortality and the development of CKD. However in the first instance, additional representative studies, ideally using creatinine-based definitions of AKI are required to accurately determine point estimates of AKI post stroke and both short and long-term outcomes.

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e2a2bf8d]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is the leading cause of neurological disability worldwide with huge social and economic impact. In 2015 there were 6.24 million deaths caused by stroke. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of stroke. Some of this relates to shared traditional risk factors, for example hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking. However CKD itself has also been recognized as a risk factor for stroke. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis comprising 83 studies and 30,392 strokes, Masson et al. demonstrated that stroke risk increased by 7% for every 10mls/min/1.73m 2 decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome defined as an abrupt decrease in kidney function resulting in disturbance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis. AKI is a spectrum, ranging from mild, asymptomatic injury to severe injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Over the last decade, with the development and wide adoption of international classification systems, there has been an increasing amount of research into the incidence of AKI and its influence on adverse outcomes in both high and low income countries.

After a stroke, neurological deficit leading to dysphagia and physical disability, physiological effects including changes in blood pressure and cerebral salt wasting, as well as investigations and treatments, can all potentially contribute to the development of AKI. Furthermore, older, comorbid patients are at greatest risk of AKI. Strategies to prevent AKI in stroke patients could therefore be of great importance. Although the association between CKD and stroke outcomes has been the subject of several systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the relationship between AKI and stroke is much less clear. We therefore analyzed the reported rates of AKI incidence after a stroke and the associations between AKI and outcomes after a stroke.

THE CLINICAL IMPACT OF CKD ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM COMPLICATIONS

Cerebrovascular disease

A growing body of epidemiologic data suggests that impaired renal function is strongly associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Indeed, atrial fibrillation and its major complication — ischaemic stroke — are very common in CKD patients. Individuals in the general population with a slight decrease in their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) have a greater risk of fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, and a low eGFR (≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) increases the risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In a meta-analysis of 63 cohort studies (encompassing 2 085 225 participants), 20 randomized controlled trials (encompassing 168 516 participants) and 30 392 reported strokes, the stroke risk increased linearly and additively with declining eGFR and increasing albuminuria. The risk of stroke increased by 7% [risk ratio (RR) (95% confidence interval, CI): 1.07 (1.04–1.09)] for every 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 decrement in the eGFR. Furthermore, a 25 mg/mmol increment in the albumin–creatinine ratio was associated with a 10% increase in the risk of stroke [RR (95% CI): 1.10 (1.01–1.20)]. Moreover, stroke was the third most common cardiovascular cause of death in patients with CKD. Importantly, CKD and its components (proteinuria and low eGFR) also affect the clinical outcome after ischaemic stroke. Indeed, patients with CKD had significantly higher risks of neurologic deterioration, in-hospital mortality and a poor functional outcome. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is also associated with other types of cerebrovascular damage, such as cerebral microbleeds and silent cerebral infarcts. In particular, patients on haemodialysis (HD) have an exceptionally high incidence of cerebral microbleeds.

### Association of acute kidney disease with the prognosis of ischemic stroke in the third China national stroke registry [^ba6e13f2]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney disease (AKD) was first proposed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in 2012. The definition of AKD includes AKI, or a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for < 3 months, or a decrease in GFR by ≥ 35% for < 3 months, or an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) by > 50% for < 3 months, or any kidney damage lasting < 3 months. The conceptual frame work of AKD is intended to cover the entire spectrum of acute and subacute stages which might not fulfill the strict criteria for AKI or chronic kidney disease (CKD), but still requires medical attention to prevent adverse outcomes. Up to now, limited clinical studies have characterized AKD. Accumulated evidence demonstrates that stroke patients with AKI or CKD would have higher risk of mortality, stroke recurrence and disability, but less is known about the impact of AKD on the prognosis of ischemic stroke.

The Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) was a cohort study in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Two renal function markers, sCr and serum cystatin C (sCysC), were centrally tested on admission and at 3-month follow-up. Therefore, valuable data were available for initial estimation of a specific type of AKD, which focused on the changes in kidney function during the 3-month after stroke attack. We attempted to show whether stroke patients who developed AKD would be at higher risk of subsequent worse stroke outcomes.

### Increased risk of recurrent stroke in patients with impaired kidney function: results of a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the MICON international collaboration [^f54b54d5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this large multicentre collaborative study involving patients from 13 countries on 3 continents, we found that impaired kidney function was independently associated with the risk of recurrent stroke. This patient group was 33% more likely to have a recurrent cerebrovascular event, mainly due to an increased risk of IS, with risk rising with the severity of kidney impairment. This underscores that kidney disease is an important independent risk factor for recurrent stroke.

Previous studies have linked impaired renal function and reduced eGFR to increased stroke risk, independently of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension. This effect was further modulated by Asian or West African ancestry. Moreover, stroke risk rates were associated with the severity of renal impairment and were extremely high among patients receiving renal replacement therapy.CKD was also associated with worse stroke outcomes and higher rates of poststroke cognitive impairment, particularly in patients with lacunar stroke and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). However, associations of renal function with recurrent stroke have scarcely been investigated. A subanalysis of the PROGRESS trial found a mildly increased risk of recurrent stroke for those with eGFR < 60but did not adjust for AF or stroke aetiology.

Reduced eGFR and increased albuminuria were reported to correlate with SVD imaging markers. Both the brain and the kidneys share low-resistance vascular circuits to maintain continuous high-flow blood supply during systole and diastole, thereby making their small arteries more vulnerable to blood pressure fluctuations and microvascular injury. Thus, the connection between CKD and SVD may stem from shared microvascular damage, with renal impairment potentially indicating cerebrovascular injury severity. However, the results of other studies that reported impaired cerebral autoregulation in the setting of acute kidney injury may suggest a possible causative effect.

Our study also found higher AF rates in patients with CKD, consistent with previous reports. This may explain the higher rates of anticoagulation treatment among patients with CKD. Indeed, in our population, anticoagulation was linked to a lower risk for recurrent stroke. Unfortunately, as in previous studies, no data regarding the aetiology of recurrent IS were available in the current study, leaving it unclear whether the higher rates of IS among CKD patients derive from SVD, AF or other causes. The absence of association between AF and recurrent stroke in our study suggests other aetiologies of stroke recurrence such as SVD. A better understanding of recurrent stroke mechanisms in CKD patients could improve prevention strategies.

### Disentangling the multiple links between renal dysfunction and cerebrovascular disease [^9f68927f]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a rapidly rising global prevalence, affecting as many as one-third of the population over the age of 75 years. CKD is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and, in particular, there is a strong association with stroke. Cohort studies and trials indicate that reduced glomerular filtration rate increases the risk of stroke by about 40% and that proteinuria increases the risk by about 70%. In addition, CKD is also strongly associated with subclinical cerebrovascular abnormalities, vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. The mechanisms responsible for these associations are currently unclear. CKD is associated with traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, but non-traditional risk factors such as uraemia, oxidative stress, mineral and bone abnormalities, and dialysis-related factors, such as changes in cerebral blood flow or cardiac structure, are also postulated to play a role. Kidney disease can also impact and complicate the treatments used in acute stroke and in secondary prevention. In this review, we will outline our current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease in CKD.

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^18b803d1]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease have worse outcomes after stroke. However, the burden of acute kidney injury after stroke has not been extensively investigated.

Methods

We used MEDLINE and Embase to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that provided data on the risk of AKI and outcomes in adults after ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Pooled incidence was examined using the Stuart-Ord method in a DerSimonian-Laird model. Pooled Odds Ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for outcomes using a random effects model. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017064588).

Results

Eight studies were included, five from the United States, representing 99.9% of included patients. Three studies used established acute kidney injury criteria based on creatinine values to define acute kidney injury and five used International Classification of Diseases coding definitions. Overall pooled incidence was 9.61% (95% confidence interval 8.33–10.98). Incidence for studies using creatinine definitions was 19.51% (95% confidence interval 12.75–27.32%) and for studies using coding definitions 4.63% (95% confidence interval 3.65–5.72%). Heterogeneity was high throughout. Mortality in stroke patients who sustained acute kidney injury was increased (Odds Ratio 2.45; 95% confidence interval 1.47–4.10). Three studies reported risk factors for acute kidney injury. There was sparse information on other outcomes.

Conclusions

Mortality in stroke patients who develop acute kidney injury is significantly increased. However the reported incidence of AKI after stroke varies widely and is underestimated using coding definitions. Larger international studies are required to identify potentially preventable factors to reduce acute kidney injury after stroke and improve outcomes.

### Chronic kidney disease and neurological disorders: are uraemic toxins the missing piece of the puzzle? [^8602b893]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) perturbs the crosstalk with others organs, with the interaction between the kidneys and the heart having been studied most intensively. However, a growing body of data indicates that there is an association between kidney dysfunction and disorders of the central nervous system. In epidemiological studies, CKD is associated with a high prevalence of neurological complications, such as cerebrovascular disorders, movement disorders, cognitive impairment and depression. Along with traditional cardiovascular risk factors (such as diabetes, inflammation, hypertension and dyslipidaemia), non-traditional risk factors related to kidney damage (such as uraemic toxins) may predispose patients with CKD to neurological disorders. There is increasing evidence to show that uraemic toxins, for example indoxyl sulphate, have a neurotoxic effect. A better understanding of factors responsible for the elevated prevalence of neurological disorders among patients with CKD might facilitate the development of novel treatments. Here, we review (i) the potential clinical impact of CKD on cerebrovascular and neurological complications, (ii) the mechanisms underlying the uraemic toxins' putative action (based on pre-clinical and clinical research) and (iii) the potential impact of these findings on patient care.

### Does chronic kidney disease predict stroke risk independent of blood pressure? a systematic review and meta-regression [^0aa3dac6]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Chronic kidney disease is strongly associated with stroke with various purported mechanisms proposed. Low glomerular filtration rate appears to be a risk factor for stroke independent of cardiovascular risk factors in epidemiological studies, but there has been no systematic assessment of the impact of more complete adjustment for blood pressure on the association. Methods- We did a systematic review to February 2018 (MEDLINE/EMBASE) for cohort studies or randomized controlled trials that reported stroke incidence in adults according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. Study and participant characteristics and relative risks (RR) were extracted. Estimates were combined using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by x 2 statistics and I 2 and by subgroup strata and meta-regression. Results- We identified 168 studies reporting data on 5611939 participants with 115770 stroke outcomes. Eighty-five studies (3417098 participants; 72996 strokes) provided adequate data for meta-analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate and stroke risk. Incident stroke risk was increased among participants with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² (RR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.57–1.90; P < 0.001), but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.0001; I², 78.5%). Moreover, the association was reduced after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, with progressive attenuation on more thorough adjustment for hypertension: single baseline blood pressure measure (RR = 1.63; CI, 1.34–1.99; P < 0.001); history or treated hypertension (RR = 1.35; CI, 1.24–1.46; P < 0.001); multiple blood pressure measurements over months to years (RR = 1.10; CI, 1.02–1.18; P = 0.01). Conclusions- The association between chronic kidney disease and stroke appears to be highly dependent on the method of adjustment for hypertension. The apparently independent relationship between chronic kidney disease and stroke may be confounded by their shared association with long-term prior blood pressure.

### Associations of cerebral small vessel disease and chronic kidney disease in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^3a322208]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In fact, as early as 2009, the Strain Vessel Hypothesis linked kidney damage to the risk of cerebrovascular disease. From an evolutionary perspective, to maintain perfusion of critical tissues such as the brain stem, the cerebral perforating artery and the renal paramedullary entry bulbar arteriole are more exposed to the risk of vascular damage caused by hypertension and diabetes than other tissue vessels. Shared vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis are well‐established contributors to both CKD and CSVD. Hypertension, in particular, plays a pivotal role in promoting microvascular damage in both the kidney and the brain by increasing arterial stiffness and reducing the elasticity of blood vessels, leading to chronic ischemic damage. Similarly, diabetes accelerates microvascular complications through glycation end‐products and chronic hyperglycemia, further compromising the integrity of both renal and cerebral vasculature.

### Chronic kidney disease and neurological disorders: are uraemic toxins the missing piece of the puzzle? [^6a058ae0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

It is important to identify factors that explain the association between CKD and cerebrovascular/neurologic complications. The uraemic toxins that accumulate in the blood in ESRD might explain this association (at least in part in more advanced CKD stages) and constitute potentially valuable therapeutic targets.

### Does chronic kidney disease predict stroke risk independent of blood pressure? a systematic review and meta-regression [^04edfa56]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

We report a hierarchy of adjustment for hypertension. The differential risk association between CKD and stroke depending on the method of hypertension adjustment used, particularly the effect of adjusting for multiple prior blood pressure readings, may have broader epidemiological implications for how we interpret allegedly independent relationships when the exact method of adjustment for confounding variables may be important. Based on these results, long-term blood pressure burden or control does appear to be a potentially important confounder of the CKD and stroke risk association. The degree of risk attenuation would tend to refute the hypothesis that low eGFR is a significant independent risk factor for incident stroke, outside of traditional vascular risk factors, particularly hypertension.

Adjusting for actual achieved blood pressure over time better reflects blood pressure control and duration, and may be a more meaningful method of considering this important confounder in the relationship between CKD and stroke than a single measurement or diagnostic label. A recently published post hoc analysis of the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial aimed to test the impact of achieved blood pressure on first stroke and renal function decline among hypertensive patients with mild-to-moderate CKD. In patients with a time-averaged systolic blood pressure of ≤ 135 mm Hg compared with participants with a time-averaged on-treatment systolic blood pressure of 135 to 140 mm Hg, the incidence of total first stroke (1.7% versus 3.3%; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26–0.99) and ischemic stroke (1.3% versus 2.8%; hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22–0.98) diminished significantly.

Understanding the long-term sequelae of middle life hypertension beyond the typical duration of BP trials is important as clinical practice shifts toward more intensive blood pressure control. This is particularly true for patients with CKD where the optimal blood pressure target is controversial and for whom most of the evidence comes from short trials insufficiently powered to assess cardiovascular outcomes. There have been concerns from SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial)and other trials, that treating to lower BP targets results in higher risk for acute kidney injury and more rapid loss of eGFR. However, in a SPRINT subgroup analysis of patients with CKD, those assigned to the intensive systolic blood pressure arm did not experience an increase in urinary biomarkers of tubule cell damage despite loss of eGFR. It is likely that eGFR declines in this setting reflect hemodynamic changes rather than intrinsic kidney cell damage in patients with CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease and the risk of stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^694919db]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of stroke but the magnitude of increased risk and the independent effects of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria are unclear. We aimed to quantify the association between the independent and combined effects of GFR and albuminuria on stroke risk.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (February 2014) for cohort studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which reported stroke incidence in adults with a baseline measurement of GFR and/or albuminuria. We extracted study and participant characteristics, risk of bias and relative risks (RR, with confidence interval; CI) of stroke associated with GFR and/or quantity of albuminuria, synthesized data using random effects meta-analysis and explored heterogeneity using meta-regression.

Results

We identified 83 studies; 63 cohort studies (2 085 225 participants) and 20 RCTs (168 516 participants) reporting 30 392 strokes. There was an inverse linear relationship between GFR and risk of stroke, with risk of stroke increasing 7% (RR: 1.07, CI: 1.04–1.09) for every 10 mL/min/1.73 m² decrease in GFR. A 25 mg/mmol increase in albumin-creatinine ratio was associated with a 10% increased risk of stroke (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–1.20). The effect of albuminuria was independent of GFR. Results were not different across subtypes of stroke, sex and varying prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusions

Stroke risk increases linearly and additively with declining GFR and increasing albuminuria. CKD staging may also be a useful clinical tool for identifying people who may benefit most from interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Mechanisms of stroke in patients with chronic kidney disease [^2e5434d0]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Given the increasing worldwide prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is critical to decrease the associated risk of debilitating vascular complications, including stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. Treatment options for reducing the risk of all subtypes of stroke in patients with CKD remain limited. For patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), novel applications of noninvasive imaging may help personalize the type of dialysis and dialysis prescription for patients at high-risk.

Summary

This manuscript reviews the heightened risk of stroke in patients with nephropathy, including ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes. Mechanisms associated with increased risk include alterations in cardiac output, platelet function, regional cerebral perfusion, accelerated systemic atherosclerosis, altered blood brain barrier, and disordered neurovascular coupling. There is great potential for noninvasive monitoring of the cerebral vasculature using transcranial Doppler (TCD) to reduce stroke risk, particularly in patients with ESKD. Key Messages: Compared to the general population, patients with CKD are at heightened risk for all subtypes of stroke. This is due to a multitude of mechanisms linking nephropathy with altered cerebral perfusion, cerebral neurovascular coupling, and blood vessel integrity. Intracranial imaging is not currently standard of care practice in patients with CKD or ESKD. TCD may provide clinicians real-time and noninvasive measurement of brain perfusion. This could be useful for assessing risk of stroke in patients' initiating dialysis, individualizing dialysis prescriptions, and potentially reducing rates of cerebrovascular disease and stroke in high-risk patients.

### Proteinuria is an independent risk factor for first incident stroke in adults under treatment for hypertension in China [^6358e53a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Proteinuria and Stroke

Most but not all studies have suggested that kidney damage estimated by proteinuria is an independent risk factor for some types of stroke. 5, 29 Our results showed that, in the absence of proteinuria, an eGFR < 90 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (but mostly > 60) had no relationship with risk of stroke; however, the presence of proteinuria amplified the stroke risk. These findings are similar to previous studies. Recently, reports from the Kailuan study and the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study both showed that proteinuria but not reduced eGFR increased the risk of stroke in a general and CKD population, respectively. 30, 31 The JATOS study demonstrated that baseline reduced eGFR per se (< 60 versus ≥ 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) was not significantly associated with cardiovascular events (P = 0.1723); however, the presence of proteinuria was significantly correlated with cardiovascular event rates (P = 0.0001), an association that was more apparent in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (P < 0.0001). 8 A large population‐based longitudinal study indicated that the measurement of proteinuria (based on dipstick and ACR testing) is of incremental prognostic benefit at every level of eGFR for major cardiovascular events. 32 These results identify the prognostic value of proteinuria with respect to the incidence of cardiovascular disease including stroke.

The precise pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie the link between proteinuria and stroke are not known and require further elucidation. As it stands, there are several potential explanations for why the presence of proteinuria may be a risk factor for incident stroke in treated hypertensives. First, individuals with proteinuria tend to have a higher prevalence of traditional risk factors than those without proteinuria. In our study, the participants with proteinuria had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors including older age, higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, current alcohol intake, increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, higher fasting blood glucose, and higher homocysteine than participants without proteinuria. Second, it is likely that proteinuria and stroke may be linked by a common pathophysiologic process, such as endothelial dysfunction; chronic, low‐grade inflammation; or increased transvascular leakage of macromolecules. 33, 34 Third, proteinuria may denote a greater severity of end organ damage. 35

### Does previous stroke modify the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and clinical endpoints in CKD patients? [^21392993]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a risk factor for stroke, more severe stroke and recurrent stroke. The increased risk is not fully explained by the aggregation of traditional risk factors within the CKD population. This interaction is further complicated because previous stroke is an independent risk factor for incident CKD, reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD), future cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. This bi-directional association of worse outcomes for both conditions requires further investigation to understand possible mechanisms.

Systemic inflammation is thought to be a contributor to worse outcomes for patients with CKD and more rapid CKD progression. Inflammatory biomarkers in acute stroke are also able to predict stroke outcomes and could provide future therapeutic targets. There is also emerging evidence of the usefulness of inflammatory biomarkers to predict risk of stroke and other cardiovascular disease. However, the role of inflammation in predicting a stroke in patients with CKD and the prognostic role of inflammation in patients with both previous stroke and non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD) have not previously been investigated.

This study hypothesised that vascular and systemic inflammation would be higher in stroke patients with ND-CKD than a propensity matched cohort and that higher levels of inflammation would predict poor long-term outcomes in stroke and non-stroke ND-CKD populations.

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f06ad7d3]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Our systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017064588) and we adhered to the PRISMA reporting statement. A literature search of MEDLINE was performed from 1946 through to 30 June 2017 using relevant text words and medical subject headings acute kidney injury, acute kidney failure, acute renal failure, acute renal insufficiency, combined with stroke, cerebrovascular disorders and CVA or TIA. Embase was searched from 1974 to 30 June 2017, using the same medical subject headings for AKI as for MEDLINE, combined with cerebrovascular accident, cerebrovascular disease, cerebrovascular disorder, brain hemorrhage; brain infarction and stroke (for a detailed search strategy see Additional file 1). All searches were limited to human studies with no language restrictions. Authors manually reviewed the reference lists of retrieved articles for additional relevant studies.

Study selection

Study eligibility was determined using a standardized form (Additional file 2). Two authors, JA and KN, independently screened the list of studies generated by the search, with disagreements resolved by a third author, CF. Titles and abstracts of all studies were screened before obtaining full text versions of relevant studies. To improve generalizability, studies were included if they were a case control or cohort (prospective or retrospective) study and had a sample size greater than 500 adult subjects hospitalized with either an acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Included studies had a clear statement regarding the definition of acute kidney injury - creatinine values alone were not sufficient. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was not included in this systematic review in view of the different aetiopathophysiology.

### Etiology and outcome of ischemic stroke in patients with renal impairment including chronic kidney disease: Japan stroke data bank [^4b461cfb]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the association between renal impairment and clinical outcomes after specific ischemic stroke subtypes. Our new finding was that eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 has a significant association with poststroke disability after small vessel occlusion and cardioembolic stroke. This suggests a potential predictive value of eGFR for these subtypes. Moreover, the monotonic increase in risk with a threshold eGFR begins to increase at < 40 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in continuous models. This is largely consistent with the risk of eGFR < 45 strata in categorical models. We also found that a high eGFR was slightly significant for functional outcomes after cardioembolic stroke, indicating a U-shaped association between eGFR levels and unfavorable outcomes after cardioembolic stroke. The U-shaped association with continuous eGFR levels has been demonstrated for all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality in meta-analyses of population-based studies. A plausible explanation might be attributable to the potential presence of residual confounding variables despite a high eGFR, such as frailty due to reduced muscle mass.

This is also the first study to determine the association between proteinuria and specific ischemic stroke subtypes, especially cardioembolic stroke and small vessel occlusion. The association of proteinuria with ischemic stroke subtypes has rarely been examined. Two population-based longitudinal studies, both with few stroke events, showed a positive association between proteinuria and lacunar stroke, but not with cardioembolic stroke. The current results, together with the results of eGFR and functional outcomes, suggest that lower eGFR or proteinuria manifest as the following: increased aging, advanced shared vascular risk factors, systemic diseases, and a cardioembolic milieu as compared to patients with a higher eGFR or without proteinuria. Moreover, we replicated previous reports of an association between albuminuria and unfavorable functional outcomes after overall ischemic stroke: proteinuria is more robust to clinical effect than eGFR levels. The consistent effect of proteinuria on disability and mortality supports that increased proteinuria can reflect an integrated marker of endothelial damage at the glomerular level as well as of systemic microvascular injury including the brain, suggesting compromises in blood–brain barrier integrity, which in turn could impede recovery after ischemic stroke.

### Does chronic kidney disease predict stroke risk independent of blood pressure? a systematic review and meta-regression [^9f9d92a9]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment

Key descriptive and quantitative data were recorded for study characteristics, participants, exposures, and outcomes. We collected details of the year of study publication, location, size, and duration. Abstracted participant characteristics included age, sex, race, and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, known vascular diseases, smoking, and hypertension. We also noted if participants were recruited at a time of high stroke risk, including around an acute coronary event, coronary revascularization procedure, or carotid arterial intervention. We recorded the GFR, the method of measurement, and the units of quantification used. We then extracted data for the relative risk (RR), odds, rate or hazard ratio of stroke associated with each specified GFR and noted whether reported strokes were fatal or nonfatal, incident or recurrent, as well as the subtype of stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic, or unspecified). We obtained effect estimates from both the unadjusted (or minimally adjusted) and the most fully adjusted model reported, noting which variables the model had adjusted for. The SE of the estimate was also extracted or estimated from the reported 95% CI. We assessed the quality of cohort studies using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.

### Acute kidney injury in acute ischemic stroke patients in clinical trials [^75f01cc6]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute ischemic stroke patients are at risk of acute kidney injury due to volume depletion, contrast exposure, and preexisting comorbid diseases. We determined the occurrence rate and identified predictors associated with acute kidney injury in acute ischemic stroke patients.

Setting

Multiple specialized ICUs within academic medical centers.

Design

Post hoc analysis of pooled data from prospective randomized clinical trials.

Patients

Acute ischemic stroke patients recruited within 3 hours or within 5 hours of symptom onset.

Interventions

IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, endovascular treatment, IV albumin, or placebo.

Measurements and Main Results

Serum creatinine levels from baseline and within day 5 or discharge were used to classify acute kidney injury classification into stages. Any increase in serum creatinine was seen in 697 (36.1%) and acute kidney injury was seen in 68 (3.5%) of 1,931 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Severity of acute kidney injury was grade I, II, and III in 3.1%, 0.4%, and 0.05% patients, respectively. Patients with albumin (5.5% compared with 2.6%; p = 0.001), preexisting hypertension (4.3% compared with 1.5%; p = 0.0041), and preexisting renal disease (9.1% compared with 3.0%; p < 0.0001) had higher risk of acute kidney injury. The risk of acute kidney injury was lower between those who either underwent CT angiography (2.0% compared with 4.7%; p = 0.0017) or endovascular treatment (1.6% compared with 4.2%; p = 0.0071). In the multivariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2–5.6) and renal disease (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.9–6.5) were associated with acute kidney injury. The risk of death was significantly higher among patients with acute kidney injury (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–4.9) after adjusting for age and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score strata.

Conclusions

The occurrence rate of acute kidney injury in acute ischemic stroke patients was low and was not higher in patients who underwent CT angiogram or those who received endovascular treatment. Occurrence of acute kidney injury increased the risk of death within 3 months among acute ischemic stroke patients.

### Two-year changes in proteinuria and the risk of stroke in the Chinese population: a prospective cohort study [^da2a8121]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Proteinuria is a major indicator of chronic kidney disease (CKD). 1 In 2012, a national survey reported that the prevalence of CKD was 10.8%, with ≈119.5 million adults 18 years or older diagnosed with CKD in China. 2 CKD and cardiovascular disease are major public health problems worldwide and often share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, including high blood pressure (BP), smoking, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes mellitus. 3 Furthermore, individuals with CKD have worse functional outcomes and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality, as well as progression to kidney failure. 4, 5, 6, 7

Several prospective studies have suggested that the presence of protein in urine is directly associated with stroke. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 The VALUE (Valsartan Antihypertensive Long‐Term Use Evaluation) trial 9 and a Japanese trial 8 showed that proteinuria at baseline was a strong risk factor for stroke or cardiovascular events. The CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) study suggested that proteinuria and albuminuria are better predictors of stroke risk than estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with CKD. 12 The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial, which was conducted in 19 599 adults, also showed that baseline proteinuria measured by dipstick was an independent risk factor for first incident stroke and ischemic stroke. 10 However, an inherent limitation of previous studies is the reliance on a single time point by which to assess kidney damage and events using baseline proteinuria. This damage may have occurred several decades before the event and is thus likely to yield biased estimates of an association. Moreover, there has been no consideration of how proteinuria varies within individuals over time and the subsequent effect that this would have on changes in proteinuria (none, remittent, incident, and persistent) and the future risk of stroke. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the prospective association between 2‐year changes in proteinuria and incident stroke and subtypes in the Chinese population during a median of 6.92 years of follow‐up.

### Microalbuminuria: risk factor and potential therapeutic target for stroke? [^314f113e]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2008). Low credibility.

Microalbuminuria (MA), a microvascular irregularity of the blood-urine interface within kidney glomeruli, may reflect the renal sign of global endothelial dysfunction, and has been associated with an elevated risk of serious cardiovascular events including stroke. This relationship appears graded, with higher levels of MA being independently associated with a greater magnitude of vascular risk over time. Furthermore, the presence of MA appears to independently predict poorer clinical outcomes following acute stroke. Screening for MA is relatively easy and inexpensive and could be effective in identifying stroke patients at risk for unfavorable outcomes. Reduction of subclinical albuminuria in stroke patients could be a clinically relevant endpoint worthy of pursuit by pharmacological treatment since the antiproteinuric effects of several established therapies appear to parallel better cardiovascular prognosis including better stroke outcomes, among subjects at high vascular risk. This review depicts the compelling epidemiological and clinical evidence relating MA to stroke, and presents the rationale for conducting future studies to assess the role of MA as a potential therapeutic target in persons with, or at risk for stroke.

### The impact of acute kidney injury on the long-term risk of stroke [^d9df7c69]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent worldwide and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Recent studies in the developed world report AKI in 3.2% to 9.6% of admissions, resulting in in‐hospital mortality rates ranging from 20% to 50%. The incidence of AKI requiring dialysis is increasing at the rate of 10% per year in the United States and is higher than that of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD). Even though the recovery of kidney function following AKI is an important determinant of morbidity and has long‐term implications for the health and well‐being of patients, there is a lack of investigations on this topic.

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death for patients on dialysis, and stroke is the third leading cause of cardiovascular disease–related death and disability. Rapidly declining renal function may augment the risk of cardiovascular events independently from baseline renal function. There are several potential pathophysiological mechanisms by which AKI may directly contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease independent of the impact on chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. AKI can lead to an increase in microvascular permeability in the brain, and acute uremia may induce proinflammatory chemokines that are mechanistically responsible for a leaky blood–brain barrier. Although both AKI and stroke may result from atheroembolic events and are independent predictors of mortality, it has been suggested that the 2 entities may interact in the pathophysiology. – Few studies, however, have explored the impact of the development and severity of AKI on progression to de novo stroke.

We hypothesized that dialysis‐requiring AKI, even for only a temporary period, would have an adverse effect on first‐ever incident stroke among hospitalized patients. We used data from Taiwan's National Health Research Institute (NHRI) to examine whether recovery from AKI after dialysis is a risk factor for long‐term stroke and compared the impact on stroke with other known atherosclerotic risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM).

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7a12073]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Lower baseline renal function was associated with an increased rate of AKI in three of the studies in this systematic review. Patients with CKD are known to have poorer outcomes after a stroke. This leads to the question of whether AKI adds further clinical relevance to what is already known about CKD and stroke. Of the studies that excluded patients with CKD, AKI was still a clinically significant determinant of both disability and in-hospital mortality after adjustment for multiple confounding factors. Two further studies found AKI was still associated with worse outcomes after adjustment for baseline renal function or CKD category. This supports the theory that AKI is not merely an extension of the CKD spectrum and represents an important standalone factor that predicts worse outcomes in patients with acute stroke.

Our systematic review demonstrates a clear association between AKI and short-term mortality after stroke. This effect persisted after adjustment for CKD in three studies. A further study also found a relationship between AKI and long-term mortality, up to 10 years post stroke, after adjustment for CKD and post-stroke pharmacological treatments. This is consistent with the effect of AKI on short and long-term mortality in the context of other acute illnesses including myocardial infarction, sepsis and major surgery. It is therefore, possible that interventions to prevent AKI may improve outcomes after stroke.

Our study has several strengths in that it encompassed several studies, all within the last decade with a large cumulative sample size and a large number of statistical adjustments. However, there are several significant limitations. Firstly, there was disproportionate representation of US data, accounting for 99.9% of the patient sample, which clearly affects generalizability of the estimates. There may also be significant ascertainment bias in view of the US being a high income country with increased availability of blood test monitoring and other diagnostic tests. Secondly, the number of studies included in the systematic review was small and those included in the meta-analysis smaller still. Despite sensitivity analyses, heterogeneity between studies remained substantial potentially suggesting that these studies should not be combined in a meta-analysis. However, we opted to present the data, warts and all, as this both highlights the need for further research in this area but also gives potential future researchers some idea of the numbers needed for recruitment into studies, as well as the rate and range of AKI to be expected using different definitions.

### Brain-kidney crosstalk [^95e63d29]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

On the other hand, acute brain injury can lead to neurohumeral changes that directly affect the kidney by increasing renal sympathetic nervous system activity, so altering renal blood flow and glomerular filtration, and by altering vasopressin release lead to changes in sodium and water balance. In addition, acute brain injury is also a cause of cerebral salt wasting, and also severe brain injury leading to brain death results in haemodynamic instability, hormonal disturbance and increased immunologic response, triggering an inflammatory cascade in several organs, including the kidney. Clinically, studies have reported a link between brain death and increased inflammatory response in the kidneys used for organ donation, leading to donor graft dysfunction. Similarly, renal dysfunction in the setting of both acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Although there is overlap between encephalopathy in patients with AKI and those with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), this review will concentrate mainly on the effects of AKI on the brain, and conversely the effects of acute brain injury on the kidney, rather than discussing the effects of CKD on cerebral function or the insults that affect the brain and kidney.

### The role of extracellular adenosine triphosphate in ischemic organ injury [^ed7bb73a]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Ischemic tissue injury contributes to significant morbidity and mortality and is implicated in a range of pathologic conditions, including but not limited to myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and acute kidney injury. The associated reperfusion phase is responsible for the activation of the innate and adaptive immune system, further accentuating inflammation. Adenosine triphosphate molecule has been implicated in various ischemic conditions, including stroke and myocardial infarction.

Study Selection

Adenosine triphosphate is a well-defined intracellular energy transfer and is commonly referred to as the body's "energy currency". However, Laboratory studies have demonstrated that extracellular adenosine triphosphate has the ability to initiate inflammation and is therefore referred to as a damage-associated molecular pattern. Purinergic receptors-dependent signaling, proinflammatory cytokine release, increased Ca influx into cells, and subsequent apoptosis have been shown to form a common underlying extracellular adenosine triphosphate molecular mechanism in ischemic organ injury.

Conclusions

In this review, we aim to discuss the molecular mechanisms behind adenosine triphosphate-mediated ischemic tissue injury and evaluate the role of extracellular adenosine triphosphate in ischemic injury in specific organs, in order to provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex process. We also appraise potential future therapeutic strategies to limit damage in various organs, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and lungs.

### Intensive blood pressure lowering for ischemic stroke patients: does it prevent ischemia or bleeding? [^6dc38e25]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

As the adverse events of intensive BP lowering, the authors of the RESPECT sub-analysis indicated caution regarding falls and renal dysfunction. Acute kidney injury is a known complication of intensive BP lowering during acute stroke, but similar ischemic damage to the kidneys would also be a concern in chronic stroke patients. Table 1 shows factors favoring strict and those favoring gentle antihypertensive therapy for ischemic stroke survivors based on the findings of PROGRESS and other studies. Relatively low mortality in the intensive treatment group, although statistically insignificant, was another interesting finding.

Table 1
Factors favoring strict and those favoring gentle antihypertensive therapy for ischemic stroke survivors

The current guidelines recommend systolic BP control aiming at < 130 mmHg or 120–130 mmHg for adults who experience ischemic stroke. RESPECT is epochal as the first large population trial to examine the importance of systolic BP lowering to < 120 mmHg. Such strict control would undoubtedly decrease incidental ICH, especially for patients taking antithrombotic agents. However, the necessity of strict BP control for protection of brain tissues from ischemic injury is still an unresolved matter that needs to be addressed in future studies.

### Long-term prognosis of acute kidney injury after first acute stroke [^d7c37911]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with increased mortality in a variety of clinical settings. We studied the incidence, predictors, and effect of AKI on long-term overall mortality and cardiovascular events after stroke.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

This was a prospective outcome study of 2155 patients who sustained an acute first-ever stroke and were followed for 10 yr. Patients were divided in two groups: (1) Those with an acute increase (over 48 h) in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dl or a percentage increase of ≥ 50% and (2) those with a change < 0.3 mg/dl, no change at all, or even a reduction.

Results

Twenty-seven percent of patients developed AKI after acute stroke. Stroke severity, baseline estimated GFR, heart failure, and stroke subtype predict the occurrence of AKI. The probability of 10-yr mortality for patients with AKI was 75.9 and 57.7 in the patients without AKI (log rank test 45.0; P = 0.001). When patients with AKI were subdivided into three groups according to AKI severity, the probability of 10-yr mortality increased: 73.7, 86.5, and 89.2 in stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In Cox proportional hazard analysis, AKI was an independent predictor of 10-yr mortality (P < 0.01) and for the occurrence of new composite cardiovascular events (P < 0.05) after adjustment for available confounding variables.

Conclusions

AKI after stroke is a powerful and independent predictor of 10-yr mortality and new composite cardiovascular events.

### The impact of acute kidney injury on the long-term risk of stroke [^122f9a8e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Disruption of the blood–brain barrier not only results in cerebral edema but also allows metabolites and toxins that are normally impermeable to the blood–brain barrier to cause changes to the central nervous system. Supporting this, numerous other reports have been published of encephalopathic events associated with AKI that are relevant to the known pathomechanisms of cerebral ischemia. –

DM and AKI Related to Stroke

The associated higher risk of stroke can only partly be explained by traditional risk factors such as DM, hypertension or dyslipidemia, and the kidney‐specific risks underlying AKI involved in the pathogenesis (Figure 3). This novel finding adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that patients with AKI are at increased risk of stroke.

The kidney and brain share unique susceptibilities to vascular injury; therefore, some vascular risk factors may cause similar vascular injuries in both organs. – No data on stroke have been reported with regard to the occurrence of AKI imposed on the course of DM, a factor known to have an impact on subsequent stroke. After a long‐term follow‐up period, we found that temporary dialysis had a similar effect to DM in causing de novo stroke independent of preexisting comorbidities.

The current study showed that the risk of developing stroke in the patients who had recovered from AKI was not statistically significantly associated with DM. In addition, the patients with AKI had a substantially higher mortality rate after stroke than the non‐AKI group, emphasizing the potential value of preventing stroke events in AKI patients. Recommendations regarding DM in the risk categorization for stroke could also be applied to patients who recover from AKI after dialysis. The US National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III reported that 30% of cardiovascular disease events are accompanied by stroke and included DM as a risk equivalent to cardiovascular disease. – Our results support the risk of stroke in patients with AKI, and the impact was similar to DM. Importantly, the patients with AKI had a higher mortality rate after a stroke event than those without AKI, further emphasizing the potential value of preventing stroke by targeting these conditions. In light of these findings, a comprehensive treatment strategy during admission or even after discharge for AKI patients is required to reduce the risk of ensuing stroke events and subsequent mortality. Taken together, AKI patients who undergo temporary dialysis are at a higher risk of subsequent stroke events compared with patients without AKI, supporting AKI as a cause of mortality.

### Epidemiology, thrombolytic management, and outcomes of acute stroke among patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^02dac24e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The relative frequency of ischaemic versus haemorrhagic stroke among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been clearly described. Moreover, no recent meta-analysis has investigated the outcomes of patients with CKD treated with thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of stroke subtypes and the outcomes of thrombolysis in CKD.

Methods

A PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane literature research was conducted. The primary outcome was the proportion and incidence of ischaemic versus haemorrhagic strokes among patients with CKD. In addition, we assessed the impact of CKD on disability, mortality and bleeding among patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with thrombolysis. The pooled proportion and the risk ratio were estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Thirty-nine observational studies were included: 22 on the epidemiology of stroke types and 17 on the outcomes of thrombolysis in this population. In the main analysis (> 99 281 patients), ischaemic stroke was more frequent than haemorrhagic among patients with CKD [78.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 73.3–82.5%]. However, among patients with kidney failure, the proportion of ischaemic stroke decreased and was closer to that of haemorrhagic stroke (59.8%, 95% CI 49.4–69.4%). CKD was associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke compared with patients with preserved kidney function.

Conclusions

The relative frequency of haemorrhagic stroke seems to increase as kidney function declines. Among patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with thrombolysis, presence of CKD is associated with higher disability, mortality and bleeding, compared with patients with preserved kidney function.

### Association between triglyceride-glucose index and clinical outcomes among patients with chronic kidney disease: a meta-analysis [^dbec24f5]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common pathological condition characterized by the gradual damage and progressive loss of kidney function. The pathogenesis of CKD is insidious, yet its mortality rate is high. Among the causes of death in CKD patients, about 50% are due to cardiovascular diseases, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ischemic stroke (IS). On the other hand, diabetes and hypertension are widely recognized as the most common causes of CKD. The coexistence of CKD and diabetes is very common, with about 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 50% of those with type 2 diabetes developing CKD. Notably, the prevalence of diabetes-related CKD has exceeded that of glomerulonephritis-related CKD to become the leading cause of CKD in China, which is also observed in some other Asian countries. In terms of pathophysiological mechanisms, nephrons are more susceptible to damage under hyperglycemic conditions. In this context, insulin resistance (IR) is a pathological condition in which target tissues fail to respond normally to insulin stimulation. IR occurs even when kidney function is still within the normal range, indirectly reflecting the severity of CKD. Current evidence suggests that IR is closely associated with the prognosis of CKD patients and may influence clinical outcomes through various mechanisms, including triggering inflammatory responses, increasing oxidative stress, and promoting vascular damage.

Recently, the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, as a surrogate marker for insulin resistance (IR), has been shown to have significant prognostic value in various vascular diseases including the ischemic stroke, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Previous meta-analyses have indicated that the TyG index is associated with a significantly increased risk of developing CKD [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.19]. However, the relationship between the TyG index and clinical outcomes in CKD patients remains unclear.

Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to identify the association of TyG index with clinical outcomes including the mortality risk and CKD progression among CKD patients based on current research progress.

### Kidney-brain crosstalk in the acute and chronic setting [^5719ec63]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Patients with kidney disease often exhibit multiple organ dysfunction that is caused, in part, by marked connectivity between the kidney and other organs and tissues. Substantial crosstalk occurs between the kidney and the brain, as indicated by the frequent presentation of neurological disorders, such as cerebrovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and neuropathy during the natural history of chronic kidney disease. The underlying pathophysiology of such comorbid neurological disorders in kidney disease is governed by shared anatomic and vasoregulatory systems and humoral and non-humoral bidirectional pathways that affect both the kidney and the brain. During acute kidney injury, the brain and kidney might interact through the amplification of cytokine-induced damage, extravasation of leukocytes, oxidative stress, and dysregulation of sodium, potassium, and water channels. The advent of dialysis and renal transplantation programmes has led to a reduction in the rate of neurological complications associated with uraemia, but a new set of complications have arisen as a consequence of the effects of dialysis on the central nervous system over the short and long term. This Review discusses the clinical complications of acute and chronic renal failure from a neurologic perspective, and highlights current understanding of the underlying pathophysiologies.

### White matter damage in maintenance hemodialysis patients: a diffusion tensor imaging study [^fbb734cf]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Anatomic brain abnormalities, including stroke and brain atrophy, are common in patients with kidney failure. Patients receiving maintenance dialysis are also known to have a high burden of white matter disease, a finding closely correlated with incident clinical stroke. White matter disease is associated with adverse outcomes in the general population and in CKD, including higher risk for overt strokes and cognitive impairment.

Through measurement of water diffusivity in the brain, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows for the characterization of alterations to white matter tracts in addition to localization of white matter damage to specific brain regions. In those without kidney disease, DTI shows promise in detailing white matter disease related to stroke, aging, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Although multiple prior studies have assessed the general burden of white matter disease in kidney disease patients using conventional MRI, very few have utilized DTI. Of those investigating DTI in dialysis patients, firm conclusions have been limited by homogeneous populations, the use of low resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the lack of use of tract-based spatial statistics to improve the sensitivity and objectivity of DTI.

Dialysis patients are at particularly high risk for stroke and cognitive impairment, and white matter disease may be a precursor to each of these adverse outcomes; accordingly, the presence and location of DTI abnormalities in patients receiving dialysis may be of particular interest. We therefore obtained high resolution MR brain imaging in stable maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and in participants already scheduled for a brain MRI who had no reported history of kidney disease, utilizing DTI and tract-based spatial statistics to detect and localize damage to white matter bundle pathways.

### The impact of acute kidney injury on the long-term risk of stroke [^8db7d232]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of long‐term kidney–brain interactions was less clear. Our findings raise the possibility that AKI may trigger a cascade of perturbations that never completely resolve. The pathogenic mechanisms involved in this association may be related to nontraditional risk factors such as endothelial dysfunction, impaired endothelial progenitor cells, oxidative stress, inflammation, hyperhomocysteinemia, and thrombogenic factors during AKI. – Each of these factors may play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis in the arteries of both the kidney and the brain, making AKI a nonmodifiable entity. The sudden decrease in systemic blood pressure during dialysis can cause a reduction in cerebral perfusion, leading to endothelial injury and subsequent stroke events. In addition, the dialysis hemofiltrate from patients with AKI has been shown to inhibit polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, oxidative metabolism, and apoptosis in vitro, which could favorably influence the development of stroke. This indicates that AKI, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, is a "kidney specific" risk factor that has a causal relationship with future stroke. Increased serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines are putative mediators of remote organ effects during AKI and are believed to increase, in part, from subsequent impaired filtration and clearance of uremic toxins. An animal study demonstrated increased vascular permeability and an altered blood–brain barrier with inflammation including elevated levels of cytokines and granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor in mice undergoing renal ischemia. Furthermore, brain histology revealed increased microglial cells (brain macrophages) and pyknotic neuronal cells after AKI.

Our results examining how much adjustment for interim CKD and ESRD attenuated the strength of the AKI–brain event association and how much adjustment for interim stroke attenuated the strength of the AKI–mortality association are important. Because AKI is gradually being recognized as a contributing factor to late‐stage CKD, it is possible that early kidney changes associated with endothelial phenotypic transition may have already taken place during acute events, leading to progressive deterioration. Recently, fibroblast growth factor‐23, a novel regulator of mineral metabolism, has been reported to be markedly elevated in AKIand to be an index of subclinical cardiovascular pathology in the community associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. – Likewise, the expression of neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin, a marker of renal tubular injury, has also been associated with increased cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Impact of prior stroke on major clinical outcome in chronic kidney disease: the salford kidney cohort study [^3299ee46]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In this large prospective cohort of CKD patients, a diagnosis of stroke was independently associated with several major clinical outcomes including death, reaching ESRD and suffering another non-fatal cardiovascular event. These associations highlight the importance of the brain-kidney interactions in determining patient outcomes at critical timepoints along the CKD pathway.

### Does chronic kidney disease predict stroke risk independent of blood pressure? a systematic review and meta-regression [^3712d1dd]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article (and in the).

Data Sources and Searches

Using the same protocol, we updated an earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that had estimated the association between GFR and the risk of stroke. Our study protocol was registered prospectively on PROSPERO (CRD42019126862) and conformed with PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). We searched MEDLINE (2013–February 2018) and EMBASE (2013–February 2018) databases using a search strategy developed by a specialized librarian that combined text word and medical subject headings without language restrictions (Materials and Appendix Table I in the).

Study Selection

We included all RCTs and cohort studies that measured GFR at baseline and reported quantitative estimates with a measure of precision (or original data which allowed their calculation) of the risk of incident or recurrent stroke in relation to GFR. GFR had to be either estimated using a validated formula (Cockcroft-Gault, modification of diet in renal disease [MDRD], CKD epidemiology collaboration [CKD-EPI]), measured directly, approximated from urinary creatinine clearance or estimable from serum creatinine. The outcome of interest was symptomatic stroke confirmed by physician examination, hospital record review, or identified from data-linkage of administrative records. Eligible articles were evaluated for overlap based on geographic setting, study period, sample size, and outcome. We excluded cross-sectional and case–control studies due to the greater risk of bias than in prospective cohort studies, studies where GFR was measured using nonvalidated methods, studies that had mostly participants with end-stage renal disease (by history of dialysis or an eGFR < 15 mL/min per 1.73 m²), studies where outcomes were measured by self-reports or proxy reports and studies that reported radiological but clinically silent stroke disease. Studies that used slightly varying eGFR intervals were included if they were otherwise comparable.

### Albuminuria: an underappreciated risk factor for cardiovascular disease [^45403044]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria, an established biomarker of the progression of chronic kidney disease, is also recognized as a biomarker for the risk of cardiovascular disease. Elevated urinary albumin excretion indicates kidney damage and systemic vascular disease, including myocardial capillary disease and arterial stiffness. Albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias, and microvascular disease. There are now several therapeutic agents that can lead to albuminuria lowering and a reduction in cardiovascular risk. However, screening for albuminuria is still low. Considering the importance of multidisciplinary management of patients with cardiovascular disease, it is crucial that health care professionals managing such patients are aware of the benefits of albuminuria surveillance and management.

### Impact of microalbuminuria on incident stroke: a meta-analysis [^2eda631e]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Microalbuminuria, a marker of both kidney disease and endothelial dysfunction, may be associated with global vascular risk, but the nature and magnitude of the link between microalbuminuria and incident stroke has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study was to assess the consistency and strength of the association of microalbuminuria with risk of stroke in prospective studies using meta-analysis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases and bibliographies for studies reporting a multivariate-adjusted estimate, represented as relative risk with 95% CI, of the association between microalbuminuria and stroke risk. Studies were excluded if a majority of study participants had established kidney disease or pre-eclampsia. Estimates were combined using a random-effect model.

Results

We identified 12 studies, with a total of 48 596 participants and 1263 stroke events. Overall, presence of microalbuminuria was associated with greater stroke risk (relative risk, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.61 to 2.28; P < 0.001) after adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors. There was evidence of significant heterogeneity in the magnitude of the association across studies (P for heterogeneity < 0.001, I² = 68%), which was partially explained by differences in study population, microalbuminuria definition, and different microalbuminuria-related risk among stroke subtypes. However, in stratified analyses, microalbuminuria was associated with increased risk of subsequent stroke in all subgroups (general population, diabetics, those with known stroke).

Conclusions

Microalbuminuria is strongly and independently associated with incident stroke risk. Future studies should explore whether microalbuminuria is just a risk marker or a modifiable risk factor for stroke.

### Relationship between renal artery stenosis and intrarenal damage in autopsy subjects with stroke [^61bc9caa]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), renal dysfunction is a risk factor for the prognosis, but substantial evidence is still lacking about the relationship between clinical characteristics and renal histology. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between the extent of renal parenchymal damage, renal artery stenosis (RAS) and clinical characteristics in autopsy subjects with stroke.

Methods

During the 17-year period 1980–1997, 2167 subjects were autopsied at the National Cardiovascular Center. We studied retrospectively all the autopsy cases aged 40 years and older who had a history of stroke. Thus, 346 subjects remained and they were classified into two groups. Thirty-six subjects had RAS (group A). Three hundred and ten subjects had no RAS, and we randomly chose 102 subjects among them (group B). We evaluated renal parenchymal damage using a semi-quantitative chronic damage score.

Results

The average overall chronic damage score was significantly higher in the stenosed kidneys of group A than in the non-stenosed kidneys of group B (9.0 ± 2.6 vs 7.0 ± 2.7). The contralateral kidneys of group A had a tendency to have milder renal damage than stenosed kidneys. Furthermore, the total score was higher in the subjects with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, proteinuria, renal insufficiency and CVD than in the subjects without such complications. The total score had a significant association with RAS, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, CVD and weight of the kidney.

Conclusions

In autopsy subjects with stroke, we demonstrated that co-existing renal parenchymal damage was more severe in the subjects with RAS, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, proteinuria and renal insufficiency than those without such complications. The presence of RAS, impaired renal function and proteinuria was closely correlated with the severity of renal parenchymal damage.

### Telmisartan [^0873552b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure makes the heart work harder to pump blood throughout the body and causes damage to the blood vessels. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can lead to stroke, heart attack, heart failure, kidney failure, and vision problems.

What is Cardiovascular Risk?

Patients older than 55 years of age who have been diagnosed with blood vessel disease in the heart, legs, or brain (coronary, peripheral, or cerebral vascular disease) or diabetes with end organ damage (for example: kidney, heart, and brain) are at higher risk of cardiovascular events (for example: death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, and/or heart attack).

### Proteinuria and stroke: a meta-analysis of cohort studies [^b1168fa3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The associations between decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease recently have been established. However, there is uncertainty about the consistency between the independent associations of proteinuria as a risk factor across all cardiovascular end points. We undertook a meta-analysis of published cohort studies to provide a reliable estimate of the strength of association between proteinuria and risk of stroke.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of observational cohort studies.

Setting & Population

General population of participants with diabetes. Studies were excluded if participants had known glomerular disease or had undergone dialysis or transplantation.

Selection Criteria For Studies

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies that reported age- or multivariate-adjusted risk ratio with some estimate of the variance of the association between proteinuria and risk of stroke, without language restriction.

Factor

Proteinuria or albuminuria.

Outcomes

Fatal or nonfatal stroke.

Results

Data from 10 published studies involving 140,231 participants and 3,266 strokes were eligible for inclusion. Participants with proteinuria had a 71% greater risk of stroke compared with those without proteinuria (95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 2.10). There was evidence of significant quantitative heterogeneity in the magnitude of the association across studies (I(2) = 60%; P for heterogeneity = 0.008), which was partially explained by differences in methods for measuring proteinuria. The risk of stroke remained significant after adjustment for other vascular risk factors.

Limitations

Because individual patient data were unavailable, we were unable to fully examine the impact of adjustment for known cardiovascular risk factors on the strength of the association between proteinuria and stroke risk. It is possible that the pooled estimate was affected by regression dilution bias.

Conclusions

These findings support the independent relationship between proteinuria and stroke. Additional studies are warranted to determine whether interventions to reduce proteinuria are effective at reducing rates of stroke.

### Prevalence of kidney damage in Chinese elderly: a large-scale population-based study [^e3569e23]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In China, both population aging and kidney damage has become emerging public health challenges. Despite the number of elders is huge, data on kidney damage in this population are scarce. The present study aimed to describe the prevalence of kidney damage among older adults in Wuhan, China.

Methods

To describe the prevalence of kidney damage among Chinese elderly, the health screening data of 350,881 adults older than 65 years in Wuhan, China were collected and analyzed. Kidney damage was defined as eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m² or the presence of proteinuria. Decreased renal function was defined as an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Proteinuria was defined as urine protein ≥ 1+ and without urine WBC or nitrite positive. The associated risk factors of eGFR decline and kidney damage were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.

Results

The age-standardized prevalence of kidney damage, decreased renal function and proteinuria was 17.2, 13.5 and 5.3%. Among the patients, up to 74.4% was stage 3. The prevalence of kidney damage and eGFR decline were higher in suburbs than in urban (18.3% vs 16.0 and 14.6% vs 12.4%). Factors independently associated with kidney damage were age, female, BMI, abdominal circumference, hypertension, diabetes, stroke and coronary heart disease.

Conclusions

Kidney damage has become an important public health problem in Chinese elderly. More attention should be paid to elderly lived in suburbs or rural area in our further work.

### The role of hyperuricemia in vascular disorders [^a4e2b1b3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of uric acid as a mediator of vascular damage is not a new idea but has only recently gained widespread acceptance. Uric acid has previously been viewed as a benign solute in serum until it exceeds its saturation level. Others have viewed it as an important antioxidant. These opinions have given way to strong epidemiologic evidence that uric acid elevation may damage endothelial cells and cause significant medical problems.

Recent Findings

The comorbidities associated with gout include hypertension, renal failure, obesity and diabetes. Multiple large epidemiologic studies cited in this review show that uric acid itself may play an important role in initiating the vascular endothelial dysfunction associated with this cluster of medical problems and ultimately lead to stroke, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. These studies are supported by experiments in animals demonstrating how uric acid can gain entrance into cells and function as a 'pro-oxidant'.

Summary

Uric acid has been long recognized as the cause of gouty arthritis and kidney stones. There is mounting evidence that it may also have an important role in the development of vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease, stroke and kidney disease. These findings have important implications for the way we view asymptomatic hyperuricemia and for future therapeutic interventions.

### Frequency, associated variables, and outcomes of acute myocardial injury according to the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction in patients with acute ischemic stroke [^86c3e068]. European Stroke Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

We observed an independent association for higher age, impaired kidney function, baseline NIHSS, and i.v. thrombolysis with the occurrence of post-stroke acute myocardial injury. It is well-established that older age is a non-modifiable risk factor of troponin elevation and cardiac complications after stroke. In addition, the association of acute myocardial injury with impaired kidney function is well in line with previous studies in stroke and other cardiac patient populations. Interestingly, there is evidence that elevated hs-cTnT values in patients with impaired kidney function are not primarily caused by reduced renal clearance but rather due to other uremia-associated factors damaging the myocardium. Importantly, impaired kidney function alone does not explain the presence of a rise or fall pattern of troponin but may represent a risk factor leading to a higher susceptibility for developing acute myocardial injury during physically stressful events such as AIS. The finding that higher stroke severity is associated with acute myocardial injury is well in line with previous studies and highlights the notion that stroke-related factors such as lesion size contribute to the occurrence of cardiac injury. Given the median NIHSS of three in this cohort, rates of acute myocardial injury might be even higher in more severely affected AIS populations (e.g. in intensive care units). Higher stroke severity and stroke lesions involving the central autonomic network may promote the occurrence of a broad spectrum of cardiac complications far beyond myocardial injury and has been summarized under the term Stroke-Heart Syndrome. Interestingly, treatment with thrombolysis was also associated with acute myocardial injury. It has been shown in myocardial infarction that later sampling after symptom onset reduces the probability of detecting changes in hs-cTn levels due to a plateau phase. Given that stroke-induced myocardial injury is believed to be mediated by time-dependent sympathetic overdrive, one may assume that this facilitates the detection of minor acute myocardial injury patterns that are observable in early presenters that are candidates for thrombolysis.

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^79ace4fd]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have shown that reported rates of AKI after stroke vary widely with a range of 0.82% to 26.68%. Increased severity of stroke is related to the risk of AKI. Furthermore, having an episode of AKI after a stroke is associated with worse disability, increased inpatient mortality, LOS and cost, increased risk of future cardiovascular events and longer-term mortality.

There are marked differences in the reported incidence rates depending on the methodology used to identify patients with AKI. Using coding definitions, the pooled incidence of AKI was 4.63%, compared with 19.51% for definitions based on serum creatinine values. ICD coding is known to underestimate the incidence of AKI. Validation of ICD-9 codes for acute renal failure (ARF, which predates present use of the term AKI), used in Saeed et al. 2014 and 2015 are reported to have a sensitivity of 35.4% and a specificity of 97.7%. Thus the low sensitivity for ARF codes may fail to identify patients with mild AKI that is more likely to go unrecognized and uncoded. We know that severe AKI influences a number of outcomes, at high cost to individual patients, the health service and society. Given that milder categories of AKI are much more common they may be even more important to detect and prevent. Furthermore, apart from Nadkarni et al. only one other study reported data on the incidence of AKI-D and outcomes. Since more severe AKI is related to worse outcomes, this is a significant limitation of our meta-analysis. Only three studies reported on the risk factors associated with AKI after stroke and generally confined themselves to reporting on those already known to be associated with AKI. Only two studies reported that stroke severity at presentation was associated with an increased risk of AKI. Two studies reported that hemorrhagic stroke type was associated with the development of AKI. Interestingly, only one study investigated the relationship between radiological contrast exposure and risk of AKI. None of the studies presented data on the association between thrombolysis, angiographic procedures or vascular intervention in ischemic stroke and AKI. In light of rapid advances in diagnostic scans and interventional treatments for stroke in recent years, including the use of intra-arterial thrombectomy, the incidence of AKI in stroke patients may well increase as these interventions become more widespread.

### Diabetic kidney disease and risk of incident stroke among adults with type 2 diabetes [^620a9685]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, in a large and diverse cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes, higher UACR, decreased eGFR, and worsening CKD stages were associated with increased risk of stroke, independently of other stroke risk factors. These data support the notion that the prevention of CKD and its progression may help mitigate the risk of stroke in people with type 2 diabetes. Our findings have several research and public health implications for people with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes mellitus represents the primary cause of CKD in the US. Our findings underscore the notion that strategies designed to prevent the onset and progression of CKD in type 2 diabetes may help mitigate the burden of stroke and its associated disability in this population. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms linking measures of kidney disease to stroke and develop strategies targeting both CKD and stroke prevention.

### Harm! foul! how acute kidney injury SHReDDs patient futures [^366c251e]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Transition from acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly accepted. Less well recognized, but supported by very similar data, is development of disease of other organ systems after AKI. Awareness of other-organ sequelae of AKI may inform efforts to improve the care of patients after AKI.

Recent Findings

Stroke, hypertension, reproductive risk, dementia, and death (SHReDD) are sequelae, which occur with increased risk relative to that of non-AKI within 6 months-3years after AKI diagnosis, and which are supported by preclinical/mechanistic study. Adjusted hazard ratios for these sequelae are strikingly similar to that of AKI-CKD, ranging from 1.2 to 3.0. Mechanistic studies suggest kidney-centric mechanisms including sodium regulation, volume status regulation, and the renin-angiotensin system are drivers of long-term, extra-renal, change.

Summary

Further clinical characterization and mechanistic insight is necessary, and may have considerable translational impact. Programs which screen or follow post-AKI patients may increase clinical utility if focus is expanded to include the SHReDD complications.

### The new biology of diabetic kidney disease-mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^558d1e38]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease remains the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the world. Despite reductions in incidence rates of myocardial infarction and stroke in people with diabetes over the past 3 decades, the risk of diabetic kidney disease has remained unchanged, and may even be increasing in younger individuals afflicted with this disease. Accordingly, changes in public health policy have to be implemented to address the root causes of diabetic kidney disease, including the rise of obesity and diabetes, in addition to the use of safe and effective pharmacological agents to prevent cardiorenal complications in people with diabetes. The aim of this article is to review the mechanisms of pathogenesis and therapies that are either in clinical practice or that are emerging in clinical development programs for potential use to treat diabetic kidney disease.

### Acute kidney injury after endovascular therapy in acute stroke patients: systematic review with meta-analysis [^e6747193]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Endovascular therapy (EVT) is a highly effective stroke treatment, but it requires the administration of contrast media which puts patients at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular patients.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, ISI and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for observational and experimental studies assessing the occurrence of AKI in adult acute stroke patients submitted to EVT. Two independent reviewers collected study data regarding study setting, period, source of data, and AKI definition and predictors, the outcomes of interest being AKI incidence and 90-day death or dependency (modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3). These outcomes were pooled using random effect models, and heterogeneity was measured using the I 2 statistic.

Results

22 studies were identified and included in the analysis, involving 32 034 patients. Pooled incidence of AKI was 7% (95% CI 5% to 10%), but heterogeneity was high across studies (I² = 98%), and not accounted for by the definition of AKI used. The most frequently reported AKI predictors were impaired baseline renal function (5 studies) and diabetes (3 studies); 3 studies (2103 patients) reported data on death and 4 studies (2424 patients) reported data on dependency. Overall, AKI was associated with both outcomes, with ORs of 6.21 (95% CI 3.52 to 10.96) and 2.86 (95% CI 1.88 to 4.37), respectively. Heterogeneity was low for both analyses (I 2 = 0%).

Conclusions

AKI affects 7% of acute stroke patients submitted to EVT and identifies a subgroup of patients for which treatment outcomes are suboptimal, with an increased risk of death and dependency.

### Association of persistent, incident, and remittent proteinuria with stroke risk in patients with diabetes mellitus or prediabetes mellitus [^c2acad9b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Notably, although proteinuria reduction was associated with a decrease in stroke risk, individuals with remittent ≥ 1+ proteinuria were still at higher risk for future stroke compared with those without proteinuria in our cohort. Stroke risk was also increased for patients with incident and persistent trace+ proteinuria. However, participants with remittent trace+ proteinuria did not have a significantly higher future stroke risk than those without proteinuria. One possibility is that nonpathological causes can result in transient reversible trace+ proteinuria of no consequence. In contrast, remittent ≥ 1+ levels of proteinuria are more likely to signify renal structural damage, which also reflects the susceptibility of cerebral arteries. 22 Previous studies have shown that stroke risk rises with degree of proteinuria, suggesting a possible dose‐response association. 4, 23 A retrospective analysis of 2 trials found that an increase in proteinuria by ≥ 100% is associated with a 30% increase in cardiovascular events and 54% increase in cardiovascular death. Additionally, shifts toward greater deteriorations in proteinuria were associated with increased cardiovascular events. 24 Another study reported a stepwise increased cardiovascular risk for transient proteinuria and persistent proteinuria as measured by means of urine dipsticks. 25 Our findings are consistent with these results, as stroke incidence was increased in participants with incident or remittent ≥ 1+ proteinuria compared with those without proteinuria, and it was highest in the group with persistent proteinuria.

In addition, we examined the association between proteinuria change and stroke risk stratified for the presence of diabetes mellitus or prediabetes mellitus. Our findings extended these relationships to the prediabetic population, showing that participants with prediabetes mellitus with incident or persistent proteinuria also had higher stroke risks than those without proteinuria. Interestingly, the risk of stroke was more profound for participants with prediabetes mellitus with persistent proteinuria compared with the participants with diabetes mellitus. These findings have not been previously reported. A substantial burden of chronic kidney disease exists in those individuals with prediabetes mellitus. Campaigns to promote awareness of both kidney damage and stroke risk at this early disease stage may be beneficial. 26 For participants with prediabetes with proteinuria, especially those with persistent proteinuria, lifestyle modification and intervention should be considered to prevent progression as well as complications of diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and stroke.

### Crosstalk between the nervous system and the kidney [^1ca1f410]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Under physiological states, the nervous system and the kidneys communicate with each other to maintain normal body homeostasis. However, pathological states disrupt this interaction as seen in hypertension, and kidney damage can cause impaired renorenal reflex and sodium handling. In acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), damaged kidneys can have a detrimental effect on the central nervous system. CKD is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment, and many factors, including retention of uremic toxins and phosphate, have been proposed as CKD-specific factors responsible for structural and functional cerebral changes in patients with CKD. However, more studies are needed to determine the precise pathogenesis. Epidemiological studies have shown that AKI is associated with a subsequent risk for developing stroke and dementia. However, recent animal studies have shown that the renal nerve contributes to kidney inflammation and fibrosis, whereas activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which involves the vagus nerve, the splenic nerve, and immune cells in the spleen, has a significant renoprotective effect. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms of communication between the nervous system and the kidney enables us not only to develop new strategies to ameliorate neurological conditions associated with kidney disease but also to design safe and effective clinical interventions for kidney disease, using the neural and neuroimmune control of kidney injury and disease.

### Kidney dysfunction predicts 90 days mortality after stroke thrombectomy independent of cardiovascular risk factors and chronic kidney disease [^e7e6606f]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the association between KD assessed by pre-interventional GFR and pre-existing diagnosis of CKD with functional independence and 90 days mortality after thrombectomy for AIS in a large-center cohort. Our main finding showed that pre-treatment KD assessed by a reduced GFR predicted mortality at 90 days independent from other cardiovascular risk factors and beyond the effect of known pre-existing CKD.

The effect of kidney function on outcome after MT for AIS has gained interest in the research community within the past few years, yet data on this important topic remain scarce. A 2022 review found eleven studies with case numbers ranging from 110 to 628 (one study with 1169 cases evaluated acute kidney injury during the hospital stay), and we found one more study published since with 1304 patients receiving MT. Comparing baseline characteristics of our cohort to previous studies, the mean age in our study was in the upper range, stroke severity was in the lower range, and prevalence of KD defined as a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² (31.8% in our study) was in the upper range, ranging from 7 to 32% in other studies –).

The observed association of both KD and pre-diagnosed CKD at admission with a higher mortality at 90 days (see Table 2) is in line with previous work. KD and CKD increase the risk of stroke independent of other cardiovascular risk factorsand are associated with pre- and posttreatment complications that limit treatment results and recovery. Pre-treatment morbidity includes cerebrovascular changes, atherosclerosis and hypertension. – Post-treatment complications include a higher risk of hemorrhage and higher all-cause mortality. The kidney and the brain have been hypothesized to share a common pattern of microvascular impairment resulting from cardiovascular risk factors, due to their shared status as high-flow end organs with autoregulatory mechanisms. Diverse pathways, such as cerebral blood flow inhibition, accelerated atherosclerosis, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation and genetic factorshave been suggested to be involved in kidney-brain-interactions.

### Reactive oxygen species in hypertension [^a695d326]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is a leading risk factor for stroke, heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Multiple interacting factors and organ systems increase blood pressure and cause target-organ damage. Among the many molecular elements involved in the development of hypertension are reactive oxygen species (ROS), which influence cellular processes in systems that contribute to blood pressure elevation (such as the cardiovascular, renal, immune and central nervous systems, or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). Dysregulated ROS production (oxidative stress) is a hallmark of hypertension in humans and experimental models. Of the many ROS-generating enzymes, NADPH oxidases are the most important in the development of hypertension. At the cellular level, ROS influence signalling pathways that define cell fate and function. Oxidative stress promotes aberrant redox signalling and cell injury, causing endothelial dysfunction, vascular damage, cardiovascular remodelling, inflammation and renal injury, which are all important in both the causes and consequences of hypertension. ROS scavengers reduce blood pressure in almost all experimental models of hypertension; however, clinical trials of antioxidants have yielded mixed results. In this Review, we highlight the latest advances in the understanding of the role and the clinical implications of ROS in hypertension. We focus on cellular sources of ROS, molecular mechanisms of oxidative stress and alterations in redox signalling in organ systems, and their contributions to hypertension.

### Acute kidney injury in neurocritical care [^d090c169]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in intensive care units (ICUs) is an independent risk factor for death. Reported mortality rates from AKI with renal replacement therapy (RRT; 40–55%) are higher than the mortality rates due to ICU-related myocardial infarction (20%), sepsis without AKI (15–25%), or acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation (30–40%). This high mortality rate is attributed to the systemic impact of AKI on the brain, heart, lungs, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, linking AKI to various syndromes (Additional file 1). Beyond the acute phase, AKI increases the likelihood of chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular complications, recurrent AKI, and functional impairment.

In the context of neurocritical care, AKI diagnosis holds significance for acute brain injury (ABI) management. This article summarizes the epidemiology and outcomes of AKI in neurocritically ill adults admitted to the ICU, focusing on prevalent ABI conditions like traumatic brain injury (TBI), aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and acute stroke. The review explores potential AKI mechanisms and their involvement in reciprocal ABI progression, while also highlighting essential principles in AKI management. Additionally, considerations for managing RRT in the context of ABI are discussed. Our literature search strategy is provided in Additional file 2.

### Etiology and outcome of ischemic stroke in patients with renal impairment including chronic kidney disease: Japan stroke data bank [^9767be1c]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem that is recognized as an established risk factor for stroke. It remains unclear whether its distribution and clinical impact are consistent across ischemic stroke subtypes in patients with renal impairment. We examined whether renal impairment was associated with the proportion of each stroke subtype vs ischemic stroke overall and with functional outcomes after each stroke subtype.

Methods

Study participants were 10,392 adult patients with an acute stroke from the register of the Japan Stroke Data Bank, a hospital-based multicenter stroke registration database, between October 2016 and December 2019, whose baseline serum creatinine levels or a dipstick proteinuria result were available. All ischemic strokes were classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment criteria. Unfavorable functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 3–6 at discharge. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between the outcomes and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR strata (< 45, 45–59, ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), or dipstick proteinuria ≥ 1 adjusted for covariates.

Results

Overall, 2,419 (23%) patients had eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m² and 1,976 (19%) had eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², including 185 patients (1.8%) receiving hemodialysis. Both eGFR 45–59 and eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were associated with a higher proportion of cardioembolic stroke (odds ratio [OR], 1.21 [95% CI, 1.05–1.39] and 1.55 [1.34–1.79], respectively) and a lower proportion of small vessel occlusion (0.79 [0.69–0.90] and 0.68 [0.59–0.79], respectively). A similar association with the proportion of these 2 subtypes was proven in the analyses using decreased eGFR as continuous values. Both eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and proteinuria were associated with unfavorable functional outcomes in patients with cardioembolic stroke (OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.01–1.69] and 3.18 [2.03–4.98], respectively) and small vessel occlusion (OR, 1.44 [1.01–2.07] and 2.08 [1.08–3.98], respectively).

Discussion

Renal impairment contributes to the different distributions and clinical effects across specific stroke subtypes, particularly evident in cardioembolic stroke and small vessel occlusion. This possibly indicates shared mechanisms of susceptibility and potentially enhancing pathways.

### Incidence and impact on outcomes of acute kidney injury after a stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1571c051]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The pooled incidence of AKI in ischemic stroke was 9.62% (95% CI 4.20–16.96%; I² statistic 99.5%). Excluding Lin et al. AKI incidence increased to 12.45% (95% CI 4.96–22.70%) and heterogeneity remained high (I² 99.5%). Using studies with a coding definition for AKI, the pooled incidence was 4.05% (95% CI 1.06–8.86%; I² statistic 99.1%). Pooled incidence of AKI in studies utilizing creatinine-based definitions was 17.33% (95% CI 9.42–27.05%) with high heterogeneity (I² 97.6%).

The pooled incidence of AKI in hemorrhagic stroke was 19.17% (95% CI 7.75–34.15%). Heterogeneity was high (I² 99.0%). Excluding Saeed et al. 2015, the only study in this group to use a coding definition for AKI, the pooled incidence increased to 24.50% (95% CI 18.03–31.61%). Heterogeneity decreased but remained high (I² 84.9%).

### The kidney-immune-brain axis: the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis and treatment of stroke in chronic kidney disease [^b8b9acf2]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

However, while the cascade of inflammatory events in CKD involves common pathways such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation, oxidative stress, and immune activation, the specific triggers and extent of inflammation can vary significantly depending on the underlying cause of the disease. For example, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, and obstructive nephropathy each have unique mechanisms that contribute to inflammation.– In diabetic nephropathy, persistent hyperglycemia leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products, which induce oxidative stress and inflammation. In hypertensive nephropathy, hemodynamic stress causes direct damage to the glomeruli, leading to inflammatory responses. Immune complex deposition and complement system activation are the central mechanisms in glomerulonephritis. In polycystic kidney disease, mutations in polycystic kidney disease 1/2 lead to abnormal functioning of many key signaling pathways, which can result in abnormal proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation that accompany cystogenesis. In obstructive uropathy, recurrent infections and tubule-interstitial damage promote an inflammatory state in the kidney.

### Renal dysfunction in acute stroke: an independent predictor of long-term all combined vascular events and overall mortality [^ee1282c2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute stroke is the third leading cause of death in western societies after ischemic heart disease and cancer. Although it is an emergency disease sharing the same atherosclerotic risk factors with ischemic heart disease, the association of renal function and stroke is poorly investigated. The present study aims at assessing renal function status in patients with acute stroke and investigate any prognostic significance on the outcome.

Methods

This is a prospective study of hospitalized first-ever stroke patients over 10 years. The study population comprised 1350 patients admitted within 24 h from stroke onset and followed up for 1 to 120 months or until death. Patients were divided in 3 groups on the basis of the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) that was calculated from the abbreviated equation of the Modification Diet for Renal Disease in ml/min/1.73 m(2) of body surface area: Group-A comprised patients who had eGFR > 60, group-B those with 30 ≤ eGFR ≤ 60 and group-C patients with eGFR < 30. Patients with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) were excluded from the study. The main outcome measures were overall mortality and the composite new cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, recurrent stroke, vascular death) among the 3 groups during the follow-up period.

Results

Almost 1/3 (28.08%) of our acute stroke patients presented with moderate (group B) or severe (group C) renal dysfunction as estimated by eGFR. After adjusting for basic demographic, stroke risk factors and stroke severity on admission, eGFR was an independent predictor of stroke mortality at 10 years. Patients in groups B and C had an increased probability of death during follow-up: Hazard ratio = 1.21 with 95% CI 1.01–1.46, p < 0.05 and Hazard ratio = 1.76 with 95% CI 1.14–2.73, p < 0.05 respectively, compared to patients belonging to group A. The probability of death from any cause was significantly different among groups (log rank test 55.4, p = 0.001) during the follow-up period: in group-A patients it was 62.8 (95% CI 57.6–68.1), in group-B 77.3 (95% CI 68.5–86.1) and in group-C 89.2 (95% CI 75.1–100). During the follow-up period 336 new cardiovascular events occurred. The probability to have a new composite cardiovascular event was also significantly different among the 3 groups (log rank test 21.1, p = 0.001): in group-A patients it was 45.2 (95% CI 38.7–51.7), in group-B 67.4 (95% CI 56.2–78.6) and in group-C 77.6 (95% CI 53.5–100).

Conclusion

Renal function on admission appears to be a significant independent prognostic factor for long term mortality and new cardiovascular morbidity over a 10-year period.

### Low glomerular filtration rate and risk of stroke: meta-analysis [^367afe01]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

We also observed that the effect of reduced eGFR was more profound on the risk of fatal stroke than on all strokes, which probably points to the association of compromised kidney function with risk factors for generally poor clinical outcomes such as oxidative stress, widespread inflammation, electrolyte derangements, procoagulation, and presence of uraemic toxins. In fact, kidney disease even of mild severity has been shown to be an independent predictor of poorer clinical outcomes among people with stroke, including higher risk of all cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Also of note, the presence of albuminuria did not substantially further increase the risk of stroke among patients with a baseline eGFR of < 60 or > 60 ml/min/1.73 m². Our result should be interpreted with caution, however, as it was based on just three studies and the rate of albuminuria is low in people without diabetes. A recent meta-analysis showed that compared with people without albuminuria or a low eGFR, those with either condition had a higher risk of cardiovascular death and those with both conditions had the highest risk of cardiovascular death. Furthermore, meta-analyses have shown that albuminuria was independently associated with a higher risk of stroke even when the included studies had adjusted for eGFR or serum creatinine level.

### Common impact of chronic kidney disease and brain microhemorrhages on cerebral A β pathology in SHRSP [^b478f1fe]. Brain Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

While chronic kidney disease seems to be an independent risk factor for cognitive decline, its impact on cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) depositions, one hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology, has not been investigated. Utilizing 80 male nontransgenic spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats (SHRSP) at various ages (12 to 44 weeks), tubulointerstitial renal damage, prevalence of cerebral microhemorrhages and Aβ accumulations were quantified. Using age-adjusted general linear models we investigated the main and interaction effects of renal damage and cerebral microhemorrhages on cerebral Aβ load. In addition, using post mortem human brain tissue of 16 stroke patients we examined the co-localization of perivascular Aβ deposits and small vessel wall damage. Statistical models revealed an age-independent main effect of tubulointerstitial kidney damage on brain Aβ accumulations, which was reinforced by the consecutive presence of cerebral microhemorrhages. Moreover, cerebral microhemorrhages independently predicted brain Aβ burden in SHRSP. In up to 69% of all human cases perivascular Aβ deposits were detected in the direct vicinity of small vessel wall damage. Our results support the associations between vascular pathology and Aβ deposition, and demonstrate a relationship between chronic kidney disease and cerebral Aβ pathology. Hence, our data suggest that prevention of chronic renal damage may reduce cerebral Aβ pathology.

### The impact of acute kidney injury on the long-term risk of stroke [^cbba6198]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The current study found that AKI requiring dialysis, even if only temporary dialysis, was associated with an increased risk of de novo stroke, and the impact was similar to DM. Our results suggest that a public health initiative is needed to monitor and control subsequent stroke among patients with dialysis‐requiring AKI, even among those whose kidney function has recovered after discharge, because dialysis‐requiring AKI may hasten subsequent long‐term stroke events and mortality.

### The impact of acute kidney injury on the long-term risk of stroke [^fea6cde0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this population‐based cohort study, we found that dialysis‐requiring AKI, even if only temporary dialysis, was associated with an increased risk of developing stroke, and its impact was similar to DM. This suggests that all patients with AKI, regardless of the presence or extent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, should be closely monitored for subsequent stroke.

AKI is now a global health problem, and the findings of the current study are noteworthy from the perspective of a clinician caring for a patient with AKI requiring dialysis. In recent decades, increased understanding of AKI epidemiologyand improvements in posthospitalization resource utilization – have allowed clinicians to examine the impact of AKI on brain disease and identify a large vulnerable population at increased risk of stroke and all‐cause mortality.

AKI Related to De Novo Stroke and Mortality

Even after being adjusted for progression to subsequent CKD or ESRD, AKI still independently contributed to long‐term stroke events or all‐cause mortality. The patients who received temporary dialysis had higher severity of subsequent stroke in terms of ventilator use and critical care unit admission than the non‐AKI group. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the presence of underlying CKD modifies the outcomes of AKI but does not completely account for the impact of AKI. With detailed matching, we adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risks using uniform baseline comorbidities between the AKI‐recovery and non‐AKI groups. Consequently, the risk factors for kidney injury leading to an AKI event may persistand eventually lead to future stroke without a direct causal association with preexisting CKD. AKI may thus amplify the risk of long‐term incident stroke and mortality.

### Associations of blood biomarkers with glomerular filtration rate in patients with TIA and stroke: population-based study [^e68ca318]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Non-traditional risk factors such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress and thrombogenic factors are believed to contribute to the excess stroke risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) by triggering vascular injury and endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to determine how well a panel of biomarkers representative of these factors would correlate with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with recent transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke. We also investigated whether eGFR would confound previously reported associations between biomarkers and mortality.

Methods

We studied a panel of 16 blood biomarkers related to inflammation, thrombosis, atherogenesis and cardiac or neuronal cell damage in TIA or ischaemic stroke in a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study). Biomarker levels were log-transformed and correlated with eGFR, adjusted for age. Cox proportional hazard models were used for survival analysis.

Results

Among 1297 patients with TIA or stroke, 52.7% (n = 684) of patients had CKD (eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m²). There was a moderate correlation between log-eGFR and the log-transformed soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 (R² = 0.21), attenuating with adjustment for age (R² = 0.12). There were moderate-to-strong correlations with markers of cardiac injury, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (hFABP, R² = 0.14and 0.34, respectively). The strongest correlation after adjustment for age was between hFABP and eGFR (R² = 0.20). Adjusting for eGFR did not impact any biomarker associations with mortality.

Conclusions

Correlations between biomarkers related to inflammation and thrombosis with renal dysfunction in the setting of cerebrovascular events were generally modest after adjustment for age, suggesting that putative risk factors such as chronic inflammation or coagulopathy are unlikely to be important stroke mechanisms in patients with CKD.

### Etiology and outcome of ischemic stroke in patients with renal impairment including chronic kidney disease: Japan stroke data bank [^e0001a2e]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

There was no significant association between renal impairment and the proportion of large artery stroke in this cohort. Although CKD might be associated with cerebral large artery disease via arterial medial calcification and stiffening of large arteries, it might be more strongly associated with the above-stated increased risks of atrial fibrillation and other etiologies of cardioembolic stroke. Note that the nature of this study was the proportion, not the incidence, of each ischemic stroke subtype in patients with renal impairment. Prior studies also reported lack of association of renal impairment with proportions of large vessel stroke in overall cohorts.

The lack of association between renal function and other determined etiology stroke could be due to the underlying heterogeneity of stroke cause. The recent pooled analysis also denied meaningful associations of renal impairment with recurrence and mortality after embolic stroke of undetermined source.

A strength of this study was the much larger number of patients compared to previous studies with the same theme. The large availability of neuroimaging and diagnosis to classify all cases of stroke by specialists also strengthened the study.

There are also inherent limitations. First, eGFR and proteinuria were based on single assessments at baseline, and they were affected by acute stroke. Accurate diagnosis for CKD was difficult because multiple data before stroke onset or at the chronic stage of stroke were not available. The lack of preadmission or repeated measurements of renal function could limit accurately identifying the clinical effect of renal impairment on stroke outcome. The renovascular dynamic data could provide crucial insights into the role of renal function for poststroke outcomes. Second, direct measurement of GFR, cystatin C–based method for calculating eGFR, or markers other than eGFR and proteinuria was not available in all cohorts. Third, we used only qualitative measurements using a dipstick test. However, a positive dipstick test is useful for risk stratification, despite being a less precise measure of albuminuria. Fourth, the mRS scores were only assessed at hospital discharge for all patients. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that recovery continued to occur beyond hospital discharge. Finally, our data were restricted to Japanese individuals. This could limit the generalizability of our findings to other ethnicities.

Our study demonstrates the differential proportions and substantial clinical effects of low eGFR or proteinuria on ischemic stroke subtypes. Decreased eGFR and proteinuria conferred a higher proportion of cardioembolic stroke using real-world data. Severe renal impairment and proteinuria are independent risk factors for certain ischemic stroke subtypes and for an associated worse prognosis within these subtypes. The mechanisms underlying these associations should be explored in further studies.

### Patterns of care quality and prognosis among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients with chronic kidney disease [^f5f9d34a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Underutilization of evidence‐based treatments has similarly been seen in other patient subgroups with chronic conditions that place them at high vascular risk such as diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease. – While the specific reasons for why there is an underuse of evidence‐based therapies among hospitalized ischemic patients with CKD are not exactly known, it stands to reason that potential contributors to this evidence‐practice treatment gap may include the facts that the randomized trial evidence upon which several expert‐consensus recommendations for stroke treatment are based typically excluded patients with major renal dysfunction, – patients with CKD are generally more likely to experience adverse effects of many medications, given the effect of renal azotemia on platelet function patients with kidney disease are at an increased risk for bleeding, and questionable therapeutic efficacy. – All of the aforementioned factors may be leading clinicians caring for hospitalized ischemic stroke patients to be more cautious about prescribing these therapies, despite the greater risk for cardiovascular events and poor clinical outcomes in these patients. – However, emerging evidence suggests that the benefits of many secondary prevention drugs used in the treatment of known vascular disease may be of equal or greater benefit to those with renal dysfunction when compared with those without, and a published analysis of the GWTG‐Stroke dataset that looked at predictors of tPA‐related sICH did not find any association between serum creatinine levels and risk for tPA‐related sICH.

### The impact of acute kidney injury on short-term survival in an Eastern European population with stroke [^a45aa88c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and of serious disability with significant impact on patients' long-term survival. The short-term evolution following stroke can associate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a possible complication, frequently overlooked and underestimated in clinical trials. We aimed to describe in an East European cohort (i) the incidence of AKI and its risk factors; (ii) the 30-day mortality and its risk factors and (iii) the relationship between mortality, pre-existent renal function and subsequent AKI.

Methods

A total of 1090 consecutive cases hospitalized-during a 12-month period-with a CT-confirmed diagnosis of stroke, from a distinct administrative region were included. Demographic details, comorbidities, laboratory and outcome data were retrieved from the electronic hospital database. All patients included in the study were followed for 30 days or until death.

Results

The mean age of this population was 66.1 ± 11.5 years, 49.3% were males, mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 68.9 ± 22.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The 30-day mortality rate was 17.2%. One hundred and fifty-eight patients presented with haemorrhagic stroke and 932 patients had ischaemic stroke. Stroke mortality was-14% for ischaemic stroke and almost twice as high for haemorrhagic stroke-36.3%. One hundred fifty-eight (14.5%) patients were classified as developing AKI. The AKI patients were older, had a higher baseline serum creatinine, lower GFR, higher serum glucose, higher prevalence of chronic heart failure and ischaemic heart disease, were more likely to have suffered a haemorrhagic stroke, and had a significantly higher 30-day mortality rate (43.1 vs 12.8%) (P < 0.05 for all). Independent predictors for AKI development in the logistic regression analysis were age, GFR, presence of comorbidities (ischaemic heart disease and chronic heart failure) and type of stroke (Cox and Snell R² 0.244; Nagelkerke R² 0.431; P < 0.05). In our study, we demonstrated that the occurrence of AKI is not a rare finding in stroke patients. This is the first study to report the incidence of AKI in a distinct geographic population base, in patients with stroke. Baseline renal function emerged as both a significant independent marker for short-term survival after an acute stroke (even after adjustment for baseline comorbidities) and as a risk factor for subsequent AKI.

AKI and In-Hospital and 30-Day Mortality for all Stroke. AKI, acute kidney injury; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval

Two studies provided data on in-hospital mortality after ischemic stroke with a pooled OR of 3.30 (95% CI 2.56–4.26) and low heterogeneity (I² 31%; Fig. 4). Two studies provided data on in-hospital mortality after ICH with a pooled OR of 1.40 (95% CI 1.37–1.43) and low heterogeneity (I² 0%; Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
AKI and In-Hospital Mortality for Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Stroke. AKI, acute kidney injury; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval

Nadkarni et al. reported an adjusted OR for in-hospital mortality in AKI-D of 1.30 (95% CI 1.12–1.48; P < 0.001) in ischemic stroke and 1.95 (95% CI 1.61–2.36; P < 0.01) in ICH. Since this study included AKI-D only it was excluded from the meta-analysis. Saeed et al. 2015 reported a higher crude mortality rate in patients with AKI-D than AKI without dialysis (50.2% vs 28.4%, P < 0.001).

Only one study provided long-term mortality data up to 10 years, demonstrating higher cumulative mortality in the AKI group at one year (34.6 vs 22.1 in non-AKI group) and 10 years (75.9 vs 57.7; P = 0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model AKI was an independent predictor of 10-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.24; 95% CI 1.07–1.44, P < 0.01) after adjustment for confounders including sex, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, systolic blood pressure, brain edema, hematocrit, antihypertensive agent use after the event and ACEi/ARB and statin use on follow-up. The probability of 10-year mortality also increased with severity of AKI.

### Rehydration with fructose worsens dehydration-induced renal damage [^8d4df30f]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Heat stroke is a concern throughout the world, not only as a complication of exercise (such as marathon running) and of military campaigns, but also for individuals working outside in both rural settings and in hot urban environments. Epidemics of heat stroke associated with extreme heat events (heat waves) were reported in Chicago in 1995 and Europe in 2003. Indeed, heat stroke is likely to become more common as temperatures rise, for now nearly 75% of heat extremes can be attributed to climate change.

Most emphasis on heat stroke relates to the acute risk for multi-organ failure and death. However, heat stroke has also been associated with residual liver and kidney damage. More recently, we have raised the hypothesis that chronic recurrent heat stress might be able to induce chronic kidney disease (CKD), and we have hypothesized this may be of relevance to the epidemics of CKD being observed in among agricultural workers in various hot communities in Central America, India, Sri Lanka and elsewhere.

To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a model of CKD induced in mice by repetitive heat stress and dehydration over a 5 week period. Using this model, we found that if mice were hydrated during the heat stress period, they did not develop renal injury, whereas if they hydrated after the heat/dehydration period, that they developed mild tubulointerstitial kidney disease. In this same study we found evidence that heat stress/dehydration caused activation of aldose reductase in the kidney, an osmotically-sensitive enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol, which is then further metabolized in the renal cortex to fructose. Fructose is known to be metabolized in the proximal tubule by the enzyme fructokinase, and this results in a drop in ATP levels, the generation of uric acid, and a burst of oxidative stress that can cause tubular injury. Indeed, mice lacking fructokinase were protected from the renal injury of recurrent heat stress.

### Disentangling the multiple links between renal dysfunction and cerebrovascular disease [^e63aeaee]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in the most recent meta-analysis of 83 studies (over two million participants), there was an inverse linear relationship between eGFR and the risk of stroke, with risk of stroke increasing 7% for every 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A 25 mg/mmol increase in the albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) was associated with a 10% increased risk of stroke. As in the previous meta-analysis, the results were consistent across stroke subtypes, by sex or in subgroup strata with varying prevalence of vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes and smoking), suggesting an independent relationship between CKD and stroke risk. Stroke risk increased linearly and additively with declining GFR and increasing albuminuria.

There is a particularly strong and independent association between proteinuria and stroke. In a meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies (140 231 participants, 3266 strokes), participants with proteinuria had a 71% greater risk of stroke compared with those without (95% CI 1.39% to 2.10%). The risk of stroke remained high after adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors, but there may be residual confounders. There is a dose–response relationship with higher levels of albuminuria conferring greater stroke risk. In another meta-analysis, patients with macroalbuminuria had a higher risk of incident stroke (relative risk (RR) 2.65, 95% CI 2.25 to 3.14) compared to that of those with microalbuminuria (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.39 to 1.80).

### Etiological subtypes of transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke in chronic kidney disease: population-based study [^30e976df]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with stroke risk, but the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear and might be informed by subtype-specific analyses. However, few studies have reported stroke subtypes in CKD according to established classification systems, such as the TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. We, therefore, aimed to determine which transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke subtypes using the TOAST classification occur most frequently in patients with CKD.

Methods

In a population-based study of all transient ischemic attack and stroke (OXVASC [Oxford Vascular Study]; 2002–2017), all ischemic events were classified by TOAST subtypes (cardioembolism, large artery disease, small vessel disease, undetermined, multiple, other etiology, or incompletely investigated). Logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2) and transient ischemic attack/stroke subtypes adjusted for age, sex, and hypertension and then stratified by age and estimated glomerular filtration rate category.

Results

Among 3178 patients with transient ischemic attack (n = 1167), ischemic stroke (n = 1802), and intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 209), 1267 (40%) had CKD. Although there was a greater prevalence of cardioembolic events (31.8% versus 21.2%; P < 0.001) in patients with CKD, this association was lost after adjustment for age, sex, and hypertension (adjusted odds ratio = 1.20 [95% CI, 0.99–1.45]; P = 0.07). Similarly, although patients with CKD had a lower prevalence of small vessel disease (8.8% versus 13.6%; P < 0.001), undetermined (26.1% versus 39.4%; P < 0.001), and other etiology (1.0% versus 3.6%; P < 0.001) subtypes, these associations were also lost after adjustment (adjusted odds ratio = 0.86 [0.65–1.13]; P = 0.27 and 0.73 [0.36–1.43]; P = 0.37 for small vessel disease and other defined etiology, respectively) for all but undetermined (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81 [0.67–0.98]; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

There were no independent positive associations between CKD and specific TOAST subtypes, which suggest that renal-specific risk factors are unlikely to play an important role in the etiology of particular subtypes. Future studies of stroke and CKD should report subtype-specific analyses to gain further insights into potential mechanisms.

### Fibroblast growth factor 23 is associated with subclinical cerebrovascular damage: the Northern manhattan study [^3749afb6]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) regulates phosphate homeostasis and is linked with mortality, cardiovascular events, and stroke. However, the role of FGF23 as a risk factor for subclinical cerebrovascular damage is unclear.

Methods

We used multivariable linear and logistic regression to evaluate associations between FGF23, continuously and by quartiles, with white matter hyperintensity volume, expressed as percent intracranial volume (%ICV), and subclinical brain infarction (SBI) in a community-based stroke-free sample.

Results

There were 1170 stroke-free Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) participants with FGF23 levels and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging data on white matter hyperintensity volume and SBI. Participants with FGF23 levels in the top quartile (range = 85–1425 RU/mL) had greater white matter hyperintensity volume (β = 0.19%ICV; 95% CI, 0.04–0.33%ICV; P = 0.01) compared with those in the lowest quartile (range = 15–49 RU/mL), adjusted for demographics, vascular risk factors, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. These findings remained significant in those without evidence of chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)). Elevated FGF23 was not associated with SBI overall after adjusting for demographic factors and estimated glomerular filtration rate, but sex modified the effect of FGF23 on odds of SBI (P for interaction = 0.03). FGF23 was associated with significantly greater odds of SBI only in men (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1–2.7; P = 0.03) after full adjustment.

Conclusions

These cross-sectional community-based data from a diverse urban sample show an association between elevated FGF23 and small vessel disease and magnetic resonance imaging-defined brain infarction in men, independent of chronic kidney disease. Data on elevated FGF23 and subclinical cerebrovascular damage progression are needed.

### Prognostic impact of 1-year changes in creatinine-and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate after stroke on 5-year outcomes: insights from the third China national stroke registry [^b0228431]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, the Q1 group, which experienced the greatest eGFR Cr+CysC decline of 29.5% (mean absolute decline of 28.3 mL/min per 1.73 m 2), was associated with a 1.96‐fold increase in all‐cause mortality and a 1.74‐fold increase in the incidence of stroke disability within 5 years. We used the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2012 formula rather than the 2021 formula to estimate eGFR, as the 2012 equation has been proven to be more accurate for risk prediction in the Chinese population.

In our study, the Q1 group, despite having higher baseline kidney function, was also associated with an increased risk of death and stroke disability. This suggests that even with preserved kidney function at stroke onset, the rate of eGFR Cr+CysC change has a predictive value for future adverse outcomes. The Q1 group had the highest prevalence of diabetes (27.1%), glycosylated hemoglobin levels (6.71% ± 1.93%), and proportion of baseline eGFR Cr+CysC > 120 mL/min per 1.73 m² (10.5%). A cohort study of a population without diabetes showed an association between prediabetes and glomerular hyperfiltration. We hypothesized that hyperfiltration due to diabetes or prediabetes may cause hemodynamic injury to the remaining nephrons, accelerating kidney disease progression. Brain injury can also lead to kidney dysfunction through the central autonomic network, sympathetic nervous system, inflammatory responses, autoregulation, neuroendocrine system, and extracellular vesicles. Conversely, a declining eGFR may increase the risk by exacerbating cardiovascular factors such as endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and vascular damage, along with activation of the renin–angiotensin system. In our study, the greatest decrease in eGFR CysC level was also associated with adverse outcomes. In addition to deteriorating kidney function, non‐GFR determinants of cystatin C, such as systemic inflammation, obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, may also result in worse outcomes.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^086e0fb1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergencies — burden and management principles: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Common forms of acute hypertension-related target organ damage include acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, neurologic disorders (encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], acute ischemic stroke), and acute kidney injury (AKI), with aortic dissection the least common presentation. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of blood pressure (BP) to prevent or limit further target organ damage, whereas patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy; reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

### Proteinuria as an independent risk factor for contrast-induced acute kidney injury and mortality in patients with stroke undergoing cerebral angiography [^4bdd07a7]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Normally, only a small amount of albumin is filtered across the glomeruli, and nearly all filtered albumin is reabsorbed by apical receptors in proximal tubular cells. In healthy individuals, proteinuria cannot be detected, but when the glomerular filtration barrier or proximal tubular cells are injured, proteinuria occurs. Furthermore, proteinuria, which is a marker of kidney injury, also participates in the injury process. An overload of albumin in proximal tubules may upregulate NF-κB, which increases the expression of multiple inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin 18 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. The increase in these inflammatory mediators leads to tubulointerstitial inflammation. Proteinuria also increases reactive oxygen species, resulting in proximal tubule inflammation. Additionally, proteinuria may induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, eventually leading to the apoptosis of proximal tubule cells. For these reasons, patients with proteinuria have reduced physiological adaptability and are less able to tolerate nephrotoxic insults, such as contrast medium.

Numerous studies have shown that proteinuria aggravates renal outcomes and increases the rate of cardiovascular events and long-term mortality in patients with CKD. Multiple studies have found that proteinuria is a marker of chronic renal insults and may also serve as a surrogate marker of acute damage. Proteinuria has been confirmed as an indicator of AKI independent of eGFR. In addition, Han et al also found that proteinuria increases the risk of AKI and also the risk of 3-year mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Recently, three studies found that proteinuria is also a risk factor for CI-AKI. However, these studies did not include patients with cerebrovascular disease and were of relatively lower power. Similarly, our study indicated that proteinuria increased the risk of CI-AKI. It is noteworthy that proteinuria is also an independent indicator of 1-year mortality in our study. Proteinuria appeared to be useful for evaluating the risk of CI-AKI and 1-year mortality in patients with stroke. Special attention should be paid to the development of CI-AKI in patients with stroke and proteinuria.

### Does previous stroke modify the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and clinical endpoints in CKD patients? [^46ada6da]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

In population B, MPO and Anti Apo A1 were significantly higher in patients who had suffered a stroke compared to those without prior stroke. MPO has been shown to correlate with infarct size, stroke severity and mortality and can be detected up to 3 weeks post infarct. MPO is associated with cardiovascular events within the general population yet has been shown to decline with advancing CKD. It has been speculated that this inverse correlation between kidney function and MPO is due to uraemic toxins inhibiting MPO enzymatic activity. Conversely in animal models, MPO knockout mice demonstrate amelioration of CKD progression. Other studies have demonstrated that whilst MPO activity reduces with CKD, its oxidation products actually increase with more advanced CKD. In patients with CKD a large US study has shown MPO to be independently associated with CKD progression but not with cardiovascular disease or death. This finding was more pronounced in better preserved kidney function (eGFR > 45 mL/min). The interaction between MPO, the oxidation products of MPOCKD and cardiovascular events requires further interrogation. MPO could prove a useful biomarker in relation to CKD and stroke risk and in relation to outcomes of stroke in patients with CKD. This requires further consideration given the findings in our study.

### Diabetic kidney disease and risk of incident stroke among adults with type 2 diabetes [^b6349011]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the associations of kidney function abnormalities and CKD stages with incident stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the ACCORD study and made several observations. First, the higher the albuminuria level, the greater was the risk of stroke. Second, decreased eGFR was related to a greater risk of stroke. Third, worsening CKD stages defined by the KDIGO criteria were associated with greater risk of stroke.

Our study has unique features, in that it assesses the impact of several CKD classification schemes on the risks of incident stroke using a prospective study design of adults with type 2 diabetes. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified a gap in this area by showing that most studies of the association between CKD and incident stroke did not focus on people with type 2 diabetes, and the few studies with a focus on diabetes were limited by a retrospective design, a short duration of follow-up, a hospital-based setting, or the lack of diversity in their study samples. Our results are however consistent with prior reports of a positive relation between markers of kidney disease and adverse cardiovascular events both from the general population, as well as people with diabetes mellitus. Indeed, in a retrospective analysis of 653 Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes, participants with CKD stages 2 and 3 had a higher risk of stroke compared to those without CKD. In the same cohort, the incidence of stroke was elevated among participants with kidney function abnormalities assessed in isolation (reduced eGFR as well as increased urinary excretion). In another cohort of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, lower eGFR was independently associated with higher risks of recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Likewise, decreasing eGFR was also found to be related to increasing hazards of cerebrovascular events in a large primary care database of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK.

### Albuminuria as a predictor of cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction [^b14a20f2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with myocardial infarction, reduced kidney function is recognized as an important predictor of poor prognosis, but the impact of albuminuria, a representative measure of kidney damage, has not been extensively evaluated.

Methods and Results

In the(Stockholm Creatinine Measurements) project (2006–2012), we identified 2469 patients with incidentwith dipstick proteinuria measured within a year before(427 patients also had urine albumin to creatinine ratio measured concurrently) and obtained estimates forwith multiple imputation in participants with data solely on dipstick proteinuria. We quantified the association ofwith the post‐composite and individual outcomes of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, recurrent, ischemic stroke, or heart failure using Cox models and then evaluated the improvement in C statistic. During a median follow‐up of 1.0 year after, 1607 participants (65.1%) developed the post‐composite outcome. Higherlevels were independently associated with all outcomes except for ischemic stroke. Per 8‐fold higher(eg, 40 versus 5 mg/g), the hazard ratio of composite outcome was 1.21 (95%, 1.08–1.35). The addition of theimproved the C statistic of the post‐composite by 0.040 (95% CI, 0.030–0.051). Largely similar results were obtained regardless of diabetic status and whenor dipstick was separately analyzed without imputation.

Conclusions

In patients with, albuminuria was a potent predictor of subsequent outcomes, suggesting the importance of paying attention to the information on albuminuria, in addition to kidney function, in this high‐risk population.

### Proteinuria, but not eGFR, predicts stroke risk in chronic kidney disease: chronic renal insufficiency cohort study [^abd39bc2]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, the impact of chronic kidney disease on cerebrovascular disease is less well understood. We hypothesized that renal function severity would be predictive of stroke risk, independent of other vascular risk factors.

Methods

The study population included 3939 subjects enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study, a prospective observational cohort. Stroke events were reported by participants and adjudicated by 2 vascular neurologists. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare measures of baseline renal function with stroke events. Multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for key covariates.

Results

In 3939 subjects, 143 new stroke events (0.62 events per 100 person-years) occurred over a mean follow-up of 6.4 years. Stroke risk was increased in subjects who had worse baseline measurements of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate and total proteinuria or albuminuria). When adjusted for variables known to influence stroke risk, total proteinuria or albuminuria, but not estimated glomerular filtration rate, were associated with an increased risk of stroke. Treatment with blockers of the renin-angiotensin system did not decrease stroke risk in individuals with albuminuria.

Conclusions

Proteinuria and albuminuria are better predictors of stroke risk in patients with chronic kidney disease than estimated glomerular filtration rate. The impact of therapies targeting proteinuria/albuminuria in individuals with chronic kidney disease on stroke prevention warrants further investigation.

### Patterns of care quality and prognosis among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients with chronic kidney disease [^50ccc39a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large, contemporary nationwide study, we observed that 1 of every 3 hospitalized ischemic stroke patients had CKD, that the odds of dying in the hospital after adjusting for major confounders was 44% higher for those patients with CKD compared with those without CKD, and the independent relation of kidney dysfunction with in‐hospital mortality rose progressively with worsening renal dysfunction. These results, based on > 600 000 ischemic stroke admissions at > 1500 hospitals, definitively confirm data from previously published analyses of small single‐center studies that showed a high prevalence of CKD linked to poorer outcomes among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients. In addition, our study is the first as far as we are aware to evaluate the quality of stroke‐related care among hospitalized ischemic stroke patients by CKD presence and stage of kidney dysfunction, finding that patients with evidence of renal dysfunction are significantly less likely to receive several effective therapies, which are currently included in ischemic stroke hospitalization performance and quality measures. This latter finding is in accord with studies among patients hospitalized with acute cardiovascular conditions that revealed greater underuse of medications for vascular risk reduction as kidney function declines. –

### Urinary biomarkers of kidney tubule injury, risk of acute kidney injury, and mortality in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated at a stroke care unit [^07dd82bb]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Urinary liver-type fatty-acid binding protein (L-FABP), which is a biomarker of kidney tubule injury, has been studied extensively and established as a risk marker of acute kidney injury (AKI). The aim of this study was to investigate whether kidney tubule injury is associated with the development of AKI and mortality in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

Acute ischaemic stroke patients hospitalized in the stroke care unit (SCU) within 24 h after symptom onset were prospectively investigated. AKI was defined on the basis of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Baseline urinary L-FABP was measured on admission. We evaluated the associations among urinary L-FABP, incidence of AKI, and 90-day mortality adjusted for renal function, albuminuria and other potentially predictive variables, using multivariable analysis.

Results

In total, 527 acute ischaemic stroke patients (342 men, median age 74 years) were enrolled in the study. Twenty-seven patients (5.1%) experienced AKI within 7 days of admission. In the univariate analysis, high urinary L-FABP level had positive associations with AKI [53.8 μg/g creatinine (Cr) vs. 3.9 μg/g Cr; P < 0.001] and 90-day mortality (15.5 μg/g Cr vs. 4.0 μg/g Cr; P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, elevated urinary L-FABP level (per 10-μg/g Cr increase) was independently associated with AKI (odds ratio 1.225, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.083–1.454; P = 0.003) and 90-day mortality (hazard ratio 1.091, 95% CI 1.045–1.138; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Urinary biomarkers of kidney tubule injury are independently associated with the development of AKI and 90-day mortality in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated at the SCU.
