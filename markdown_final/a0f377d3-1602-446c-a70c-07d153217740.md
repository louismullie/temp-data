## Question

Is subthalamic bleed considered subdural or subarachnoid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a "subthalamic bleed" is subdural or subarachnoid, and how it should be classified overall. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact anatomy of the subthalamic nucleus and whether it lies within brain parenchyma. Then, I should verify precise definitions of subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Next, I will contrast intra-axial versus extra-axial compartments. After that, I should classify hemorrhage types by location using accepted frameworks. Finally, I will consider typical etiologies and any exceptions, before drawing a careful conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the anatomical substrate: the subthalamic nucleus is a deep diencephalic structure targeted in deep brain stimulation and lies within the brain parenchyma, not in the meningeal spaces, which immediately suggests an intra-axial location rather than a subdural or subarachnoid compartment bleed.

> Wait, let me verify the definition of subdural hemorrhage so I don't conflate compartments. Subdural hemorrhage is bleeding into the potential space between the dura and arachnoid mater, classically extra-axial and often traumatic, though it can rarely arise from aneurysmal rupture, which underscores that SDH is a meningeal-space process rather than a parenchymal one [^114Vk5FV].

> I should also confirm the definition of subarachnoid hemorrhage. SAH is bleeding into the subarachnoid space that contains CSF; in clinical practice it is most often aneurysmal when nontraumatic and is diagnosed by CT patterns of subarachnoid blood or LP when CT is negative beyond the early window, which again places it outside the brain tissue proper [^114oTich] [^1169HZgY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check compartments explicitly. Intraparenchymal bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage, ICH) occurs within brain tissue and may extend into ventricles and, rarely, into the subarachnoid space, whereas SDH and SAH are extra-axial and confined to meningeal spaces, so a hemorrhage centered in the subthalamic nucleus is by definition intra-axial ICH, not SDH or SAH [^1169TYRE].

> Next, I should review classification by location to ensure I'm applying standard terminology. Established schemes distinguish lobar from deep (non-lobar) ICH, with deep ICH encompassing basal ganglia and thalamic regions; a subthalamic hemorrhage aligns with deep/non-lobar ICH rather than any extra-axial hemorrhage category [^notfound] [^1131JoHB].

> Let me consider likely etiology, since that often correlates with location and can serve as a cross-check. Deep ICHs involving the basal ganglia–thalamic complex are most commonly due to chronic hypertensive small vessel disease with lipohyalinosis and Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms, and observational cohorts consistently show strong associations between hypertension and deep ICH, which fits a subthalamic bleed profile [^1131JoHB] [^1126yryq].

> But wait, what if there is subarachnoid blood seen on imaging — does that change the primary classification. I should double-check: primary ICH can secondarily spill into ventricles and only rarely into the subarachnoid space, so even if limited subarachnoid layering occurs, the hemorrhage remains classified by its origin as an intraparenchymal deep ICH, not as a primary SAH or SDH [^1169TYRE] [^1131JoHB].

> In summary, I need to ensure the terminology is precise: a "subthalamic bleed" is neither subdural nor subarachnoid; it is an intraparenchymal intracerebral hemorrhage in a deep location within the basal ganglia–thalamic region, most commonly related to hypertensive small vessel disease, which clearly distinguishes it from extra-axial SDH and SAH entities [^1131JoHB] [^1126yryq] [^notfound].

No, a subthalamic bleed is **neither subdural nor subarachnoid**; it is an **intracerebral hemorrhage** within the subthalamic nucleus, a deep gray matter structure. Subdural hematomas occur **between the dura and arachnoid**, and subarachnoid hemorrhages occur in the subarachnoid space; by contrast, subthalamic bleeds are parenchymal and most often due to hypertension or small-vessel disease [^1131JoHB] [^1124qyfw]. Accurate classification is essential for management and prognosis.

---

## Anatomical location and classification

- **Subthalamic nucleus location**: The subthalamic nucleus is a deep gray matter structure below the thalamus, within the basal ganglia, and is part of the diencephalon [^112uuBCj].

- **Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)**: Bleeding within brain parenchyma, including deep structures such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus [^114zbjsL].

- **Subdural hematoma (SDH)**: Bleeding between the dura mater and arachnoid mater, typically from bridging veins [^111r6fZd].

- **Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)**: Bleeding into the subarachnoid space, usually from aneurysmal rupture or trauma [^1131qvQb].

Therefore, **a subthalamic bleed is an intracerebral hemorrhage**, not a subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115EQ7FP].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

- **Etiology**: Subthalamic bleeds are commonly associated with hypertension, small vessel disease, or vascular malformations [^1124qyfw] [^116Xwv1q].

- **Clinical presentation**: Patients typically present with acute neurological deficits, including hemiparesis, altered consciousness, and movement disorders [^115NvZVU].

- **Management**: Management involves blood pressure control, supportive care, and surgical intervention if indicated [^114Mj5FR] [^112eAVwh].

- **Prognosis**: Prognosis depends on hematoma size, location, and patient factors such as age and comorbidities [^111AQqoJ].

---

## Imaging characteristics

On **CT**, subthalamic bleeds appear as hyperdense lesions within the subthalamic nucleus [^1131JoHB]. **MRI** provides detailed visualization of the hematoma and surrounding brain structures, aiding accurate diagnosis and management planning [^1126yryq].

---

## Conclusion

A subthalamic bleed is an **intracerebral hemorrhage** within the subthalamic nucleus — not a subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage [^114zbjsL]. Accurate classification is essential for appropriate management and prognosis.

### Surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage [^116Xwv1q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a subtype of stroke characterized by the leakage of blood into brain tissue. It is a life-threatening condition with a high global burden, contributing to an annual loss of 68.5 million disability-adjusted life years worldwide. In 2019, ICH constituted 27.9% of all new strokes, with over three million estimated incident cases. There are substantial variations between countries; in World Bank low- to upper-middle-income countries, the age-standardized incidence rates of ICH are almost two to four times higher than in high-income countries.

In about 20% of people, ICH is caused by an underlying lesion such as a macrovascular cause (e.g. an aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, dural arteriovenous fistula, cavernous malformation, or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), an intracranial tumor, hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct, a coagulation disorder, or an infection. In the remaining 80% of cases, the hemorrhage is presumed to result from cerebral small vessel disease, known as primary or spontaneous ICH. The two main types of small vessel disease resulting in spontaneous ICH are arteriolosclerosis, which predominantly affects the small perforating end arteries of the deep grey nuclei, brainstem, and white matter, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which primarily affects the cortical and leptomeningeal arteries and arterioles.

The risk factors for spontaneous ICH depend on the underlying cause. The major modifiable risk factors include hypertension, high body-mass index, diabetes mellitus, and smoking.

### Computed tomography in acute intracerebral hemorrhage: Neuroimaging predictors of hematoma expansion and outcome [^1131JoHB]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) location can predict its etiology. Deep/non-lobar ICHs, such as those in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and deep cerebellum, usually occur due to long-standing hypertension in addition to other risk factors like diabetes mellitus, male sex, alcohol overuse, and being underweight. Pooled results from several studies, including a total of about 4,000 patients, demonstrated that hypertension was twice as common in patients with deep ICH compared to those with lobar ICH.

Chronic hypertension induces degenerative changes in small perforating arteries, leading to rupture and deep hemorrhages that can extend into the ventricles. Hypertensive microangiopathy, also known as chronic hypertensive encephalopathy, accounts for up to 35% of all spontaneous ICHs. It is caused by the effects of long-standing hypertension on the brain, leading to lipohyalinosis and Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms that can rupture and cause hypertensive hemorrhages. Hypertensive microangiopathy results in brain microbleeds, best visualized on T2-weighted MRI sequences, specifically susceptibility-weighted imaging, as small foci of susceptibility blooming in the basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellar hemispheres.

The presence of brain microbleeds is significantly correlated with a history of hemorrhagic stroke and has been shown to be a predictor of future ICH. A study conducted on 2,164 patients who had undergone 2,416 consecutive brain MRI studies demonstrated that the presence of microhemorrhages had the highest significant correlation (p < 0.001) with a history of hemorrhagic stroke. However, the content is incomplete and requires additional information to elaborate further on these findings.

### Progressing haemorrhagic stroke: categories, causes, mechanisms and managements [^116z3FAe]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Subacute progressing haemorrhagic stroke: Several patients with intracerebral haemorrhage develop late-onset deterioration, which often occurs during the second and third weeks. Although complications such as re-bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and pneumonitis may occur, the subacute progression of haemorrhagic stroke should primarily be attributed to the increased mass effect produced by secondary oedema. As previously described, perihaematomal oedema has two peaks: in the fourth or fifth days, or during the second and third week. This special feature of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is consistent with the progression of perihaematomal oedema after the onset of ICH. Subacute natural progression has not been reported much, and it is hard to identify in the beginning.

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Updates in diagnosis and management [^114oTich]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a neurologic emergency characterized by bleeding into the subarachnoid space. Mortality rates can reach up to 50%. Clinically, SAH often presents with a headache that is maximal at onset and described as the worst headache of the patient's life. While traumatic causes are most common, approximately 80% of nontraumatic SAHs are due to aneurysmal ruptures. The remaining cases are attributed to idiopathic peri-mesencephalic hemorrhage or other less common causes. Noncontrast brain computed tomography (CT), if performed within 6 hours of symptom onset, boasts a sensitivity close to 100%. If the initial CT results are normal, a lumbar puncture may be considered after this period for a definitive diagnosis.

### Imaging evaluation of the patient with worst headache of life — it is not all subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115sb3L3]. Emergency Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The radiologist working in an emergency radiology setting is often tasked with evaluating imaging findings for patients whose chief complaint is the worst headache of their life. The diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is typically the initial consideration before imaging is performed and must be quickly and accurately diagnosed. However, several entities can mimic SAH on imaging studies. These entities are presented in this review. Additionally, various other disease processes can produce what patients describe as the worst headache of their life. This paper reviews some of the most important entities and their respective CT and MR imaging findings.

### Are primary supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhages surrounded by a biochemical penumbra? A microdialysis study [^115RtfFQ]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Opinions vary regarding the indications for surgical evacuation of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) and whether or not penumbra zones surround them.

- **Methods**: We performed intracerebral microdialysis (mean duration, 3.5 days) after surgical evacuation of ICH in 22 patients. Probes were placed in the parenchyma within 1 to 2 cm of the evacuated hematoma; a postoperative computed tomographic scan verified their positions. The catheters were perfused with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution at 0.3 microliters per minute. Biochemical variables (glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate, and glycerol) were analyzed and displayed at the bedside. The levels obtained were compared with previous data from normal human brains and the pericontusional penumbra zones of patients with severe traumatic brain lesions.

- **Results**: During 1 to 12 hours after surgery, interstitial levels of glucose (median level, 1.3 mmol/L; interquartile range, 0.6–2.2 mmol/L) were within normal variations, whereas the levels of lactate (median level, 6.4 mmol/L; interquartile range, 3.9–9.0 mmol/L), glutamate (median level, 14 micromol/L; interquartile range, 5–370 micromol/L), and glycerol (median level, 190 micromol/L; interquartile range, 74–380 micromol/L), as well as the lactate/pyruvate ratio (median ratio, 35; interquartile range, 23–50) were increased. A gradual normalization of the lactate/pyruvate ratio and glycerol level was observed within 48 hours.

The area close to an evacuated ICH exhibits a biochemical pattern similar to that of the biochemical penumbra zone surrounding brain lesions.

### Surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage [^1123rN4D]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

This review updated the methodology of a previous Cochrane review on this topic and was conducted by a new team of review authors in accordance with established Cochrane standards. We minimized the effects of publication and language bias by conducting extensive searches for published and unpublished RCTs regardless of publication type or language and by contacting trialists in the field to obtain additional information on unpublished or ongoing studies. The electronic searches were rerun prior to publication to ensure that the review is as current at the time of writing as possible. Moreover, we followed a dual review process for study selection to reduce the possibility that relevant reports have been discarded. Despite our efforts, there remains a possibility that some unpublished data may have been missed, as the results from two apparently completed studies could not be retrieved, and the status of another seven studies awaiting classification remains unknown.

We deviated from the study protocol by removing the prespecified important outcome "symptomatic brain bleeds within the first week after randomization" from our review. This post hoc decision was made because the studies were not sufficiently homogeneous to provide a meaningful summary, as the studies used different definitions for brain bleeds, reported brain bleeds at different time points, or excluded participants with a rebleed leading to a change in therapeutic modality.

We anticipated that several multiplicity issues would arise in our review. Over half of the included RCTs reported various outcomes inconsistently.

### Characteristics of intracerebral haemorrhage associated with COVID-19: A systematic review and pooled analysis of individual patient and aggregate data [^113f6gUN]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The following variables were extracted from the studies: demographics (age, gender); vascular risk factors; ICH characteristics (location, cause); stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score); anticoagulant treatment (prophylactic or therapeutic) at the time of ICH; COVID-19 severity and clinical outcome; coagulation and inflammation markers (D-dimers and fibrinogen, APTT, PT, INR, platelets, CRP, ferritin).

We classified ICH from reported information according to location as lobar or non-lobar (i.e. deep or infratentorial, defined as ICH in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, or the cerebellum). We then classified ICH aetiology using all information available by predefined criteria as follows: hypertensive arteriopathy (deep or infratentorial haemorrhage with known hypertension before the ICH); cerebral amyloid angiopathy (defined as ≥ 1 lobar, cortical, or cortico-subcortical haemorrhage and age ≥ 55 with no other identified cause); structural macrovascular lesions (aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, cavernous malformation); coagulopathy (defined as PT ≥ 15 and/or INR ≥ 1.2 and/or APTT ≥ 45 and/or platelets ≤ 100,000); other identified causes (cerebral venous thrombosis, Moya Moya angiopathy); or undetermined.

To estimate the pooled incidence of ICH in patients with COVID-19, we extracted data on the number of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and the number documented to have ICH in the same time period.

A pooled analysis was performed on all of the individual patient data found in the published literature.

### Hemorrhagic complication of stereotactic surgery in patients with movement disorders [^112uuBCj]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Small, asymptomatic hemorrhages are easier to detect during stereotactic surgery when magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used for targeting, rather than traditional approaches such as ventriculography with contrast material. In the present study, the authors examined the actual incidence of intraoperative hemorrhages in patients with movement disorders who had undergone MR imaging-targeted surgery, microelectrode recording (MER)-guided implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, or radiofrequency-induced coagulation surgery.

- **Methods**: Ninety-six consecutive patients underwent a total of 116 stereotactic operations for movement disorders between January 1998 and November 2002, including 57 operations for radiofrequency-induced coagulation and 59 for DBS electrode implantation. The authors investigated the correlation between hemorrhages and other factors, including the location of the hemorrhage and the type of surgery performed. Postoperative computerized tomography scans demonstrated the occurrence of intraoperative hemorrhages at 12 locations during 11 procedures (9.5% of all procedures). Nine hemorrhages occurred during 57 coagulation operations (15.8%). Within this group, the frequency of hemorrhages was highest during thalamotomy (five [21.7%] of 23 procedures) and lower during pallidotomy (four [11.8%] of 34 procedures). In contrast, only two intraventricular hemorrhages developed during 59 operations in which DBS electrodes were implanted (3.4%). In no case was hemorrhage detected in the main DBS target, that is, the subthalamic nucleus.

### Non-traumatic subdural hemorrhage: Beware of ruptured intracranial aneurysm [^111r6fZd]. Emergency Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Acute subdural hemorrhage (SDH) is commonly encountered by emergency radiologists in the setting of trauma. When history or imaging evidence of trauma is absent, the differential diagnosis for SDH should be expanded. Intracranial aneurysm rupture is a rare and underrecognized cause of SDH that may present without concurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage. The mechanism of aneurysmal SDH is controversial, but understanding the anatomic microenvironment of the aneurysm provides insight and clarifies aneurysm features predisposing to subdural compartment rupture.

Aneurysmal SDH is a neurosurgical emergency, and its treatment strategies differ from those for traumatic SDH. Outcomes are poor if treatment is delayed; thus, radiologists play a central role in recognizing this uncommon but potentially devastating complication of aneurysm rupture. The goal of this article is to familiarize radiologists with clinical and imaging characteristics of aneurysmal SDH and review pertinent anatomy, risk factors, and potential etiologies. Aneurysmal rupture can easily be overlooked in the routine workup of atraumatic SDH, and radiologists must know when to recommend vascular imaging to avoid the catastrophic consequences of a missed diagnosis.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) guideline on stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage [^115FkpBi]. European Stroke Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering limiting the use of the ICH score to providing prognostic information. This is advised rather than using the ICH score as the primary or sole method for predicting outcomes in adult patients with ICH, due to the risk of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) guideline on stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage [^1159cLvh]. European Stroke Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly in the initial evaluation, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering the use of algorithms such as the DIAGRAM for targeted investigation of the cause of spontaneous ICH. This approach aims to improve the prediction performance regarding the underlying cause, compared to standard care.

### Determining the optimal hematoma volume-based thresholds for surgical and medical strategies in basal ganglia hemorrhage [^115wmjqq]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Low credibility.

The medical treatment alone is feasible for hematoma volumes within the range of 0 to 45.3 mL. For hematoma volumes between 45.3 mL and 59.9 mL, the decision to pursue surgical intervention depends on the surgeon's judgment and various contributing factors. Furthermore, hematoma volumes of at least 60 mL strongly indicate the need for surgical intervention in patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage. This is primarily associated with improved survival rates, while functional outcomes remain unaffected, as they strictly depend on pre-treatment neurological status. The volumetric threshold is a practical clue for prompt management of both medical and surgical care plans, enhancing overall healthcare cost-effectiveness.

### Delayed clinical improvement after deep brain stimulation-related subdural hematoma. Report of 4 cases [^1156UrQP]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to present four cases that illustrate the management and outcome of subdural hematoma (SDH) following deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation.

- **Methods**: The authors identified four cases of SDH following DBS lead implantation from a pool of 500 consecutive lead implantations (incidence 0.08%) performed at the University of Florida. Cases were characterized by chart review, serial Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale evaluations, and changes on serial postoperative imaging studies.

- **Results**: Two of the four patients with DBS-related SDH were clinically symptomatic. In the other two cases, the SDH was incidentally discovered on routine postoperative lead localization imaging studies. None of the patients required craniotomy for evacuation of the SDH in the acute phase. Three of the four cases were managed with burr hole drainage in the chronic phase, and one was successfully managed non-operatively. In all four cases, thresholds for stimulation-induced side effects were lower during initial postoperative programming than during intraoperative macrostimulation. Expected clinical improvement from DBS was achieved without lead revision in all four cases, but only following a significant delay.

- **Conclusions**: Subdural hematoma is a rare and potentially avoidable complication of DBS that does not typically mandate acute hematoma evacuation or hardware revision and does not preclude an excellent outcome from DBS therapy. The clinical picture and apparent lead position tend to improve with time, and it may be wise to delay repositioning of an ineffective DBS lead.

### Progressing haemorrhagic stroke: categories, causes, mechanisms and managements [^116BA9Qj]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

- **Causes**:

	- **Haematoma expansion**: Haematoma expansion refers to the expansion of the haemorrhagic volume within the first 3–72 hours, mostly within 6 hours. This expansion, detected by neuroimaging methods, occurs in 13–40% of all reported patients. The definition of haematoma expansion is not universally agreed upon. A commonly used definition is an increase in the volume of intraparenchymal haemorrhage of greater than 33% between the baseline and the repeated CT, or an increase in volume by ≥ 12.5 cm³ or by ≥ 1.4 times. Haematoma expansion accounts for a major part of acute progression in the acute phase of intracerebral haemorrhage and is independently associated with a poor outcome.

	- **Intraventricular haemorrhage**: Intraventricular extension of haemorrhage is another deteriorating factor of early ICH. This extension can occur simultaneously with ICH or within 24–72 hours after the onset of initial ICH, in 20–55% of all ICH patients. Studies by Steiner et al. and Bhattathiri et al. demonstrated that ICH patients with intraventricular haemorrhage had a worse functional outcome compared to those without. Even after adjusting for the ICH score and haematoma expansion, intraventricular haemorrhage is associated with a higher mortality rate during hospitalisation.

	- **Perihaematomal oedema**: Perihaematomal oedema volume significantly increases after onset within the first 24 hours after spontaneous ICH. Chronological CT images have shown rapid increases in perihaematomal oedema within 3 days after onset, reaching its initial peak during the fourth day.

### Treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage: Current approaches and future directions [^1153rCst]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Low credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) stands out among strokes for the severely morbid outcomes it routinely produces and the significant deficiency of defenses against it. The brain damage caused by ICH proceeds through multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are broadly differentiated into primary mechanisms, arising from the hematoma itself, and secondary consequences of the presence and expansion of the hematoma.

A number of interventions against ICH and its sequelae have been investigated, such as hemostatic therapies, blood pressure control, hematoma evacuation, and a variety of neuroprotective strategies. However, conclusive demonstrations of clinical benefit have largely remained elusive. In this review, we describe these interventions and the trials in which they have been implemented, along with an analysis of their failures. Possible causes include iatrogenic injury during hematoma evacuation, secondary injury initiated by hematoma persistence after evacuation, and inadequate therapeutic power due to an excessively narrow focus on a single component of the complex pathophysiology of ICH injury.

To conclude, we propose several strategies that hold promise for extending anti-ICH therapy into the domain of clinical significance. These strategies include enhancing endogenous hematoma resolution, hematoma evacuation-based neuroprotection, and multi-targeted therapy.

### State of the art in managing nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage [^111KAffC]. Neurosurgical Focus (2011). Low credibility.

Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. It leads to a high rate of morbidity and mortality. At the time of writing, no medical or surgical trials have clearly attested to the benefit of a particular therapy. The aim of this review was to summarize the best evidence for management decision-making in intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Multidisciplinary consensus guideline for the diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^112AQk3X]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for spontaneous intracranial hypotension, particularly in patients with subdural hematoma, the SIH-SIG 2023 guidelines recommend considering performing burr hole drainage in conjunction with treating the cerebrospinal leak in patients with symptomatic hematomas with significant mass effect.

### Intracerebral haemorrhage expansion: definitions, predictors, and prevention [^114zbjsL]. The Lancet Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Haematoma expansion affects a fifth of patients within 24 hours of the onset of acute intracerebral haemorrhage and is associated with death and disability, making it an appealing therapeutic target. The period in which active intervention can be done is short, as expansion occurs mostly within the first three hours after onset. Baseline haemorrhage volume, antithrombotic treatment, and CT angiography spot signs are each associated with an increased risk of haematoma expansion.

Non-contrast CT features are promising predictors of haematoma expansion, though their potential contribution to models is under investigation. Blood pressure lowering and haemostatic treatment minimize haematoma expansion but have not led to improved functional outcomes in randomized clinical trials.

Ultra-early enrollment and the selection of participants based on non-contrast CT imaging markers could focus future clinical trials to demonstrate clinical benefit in people at high risk of expansion. It could also investigate the heterogeneity of treatment effects in clinical trials with broad inclusion criteria.

### Subsequent bilateral thalamic haemorrhage [^111aemUW]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Simultaneous or subsequent bilateral thalamic haemorrhage is rare, with most reported cases originating from Asian countries. An 80-year-old white Cuban man, with a history of arterial hypertension, experienced the sudden onset of right hemiparesis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a left posteromedial thalamic haemorrhage. Two days later, his condition abruptly worsened: his blood pressure was 220/105 mm Hg, he was stuporous and tetraplegic, respiration was ataxic, and his gaze was fixed, deviated downward and inward. A CT scan showed haemorrhages in both thalami, extending to the ventricles. Thirty-two hours later, the patient died. There are few previous publications of simultaneous or subsequent bilateral thalamic haemorrhages, and this is the first report involving a Hispanic patient. The prognosis in patients with bilateral thalamic haemorrhage is poor, and the mechanism underlying the development of subsequent and symmetrical bleeding remains unclear.

### Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of undetermined intracerebral hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113747KD]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

There are scarce data regarding the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of undetermined (unknown or cryptogenic) etiology. We sought to determine the prevalence, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcomes of undetermined ICH.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies involving patients with spontaneous ICH was conducted to primarily assess the prevalence and clinical-radiological characteristics of undetermined ICH. Additionally, we assessed the rates for ICH secondary to hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the use of (1) etiology-oriented ICH classification, (2) detailed neuroimaging, and (3) Boston criteria among patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related ICH. We pooled the prevalence rates using random-effects models and assessed the heterogeneity using Cochran Q and I² statistics.

- **Results**: We identified 24 studies comprising 15,828 spontaneous ICH patients (mean age, 64.8 years; men, 60.8%). The pooled prevalences of hypertensive arteriopathy ICH, undetermined ICH, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy ICH were 50% (95% CI, 43%–58%), 18% (95% CI, 13%–23%), and 12% (95% CI, 7%–17%) [P < 0.001 between subgroups]. The volume of ICH was the largest in cerebral amyloid angiopathy ICH (24.7 [95% CI, 19.7–29.8] mL), followed by hypertensive arteriopathy ICH (16.2 [95% CI, 10.9–21.5] mL) and undetermined ICH (15.4 [95% CI, 6.2–24.5] mL). Among patients with undetermined ICH, the rates of short-term mortality (within 3 months)…

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) guideline on stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage [^115an1tc]. European Stroke Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery, supratentorial hemorrhage, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering decompressive surgery without hematoma removal in adult patients aged 18–75 years. This is applicable within 72 hours of severe deep spontaneous ICH (GCS 8–13, NIHSS 10–30, and stable ICH volume 30–100 mL) to reduce the risk of death or severe dependence (mRS 5–6).

### Yield of MRI in patients with spontaneous deep intracerebral hemorrhage [^1126yryq]. Emergency Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypertensive hemorrhage is the most common type of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). It characteristically originates in deep structures, particularly the basal ganglia, internal capsules, thalami, brainstem, and cerebellum. While advanced imaging modalities like MRI can help uncover culprit lesions in cases of unexplained ICH, we hypothesized that the yield of brain MRI would be low in patients with spontaneous deep intracerebral hemorrhage.

With IRB approval, we retrospectively reviewed cases of deep ICH at a single tertiary care academic center over a five-year period and excluded cases with a known cause for hemorrhage. Patient history and demographics, initial blood pressure, and the results of the initial non-contrast head CT and subsequent imaging studies were recorded.

222 patients met study inclusion criteria, with a median age of 67 and 43.2% female sex. 188 patients (84.7%) had a history of hypertension, while 14 (6.3%) had a urine drug screen positive for cocaine or amphetamines during their hospital admission. The majority of hemorrhages were centered in the basal ganglia or internal capsules (116, 52.3%). Brain MRI was obtained for 120 (54.1%) of cases at a median interval of 0.97 days following the initial head CT. Of these studies, 85 (70.8%) included postcontrast imaging. Only 1 MRI study (0.8%) identified a culprit lesion adjacent to a cerebellar hematoma, which was later found to represent a pilocytic astrocytoma.

### Identification and validation of hematoma volume cutoffs in spontaneous, supratentorial deep intracerebral hemorrhage [^111tQDQK]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical trials in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have used volume cutoffs as inclusion criteria to select populations in which the effects of interventions are likely to be the greatest. However, optimal volume cutoffs for predicting poor outcomes in deep locations (thalamus versus basal ganglia) are unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a two-phase study to determine ICH volume cutoffs for poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score of 4–6) in the thalamus and basal ganglia. Cutoffs with optimal sensitivity and specificity for poor outcome were identified in the ERICH (Ethnic/Racial Variations of ICH) study [derivation cohort], using receiver operating characteristic curves. The cutoffs were then validated in the ATACH-2 trial (Antihypertensive Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage-2) by comparing the c-statistic of regression models for outcome (including dichotomized volume) in the validation cohort.

- **Results**: Of the 3000 patients enrolled in ERICH, 1564 (52%) had deep ICH, of whom 1305 (84%) had complete neuroimaging and outcome data (660 thalamic and 645 basal ganglia hemorrhages). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 8 mL in thalamic (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 78%) and 18 mL in basal ganglia ICH (area under the curve, 0.79; sensitivity, 70%; specificity, 83%) as optimal cutoffs for predicting poor outcomes. The validation cohort included 834 (84%) patients with deep ICH and complete neuroimaging data enrolled in ATACH-2 (353 thalamic and 431 basal ganglia hemorrhages).

### Intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathophysiology and therapy [^115NvZVU]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, arising from various sources, causes an instantaneous mass effect and disruption of the surrounding brain tissue, often leading to early neurological death. If the patient survives the initial event, the hematoma can result in secondary brain injury, neurological deficits, and, occasionally, delayed fatality. The mechanisms that trigger pathophysiological changes in and around the hematoma are becoming better understood, offering new therapeutic opportunities.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in critically ill adults with intracerebral hemorrhage [^111AQqoJ]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

These guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of select demographic and clinical variables, as well as prediction models, when counseling patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and/or their surrogates. We formally categorized these predictors as reliable, moderately reliable, or not reliable, based on a GRADE-based assessment of certainty in the body of evidence, and effect size (quantification of predictor accuracy) across published studies.

- **Reliable and moderately reliable predictors**: Reliable predictors may be used to formulate a prognosis when the appropriate clinical context is present in the absence of potential confounders. These are predictors with clear, actionable thresholds or clinical/radiographic definitions and a low rate of error in prediction of poor outcomes, with at least moderate certainty in the body of evidence. When the prognosis is formulated on the basis of one or more reliable predictors, a clinician may describe the outcome as "very likely" during counseling. Given the inherent limitations in neuroprognostication research, the clinician must nevertheless acknowledge existing uncertainties.

Many predictors designated as "not reliable" are still used by clinicians in formulating and communicating real-world subjective impressions of prognosis. The purpose of these guidelines is to identify predictors, if any, that meet reliable or moderately reliable criteria.

### Diagnosis and management of subarachnoid haemorrhage [^1131qvQb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

While advancements in medical technology and treatment protocols have significantly improved outcomes, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) remains a challenging condition with profound implications for patient care. The highly individualized nature of SAH, due to factors such as aneurysm location, patient comorbidities, and pathophysiology, underscores the importance of personalized treatment strategies. The incidence of multi-system complications further exemplifies the need for an interdisciplinary approach, which is critical for optimizing patient outcomes.

As we continue to face these multifaceted challenges, there is a pressing need for ongoing research to refine existing treatment protocols and develop new, innovative approaches to manage SAH. Future studies should aim to address the gaps in our understanding of SAH pathophysiology and evaluate strategies that could mitigate the systemic inequities currently limiting the accessibility of optimal care.

Collaboration between neuroscientists, clinicians, and health policy experts will be crucial in this endeavor. The development of novel therapeutics and improved management techniques, backed by robust data collection and analysis, holds the promise of enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by SAH.

### Acute subdural hematoma caused by ruptured cerebral aneurysms: Diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls [^114Vk5FV]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

On rare occasions, rupture of a cerebral aneurysm causes acute subdural hematoma (SDH) in addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The frequency of SDH resulting from aneurysmal rupture is summarized, and its clinical and radiological characteristics, as well as potential pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of this life-threatening condition, are described. Among 641 patients with nontraumatic SAH treated between 1992 and 2000, 12 patients (1.9%) presented with SDH due to aneurysmal rupture. The SAH grade on admission was grade II in one patient, grade IV in three patients, and grade V in eight patients.

- **Treatment and outcomes**: Four patients underwent both hematoma evacuation and clipping of the aneurysm, four underwent hematoma evacuation alone, and the other four patients were treated conservatively. The outcome was good recovery in two patients, severe disability in one patient, and death in nine patients. Patients with a good outcome had a better SAH grade on admission, smaller midline shift, and smaller SDH volume on the initial CT scan. They had been treated by both SDH evacuation and clipping of the aneurysm.

Emergency one-stage operations may be beneficial for aneurysmal SDH patients who are in good SAH grade, or those who are in poor SAH grade but show some neurological recovery after resuscitation. It should also be mentioned that there are cases of aneurysmal SDH without recognizable SAH on the CT scans. Additionally, a case of aneurysmal SDH may present as a case of 'head trauma' after an accident due to the disturbance of consciousness resulting from aneurysmal rupture.

### Surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage [^116WKRJA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Risk of bias assessment in included studies:

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in Chapter 8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool for randomized trials across the following domains:

- **Random sequence generation**: Selection bias
- **Allocation concealment**: Selection bias
- **Blinding of participants and personnel**: Performance bias
- **Blinding of outcome assessment**: Detection bias
- **Incomplete outcome data**: Attrition bias
- **Selective reporting**: Reporting bias
- **Other sources of bias**

The risk of bias for each domain was graded as high, low, or unclear, with information from the study reports provided to justify our judgment in the risk of bias tables.

Measures of treatment effect:

We conducted all analyses using an intention-to-treat approach, meaning participants were analyzed according to their assigned intervention at baseline, regardless of whether the interventions were received as intended. Dichotomous data were analyzed as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous data as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. Data presented on a scale with a consistent direction of effect were entered accordingly. If a study did not report data in a format directly compatible with meta-analysis, we converted the data to an appropriate format using the information in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Evaluations for abuse in young children with subdural hemorrhages: Findings based on symptom severity and benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces [^114s2HUZ]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The study focuses on children who have subdural hematomas (SDHs) with no or minimal neurological symptoms, referred to as SDH-mild symptoms. These cases often present a forensic challenge. Nonabusive causes of SDH, including birth-related SDH, benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces (BESS), and other proposed causes, have been suggested as potential etiologies. However, these alternative causes do not explain concomitant suspicious injuries (CSIs). The study hypothesizes that if SDH with mild symptoms in young children are frequently caused by these alternative causes, then children with SDH-mild symptoms should be more likely to present with no other CSIs compared to those with SDH and severe symptoms (SDH-severe symptoms). Moreover, if SDH with mild symptoms is due to non-abusive causes, the location and distribution of the SDH might differ from those caused by abuse.

The objectives of this study include determining the prevalence of other CSIs in patients presenting with SDH-mild symptoms and comparing this prevalence with patients having SDH-severe symptoms. The study also aims to compare the locations and distributions of SDH between these two groups. Furthermore, due to data supporting BESS as a potential cause of SDH in young children, the authors aim to evaluate the associations between BESS, SDH-mild symptoms, and other CSIs.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a 5-year retrospective case-control study involving patients younger than 2 years of age with SDH, evaluated by a Child Abuse Pediatrics program. Patients were classified as having SDH-mild symptoms (cases) or SDH-severe symptoms (controls). The two groups were then compared.

### Surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage [^112sPsPe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence by creating separate summary of findings tables for all the outcomes listed under outcome measures for each of the comparisons listed under synthesis methods. Following the methods described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, we used GRADEpro GDT software for this purpose.

The certainty of the evidence was presented according to GRADE, taking into account the following five domains: overall risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias. Two review authors, FNW and HDB, independently made judgments regarding the certainty of the evidence. All decisions to downgrade the certainty of evidence were justified using footnotes, and additional comments were provided to enhance the understanding of the review for readers. We justified, documented, and incorporated our judgments into the reporting of results for each outcome.

Due to limited resources, we did not involve consumers in this review.

### Supratentorial subdural hemorrhage of a previous head injury and cerebellar hemorrhage after cervical spinal surgery: A case report and review of the literature [^112bPjms]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

This case report aims to discuss an acute supratentorial subdural hemorrhage (SDH) at a previous head injury site and cerebellar hemorrhage following an incidental dural tear during spine surgery.

Intracranial hemorrhages, such as subdural, cerebellar, subarachnoid, and epidural hemorrhages occurring following a dural tear during spinal surgery, are rare and poorly recognized complications. The literature describes only three cases involving concurrent SDH and cerebellar hemorrhage, none of which demonstrated the bleeding point on the adhesion site of the dura at the regions of prior head injury.

A case report and literature review were conducted. The patient, a 46-year-old male, underwent occipital cervical surgery for os odontoideum. Intraoperatively, a dural tear was observed and repaired, but the patient subsequently developed postoperative consciousness disturbances. A head computed tomography scan revealed both supratentorial SDH and cerebellar hemorrhage. Craniotomy was performed to evacuate the supratentorial SDH, revealing that the bleeding originated at the dural adhesion site from a previous head injury. The patient made a full recovery.

This report highlights that cerebrospinal fluid leakage following a dural tear during spinal surgery may lead to intracranial hemorrhage. Additionally, previous head trauma could be considered a risk factor for such hemorrhagic complications. Symptoms such as headache, nausea, and postoperative stupor after spinal surgery — especially following an accidental dural tear — should be monitored closely.

### Prediction of etiology and prognosis based on hematoma location of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a multicenter diagnostic study [^1124qyfw]. Neuroradiology (2025). High credibility.

On the basis of our clinical model, we utilized lesion-symptom mapping for quantitative and precise specification of hematoma location, confirming that location features have a significant additive effect relative to standard clinical information for the prediction and classification of etiology. Our data showed that hypertensive hemorrhage manifested primarily in deep brain regions, specifically the lentiform nucleus, striae terminalis, and hippocampus. This is consistent with previous clinical knowledge, which contends that hypertensive hemorrhage is primarily located in the basal ganglia region. Due to hemodynamic sensitivity, the cerebral arterial circle or deep penetrating arteries may exhibit heightened responsiveness to systemic blood pressure changes compared to cortical arteries, thereby increasing the likelihood of bleeding.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage often results from rupture with sICH occurring in approximately 20–30% of aneurysm patients. The cistern in which the hemorrhage is likely to be located is an important clue to finding the responsible aneurysm. In this light, it is important to note that our etiologic classification model found evidence that involvement of the lateral fissure cistern and the anterior longitudinal fissure cistern were key in predicting aneurysm rupture. Our evidence also suggests that the corpus callosum and lenticular fasciculus are important in terms of location for regions outside the subarachnoid space.

### Concussion susceptibility is mediated by spreading depolarization-induced neurovascular dysfunction [^116UMyLe]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

While the cause of immediate post-impact death is not understood, more frequent intracranial hemorrhage, including subarachnoid and subdural bleeding, was observed in susceptible animals compared to resilient animals. Susceptible animals also show a more severe microvascular injury and blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD). This raises the hypothesis that, similar to the situation in stroke, BBBD increases the risk for secondary hemorrhage. Besides hemorrhage, immediate post-impact death could result from cortical spreading depression (CSD) spreading to the brainstem, as suggested in models of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). CSDs are transient cortical gray matter depolarizations that result in the suppression of brain activity and disruption of ion gradients lasting several minutes. CSD is initiated when a sufficient number of neurons are depolarized, which may occur when traumatic brain injury (TBI)-induced cortical shear stress surpasses a certain threshold or with a massive release of glutamate similar to that described during hypoxia.

The frequent recording of CSDs in our model confirms previous studies showing increased blood flow changes within minutes after impact. Interestingly, CSDs are also considered as the physiologic substrate of migraine aura, which has been described in patients with complicated mild TBI and following post-traumatic headache. The extent to which repeated CSD generation with associated migraine aura persists following mild TBI is not known but is an important area for future study. In our model, while CSDs were always associated with loss of righting reflex, frequent occurrence was recorded.

### What causes intracerebral bleeding after thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke? Recent insights into mechanisms and potential biomarkers [^116PGdK1]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

The overall population benefit of intravascular recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) on functional outcomes in ischaemic stroke is clear. However, some treated patients are harmed by early symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Although several clinical and radiological factors increase the risk of rtPA-related ICH, none of the currently available risk prediction tools are yet useful for practical clinical decision-making, probably reflecting our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Finding new methods to identify patients at the highest risk of rtPA-related ICH, or new measures to limit risk, are urgent challenges in acute stroke therapy research. In this article, we focus on the potential underlying mechanisms of rtPA-related ICH, highlight promising candidate risk biomarkers, and suggest future research directions.

### Current diagnostic approaches to subarachnoid haemorrhage [^1169HZgY]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the field of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Prompt diagnosis with high-resolution CT and intensive critical care support remain key aspects of good patient management. Early identification and definitive treatment of underlying ruptured aneurysms are generally advocated to reduce the risk of re-bleeding, a complication with high mortality and morbidity. Although intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is still considered the gold standard for sourcing aneurysms, CT angiography, especially with the evolution of multi-slice technology, is slowly gaining acceptance as a rapid, accessible, and minimally invasive method which appears likely to replace DSA as the first-line modality in the future.

Furthermore, the advent of Guglielmi detachable coils and the ISAT trial has revolutionised the treatment of ruptured aneurysms, with a significant trend towards endovascular coiling away from operative clipping. Improvements in clinical experience, coiling technology, and assistive devices now allow interventionalists to potentially treat the majority of aneurysms, including wide-necked or complex lesions. The uncertain long-term results of coiling, however, still fuel strong debate and controversy. This review summarises diagnostic approaches to SAH from a radiological perspective, with an emphasis on aneurysmal SAH and an evidence-based approach to the role of imaging and interventional radiology in diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

### A causal classification system for intracerebral hemorrhage subtypes [^117VqBoM]. Annals of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Every patient is scored in each of the main intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) categories according to the level of diagnostic evidence: (1) well-defined ICH subtype, (2) possible underlying disease, and (0) absence of evidence of the disease that may have caused ICH. Clinical and imaging criteria to define well-defined ICH subtypes are pre-specified. When available, validated diagnostic criteria, such as the modified Boston criteria for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), are used. The level of diagnostic evidence is considered "possible" in patients who have imaging markers or clues suggesting the presence of an underlying disease without enough criteria for a "well-defined" ICH subtype. When a patient cannot be scored in an ICH category because etiological investigations are insufficient, a score of (9) for insufficient work-up is given.

Results

- **Meta-analysis**: Figure 1 A through 1 D shows the results of the meta-analyses. All the studies individually show a nonsignificant trend towards a favorable outcome with surgery. Figure 1 A shows that the combined result from the meta-analysis of the spontaneous ICH trials gives an overall odds ratio (OR) of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.70–1.09; P = 0.23). Figure 1 B shows that for traumatic ICH, the OR is 0.57 (95% CI, 0.31–1.08; P = 0.09). Figures 1 C and 1 D present the subgroup analyses looking at the three bands of the GCS. There is a wide variation in the ORs observed for the GCS band 3 to 8, with the results dominated by STICH showing no treatment effect. For the GCS band 13 to 15 (the most conscious patients), the results are similar between the two studies, giving a combined OR of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.68–1.23; P = 0.56). For the intermediate GCS band 9 to 12, both studies give similar results, with the combined OR for the spontaneous studies at 0.70 (95% CI, 0.48–1.03; P = 0.07). In traumatic ICH, there is a tendency for improved outcome with surgery in both GCS band 3 to 8 (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.11–2.38; P = 0.38]) and GCS 9 to 12 band (OR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.18–1.26; P = 0.14]), but again no treatment effect in GCS band 13 to 15.

Regarding medical management for intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically concerning blood pressure management, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering the following aspects for adult patients with spontaneous minor or moderate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with a hematoma volume of less than 30 mL:

- **Initiate antihypertensive treatment early**: Ideally within the first 2 hours following the onset of symptoms (acute phase).

- **Lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to less than 140 mmHg**: Minimize variability in blood pressure fluctuations.

- **Maintain SBP below the target threshold**: Keep it at less than 140 mmHg for up to 7 days (sub-acute phase).

- **Continue blood pressure management for secondary prevention**: Aim for a target value of ≤ 130/80 mmHg after the sub-acute phase (Expert opinion).

### Intracerebral hemorrhage location and outcome among INTERACT2 participants [^114yoHSM]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The prognosis for recovery from acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is strongly related to several radiologic criteria, including hematoma volume and the degree of extension of blood into the ventricles and the subarachnoid space. Infratentorial location of ICH also predicts a higher likelihood of death or dependency. However, the relationship between specific locations of supratentorial ICH and outcome is poorly understood due in part to varying designs and definitions across studies. We examined associations of ICH location with clinical outcomes among participants of the main phase Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2).

### Acute hypertension in intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathophysiology and treatment [^1169TYRE]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic or spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is defined as intraparenchymal bleeding with or without extension into the ventricles and rarely into the subarachnoid space. Primary ICH, in most cases, is associated with chronic hypertension. Acute hypertension is linked to hematoma expansion and poor neurological outcomes. The treatment of hypertension in acute ICH is a topic of controversy.

Experiments have demonstrated an area of ischemia around the hematoma, with a reduction of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to compression of microvasculature. However, not all scientific results concur with these findings. Recent studies have shown that CBF decreases in the perihematoma region but with a concomitant reduction in cerebral metabolism, arguing against an area of ischemia in the perihematoma region. Based on these results, several clinical trials have investigated clinical outcomes and decreases in hematoma expansion rates with reduction of blood pressure acutely after ICH.

The parameters for blood pressure control are still under investigation. The American Heart Association has put forward guidelines for blood pressure control, which have been adopted in centers around the country. We have described the protocol we use at our center for blood pressure control in patients with acute ICH.

### Redefining hematoma expansion with the inclusion of intraventricular hemorrhage growth [^114v9tyC]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Definitions of significant hematoma expansion traditionally focus on changes in intraparenchymal volume. The presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a predictor of poor outcome, yet definitions of hematoma expansion do not include IVH expansion. We evaluated whether including IVH expansion in definitions of hematoma expansion improves the ability to predict 90-day outcomes.

Using data from the PREDICT-ICH study (Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT), we compared a standard definition of hematoma expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33%) with revised definitions that include new IVH development or expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% or any IVH; ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% or IVH expansion ≥ 1 mL). The primary outcome was poor clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 4–6) at 90 days. Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for each definition, and C statistics for each definition were compared using nonparametric methods.

Of the 256 patients eligible for primary analysis, 127 (49.6%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6. Sensitivity and specificity for the standard definition (n = 80) were 45.7% (95% CI, 36.8–54.7) and 82.9% (95% CI, 75.3–88.9), respectively. The revised definition, ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% or any IVH (n = 113), possessed a sensitivity of 63.8% (95% CI, 54.8–72.1) and a specificity of 75.2% (95% CI, 66.8–82.4). Overall accuracy was significantly improved with the revised definition (P = 0.013) and, after adjusting for relevant covariates, was associated with a 2.55-fold increased odds.

### Chronic subdural haematoma mimicking extrapyramidal symptoms [^1176jWWn]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The presentation of chronic subdural haematoma (SDH) can vary from no symptoms to decreased memory, confusion, weakness, or numbness of the arms, legs, and face, as well as difficulty in speech and walking. Movement disorders such as Parkinsonism can also be associated with SDH. Elderly people with subacute progressive Parkinsonism should therefore undergo CT studies to differentiate it from primary Parkinsonism.

The aetiology of chronic SDH includes head injury, subdural effusion, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and spontaneous intracranial hypotension, especially in young to middle-aged patients, even without preceding trauma or haematological disorders.

Surgery is the best treatment option for chronic SDH involving moderate-to-large haematoma with accompanying neurological deficits. The ideal treatment strategy should be tailored to the individual patient's condition. Careful supportive treatment can be considered if it is well tolerated.

In the present case, SDH was not diagnosed at our initial impression due to the lack of neurological deficits and trauma history. A patient with SDH may also initially present withdrawn behaviour, absence of speech, apathy, blunted affect, and poor self-care, which may be thought to be manifestations of psychosis. Moreover, in many cases of chronic SDH, reversible Parkinson-like symptoms are the acute presenting feature. These symptoms may be misleading in patients with underlying psychiatric disorders who are taking antipsychotic medication.

Because such movement disturbances are a common concern in patients who use antipsychotics…

### Sensitivity of computed tomography performed within six hours of onset of headache for diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage: prospective cohort study [^112dWmrg]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

With an extremely high sensitivity when performed within six hours, an early unenhanced computed tomography can be considered a "rule out" test for subarachnoid haemorrhage. This observation challenges the dogma of performing a lumbar puncture in all patients despite a negative result on computed tomography. The strength of this conclusion necessarily hinges on the final outcomes of a small number of patients lost to follow-up. While we did achieve a high degree of certainty in our outcome classification, nearly 2% of patients were lost to all active follow-up at six months. Our study sites included the regional neurosurgical referral centres and would have identified any subsequent non-fatal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Moreover, nearly three quarters of patients who could not be contacted at six months were known to be alive and free from subarachnoid haemorrhage at least one month after the initial visit, a time within which most patients with a missed sentinel bleed or small subarachnoid haemorrhage would experience a re-bleed.

- **Limitations**: Our planned follow-up procedure failed to identify a single case of missed subarachnoid haemorrhage resulting in death or diagnosed on a subsequent unscheduled visit. We recognise that such cases do occur and might be more common in smaller community hospitals (not represented in this study) where access to computed tomography imaging and to specialists is difficult. Even if we adopt a highly conservative view that a quarter of our patients lost to all follow-up could have experienced a subarachnoid haemorrhage, diagnosed and treated in

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral hemorrhage, particularly concerning indications for surgery and intraventricular hemorrhage, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering the performance of external ventricular drainage with intraventricular thrombolysis. This is advised for patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and intraventricular extension to reduce mortality, while recognizing the uncertainty regarding the balance of beneficial and adverse effects on death, dependence, and shunt dependence.

### Microelectrode recording and hemorrhage in functional neurosurgery: a comparative analysis in a consecutive series of 645 procedures [^114gtuCX]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Functional stereotactic neurosurgery, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) and radiofrequency lesioning, is well established and widely used for the treatment of movement disorders and various other neurological and psychiatric diseases. Although these procedures are considered relatively safe, intracranial hemorrhage resulting in permanent neurological deficits may occur in 1%-3% of patients. Microelectrode recording (MER) has been recognized as a valuable tool for refining the final target in functional stereotactic neurosurgery. Moreover, MER provides insight into the underlying neurophysiological pathomechanisms of movement disorders and other diseases. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing controversy on whether MER increases the risk of hemorrhage. The authors aimed to compare the risk of hemorrhage in functional stereotactic neurosurgical procedures with regard to the use of MER.

The authors performed a comparative analysis on a consecutive series of 645 functional neurosurgery procedures, including 624 DBS surgeries and 21 radiofrequency lesionings, to evaluate whether the use of MER would increase the risk of hemorrhage. MER was performed in 396 procedures, while no MER was used in 249 cases. The MER technique involved the use of a guiding cannula and a single trajectory when feasible. Postoperative CT scans were obtained within 24 hours after surgery in all patients and screened for the presence of hemorrhage.

Twenty-one intracranial hemorrhages were detected on the postoperative CT scans (3.2%). Of the 21 in

### A causal classification system for intracerebral hemorrhage subtypes [^115EQ7FP]. Annals of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

The new classification system is an imaging-based classification for ICH etiology (or etiologies) using validated neuroimaging biomarkers of small vessel and macrovascular pathologies, rather than risk factors such as oral anticoagulants. Oral anticoagulants are considered an important risk factor for ICH but not a direct cause.

The classification system is comprehensive and applies to all subtypes of spontaneous (i.e. nontraumatic) ICH. It is crucial to distinguish from ischemic stroke (brain imaging) and traumatic ICH, which involves major head trauma occurring within 24 hours of symptom onset, causing loss of consciousness and thought to be sufficient to have caused the intracerebral bleeding.

- **Known causes of ICH**: The subgroups of the classification system include the main known causes of ICH, recognizing that SVD and structural macrovascular lesions are predominant causes.
- **Pathogenesis and prognosis**: The classification system is based on the premise that pathogenesis, prognosis, or both differ by ICH subtypes, potentially affecting management strategies.
- **Multiple potential causes**: The system also acknowledges that patients can have multiple potential causes of ICH, particularly presumed "mixed" small vessel disease (e.g. arteriolosclerosis/CAA combination). Rather than selecting only the single most likely cause of ICH, which may be subjective, the classification allows for overlap between ICH subtypes.
- **Diagnostic certainty**: When identifying ICH subtypes, various factors might affect the level of diagnostic certainty.

### Acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraparenchymal hematoma caused by rupture of a posterior communicating artery aneurysm: Case report and review of the literature [^113fp5p4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage or intraparenchymal hematoma is rare. We report on a 47-year-old woman without previous trauma who presented with an acute subdural hematoma without subarachnoid hemorrhage. The hematoma was evacuated immediately. Further evaluation with cerebral four-vessel angiography revealed a left-sided posterior communicating artery aneurysm that was occluded by endovascular embolization. The patient recovered without neurological deficit.

Ruptured intracranial aneurysm should be considered as a cause of nontraumatic subdural hematoma. Immediate subdural hematoma removal after aneurysm coiling can be performed in such patients, even those in poor neurological condition.

### Surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage [^115jouw3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

The main goal of this review was to assess the benefits and harms of surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Data on good functional outcomes were extracted from 20 studies, with 19 of these being included in the primary analysis. Data on all-cause mortality were extracted from 23 studies. The thirty-day case fatality rate was less consistently reported and was available in only half of the studies. Data on health-related quality of life were sparse, with only three studies available for analysis. Most studies included in the review did not contribute to this outcome.

The authors of both included and excluded studies were helpful in providing unpublished data. As a result, this review presents a considerable quantity of unpublished data and clarification of methods, which has contributed to the completeness of the evidence.

Regarding surgical interventions for intracerebral haemorrhage, more specifically with respect to indications for surgery and supratentorial haemorrhage, the EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend considering minimally invasive evacuation of the hematoma within 24 hours after spontaneous supratentorial ICH onset to reduce mortality and improve functional outcomes in adult patients with lobar ICH. Offer patients with deep hematomas enrollment in ongoing RCTs.

### Recurrent migraine aura-like symptoms in an elderly woman: Symptomatic cortical spreading depression [^114tMdJd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has been directly observed in humans with malignant stroke, traumatic brain injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage and is also considered to be the correlate of migraine aura. We report on a 76-year-old woman with new-onset episodes of headache, paraesthesia, hemiparesis, and dysarthria, in whom a small cortical subarachnoid hemorrhage was diagnosed with MRI. Repeated diffusion-weighted MRI scans shortly after transient focal neurological episodes, as well as diagnostic workup, were normal, which makes transient ischemic attacks unlikely. Ictal electroencephalogram recordings showed no epileptic activity. Long-term follow-up revealed a diagnosis of probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We propose that CSD could be a pathophysiological correlate of transient focal neurological deficits in patients with cortical bleeding.

### Parkinsonism secondary to subdural haematoma [^115N1uMx]. Neurosurgical Review (2012). Low credibility.

Parkinsonism consists of several extrapyramidal signs characterized by tremor, muscle rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes. The most common cause of parkinsonism is idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whereas the secondary forms include drug exposure, trauma, infection, and chronic subdural haematomas. Four patients with parkinsonism out of 1,289 chronic subdural haematomas were admitted to our hospital between 1985 and 2010, while nineteen patients identified in the literature were also included in this revision. Of the 23 cases reviewed (19 men and 4 women; age at diagnosis ranged between 38 and 83 years; mean, 68.8), the interval between initial symptoms and haematoma diagnosis ranged between 1 week and 1 year (mean interval, 8 weeks). The haematoma was unilateral in 13 cases and bilateral in 10 cases. All chronic subdural haematomas were resolved using different surgical techniques, with marked improvement following surgery.

Parkinsonism is a rare presentation of chronic subdural haematoma. However, the sudden onset of parkinsonisms requires prompt neuroimaging to rule out this potentially reversible aetiology. The prognosis of chronic subdural haematoma-related parkinsonism is favourable after surgical evacuation.

### The location of intraparenchymal bleeding determines functional outcome after spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116sxA6L]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. A higher blood burden and the presence of intraparenchymal extension of the bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH]) are well-known predictors of poor outcome. Few studies have addressed the role of hematoma location on a patient's functional outcome. The main aims were to compare clinical and radiographic characteristics between SAH patients with and without ICH and to compare different ICH localizations in relation to long-term functional outcomes.

We prospectively collected data on 280 consecutive SAH patients (aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal) admitted to a tertiary care hospital between 2010 and 2017 and assessed the initial computed tomography scans of the brain acquired after intensive care unit admission. Poor functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score > 2, 3 months after SAH. We used multivariable logistic linear regression to investigate associations between ICH location and clinical variables as well as functional outcomes.

Intraparenchymal extension of the hemorrhage was observed in 59/280 patients (21%). The median (interquartile range) ICH volume was 11.3 (4.9–16.2) ml, and the location was supratentorial in 55/59 patients (93%). Most parenchymal hemorrhages were located in the frontal (n = 24, 41%) and temporal lobes (n = 12, 21%), followed by insular ICH (n = 7, 12%), corpus callosum (n = 6, 10%), parietal (n = 2, 3%), and occipital locations (n = 2, 3%). Among SAH patients with ICH, those with…

### Intracerebral haemorrhage: Mechanisms of injury and therapeutic targets [^116sEgAL]. The Lancet Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for about 10–15% of all strokes and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. No successful phase 3 clinical trials for this disorder have been completed. In the past six years, the number of preclinical and clinical studies focused on intracerebral haemorrhage has risen. Important advances have been made in animal models of this disorder and in our understanding of mechanisms underlying brain injury after haemorrhage. Several therapeutic targets have subsequently been identified that are now being pursued in clinical trials. Many clinical trials have been based on limited preclinical data, and guidelines to justify taking preclinical results to the clinic are needed.

### Intracerebral hemorrhage outcome: A comprehensive update [^1172CDvE]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2019). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with a significant global burden of disease. Despite being proportionally less frequent than ischemic stroke, in 2010 it was associated with greater worldwide disability-adjusted life years lost. The focus of outcome assessment after ICH has been mortality in most studies because of the high early case fatality, which reaches 40% in some population-based studies.

The most robust and consistent predictors of early mortality include age, severity of neurological impairment, hemorrhage volume, and antithrombotic therapy at the time of the event. Long-term outcome assessment is multifaceted and includes not only mortality and functional outcome, but also patient self-assessment of health-related quality of life, occurrence of cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, epileptic seizures, re-ICH, and subsequent thromboembolic events.

Several scores that predict mortality and functional outcome after ICH have been validated and are useful in daily clinical practice. However, they must be used in combination with clinical judgment for individualized patients. Management of patients with ICH, both in the acute and chronic phases, requires healthcare professionals to have a comprehensive and updated perspective on outcomes. This informs decisions that need to be taken together with the patient and next of kin.

### Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and the challenge of surgical decision making: A review [^114qzU95]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Decision making for patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses several challenges. Outcomes in this patient population are generally poor, prognostication is often uncertain, and treatment strategies offer limited benefits. Studies demonstrate variability in the type and intensity of treatment offered, attributed to clinical uncertainty and habits of training. Research has focused on new techniques and more stringent evidence-based selection criteria to improve outcomes and produce consensus around treatment strategies for patients with ICH. Such focus, however, offers little description of how ICH treatment decisions are made and how such decisions reflect patient preferences regarding medical care.

A growing body of literature suggests that the process of decision making in ICH is laden with bias, value assumptions, and subjective impressions.

- **Geography and cognitive biases**: These factors can shape decision making and the selection of treatment.

- **Patient perceptions and physician characteristics**: Such factors often serve as a barrier to providing patient-centered medical care.

In this article, the authors review how surgical decision making for patients with ICH is shaped by these decisional factors and suggest future research pathways to study decision making in ICH. Such research efforts are important for establishing quality guidelines and pay-for-performance measures that reflect the preferences of individual patients and the contextual nature of medical decision making.

### Subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhages in lobar intracerebral hemorrhage associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy [^117NsCJY]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Identifying underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has important clinical implications. Convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) and subdural hemorrhage (SDH) are computed tomography features of CAA-related ICH. This study explored whether cSAH and SDH could be additional magnetic resonance imaging markers of CAA in lobar ICH survivors.

Methods: Data from consecutive patients with acute lobar ICH associated with CAA (CAA-ICH) or not attributed to CAA (non-CAA-ICH) were analyzed. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined for cSAH, SDH, and markers of small vessel disease. The associations of cSAH and SDH with the diagnosis of probable CAA based on the modified Boston criteria were explored using multivariable models.

Results: The study included 165 patients with acute lobar ICH (mean age 70 ± 13 years): 72 patients with CAA-ICH and 93 with non-CAA-ICH. Patients with CAA-ICH had a higher prevalence of cSAH (73.6% versus 39.8%; P < 0.001) and SDH (37.5% versus 21.5%; P = 0.02) than non-CAA-ICH. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of cSAH was independently associated with CAA-ICH (odds ratio, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.26–6.99; P = 0.013), whereas there was no association between SDH and CAA-ICH.

Conclusions: Among survivors of acute lobar ICH, the presence of cSAH is associated with the magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis of CAA. Further studies should investigate whether cSAH can help improve the sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging for in vivo diagnosis of CAA.

### Pseudosubarachnoid haemorrhage in subdural haematoma [^111iieQz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Two patients with large bilateral subdural haematomas presented with patterns on non-enhanced brain computed tomography (CT) that falsely suggested coexistent subarachnoid haemorrhage. The CT images showed marked effacement of the basal cisterns with hyperdense signals along the tentorium, sylvian fissure, and the perimesencephalic cisterns. In both cases, the suspicion of subarachnoid haemorrhage led to the performance of angiographic studies to rule out vascular lesions. Recognition of this radiological feature is important to avoid unnecessary testing and treatment delay.
