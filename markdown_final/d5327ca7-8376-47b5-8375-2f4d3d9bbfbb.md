## Question

What is the significance of a fibrinogen level of 600 with normal coagulation studies in gestational thrombocytopenia when no hemolysis is occurring?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a fibrinogen level of 600 mg/dL (6.0 g/L) with normal coagulation studies means in gestational thrombocytopenia when no hemolysis is occurring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about unit conversion and pregnancy-specific reference ranges for fibrinogen. Then, I should verify how gestational thrombocytopenia typically presents with respect to coagulation parameters. Next, I will assess whether this pattern argues for or against disseminated intravascular coagulation or HELLP. After that, I will consider the hemostatic balance of pregnancy and whether elevated fibrinogen is physiologic or pathologic. Finally, I will translate this into management implications, including labor anesthesia considerations and postpartum hemorrhage thresholds, and explore special scenarios like preeclampsia and PPH risk prediction.

> Let me first confirm the unit conversion and baseline context. A fibrinogen level reported as 600 mg/dL does indeed equal 6.0 g/L, and in pregnancy fibrinogen rises progressively with gestational age, peaking in the third trimester, so I need to anchor interpretation to pregnancy-adapted intervals rather than nonpregnant ranges [^115DbTYD]. Wait, let me verify the late pregnancy range: normal fibrinogen around delivery is commonly cited as approximately 3.5–6.5 g/L, which would make 6.0 g/L near the upper end of physiologic for term gestation rather than abnormal [^115DbTYD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm trimester-specific references. Cross-sectional cohort data show fibrinogen increases steadily across trimesters, with the highest values in the third trimester, consistent with the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy, so a value of 6.0 g/L in late pregnancy falls within expected physiology rather than indicating an acute-phase abnormality by itself [^115DbTYD]. I should double-check that these pregnancy-adapted references supersede nonpregnant lab ranges, which are typically lower and thus can mislead interpretation during gestation [^113Af2kf].

> Next, I will now examine the context of gestational thrombocytopenia. Let me think about the typical laboratory profile: gestational thrombocytopenia usually presents in late pregnancy with mild thrombocytopenia, often with platelets above 70–100 × 10^9/L, and with otherwise normal coagulation screening including PT and aPTT, without hemolysis or organ dysfunction, which distinguishes it from HELLP and DIC patterns in most cases [^113hufDC]. I need to ensure the normal PT/aPTT in this scenario fits that benign profile, which it does, supporting a physiologic rather than pathologic process [^113hufDC].

> But wait, what if this is an atypical consumptive coagulopathy? I should review DIC criteria and HELLP features to avoid premature closure. The ISTH DIC scoring system weights platelet count, PT prolongation, fibrin-related markers, and hypofibrinogenemia, with fibrinogen ≤ 1 g/L contributing to DIC scoring, so a fibrinogen of 6.0 g/L with normal PT/aPTT argues strongly against DIC in this presentation [^117AYd2c]. Moreover, DIC replacement guidance emphasizes fibrinogen supplementation only when levels are severely reduced, typically < 1–1.5 g/L in actively bleeding patients after FFP, which is the opposite of the current finding, further arguing against DIC here [^113358Ck] [^111Q1fAh]. For HELLP, I should confirm there is hemolysis and elevated liver enzymes; the absence of hemolysis and normal coagulation screening is not consistent with HELLP-associated coagulopathy, which can feature thrombocytopenia and consumptive changes when severe [^116sfHeN] [^112CJSTX].

> I need to consider the hemostatic balance of pregnancy to reconcile elevated fibrinogen with low platelets. Pregnancy enhances procoagulant drivers including fibrinogen, factors VII, VIII, X, and vWF, and concurrently suppresses fibrinolysis; this shift contributes to robust thrombin generation and fibrin formation, which can offset mild platelet reductions typical of gestational thrombocytopenia, maintaining adequate clot formation despite lower platelet counts [^112GWr9G] [^114J6Lvb] [^115DbTYD]. Hold on, I should verify that this pattern is physiologic rather than an inflammatory acute-phase rise; longitudinal pregnancy studies show fibrinogen rises with gestation and falls postpartum, consistent with normal adaptation rather than pathology in uncomplicated pregnancies [^114RMZ9y].

> Now, let me translate this into clinical significance and management. A fibrinogen of 6.0 g/L in late pregnancy is physiologic and, if anything, protective from a hemostatic standpoint, so no fibrinogen-specific intervention is indicated, and the management focus remains routine obstetric care with periodic platelet monitoring and delivery planning tailored to platelet count trends, not to fibrinogen reduction or replacement needs [^115DbTYD]. I should confirm anesthesia implications: neuraxial anesthesia decisions are primarily platelet-count based in this context and generally consider thresholds around 70–100 × 10^9/L rather than fibrinogen levels, with individualized risk assessment by anesthesia and obstetrics teams, aligning with obstetric coagulation reviews [^113hufDC]. If hemorrhage occurs, guidance emphasizes measuring fibrinogen during PPH and treating only when levels fall, typically intervening below 2 g/L, which is far from the current value [^111SDX28] [^113TjWmp].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could elevated fibrinogen signal heightened thrombotic risk that changes management now. Elevated fibrinogen is an epidemiologic risk factor for VTE in general populations, but in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy with gestational thrombocytopenia and no other risk factors, this isolated laboratory finding does not mandate antepartum anticoagulation; vigilance for standard obstetric VTE risk factors remains the priority, particularly in the postpartum period [^114ML3ue].

> I should also review special scenarios. If postpartum hemorrhage develops, maintaining fibrinogen above 2 g/L is associated with better hemostasis, and multiple guidelines advise replacement only when levels drop below about 2 g/L or when viscoelastic thresholds indicate low functional fibrin polymerization, meaning a predelivery level of 6.0 g/L provides a substantial safety margin without requiring preemptive treatment [^111SDX28] [^113TjWmp] [^111WoboX]. Let me reconsider preeclampsia risk inference: pooled data suggest fibrinogen levels are not consistently different between preeclampsia and normotensive pregnancies, so a high-normal fibrinogen does not predict preeclampsia, and clinical surveillance should be guided by blood pressure, proteinuria, and organ dysfunction rather than fibrinogen alone [^111Z11JE].

> Final check before concluding: the combination of late-pregnancy-range fibrinogen at 6.0 g/L, normal PT/aPTT, and isolated mild thrombocytopenia fits physiologic gestational adaptation and benign gestational thrombocytopenia, not DIC or HELLP, and warrants no fibrinogen-directed therapy; routine monitoring and standard delivery planning are appropriate, with hemostatic escalation only if bleeding develops and fibrinogen falls toward guideline thresholds [^115DbTYD] [^117AYd2c] [^113358Ck].

In gestational thrombocytopenia, **fibrinogen ~600 mg/dL is a normal pregnancy finding** [^115DbTYD] and reflects the physiologic hypercoagulable state [^111WoboX]; it does not indicate pathology or increased bleeding risk [^111WoboX]. Normal PT/aPTT confirm **no coagulopathy**, and the absence of hemolysis supports the benign diagnosis. No additional testing or intervention is needed; monitor platelets and proceed with standard obstetric care.

---

## Physiological changes in fibrinogen during pregnancy

Fibrinogen rises in pregnancy [^115DbTYD] [^114RMZ9y], increasing progressively and often reaching **400–600 mg/dL** [^111WoboX] or higher by the third trimester as part of the normal hypercoagulable state [^111Z11JE] [^113Af2kf]. As an **acute-phase reactant**, its elevation in uncomplicated pregnancy is physiologic rather than a marker of pathology.

---

## Clinical significance of elevated fibrinogen in gestational thrombocytopenia

- **Benign context**: In GT, elevated fibrinogen with normal PT/aPTT and no hemolysis is expected and reflects normal pregnancy physiology [^115DbTYD].

- **No coagulopathy**: Normal PT/aPTT indicate intact coagulation; elevated fibrinogen alone does not signal DIC or other coagulopathies [^117AYd2c] [^111Q1fAh].

- **No bleeding risk**: Elevated fibrinogen in this setting does not increase bleeding risk and does not require intervention.

---

## Clinical management implications

- **No intervention needed**: Elevated fibrinogen alone in GT does not require treatment or further testing.

- **Routine monitoring**: Continue standard obstetric care with periodic platelet counts; no special coagulation monitoring is needed.

- **Reassure patient**: Explain that elevated fibrinogen is a normal pregnancy change and not a concern.

## Summary table: clinical significance of elevated fibrinogen in gestational thrombocytopenia

| **Parameter** | **Clinical significance** | **Management implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Elevated fibrinogen (~600 mg/dL) | Normal pregnancy finding | No intervention required |
| Normal PT/aPTT | No coagulopathy | Routine monitoring |
| No hemolysis | Benign GT | Standard obstetric care |

---

Elevated fibrinogen (~600 mg/dL) with normal PT/aPTT and no hemolysis in gestational thrombocytopenia is a normal pregnancy finding [^115DbTYD]. No intervention is required, and **standard obstetric care** should continue.

### Fibrinogen and high molecular weight fibrinogen during and after normal pregnancy [^114RMZ9y]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Pregnancy has recently been described as a generalized intravascular inflammatory response to the conceptus. Total fibrinogen concentrations increase during pregnancy. The percentage of high molecular weight fibrinogen (HMW-Fg) of the total fibrinogen concentration is known to increase during acute-phase conditions like inflammation. Therefore, we investigated whether the percentage of high molecular weight fibrinogen increases during normal pregnancy.

- **Materials and methods**: Eighteen healthy nulliparous women with uncomplicated pregnancies with normal course and outcome participated in this study. Five blood samples were drawn from every woman in the gestational age periods 9 to 16, 17 to 24, 25 to 33, and 34 to 42 weeks, and at 12 to 20 weeks after delivery. Total fibrinogen concentrations were determined according to Clauss, and the percentage of high molecular weight fibrinogen was assessed by SDS-electrophoresis and densitometry after isolation of fibrinogen by precipitation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between gestational age periods, and correlation coefficients were calculated by Pearson's method.

- **Results**: Total fibrinogen concentrations increased with advancing gestational age and decreased after delivery. The percentage of high molecular weight fibrinogen of the total fibrinogen remained unaltered during and after pregnancy.

- **Conclusions**: During normal pregnancy, there is an increase in total fibrinogen concentrations with advancing gestational age, without a rise in the percentage of high molecular weight fibrinogen. After delivery, total fibrinogen concentrations decrease.

### Haemostatic support in postpartum haemorrhage: A review of the literature and expert opinion [^111WoboX]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2023). Low credibility.

Fibrinogen levels are recognized as a predictive marker of severe postpartum haemorrhage (PPH). Normal fibrinogen levels at delivery range from 3.5 to 6.5 g/L, which is significantly higher than in nonpregnant women (2.0–4.5 g/L). In PPH, similar to other types of massive haemorrhage, fibrinogen plasma levels fall below the normal range for pregnancy sooner than other coagulation factors, decreasing proportionately with blood loss.

Clinically significant low fibrinogen levels during delivery or early postpartum, specifically below 2 g/L, have been identified as a good predictive marker of progression to severe PPH. However, the exact threshold for intervention to replace fibrinogen remains unclear, although maintaining fibrinogen levels above 2 g/L appears adequate for haemostasis during PPH. Monitoring fibrinogen levels during delivery is therefore vital; however, the benefit of measuring predelivery fibrinogen is uncertain.

Lower antepartum fibrinogen levels have been identified in some women who later developed severe PPH and bleeding complications, yet the differences may not be substantial enough for establishing clinically meaningful threshold values. Conversely, another study found antepartum fibrinogen levels to be a poor predictor of PPH. Blood samples are typically taken at 32–38 weeks' gestation, but this may be too early to yield meaningful results since fibrinogen may still be increasing as part of the normal haemostatic process.

The evidence suggesting that low fibrinogen levels predict PPH is possibly too weak to justify routine testing for all patients; such testing could also lead to increased medical intervention.

### Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and coagulation: A dual risk of hypercoagulability and bleeding [^115omNwG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

A multidisciplinary approach should be adopted in the management of ICP patients. In particular, patients with high fibrinogen and D-dimer levels should be closely monitored for thromboembolic risk in the postpartum period, and anticoagulant prophylaxis should be administered when necessary. In addition, close follow-up of the patient throughout pregnancy is necessary to minimize the risk of bleeding. While the findings of this study provide an important contribution to understanding the hematological and perinatal effects of ICP, they also indicate the need for future large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled studies. Further studies examining the effects of factors such as genetic predisposition, inflammation, and endothelial function on the coagulation dynamics of ICP will help in the development of new strategies for better management of this disease.

In conclusion, early diagnosis, appropriate follow-up, and the implementation of individualized management plans are highly important for preventing hematological and perinatal complications in pregnant women with gestational cholestasis. This study demonstrated once again that ICP should be considered a systemic disease that is not limited to pruritus and liver dysfunction.

### When to suspect hypercoagulability and how to investigate it [^114H3e3w]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The authors summarize the knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, including both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. The list of genetic defects predisposing carriers to develop thrombosis has increased significantly in recent years, along with the available assays to test for them. As a result, hypercoagulability has become a subject of much discussion. This review highlights the issues concerning hypercoagulability that pathologists, who are not specialists in coagulation, should be familiar with in order to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to diagnosing this newly described group of disorders will ensure more cost-effective and efficient care for patients at risk.

### Fibrinogen for the prediction of severe maternal complications in placental abruption with fetal death after 24 weeks of gestation [^114T3tta]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Low credibility.

We raise several limitations to our study. The number of cases in our series is fairly small, as we sought to exclude, by strict inclusion criteria, cases in which the diagnosis of placental abruption was not certain. However, to our knowledge, this study represents one of the largest series reported in the medical literature for this specific condition. The sample size limited the interpretation of our results and the achievement of a multivariate analysis. A multivariate analysis of a larger series would have allowed us to consider the timing between diagnosis and delivery as a predictable variable of adverse outcomes. In fact, it has been reported that a long delay between diagnosis and delivery would increase the risk of maternal hemorrhage. Although the use of fibrinogen assay alone for the prediction of adverse maternal outcomes is insufficient, our results emphasize the need to repeat blood sampling, as laboratory indicators were worse at the time of delivery compared to those measured at admission. Indeed, obstetricians need to consider each clinical situation as a whole and consider fibrinogen level as an aid to decision-making, not as a decisive element per se. Nonetheless, this work is the first to suggest a prognostic marker for the subsequent course, and our series was large enough to show that the fibrinogen level is an interesting marker for predicting maternal complications (area under the curve fibrinogen at admission 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–0.97). The diagnostic performance of fibrinogen was optimal for a fibrinogen threshold of 1.9 g/L (sensitivity and…).

### Fibrinogen and D-dimer protein levels in patients with preeclampsia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1129hVyj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a significant obstetric and global health concern associated with fetal growth restriction, poor placental perfusion, and maternal organ dysfunction. Early detection through simple, routine antenatal indicators is essential. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer (DD) levels in PE patients compared to normotensive pregnant women.

- **Methods**: Relevant articles were systematically identified through comprehensive searches across multiple databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Hinari. Utilizing Stata version 14.0, we employed a random-effects model to estimate the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistics and the Cochrane Q test, while subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Additionally, sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Egger's regression test and funnel plot were utilized to evaluate publication bias among the included studies.

- **Results**: In total, 31 articles involving 5,846 participants were included in this study. Among these, 2,938 were identified as patients with PE (664 severe PE, 619 mild PE, and 1,655 undefined PE), while 2,908 were normotensive pregnant mothers. The overall pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) for FIB and DD between PE and normotensive pregnant mothers were 0.26 (95% CI: -0.12–0.64, p = 0.18) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.43–1.18, p < 0.001), respectively.

### How I treat quantitative fibrinogen disorders [^1177qFxR]. Blood (2025). Low credibility.

Quantitative fibrinogen disorders, including afibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia, are defined by the complete absence or reduction of fibrinogen, respectively. The diagnosis is based on the measurement of fibrinogen activity and antigen levels, which define the severity of this monogenic disorder. Afibrinogenemia results from homozygosity or combined heterozygosity for the causative mutations, whereas monoallelic mutations lead to hypofibrinogenemia.

The bleeding phenotype varies according to fibrinogen levels, ranging generally from frequent and often life-threatening bleeding in afibrinogenemia to the absence of symptoms or mild bleeding symptoms in mild hypofibrinogenemia. The main treatment for quantitative fibrinogen disorders is fibrinogen supplementation. Despite low fibrinogen levels, a tendency for thrombosis is characteristic of these disorders and may be exacerbated by fibrinogen supplementation.

- **Management of surgery and pregnancy**: These present significant challenges concerning the amount of fibrinogen replacement and the need for thromboprophylaxis. The objective of this article is to present four clinical scenarios that illustrate common clinical challenges and propose strategies for managing bleeding, thrombosis, surgery, and pregnancy.

### Fibrinogen and D-dimer protein levels in patients with preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Z11JE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). High credibility.

D-dimer (DD) serves as a widely recognized biomarker in hemostasis, signifying the final degradation product of fibrin by plasmin. Its detection in plasma indirectly signals the activation of both coagulation and fibrinolysis. The levels of DD mirror the processes of fibrin polymerization and subsequent breakdown, with elevated concentrations in severe PE patients likely attributed to increased fibrin production. Furthermore, it stands as a standard test for ruling out venous thromboembolism.

Fibrinogen (FIB) serves as a substrate for three key enzymes: thrombin, plasmin, and factor XIIIa, and its functional interactions are diverse, making it pivotal in hemostasis. It acts as the soluble precursor to insoluble fibrin and aids in platelet aggregation. The formation of a fibrin clot triggers the fibrinolytic system, underscoring the importance of maintaining a balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis in determining clinical outcomes. Moreover, the plasma concentration of FIB in pregnant women is higher than in non-pregnant women, which might be due to the hypercoagulable state.

Accurate and timely identification of PE and the assessment of its severity are of utmost importance. Developing easily measurable predictive indicators during routine antenatal examinations is highly necessary to ensure early detection of PE and assess its severity. Prediction of PE development and decisions regarding its severity have posed challenges in the field of obstetrics. Several studies have investigated the levels of FIB and DD in individuals with PE, yielding conflicting results.

### Developmental hemostasis: The evolution of our coagulation system [^116T2WqU]. NeoReviews (2022). Low credibility.

Developmental hemostasis describes the evolution of the coagulation system from the neonatal period through adulthood. Neonates have lower levels of coagulation factors and elevated screening levels at birth. These levels can be influenced by various circumstances, including gestational age, labor effects, and clinical status.

The most commonly used screening tests for coagulopathy are prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen level. These values can be difficult to interpret as every laboratory has its own age-specific reference ranges. An understanding of developmental hemostasis is important when evaluating, diagnosing, and treating clinical manifestations, including vitamin K deficiency, surgical needs, infections, inherited thrombophilias, and inherited bleeding disorders.

The mainstay of treatment for bleeding or hemorrhage is platelet and fresh frozen plasma transfusions. For the treatment of thrombosis, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin are the two most commonly used anticoagulants in the neonatal setting.

### The D-dimer assay [^113CguKd]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

D-dimer is an indirect marker of fibrinolysis and fibrin turnover; this molecule exhibits unique properties as a biological marker of hemostatic abnormalities as well as an indicator of intravascular thrombosis. D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the systematic degradation of vascular thrombi through the fibrinolytic mechanism. Because of this, the D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in a number of clinical scenarios.

Most commonly, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for excluding the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and for monitoring other conditions in which the patient is at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Limitations of the assay include D-dimer elevation in a constellation of clinical scenarios (age, pregnancy, and cancer) and lack of clinical standardization.

### Levels of coagulation factors and venous thromboembolism [^114ML3ue]. Haematologica (2003). Low credibility.

Altered levels of coagulation factors have been included among the abnormalities that may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in otherwise healthy subjects.

- **Information sources**: According to the studies that have been carried to test this hypothesis, only elevated levels of factor VIII and fibrinogen emerged as independent risk factors for VTE.

- **State of the art and perspectives**: Although some data indicate that elevated levels of factor XI or IX are also determinants for VTE, this awaits confirmation.

### Fibrinogen and D-dimer protein levels in patients with preeclampsia: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Wwje7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis shed light on the fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer (DD) protein levels in patients with preeclampsia (PE) compared to normotensive pregnant mothers. While the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of FIB showed a minor increase among preeclamptic patients, this difference did not reach statistical significance (SMD: 0.26; 95% CI: −0.12 to 0.64, p = 0.18). Additionally, the non-significant difference in FIB levels highlights the need for continued investigation into the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic relevance of FIB in PE.

However, our analysis revealed a significant increase in the pooled SMD of DD among preeclamptic patients compared to normotensive pregnant mothers (SMD: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.18, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that elevated DD levels may serve as a potential biomarker for PE, highlighting the importance of further research to elucidate the role of FIB and DD in the pathophysiology and clinical management of this condition.

### Guideline No. 431: Postpartum hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock [^111SDX28]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for postpartum hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to coagulation monitoring, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend measuring fibrinogen levels in all patients with moderate-to-severe postpartum hemorrhage and replacing fibrinogen if the level is below 2 g/L.

### The fibrinogen/CRP ratio as a new parameter for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation in patients with HELLP syndrome and as a predictive factor for neonatal outcome [^113pDrZp]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine if the fibrinogen/C-reactive protein (CRP) ratio could be used in obstetrics as a predictor for disseminated intravascular coagulation.

One hundred eleven patients with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome at the Department of Obstetrics and Fetomaternal Medicine (General Hospital, Vienna, Austria) were selected and divided into two groups: overt disseminated intravascular coagulation, and no overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. The classical parameters and the fibrinogen/CRP ratio were compared. The analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS statistical package (SPSS, Inc, Cary, NC).

The fibrinogen/CRP ratio showed significant differences. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that the ratio (area under the curve, 0.74) had significantly better discriminative power than fibrinogen (area under the curve, 0.59). The odds ratio for the fibrinogen/CRP ratio was 7.04. Finally, significant correlations between the ratio and the neonatal outcome were found.

We suggest the implementation of the fibrinogen/CRP ratio within patients with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome as a diagnostic and prognostic factor for the occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Laboratory testing for fibrinogen abnormalities [^113H1yJx]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Fibrinogen is essential for the formation of a fibrin clot. Acquired and congenital disorders of fibrinogen may result in decreased concentration or altered function of fibrinogen, often leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Routine coagulation testing and specialized laboratory investigations can guide diagnosis in patients suspected of having a fibrinogen abnormality. This article summarizes the types of laboratory assays that are used to assess fibrinogen disorders, and key abnormalities found in different types of fibrinogen disorders.

### Point-of-care fibrinogen testing in pregnancy [^11689K8y]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Low credibility.

Agreement between estimated fibrinogen concentration via thromboelastography and traditional assays is not established in the parturient. We therefore recruited 56 parturients and performed Clauss and functional fibrinogen level (FLEV) tests. The mean difference of measurements was 36.8 mg/dL (95% CI, 21.8–51.9) with a standard deviation of 52.8 mg/dL. Calculated limits of agreement were 140.2 mg/dL (95% CI, 166.3–114.6) and -66.6 mg/dL (95% CI, -40.8 to -92.5), within the maximum allowable difference of 165 mg/dL. We therefore conclude that while most measurements fell within the limits of agreement, more work is needed to clearly define the role of this test in the obstetric population.

### Bleeding related to disturbed fibrinolysis [^116niicQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Haemophilia A, B, and C are rare congenital deficiencies of coagulation factors VIII, IX, and XI, respectively, that are accompanied by devastating bleeding episodes, often unprovoked in severe cases. Because these factors participate in the positive feedback circuit of the blood coagulation cascade mediated by intrinsic tenase (FVIIIa as a cofactor, FIXa as an executioner protease, FXIa as an activator), their deficiency causes a significant delay in thrombin generation during the propagation phase of whole blood clotting, although not at its initiation. Thus, significant fibrin is formed at the clot time of whole haemophilic blood, suggesting that bleeding results from clot instability rather than an inherent fibrin deficiency. This concept is supported by the elevated D-dimer concentration found in the circulation of haemophilic patients.

The effects of thrombin concentration on fibrin structure, as mentioned in the introduction, highlight that fibrin architecture is altered in haemophilic plasma clots. Fibrin formed in haemophilic plasmas exhibits thicker fibers, larger pores, lower density, and increased permeability compared to normal plasma [e.g. Antovic et al, 2014; Wolberg et al, 2005; Zucker et al, 2014]. These structural characteristics enhance the clots' susceptibility to tPA-mediated lysis. This is due to improved permeation of the activator, increased potency of the fibrin structure as a template for plasminogen activation, and a more efficient pattern of plasmin digestion.

### Guideline for the diagnosis and management of the rare coagulation disorders: A United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organization guideline on behalf of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology [^1162fFfr]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for congenital dysfibrinogenemia, and more specifically with respect to pregnant patients and bleeding prophylaxis, BCSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of prophylaxis with fibrinogen concentrate throughout pregnancy. Initially, a dose of 50–100 mg/kg should be given twice weekly and then adjusted to maintain trough fibrinogen activity greater than 1 g/L, in patients with fibrinogen activity less than 1.5 g/L for at least 3 days.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to coagulation factor transfusion, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend using one of the following strategies in the initial management of patients with expected massive hemorrhage:

- **Fibrinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate** and packed RBC.
- **FFP or pathogen-inactivated FFP** in a FFP/packed RBC ratio of at least 1:2 as needed.

### International recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of acquired hemophilia A [^113Uiqqi]. Haematologica (2020). Low credibility.

A prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is not specific to factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency; other causes of APTT prolongation are much more common. Therefore, a prolonged APTT does not constitute a good predictive biomarker for bleeding, as evidenced by UK guidelines recommending against routine testing in unselected patients. However, we recommend that an unexplained APTT prolongation should not be ignored if it is encountered before surgery or in bleeding patients. Measuring normal FVIII, factor IX (FIX), or factor XI (FXI) levels will exclude a bleeding diathesis in such cases. Additionally, testing for conditions that prolong the APTT but do not pose a bleeding risk, such as lupus anticoagulant (LA) and factor XII deficiency, may be performed.

The diagnosis of acquired hemophilia A (AHA) should be considered whenever an acute or recent onset of bleeding is accompanied by an unexplained prolonged APTT (GRADE 1B). Unexplained APTT prolongation prior to surgery should be investigated and not ignored (GRADE 1C).

- **Mixing tests**: Coagulation factor deficiencies or coagulation factor inhibitors, including autoantibodies, LA, or pharmacological anticoagulants, may result in a prolonged APTT. To distinguish a factor deficiency from the presence of an inhibitory substance, mixing tests may be conducted if FVIII:C is not immediately available. AHA FVIII inhibitors are time- and temperature-dependent, so APTT results obtained immediately following the mixture of normal and patient plasma and following a 2-hour incubation should be compared. These tests are poorly standardized and cannot be used to establish or exclude AHA.

### Trimester-specific reference intervals and profile of coagulation parameters for Chinese pregnant women with diverse demographics and obstetric history: A cross-sectional study [^115DbTYD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

The level of Fib and D-dimer increased with the increase of trimesters and gestational weeks, reaching their highest in the third trimester. These trends are in accordance with the established works based on Western and Chinese populations. Fib, also known as clotting factor I, can be transformed by thrombin into a fibrin gel to form a clot. Thus, its gestational evaluating trend in this study indicated a hypercoagulable state during pregnancy. Along with a localized increase in Fib formation, D-dimer progressively increased with gestational age and trimesters due to its fibrinolytic activity sensitivity.

The magnitude of the increasing D-dimer level with gestational weeks (multivariable coefficient: 0.081; 95% CI, 0.075 to 0.086; p < 0.001) is more significant than all other parameters. We suggest this significant variation might be the main reason for using D-dimer to safely rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) and thus reduce the amount of unnecessary diagnostic imaging. The reference intervals and profiles of D-dimer in this study could facilitate the establishment of pregnancy-adapted scores or other methods for VTE screening for Chinese patients.

Overall, the variation of the five parameters during pregnancy, based on the latest coagulation characteristics in Chinese pregnant women, is comparable with established works, and the trimester-specific RIs were updated accordingly. The positive association of each parameter with gestational weeks is also comparable with the literature.

### Management of pregnancy and delivery in congenital fibrinogen disorders: Communication from the ISTH SSC subcommittee on factor XIII and fibrinogen [^117Y9VzK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

Congenital fibrinogen disorders (CFDs) are a heterogeneous group of rare congenital quantitative and/or qualitative fibrinogen deficiencies. The spectrum of molecular anomalies is broad, leading to several subtypes of fibrinogen disorders (e.g. afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, and hypodysfibrinogenemia). Pregnancy in women with CFDs is a high-risk clinical situation, with an increased tendency for miscarriages, bleeding, and thrombosis. Even though it is well established that management of such pregnancies requires a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists — hematologists and maternal/fetal medicine experts with expertise in the management of inherited bleeding disorders — specific guidelines are lacking. In this International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Scientific and Standardization Committee communication, we aim to propose an expert consensus opinion with literature evidence where available on the strategy for management of pregnancy, delivery, and puerperium in CFDs.

### Anti Xa activity after high dose LMWH thrombosis prophylaxis in covid 19 patients at the intensive care unit [^112YZb72]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Coagulopathy in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been demonstrated by an increase in D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, and factor VIII. Venous thromboembolic events are a common abnormality in patients with COVID-19. We evaluate the results of intensive care unit (ICU) thrombosis prophylaxis with 5700 international units (IU) of nadroparin low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administered twice daily.

- **Methods**: After the introduction of this high-dose pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis, twice-weekly anti-factor Xa (anti Xa) concentrations and results from routine laboratory and viscoelastic hemostatic tests in 16 ICU COVID-19 patients were evaluated.

- **Results**: During one week, median peak anti Xa activities were 0.38 [0.16–0.45] and 0.38 [0.20–0.58] at time points 1 and 2, respectively. Laboratory coagulation tests showed PT, AT, and platelet count (PltC) values within the normal range and markedly increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. Viscoelastic tests showed a maximum clot strength just above normal reference values, while fibrin clot strength was strongly increased. The overall contribution of fibrin to clot strength was high at 71 [56–85]%.

- **Conclusion**: Anti Xa activity was within the target range of pharmacodynamic endpoints for COVID-19 patients, but viscoelastic tests still demonstrated a procoagulant pattern.

### Bleeding related to disturbed fibrinolysis [^117TCMvy]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Bleeding tendencies based on abnormal fibrinolysis stem from either inadequate pro-coagulant mechanisms or enhanced fibrinolysis. Clinical bleeding without overt mechanical injury commonly results from an impaired haemostatic balance. In some instances, such as a lack of a specific inhibitor, the fibrinolytic abnormality's causal link to laboratory findings or clinical symptoms is clear. Conversely, defective clotting and abnormal fibrin can lead to enhanced fibrinolysis, though no standardized laboratory assay routinely identifies relative hyperfibrinolysis.

To highlight fibrinolysis's varying roles in clinical bleeding, this discussion distinguishes between primary hyperfibrinolysis — characterized by absolute quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of proteins directly involved in the lytic process — and secondary hyperfibrinolysis, involving imbalanced excessive activation of structurally normal fibrinolytic enzymes or enhanced susceptibility of fibrin to proteolysis. Both primary and secondary hyperfibrinolytic trends trace back to inherited or acquired disease states. The distinction aids therapeutic strategies by identifying whether treatment should target the fibrinolytic system or the underlying disease.

In addition to detailing these hyperfibrinolytic states, this review introduces concepts summarized in Table 1, which emphasize the primary target of treatment from a therapeutic perspective.

### Haemostatic management of obstetric haemorrhage [^112yBL2J]. Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The haemostatic management of major obstetric haemorrhage remains challenging, and published guidance relies heavily on experience from the non-pregnant population and expert opinion. In recent years, interest in the implications of relative hypofibrinogenaemia, point-of-care monitoring of coagulation abnormalities, and the potential to give goal-directed therapy to correct coagulopathies has created the possibility of significantly challenging and changing guidance.

There is evidence that the haemostatic impairment in the pregnant population is different from trauma-induced bleeding, and the type and rate of onset of coagulopathies differ depending on the underlying cause. This review examines areas such as possible intervention points, describes evidence for over-transfusion of fresh frozen plasma in some situations, and challenges conventional thinking on formulaic management. It also examines the rationale for other therapeutic options, including fibrinogen concentrate and tranexamic acid.

### High plasma fibrinogen level is associated with poor clinical outcome in DIC patients [^114uj4jC]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

We measured the plasma level of fibrinogen in 560 patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and evaluated its relationship with outcome and with other hemostatic markers. Forty-seven percent of patients had > 200 mg/dL of plasma fibrinogen, and 24% had < 100 mg/dL of plasma fibrinogen, suggesting that plasma fibrinogen level is not a sensitive marker for DIC.

In our analysis of outcome and plasma fibrinogen levels, the rate of death was high in leukemia/lymphoma patients with high fibrinogen concentration, yet no significant difference in outcome was observed in relation to plasma fibrinogen concentration in non-leukemia/lymphoma patients with DIC. Among patients with leukemia/lymphoma, the frequency of organ failure was markedly high in those with high plasma levels of fibrinogen. In patients without leukemia/lymphoma, the frequency of organ failure increased concomitantly with the increase in plasma fibrinogen levels.

- **International normalized ratio**: Significantly increased in leukemia/lymphoma patients with low fibrinogen.
- **FDP levels**: Slightly increased in patients with low fibrinogen.
- **Platelet count**: Significantly low in non-leukemia/lymphoma patients with high fibrinogen.
- **DIC score**: Increased concomitantly with the reduction in plasma fibrinogen levels.
- **Plasma levels**:
	- Thrombomodulin and tissue factor were significantly high in patients with high fibrinogen levels.
	- Antiplasmin and plasminogen were significantly decreased in patients with low fibrinogen.
	- Plasmin plasmin-inhibitor complex and tissue t

### Management of hemostatic complications in acute leukemia: Guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^111pBSQP]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute myeloid leukemia, and more specifically the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend considering fibrinogen supplementation when fibrinogen levels are less than 1.5 g/L. This recommendation applies to patients with acute leukemia-associated DIC, particularly in cases involving acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Fibrinogen supplementation can be administered using either fibrinogen concentrates or cryoprecipitate.

### Rotational thromboelastometry alongside conventional coagulation testing in patients with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever: an observational cohort study [^113ntfv4]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

In keeping with the results of clot formation time, maximum clot firmness was abnormal in about half of the patients on admission and was highly deranged in a fifth. Abnormal values for maximum clot firmness indicate reduced stabilization of the clot by the polymerized fibrin, platelets, and factor XIII. Significant activation of fibrinolysis can be discounted as no significant reduction was observed in maximum clot firmness or clot lysis in any patient.

In FIBTEM S, coagulation is activated as in EXTEM S, but the addition of cytochalasin D, an antiplatelet agent, blocks the effects of platelets. The resulting clot formation therefore depends only on fibrin formation and fibrin polymerization, which mainly relates to fibrinogen concentrations. Our results show that, at admission, most patients had a normal FIBTEM S amplitude at 10 minutes after clotting time and maximum clot firmness, indicating normal fibrinogen concentrations.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterized by consumption of coagulation factors, with the formation of small thrombi throughout the vasculature leading to end organ failure. A key finding in disseminated intravascular coagulation is the presence of hypofibrinogenemia and activation of fibrinolysis. The absence of significantly low fibrinogen concentrations and of activation of fibrinolysis are therefore out of keeping with a diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

We detected a reversible coagulopathy in patients who survived Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever. Combined data from acute samples showed significant differences in all.

### Bleeding related to disturbed fibrinolysis [^116R8t6S]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Detecting and measuring fibrinolysis is less standardized than coagulation, where batteries of tests are routinely performed using high-throughput automated analyzers and standardized reagents to diagnose coagulation defects or monitor anticoagulation therapy, for example. Ongoing fibrinolysis can be detected by fluctuations in fibrinolytic components, such as plasmin-α2-PI complexes, D-dimer formation, and depletion of circulating plasminogen and fibrinogen. Other fibrinolysis proteins, such as antigen levels of PAI-1, tPA, and TAFI, or activity of PAI-1 or TAFIa, are also used as markers of the state of the fibrinolysis system.

Data on individual haemostasis components do not give a complete picture of the fibrinolytic system, and global assays are an alternative option. Global assays of haemostasis are a significant topic and the subject of several recent reviews [e.g. van Geffen & van Heerde, 2012]. Coagulation assays dominate, from simple time courses of clotting of plasma or whole blood to more sophisticated thrombin generation tests where thrombin activity is monitored by following the hydrolysis of chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates after coagulation is triggered in re-calcified plasma [He et al, 2007; van Geffen & van Heerde, 2012].

There is no equivalent system for directly measuring plasmin evolution during activation of the fibrinolytic system, but there are several variations of clot lysis assays that rely on turbidity changes as clots are formed and lysed. Parameters derived from such time courses are used to study fibrinolytic processes.

### A novel simultaneous clot-fibrinolysis waveform analysis for assessing fibrin formation and clot lysis in haemorrhagic disorders [^111MDGog]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Simultaneous evaluation of coagulation and fibrinolysis facilitates an overall understanding of normal and pathological haemostasis. We established an assay for assessing clot formation and fibrinolysis simultaneously using clot waveform analysis. This was achieved by triggering a mixture of activated partial thromboplastin time reagent and an optimized concentration of tissue-type plasminogen activator (0.63 μg/ml) to examine the temporal reactions in a short monitoring time (< 500 s). The interplay between clot formation and fibrinolysis was confirmed by analyzing the effects of argatroban, tranexamic acid, and thrombomodulin. Fibrinogen levels positively correlated with coagulation and fibrinolytic potential, with initial fibrin clot formation being independent of plasminogen concentration.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1-deficient (-def) and α2-antiplasmin-def plasmas demonstrated different characteristic hyper-fibrinolytic patterns. For the specificity of individual clotting factor-deficient plasmas, factor (F)VIII-def and FIX-def plasmas in particular demonstrated shortened fibrinolysis lag-times (FLT) and enhanced endogenous fibrinolysis potential, in addition to decreased maximum coagulation velocity. This possibly reflects the fragile formation of fibrin clots. Tranexamic acid depressed fibrinolysis to a similar extent in FVIII-def and FIX-def plasmas. We concluded that the clot-fibrinolysis waveform analysis technique could sensitively monitor both sides of fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis, providing an easy-to-use assay to help clarify the underlying pathogenesis of bleeding disorders.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for transfusion strategies in critical care, more specifically concerning massive bleeding, the ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend considering the administration of platelets to maintain a platelet count greater than 50×10⁹/L in patients with trauma with ongoing bleeding and greater than 100×10⁹/L in patients with traumatic brain injury.

### Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and coagulation: A dual risk of hypercoagulability and bleeding [^113KqdZs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In the patient group with cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), 2 (1.1%) patients were diagnosed with lower extremity venous thromboembolism (VTE) postpartum, whereas no VTE was observed in the control group. The correlations between coagulation parameters and bile acid levels are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.

When Table 4 was examined, the multiple logistic regression analysis performed to determine the effects of the parameters on cholestasis status was statistically significant (X² = 312.629, p < 0.01). A statistically significant relationship was found between the parameters and cholestasis status (p < 0.01). The parameters in the model explained 68% of the total variance in the presence of cholestasis (R² = 0.680, p < 0.01).

When the regression coefficients are analyzed, the variables of age (β = 0.846, p < 0.05) and length of hospital stay (β = 0.682, p < 0.05) have positive effects, whereas birth week (days) (β = -1.127, p < 0.05) and lymphocyte count (β = -54.698, p < 0.05) have negative and significant effects on the development of cholestasis. As a result, the incidence and hospitalization duration of those with cholestasis were greater than those without cholestasis.

### How I treat dysfibrinogenemia [^115D3vf9]. Blood (2021). Low credibility.

Congenital dysfibrinogenemia (CD) is caused by structural changes in fibrinogen that modify its function. Diagnosis is based on the discrepancy between decreased fibrinogen activity and normal fibrinogen antigen levels; it is confirmed by genetic testing. CD is caused by monoallelic mutations in fibrinogen genes that lead to clinically heterogeneous disorders. Most patients with CD are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, but the clinical course may be complicated by a tendency toward bleeding and/or thrombosis.

Patients with a thrombosis-related fibrinogen variant are particularly at risk, and, in such patients, long-term anticoagulation should be considered. Management during surgery and pregnancy raises important and difficult issues. The mainstay of CD treatment remains fibrinogen supplementation. Antifibrinolytic agents are part of the treatment in some specific clinical settings.

In this article, we discuss five clinical scenarios to highlight common clinical challenges. We detail our approach to establishing a diagnosis of CD and discuss strategies for the management of bleeding, thrombosis, surgery, and pregnancy.

### Bleeding related to disturbed fibrinolysis [^113HyJre]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Inherited secondary hyperfibrinolysis can occur in pathological situations where the members of the fibrinolytic system have normal structure and availability. However, they either act on fibrin that is more susceptible to lysis, or their hyperfunction is provoked in response to overt abnormal systemic blood clotting. Both inherited and acquired conditions can result in such alterations of fibrinolytic activity.

### Preeclampsia complicated with hypofibrinogenemia: 2 case reports and review of the literature [^113jUntv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

We reported two cases of severe preeclampsia complicated with hypofibrinogenemia. The main issues in these cases were a significant decrease in fibrinogen and continuous hypertension. After excluding family heredity and previous history, the cases were diagnosed as hypofibrinogenemia.

Fibrinogen levels are physiologically increased during gestation and may have a critical effect on implantation and the development of fetal vascular communication. However, this elevation does not prevent complications such as antepartum haemorrhage (APH) and postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in women with hypofibrinogenemia. Fibrinogen replacement may be necessary to minimize bleeding risk and stabilize pregnancy.

Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication and a worldwide health concern. The exact pathogenesis and mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, though various risk factors have been discussed. Vascular endothelial cell injury is known to play a fundamental role in multi-organ injury, resulting in preeclampsia. Abnormal coagulation and bleeding mechanisms are significant manifestations.

Some clinicians focus on the association between fibrinogen levels and preeclampsia. Karehed et al. elucidated that fibrinogen concentration increased in preeclampsia before gestational week 32 compared to controls. Rijin and colleagues analyzed the clinical characteristics of secondary pregnancies following a first pregnancy complicated by early-onset preeclampsia. They revealed recurrent patterns…

### Functional fibrinogen (FLEV-TEG) versus the Clauss method in an obstetric population: a comparative study [^112GWr9G]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemostasis is the dynamic equilibrium between coagulation and fibrinolysis. During pregnancy, the balance shifts to a hypercoagulative state that becomes more pronounced toward the end of the third trimester, returning to normal approximately 4 to 5 weeks after delivery. Hypercoagulability results from an increase in plasma concentrations of coagulation factors VII, VIII, X, XII, von Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibrinogen, which can reach 6 g/L by the end of pregnancy. Gestational thrombocytopenia may also occur during the third trimester, with platelet counts dropping by approximately 10% with respect to baseline. Fibrinolysis is also markedly depressed during a normal pregnancy. It is important to highlight that the coagulation changes occurring during postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) differ from those of polytraumatized or postsurgical patients because of the underlying cause of obstetric bleeding.

Uterine atony, genital tract trauma, and surgical trauma are not always associated with the development of coagulopathy, although they may cause significant blood loss. However, uncontrolled bleeding in this context may evolve into a late coagulopathy. In contrast, placental abruption, even with minimal blood loss, and abnormal placentations may be associated with rapidly evolving coagulopathy characterized by the consumption of coagulation factors. Placental abruption and amniotic fluid embolism are the main causes of the onset of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).

During PPH, fibrinogen is of fundamental importance, and a blood level of fibrinogen less t

### Disorders of coagulation in pregnancy [^113hufDC]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

The process of haemostasis is complex and is further complicated in the parturient because of the physiological changes of pregnancy. Understanding these changes and the impact that they have on the safety profile of the anaesthetic options for labour and delivery is crucial to any anaesthetist caring for the parturient.

This article analyzes theories on coagulation and reviews the physiological changes to coagulation that occur during pregnancy and the best methods to evaluate coagulation. Finally, we examine some of the more common disorders of coagulation that occur during pregnancy, including von Willebrand disease, common factor deficiencies, platelet disorders, and the implications for the parturient on anticoagulants, as well as the more rare acute fatty liver of pregnancy, with a focus on their implications for neuraxial anaesthesia.

### Prospective longitudinal study of thromboelastography and standard hemostatic laboratory tests in healthy women during normal pregnancy [^114J6Lvb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2012). Low credibility.

Hemostatic disorders are common in obstetric complications. Thromboelastography (TEG®) simultaneously measures coagulation and fibrinolysis within 10 to 20 minutes. Our primary aim in this prospective longitudinal study was to obtain knowledge about physiological changes in TEG® variables during normal pregnancy and 8 weeks postpartum. The secondary aims were to compare TEG® variables during pregnancy with TEG® variables 8 weeks postpartum and gestational weeks 10 to 15, and to correlate TEG® variables to standard laboratory analyses.

- **Methods**: Blood samples were collected from 45 healthy pregnant women at gestational weeks 10 to 15, 20 to 22, 28 to 30, and 38 to 40, and at 8 weeks postpartum. The following TEG® analyses were performed: time until start of clotting (TEG®-R), time until 20-mm clot firmness (TEG®-K), angle of clotting (TEG®-Angle), maximum amplitude (TEG®-MA), and lysis after 30 minutes (TEG®-LY30). Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, soluble fibrin, antithrombin, D-dimer, and platelet count were analyzed.

- **Results**: Compared to 8 weeks postpartum, TEG®-R was at least 0.9 minutes shorter (upper limit 99% confidence intervals) until gestational weeks 28 to 30, and the mean reduction varied between 23%-26%. TEG®-K was at least 0.1 minutes shorter throughout pregnancy, and the mean reduction varied between 18%-35%. TEG®-Angle was at least 2.5 degrees greater during pregnancy, and the mean increase varied between 12%-20%. TEG®-MA was also at least 0.4 mm greater during pregnancy, and the mean increase varied between 6%-8%. TEG®-LY30 was…

### Disseminated intravascular coagulation in pregnancy: Insights in pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^112CJSTX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a life-threatening situation that can arise from various obstetrical and non-obstetrical causes. Obstetrical DIC has been associated with a series of pregnancy complications, including:

- **Acute peripartum hemorrhage**: Uterine atony, cervical and vaginal lacerations, and uterine rupture.
- **Placental abruption**: Sudden detachment of the placenta.
- **Preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP syndrome**: Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome.
- **Retained stillbirth**: Failure to deliver placenta in stillbirth cases.
- **Septic abortion and intrauterine infection**: Infections leading to septic conditions.
- **Amniotic fluid embolism**: Entry of amniotic fluid into the mother's blood.
- **Acute fatty liver of pregnancy**: Rare liver condition during pregnancy.

Prompt diagnosis and a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to this complication are essential for a favorable outcome. In recent years, novel diagnostic scores and treatment modalities, along with bedside point-of-care tests, have been developed and may assist clinicians in both the diagnosis and management of DIC. Teamwork and prompt treatment are essential for the successful management of patients with DIC.

### Prognostic value of plasma fibrinolysis activation markers in cardiovascular disease [^113C6M4G]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The pivotal role of hypoactive endogenous fibrinolysis in the occurrence of thrombotic cardiovascular events is now well-recognized. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic role of impaired fibrinolysis, plasma fibrinolysis markers have been investigated in large prospective studies involving both healthy individuals and patients with established coronary disease. Antigen and activity levels of components of the fibrinolytic system were measured by immunoassays, which have replaced earlier global fibrinolysis tests.

This review covers 45 studies conducted with nearly 50,000 subjects, examining the association between plasma markers of fibrinolysis and coronary artery disease to establish the usefulness of these markers in predicting future cardiovascular events. The predictive value of plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, platelet activator inhibitor-1, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, D-dimer, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and lipoprotein(a) for major adverse cardiac events is highly variable and conflicting, especially after adjusting for conventional risk factors, as seen in the published data over the last decade.

The value of fibrinolysis activity markers is very limited in aiding diagnosis and risk stratification in individual patients due to the weak prognostic values obtained in some studies and the lack of power in others. The physiological limitations of such markers in reflecting endogenous fibrinolysis are discussed. The emerging novel global assays of fibrinolysis will require large-scale clinical trials to determine their prognostic power or superiority.

### Comparison of diagnostic criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Diagnostic criteria of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis and of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare for overt DIC [^117AYd2c]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). High credibility.

The ISTH criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of DIC, a complex systemic thrombohemorrhagic disorder. The tool is particularly useful in stratifying patients based on the severity of their coagulation abnormalities, thereby facilitating timely and appropriate therapeutic interventions.

The ISTH DIC criteria incorporates four primary components: platelet count, fibrinogen degradation product level, prothrombin time (PT) prolongation, and fibrinogen level. Each component is scored based on the severity of the abnormality. For platelet count, a score of 0 is assigned for counts ≥ 100 x10^9/L, 1 for counts between 51–100 x10^9/L, and 2 for counts < 50 x10^9/L. Regarding fibrinogen degradation product level, a score of 0 is given for levels < 10 mg/L, 1 for levels between 10–25 mg/L, and 2 for levels > 25 mg/L. Prothrombin time is scored 0 for prolongation < 3 seconds, 1 for prolongation between 3–6 seconds, and 2 for prolongation > 6 seconds. Lastly, fibrinogen level is scored as 0 for > 1 g/L and 1 for ≤ 1 g/L.

The total score is calculated by summing the scores from each of the four components. A score of less than 5 suggests that the criteria for DIC are not met, while a score of 5 or more meets the criteria for DIC. This scoring system allows for a standardized and objective assessment of DIC, which can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable clinical presentation and the lack of a single definitive diagnostic test.

### Congenital fibrinogen disorders: A retrospective clinical and genetic analysis of the prospective rare bleeding disorders database [^116Szk71]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Bleeding severity

More than 70% of afibrinogenemic patients had grade 3 bleeding, whereas the majority of those with dysfibrinogenemia and hypofibrinogenemia were asymptomatic (Table 1). An agreement of the bleeding severity grades with the established factor activity threshold in quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies was observed in 36 of 62 cases, achieving an accuracy of 58% (95% confidence interval, 44.85–70.49). Taking the severity grades as a reference, 45% of those asymptomatic had factor activity levels above 100 mg/dL, and 56% of grade 1–2 cases had activity levels between 20 and 100 mg/dL. In patients with grade 3 bleeding, 65% had factor activity levels below 20 mg/dL (Table 2). Except for grade 3 in quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies, there were no significant differences between median levels of factor activity for other bleeding severity grades (Figure 1B).

Table 2.
Determined factor activity (Clauss) thresholds (mg/dL) according to the bleeding severity grades in quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies.

Accordingly, in quantitative fibrinogen deficiencies, the highest sensitivity was found for grade 3 (65%), followed by grade 1–2 (56%) and asymptomatic (45%), whereas the highest specificity (90%) was found for asymptomatic cases (Table 3). Additionally, we were interested in determining the positive predictive value (precision) of established thresholds for different bleeding grades. Our analysis showed that the highest precision was observed in cases with Fg:C < 20 mg/dL (71%), indicating that 71% of patients with this value were correctly diagnosed as a grade 3 bleeding case.

### Bleeding related to disturbed fibrinolysis [^1144LnYd]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a common severe complication of systemic infection, such as sepsis, and extensive tissue destruction, like major trauma. Unlike the rare acquired FXIII deficiency, DIC involves the intravascular activation of coagulation with loss of localization arising from various causes. It can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which, if sufficiently severe, can lead to organ dysfunction [Taylor et al, 2001].

Innate immune mechanisms are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in sepsis or altered self-tissue damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), as reviewed by Manson et al, 2012. These provoke pro-thrombotic mechanisms in the microvasculature of the injured tissue to restrict the propagation of the damaging agent. Recruited monocytes express tissue factor, triggering the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, while neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Histones, the most abundant proteins in NETs, induce activation of platelets [Fuchs et al, 2011] and endothelial cells [Saffarzadeh et al, 2012], and they inhibit the activated protein C-mediated negative feedback of the coagulation cascade [Ammollo et al, 2011].

If the impaired anticoagulant pathways cannot localize the pro-thrombotic factors to the primary injury site, overt multi-organ microthrombosis develops, accompanied by activation of fibrinolysis. The outcome of simultaneous systemic activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is consumptive coagulopathy.

### Hemostatic issues in pregnancy-induced liver disease [^116sfHeN]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Liver diseases may be accompanied by profound changes in the hemostatic system, including thrombocytopenia, decreased plasma levels of pro- and anticoagulants, and alterations in plasma levels of fibrinolysis. The net effect of the hemostatic changes in chronic and acute liver diseases is a hemostatic system that is in relative balance due to the simultaneous decline in pro- and antihemostatic drivers. A unique category of liver diseases are those induced by pregnancy.

- **Acute fatty liver of pregnancy**: Profound hemostatic changes occur, which may be caused by a combination of liver failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

- **Hemostatic changes in preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome**: These are dominated by thrombocytopenia, although alterations in plasmatic coagulation may also occur. Post-partum bleeds, bleeding from cesarean section wounds, and hepatobiliary bleeds may occur in both patient groups.

Patients with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy do not show clinically relevant hemostatic alterations, despite biochemical evidence of liver injury.

### Association between fibrinogen level and severity of postpartum haemorrhage: secondary analysis of a prospective trial [^113qaghM]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to determine whether the fibrinogen level at the diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is associated with the severity of bleeding.

- **Methods**: This is a secondary analysis of a population-based study conducted in 106 French maternity units, identifying cases of PPH prospectively. PPH was defined by a blood loss exceeding 500 mL during the 24 hours after delivery or a peripartum haemoglobin decrease of more than 20 g litre(-1). This analysis includes 738 women with PPH after vaginal delivery. Fibrinogen levels were compared in patients whose PPH worsened and became severe and those whose PPH remained non-severe. Severe PPH was defined as haemorrhage by occurrence of one of the following events: peripartum haemoglobin decrease ≥ 40 g litre(-1), transfusion of concentrated red cells, arterial embolization or emergency surgery, admission to intensive care, or death.

- **Results**: The mean fibrinogen concentration at diagnosis was 4.2 g litre(-1) [standard deviation (sd) = 1.2 g litre(-1)] among the patients without worsening and 3.4 g litre(-1) (sd = 0.9 g litre(-1)) (P < 0.001) in the group whose PPH became severe. The fibrinogen level was associated with PPH severity independently of other factors [adjusted odds ratio = 1.90 (1.16–3.09) for fibrinogen between 2 and 3 g litre(-1) and 11.99 (2.56–56.06) for fibrinogen < 2 g litre(-1)].

- **Conclusions**: The fibrinogen level at PPH diagnosis is a marker of the risk of aggravation and should serve as an alert to clinicians.

### Blood platelet biochemistry [^117YFnbN]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Defects in platelet function or formation increase the risk for bleeding or thrombosis, indicating the crucial role of platelets in maintaining haemostasis in normal life. Upon vascular injury, platelets instantly adhere to the exposed extracellular matrix, resulting in platelet activation and aggregation and the formation of a haemostatic plug that stops bleeding. To prevent excessive platelet aggregate formation, which could occlude the vessels, this self-amplifying process requires tight control. This review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the currently established main mechanisms in platelet function.

### Is platelet aggregation a more important contributor than platelet adhesion to the overall platelet-related primary haemostasis measured by PFA-100 [^115oJmWa]. Thrombosis Research (2003). Low credibility.

Platelet-related primary haemostasis (PRPH), measured in PFA-100 as a closure time (CT), reflects platelets' combined ability to adhere and aggregate under higher shear stress. The contributions of platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion to the real values of CT remain unknown, and this poor discrimination results in the complexity of the PFA-100 measurement.

- **Objective**: To estimate the contributions of platelet aggregation and adhesion, and the importance of various membrane receptors underlying platelets' capability for plug formation in PFA-100 cartridges.

- **Materials and methods**: The effects of various blockers antagonizing ligands binding to platelet surface membrane receptors (antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa complex, collagen receptors, and purinoreceptors), as well as aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), the antagonist of GPIb-von Willebrand factor (vWF) interaction, were monitored in 47 healthy donors using PFA-100 and whole blood electrical aggregometry (WBEA).

- **Results**: PFA-100 collagen/ADP CT was the most sensitive in probing the effect of platelet membrane receptor antagonists that block the GPIIb-IIIa complex and those antagonizing GPIb-vWF interaction (GR144053F, Integrilin, ATA), whereas the other blockers acting on collagen receptors or purinoreceptors were much less efficient. For the examined GPIIb-IIIa and GPIb antagonists, the variability in WBEA explained a very significant part (30–60%) of the variability in PFA-100 CT.

- **Conclusions**: GPIIb-IIIa-mediated platelet aggregation and von Willebrand factor interactions play a crucial role in this context.

### A British Society for Haematology guideline on the assessment and management of bleeding risk prior to invasive procedures [^112FaoWG]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to preoperative coagulation testing, the British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2024 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a coagulation screen (including PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen) in patients undergoing high-bleeding-risk procedures and in those with liver disease, malnutrition, prolonged antibiotic use, and those at risk of coagulopathy, such as with sepsis or critical illness.

### Evaluation of clotting factor activities early after severe multiple trauma and their correlation with coagulation tests and clinical data [^115ybz4M]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Prothrombin Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) have major limitations in diagnosing trauma-induced coagulopathy as they are time-consuming and lack the desirable sensitivity at the critical time of admission. Additionally, it is unclear to what extent possible derangements of the underlying coagulation system are reflected by PT and PTT. This has resulted in the emergence of viscoelastic tests, such as rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) or thromboelastography, as point-of-care diagnostic procedures for detecting acute coagulopathy after trauma. In experimental hypothermia and hemorrhage, ROTEM showed superiority over PT and PTT in predicting coagulation disorders and mortality.

In this study, the International Normalized Ratio (INR), reflecting PT, was significantly elevated, whereas differences in PTT were negligible. Indeed, an abnormal PTT is known to occur more infrequently than changes in PT. The strongly elevated factor VIII levels found in this study offer a possible explanation for this phenomenon. As indicated by a strong negative correlation, high plasma levels of factor VIII may discredit the measurement of PTT, potentially leading to a reduced (quasi-normal) clot formation time ex vivo. In this context, PTT would be useless in an attempt to diagnose traumatic coagulopathy.

If viscoelastic tests are not available, INR might be helpful as it highly correlated with reduced levels of fibrinogen and the activities of factors II, V, and VII. This finding is reasonable because INR reflects PT, which was designed to test these factors, formerly called the "extrinsic pathway". Under these circumstances, INR might be used.

### Haemostatic monitoring during postpartum haemorrhage and implications for management [^1137g3j9]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is excessive blood loss after childbirth and has been defined as blood loss greater than 500 mL within 24 hours of normal vaginal delivery, or greater than 1000 mL after Caesarean section, although alternative definitions have been used to describe PPH and its severity. Although PPH typically occurs within 24 hours of childbirth (primary PPH), haemorrhage may occur any time up to 12 weeks postpartum (secondary PPH). PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide, estimated to be responsible for around 143,000 deaths each year. PPH also contributes significantly to maternal morbidity and is a major reason for intensive care admission and hysterectomy in the postpartum period.

The causes of PPH are varied and have been classified according to their underlying pathophysiology. Excessive bleeding is often exacerbated by acquired coagulation abnormalities, and coagulopathies vary markedly depending on the underlying aetiology. Primary coagulation defects are occasionally direct causes of PPH. Although historically categorized under 'thrombin', recent studies suggest that acquired fibrinogen deficiency, rather than thrombin generation, may be the major coagulation abnormality associated with obstetric bleeding.

- **Editor's key points**:
	- Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is a major cause of maternal mortality worldwide.
	- Monitoring of coagulation in PPH must take account of pregnancy-induced changes in coagulation status.
	- Point-of-care testing may have advantages in guiding replacement therapy.
	- There is a need for specific studies of haemostatic therapies in PPH.

### Multidisciplinary team management of congenital dysfibrinogenemia in pregnancy: A case report [^115N6Dbm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Low credibility.

In this case, the patient's diagnosis of congenital dysfibrinogenemia (CD), a rare disorder characterized by impaired fibrinogen function resulting in abnormal clot formation, presented unique clinical challenges, especially in the context of pregnancy. Most patients with CD are asymptomatic, with fibrinogen abnormalities often discovered incidentally during routine physical exams or preoperative screenings. Genetic testing is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, though it is time-consuming and costly. Coagulation function tests, including normal prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prolonged thrombin time (TT), significantly decreased Fib-Clauss levels, normal or elevated Fib-PT-derived levels, and a Fib-PT-derived/Clauss ratio greater than 1.43, or a Fib-Clauss/PT-derived ratio less than 0.7, are recommended as rapid diagnostic methods in most medical settings. In this case, the patient's family history and laboratory findings strongly suggested CD, which was confirmed through genetic testing.

CD presents with diverse clinical phenotypes, with only a small proportion of patients exhibiting bleeding or thrombotic complications. Among those with bleeding tendencies, bruising is the most commonly reported manifestation in both European and Chinese populations. Women with CD face a higher risk of pregnancy-related complications such as recurrent pregnancy loss, stillbirth, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Despite this, many patients with CD have uneventful pregnancies, though pregnancy remains a high-risk condition that requires careful monitoring and management.

### Platelet function tests: Why they fail to guide personalized antithrombotic medication [^116aEvtJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Point-of-care platelet function tests that use high shear:

Presently, three commercially available point-of-care platelet function tests (PFTs) claim to test platelet reactivity under high shear stress: the PFA-100 (Siemens Inc, the Global Thrombosis Test (GTT; Thromboquest Ltd), and the PlaCor Platelet Reactivity Test (PlaCor Inc).

In the PFA-100, shear rates of 5000 s⁻¹ are described in the 147-μm aperture of the collagen-coated membrane impregnated with specific platelet agonists; however, histology of the occluded aperture revealed that adhesion and aggregation of platelets take place on the proximal (and not distal) surface of the membrane around the aperture, and the arrest of flow was caused by the extension of those proximally formed platelet aggregates into the aperture. This is important because the platelets, which react with the collagen-coated membrane and form occlusive aggregates, were exposed to shear only in the capillary conduit (200-μm diameter) on their way to the membrane, and had not passed through the 147-μm aperture. Because shear rate is inversely proportional to the cube of the arterial radius, the true initial shear rate in the PFA-100 is likely to be less than 2500 s⁻¹.

### Hypercoagulability of COVID-19 patients in intensive care unit: A report of thromboelastography findings and other parameters of hemostasis [^111jm6yT]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

The severe inflammatory state secondary to COVID-19 leads to a significant derangement of hemostasis that has been described as a state of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and consumption coagulopathy. This condition is characterized by decreased platelet count, increased fibrin(ogen) degradation products such as D-dimer, and low fibrinogen levels.

- **Aims**: Whole blood from 24 patients admitted to the intensive care unit due to COVID-19 was collected and evaluated with thromboelastography using the TEG point-of-care device on a single occasion. Six patients underwent repeated measurements on two consecutive days, resulting in a total of 30 observations. Plasma was evaluated for other parameters of hemostasis.

- **Results**: TEG parameters indicated a state of hypercoagulability, as shown by decreased values and increased values of K angle and MA. Platelet count was normal or increased. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were near normal. Fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were increased, with the latter being dramatically elevated. C-reactive protein was also increased. Factor VIII and von Willebrand factor (n = 11) were elevated, while antithrombin (n = 11) was marginally decreased, and protein C (n = 11) was increased.

- **Conclusion**: The results of this cohort of COVID-19 patients are not consistent with acute DIC but rather support a state of hypercoagulability along with a severe inflammatory response. These findings may explain the events of venous thromboembolism observed in some patients and suggest the need for antithrombotic prophylaxis and treatment. Clinical trials are urgently needed to establish effective treatment protocols.

### Disorders of coagulation in the newborn [^112SSQV8]. NeoReviews (2024). Low credibility.

The coagulation system in newborns varies significantly from that of children and adults, with many circulating hemostatic factors being lower in the newborn. Infants are also susceptible to diseases and conditions in the pregnant person that can affect their coagulation system, which can make it difficult to rapidly identify the cause behind coagulopathy in a neonate. Coagulation disorders can lead to high levels of infant morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment. This review outlines the clinical characteristics, diagnosis and management, epidemiology, and etiologies of both common and uncommon congenital and acquired forms of neonatal coagulopathy.

### Epidemiology and treatment of congenital fibrinogen deficiency [^111Hy6JE]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder, affecting either the quantity (afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia) or quality (dysfibrinogenemia) of circulating fibrinogen. There is a strong association between fibrinogen activity levels and clinical bleeding severity. Patients with afibrinogenemia experience frequent, often severe, spontaneous bleeds into the muscles and joints and are at significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with hypofibrinogenemia are usually asymptomatic; however, they are vulnerable to bleeding after trauma. Dysfibrinogenemia is associated with both spontaneous bleeding and a relatively high risk of thrombosis. Fibrinogen replacement therapy is effective in treating bleeding episodes in congenital fibrinogen deficiency.

Fibrinogen concentrates are the preferred treatment option, and guidelines now exist for their on-demand use and to manage surgery. Prophylaxis may benefit patients with afibrinogenemia and others with a severe bleeding tendency. The dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted to maintain a fibrinogen activity level > 0.5–1.0 g/L. Pregnant women with afibrinogenemia require prophylactic factor replacement as early as possible during pregnancy, continuing throughout pregnancy and after birth. Fibrinogen replacement should also be considered in pregnant women with other fibrinogen deficiencies.

The risk of thrombosis presents an additional management challenge in these patients, often necessitating the use of anticoagulants and fibrinogen. Although basic guidelines have been developed, further research and guidelines are needed to optimize care.

### C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels as determinants of recurrent preeclampsia: a prospective cohort study [^112gKdUH]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia have an increased risk of recurrent preeclampsia and are more prone to develop future cardiovascular disease. Currently, risk factors underlying this association are not well characterized. We investigated whether the risk of recurrent preeclampsia is associated with pre-pregnancy levels of common cardiovascular and inflammatory markers.

- **Methods**: Reproductive follow-up and cardiovascular parameters were obtained for 150 primiparae with a history of early-onset preeclampsia 6–12 months after their first delivery. Simultaneously, fasting plasma samples were collected and tested for lipids, glucose, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen. The relative contribution of each marker to the recurrence risk of preeclampsia and preterm delivery was estimated by Cox proportional hazard models.

- **Results**: Forty-two women (28%) developed preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy. Recurrent preeclampsia was related to elevated pre-pregnancy levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen when compared to women who did not develop the condition. We found no associations between recurrent preeclampsia and maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking, or fasting levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose.

- **Conclusion**: These observations support a role for inflammation in recurrent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, similar to its contribution to later-life atherosclerosis and the risk of cardiovascular disease.

### Thrombotic disorders in the newborn [^116HGK5i]. NeoReviews (2024). Low credibility.

The coagulation and thrombotic systems of an infant are fundamentally different from those of adults and older children. Hemostatic factors have inherently lower circulation levels in infants and are also affected prenatally by conditions of pregnancy. The unique physiology of neonates can contribute to a procoagulant state, which can result in a high level of morbidity and mortality. This review outlines the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and management, and etiologies of congenital and acquired forms of thrombotic disorders, with a discussion of the evaluation for hypercoagulation.

Regarding medical management for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and more specifically with respect to the management of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the ISTH 2020 guidelines recommend considering the administration of fibrinogen when the level is below 1.5 g/L. This can be achieved using either fibrinogen concentrates or cryoprecipitate in patients with acute leukemia-associated DIC, particularly in cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia.

### Challenges in the evaluation of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels in pregnant women [^113Af2kf]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Normal pregnancy is associated with a hypercoagulable state. Elevated markers of coagulation and fibrinolytic system activation indicate increased thrombin activity and increased fibrinolysis following fibrin formation throughout pregnancy. These changes exceed the biological variability in most cases. Haemostatic reference intervals are generally based on samples from non-pregnant women. Thus, they may not be relevant to pregnant women, a problem that may hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment of haemostatic disorders during pregnancy. The aim of the study was to follow the changes of haemostatic parameters and to establish gestational age-specific reference intervals during normal pregnancy.

- **Materials and methods**: Blood samples of 83 pregnant women were collected at gestational weeks 16, 26, and 36. Fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were examined. Reference intervals were calculated for fibrinogen and D-dimer tests using two different methods (mean ± 2 SD or median and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles with 90% confidence intervals).

- **Results**: Fibrinogen and D-dimer increased progressively throughout pregnancy. Mean fibrinogen levels were higher than the maximum of the conventional reference interval, already in the 16th week of pregnancy. D-dimer levels were at or above the conventional cutoff point (250 ng/mL) throughout the pregnancy in 42% of pregnant women, while in the 36th week, 98% of them displayed elevated D-dimer levels. CRP did not increase in normal pregnancy.

- **Conclusions**: There seems to be an emerging need to reconsider fibrinogen and D-dimer reference intervals for pregnant women.
